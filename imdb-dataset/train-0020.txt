<START> i think this is one of the weakest of the kenneth branagh <UNK> works after such great efforts as much <UNK> about nothing etc i thought this was poor the cast was weaker alicia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but my biggest <UNK> was that they messed with the <UNK> work and cut out some of the play to put in the musical dance sequences br br you just don't do shakespeare and then mess with the play sorry but that is just wrong i love some cole porter just like the next person but <UNK> don't mess with the shakespeare skip this and watch <UNK> books if you want to see a brilliant shakespearean adaptation of the <UNK>
<START> this movie was lame lame lame what a build up what a let down all form no substance a terrible waste of talent and time would not recommend it to my husband's dog who will watch anything
<START> first off i would like to point out that while i am not an expert the way the trial was handled will insult your intelligence firstly the <UNK> never proved that <UNK> <UNK> actually works irresponsible for both the <UNK> because they can get an appeal and the defense for not acting on this as another <UNK> said <UNK> learning was proved untrue secondly they used terry as the <UNK> who has personal interest and even will <UNK> in the trial which is just stupid if the court had allowed him to <UNK> that way they would have brought in someone neutral otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal <UNK> this child was never asked specific questions about the <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> details of the event etc and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started he could not answer if that isn't reasonable doubt i don't know what is and a competent lawyer would have gotten an <UNK> br br bottom line it starts off well with the <UNK> of being the parent of a child with <UNK> but the trial makes this movie wholly unbelievable
<START> this isn't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology or being dated issues that only the <UNK> people could relate with but rather a review on the story telling which most of us are truly interested in br br the plot is about a combination of wwii allied and german navy members and two civilians the hero and heroine who are thrust together on a german u boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs br br the <UNK> aren't so bad by film standards and we know from the plot that realism isn't going to be high what films like this need are credible and likable characters along with some semblance of reason in the actions br br this film lacks both for a full length film only 6 characters are given any time and 3 of them are barely looked into <UNK> hero is beyond routine and doesn't make much sense in any era br br the female seems to be looking for an answer to a <UNK> about the land of dinosaurs they entered but the <UNK> is not much of a <UNK> and we could care less br br a lot of failure in a film that should have been better even for its time
<START> i had never heard of this adam sandler movie until i saw it on the wall at blockbuster being an adam sandler fan at the time i rented it honestly i could only watch about 30 mins of it it was terrible do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public i honestly hope this movie goes <UNK> soon and i hope it stays that way
<START> growing up with the beast wars transformers i wasn't very familiar with the original transformers and now that i have seen the awesome movie and now that i have seen the older cartoon on which it's based i have to say i like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than beast wars br br not that i don't like the <UNK> characters i just think that characters like <UNK> prime are better than <UNK> primal br br i mean <UNK> <UNK> and roll out sounds a lot better than <UNK> <UNK> the voice of the original <UNK> prime still makes me a strong believer that he's a real commander more so than <UNK> primal br br besides <UNK> <UNK> prime is a lot more powerful than <UNK> <UNK> just look on the web br br <UNK> in the <UNK> character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series br br besides what's <UNK> robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and <UNK> <UNK> the original transformers any day over beast wars
<START> this show is about three little girls d j stephanie and michelle their mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father danny invites his brother in law jesse and his old friend joey so the whole show is about living life the girls go through life's troubles and have life lessons they develop <UNK> boyfriends and many more the whole show is basically about to go with the flow you do not have to hold <UNK> you just have to let it go i think this show is really good and fun to watch i grew up watching this show and still watch it today i am glad they still air this show on television i watch it almost every day i rate it 10 10
<START> caution may contain spoilers br br i've seen this movie 3 times i've liked it every time upon seeing it again i'm always reminded of how good it is an hbo tv movie very well done like most of their movies are this would've gotten oscars for it's performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for tv br br as i'm sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here this is the story of serial murderer <UNK> <UNK> he murdered <UNK> people over 8 years in the former soviet union 3 victims were buried couldn't be found so he was only convicted of <UNK> out of <UNK> of his murders the story actually focuses more on the <UNK> <UNK> victor <UNK> played to perfection by stephen rea a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party <UNK> his part is essential to be sure there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america <UNK> are <UNK> taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain frustration according to this <UNK> <UNK> worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it he followed the case to its conclusion 3 years later in this scene his superior general <UNK> played by donald sutherland actually tells him he <UNK> his dedication and <UNK> for not knowing he should've given him a break sooner br br <UNK> performance is so well done he doesn't <UNK> chew up the scenery or do anything that <UNK> from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer he is a man with passion but doesn't show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies he only occasionally gives <UNK> after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances rea does so much with his face his eyes he doesn't need to <UNK> he just is his character so frustrated after so long at one point driven to frustration he actually says he'd rather find 3 at one time than none in a year of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die he just wants some clues to catch this man rea makes us feel for this man he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and <UNK> br br a mutant to be sure <UNK> childhood was one which produces such monsters the character of <UNK> is very well done by jeffrey <UNK> he somehow impossible though it may seem <UNK> some <UNK> of sympathy for himself perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong either way his performance is very well done br br donald sutherland as colonel <UNK> later promoted to general also does a great job he starts out seeming to be a cynical <UNK> official that doesn't seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else <UNK> <UNK> but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant he actually <UNK> <UNK> in helping <UNK> there is also a very nice turn by max von <UNK> as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of <UNK> they are looking for br br although this movie deals with a morbid grotesque and violent story it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does give factual events place them <UNK> inside a dramatic <UNK> that makes you feel like you know the people behind the facts br br 9 out of 10 stars
<START> the remake of h b <UNK> classic seventies chase film is simply horrible along with <UNK> point gone in 60 seconds represent the quintessential car chase films the remake takes the original and stands it on its head whereas <UNK> gave us 75 car chase and 25 supporting drama in <UNK> 2000 we get 25 car chase and 75 supporting drama cage as super man saves his brother kisses the girl mtv edits tits and ass save your money rent the original at least <UNK> didn't live to see his baby he wrote produced directed and starred in the <UNK> film <UNK> in this manner
<START> <UNK> <UNK> once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism br br then something happened and he turned into just another dull <UNK> than <UNK> director br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> can more or less be <UNK> in one line working class kind and warm while upper class <UNK> and <UNK> but love wins in the end br br such a trite <UNK> for such a smart director br br there isn't really too much to talk about in the movie every character is a walking stereotype the self made man who forgets his roots but <UNK> become good again the <UNK> wife the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest but poor guy acting is barely average br br severely disappointing under every aspect
<START> was there a single positive to this film critics who knew nothing of video games could spot the <UNK> errors made no damage taken with damage clearly visible towards the beginning being a primary example br br and i may have missed something but wasn't super mario bros 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before well if that is the case and i did not miss anything how did fred <UNK> character and even the girl know so much about the game already we're talking things that some people don't know about by their second or third play through br br beyond the factual and <UNK> errors there is the general low quality of the film itself nothing here is honestly very memorable the kid wasn't even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed a lot of kids i knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced on top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points the characters are bland and completely uninteresting the <UNK> the youngest child is a very silent completely dry child cliché of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma it isn't that this is unrealistic it's the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would <UNK> even 30 minutes br br honestly the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature if you grew up with this movie you're going to like it whether it was good or not it was about kids playing video games and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the <UNK> as well but unless you loved it as a kid there just isn't anything that's going to keep you interested and very little that will prevent you from turning it off br br no sir i didn't like it
<START> please help the economy spend your money elsewhere the synopsis of the movie is the first lady has her husband <UNK> because he was cheating on her that's it <UNK> by anyone except cuba and angie she designs and <UNK> a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about and gets away completely free br br some specific points are particularly hilarious while standing in front of the president cuba a <UNK> the <UNK> bullet which then enters the back of the <UNK> head br br cuba and angie watch film from a news camera and they see a clue they go to great <UNK> to protect the film believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film br br cuba speaks with a presidential staff member the <UNK> comments that there was no conspiracy cuba claims there was more than one person involved the <UNK> then <UNK> that the conspiracy includes the fbi the cia and the <UNK> gosh i wonder is the <UNK> is involved br br ms archer the first lady is a <UNK> artist cuba can't make out a painting and she says you're too close stand back look from a different perspective look from my perspective can anyone miss that clue
<START> i must say that during my childhood i'm quite proud of a lot of the movies i've rented the exception being theodore rex talk about the all time <UNK> movie in any actor's resume could you just imagine what <UNK> fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of crap hey <UNK> you ever seen that show dinosaurs yeah well they're making a movie out of it and you get to see germany after that that agent must have <UNK> star wars a lot br br this movie was so bad i figured <UNK> must have bought out every copy of this film and had it destroyed i just wish she could have done the same thing to my memory because my sister still gives me crap for watching that movie i mean c'mon i'll even admit i watched mr <UNK> and <UNK> in theaters good reasons why i gave up on both hulk hogan and <UNK> for awhile yet this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood and the biggest rental regret of my life and that was 16 years ago i'm 24 now if you want to do the <UNK> br br whenever i think of my all time list of worst movies i don't even mention this one because like a raped step child i try hard to <UNK> that it ever happened screw you <UNK> just be glad people only acknowledge eddie and sister act 2 as your worst you lucky stiff
<START> i bought this movie a few days ago and thought that it would be a pretty <UNK> film but when i popped it into the dvd player it surprised me in a very good way james belushi plays very well as bill the mouth <UNK> but especially timothy dalton plays a very good roll as the sheriff the <UNK> scene in the house of bill is very excellent good camera work nice dialogues and very good acting bill the mouth <UNK> has stolen 12 million dollars from the mafia together with his wife he lives in south <UNK> in a witness protection program but the mafia tracks him down and wants the 12 million dollar bill can only trust the only person he knows inside out himself
<START> i saw <UNK> attic thinking that i would be in for an <UNK> visceral ride however it was not to be the case visceral yes but enjoyable that would be a big fat no in fact the only reason that i gave it a 3 is due to the fact that <UNK> <UNK> appears ever so briefly as one of the film's <UNK> characters how they ever <UNK> mr <UNK> into this piece of work i'll never know the story idea is interesting but poorly executed the direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre the only thing that is worse than that are the special effects <UNK> i've seen better effects in a grade school play give it up mr w it's time for a career change i hear they're hiring at <UNK> diner there are very few well made <UNK> movies coming out of <UNK> and <UNK> attic isn't one of them
<START> currently on <UNK> new schedule at 4 <UNK> on <UNK> right after maverick and right before wild wild west followed by star trek br br don't know if i ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on but i'm really captivated by it offbeat unusual surreal stories set in a mythical west kind of the naked city of westerns br br and the guest stars are there dan duryea <UNK> <UNK> brian <UNK> macdonald carey rick jason as a <UNK> mexican a young dick van <UNK> jack lord <UNK> <UNK> jr as a colorful mexican martha <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even ann robinson war of the worlds gloria <UNK> i married a monster from outer space br br it ran for eight seasons over 200 episodes from january 1959 to december 1965 br br eric <UNK> is quite remarkable as trail boss <UNK> favor the most <UNK> man that's ever lived with the code of honor of a samurai and just the right balance between <UNK> and open <UNK> i would vote for him for president any day p s he had a very interesting biography http www imdb com name <UNK> br br and a young clint eastwood is quite striking as his <UNK> right hand <UNK> <UNK> also veteran western actor and country music figure the immortal one eyed one <UNK> flying purple people eater <UNK> <UNK> is there as seasoned <UNK> pete nolan and paul <UNK> makes the most <UNK> character of a cook you could ask for as <UNK> br br and then there's that great theme song performed by the immortal frankie <UNK> between that and the maverick theme i've got western theme songs running through my head all day br br i look forward to every episode i'm collecting the whole set a good time not to mention a <UNK> <UNK> experience is always guaranteed as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties <UNK> out before the commercial br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in austin <UNK> film just as we were getting tired of things like shakespeare in love and elizabeth this movie deserves an audience an inside look at the staging of the scottish play as actors call <UNK> when producing it to avoid the curse this is a crisp efficient and stylish treatment of the <UNK> which <UNK> the <UNK> with a wonderfully <UNK> score and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest this is a quiet gem not world class but totally satisfying
<START> this is far worse than those awful laurel and hardy cartoons of the 60s they were terrible but at least they were simple <UNK> of a then stan and ollie <UNK> new audiences had <UNK> the <UNK> comedic genius and the cartoons were mind numbing garbage <UNK> to cash in on children's interest it was to be expected but how does one even attempt to <UNK> this work of i can't even think of a word i'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another laurel and hardy revival but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing the <UNK> i hesitate to call them actors do a vegas act and that's where it belongs the plot is even <UNK> than those used in the old days trying to stretch out two reel ideas for a feature if this film was someone's first exposure to the real laurel and hardy i'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original <UNK> reputation as <UNK> gone amok the only movie i hate worse than this is i spit on your grave and you know these <UNK> basically did the same thing to stan and ollie
<START> <UNK> is the most new york feeling <UNK> film i've seen since when the <UNK> away <UNK> <UNK> son chat br br a film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention audrey <UNK> is getting for <UNK> its french title is more apt le <UNK> <UNK> du <UNK> the beating of the <UNK> wings as in <UNK> chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures and because she's part of a large multi ethnic ensemble so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me and some of the characters <UNK> what they should do such that i wasn't sure if they were doing that or not br br but i loved how urban the <UNK> were from immigrants to love <UNK> to crowded subway cars to hanging around <UNK> br br the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once br br originally written 12 8 2001
<START> murder in <UNK> i have always considered one of the better <UNK> books as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending there is no doubt that the tv adaptation is visually striking with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score as always david <UNK> is impeccable as <UNK> <UNK> the comedic highlight of the episode being <UNK> battle with a <UNK> in the middle of the night and hugh <UNK> is good as the rather naive captain <UNK> the remainder of the cast turn in decent performances but are careful not to <UNK> the two leads a danger in some christie adaptations some of the episode was quite creepy a <UNK> of an episode as tragic as five little pigs an episode that i enjoyed a lot more than this one what made it creepy in particular putting aside the music was when louise <UNK> sees the ghostly face through the window about the adaptation it was fairly faithful to the book but i will say that there were three things i didn't like the main problem was the pacing it is rather slow and there are some scenes where very little happens i didn't like the fact also that they made joseph <UNK> a murderer in the book i see him as a rather nervous character but the <UNK> of the idea of making him a murderer and under developing that made him a less appealing character though i am glad they didn't miss his drug addiction i also noticed that the writers left out the fact that mrs <UNK> in the book falls into <UNK> when she believes she is the <UNK> next victim the other thing that wasn't so impressive was that i felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of amy <UNK> like it was in the book amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation on the whole despite some <UNK> on the <UNK> behalf i liked murder in <UNK> 7 10 <UNK> cox
<START> this film which is based on a true story comes from first time director and long time actor denzel washington denzel washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade as a black soldier in the civil war in glory and a lawyer in the acclaimed philadelphia and of course he made special <UNK> last year when he won the academy award for best actor in training day in which denzel washington became the first african american to receive the award for best actor i guess denzel wanted a change of pace so he chose to direct antwone fisher in which he also stars fisher is played by derek luke who is new to the silver screen but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as king of queens and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of biker <UNK> br br this is a truly well done film from denzel washington considering it was his first time directing undoubtedly denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of antwone fisher antwone fisher is about a young african american man in the navy who constantly gets into fights and after one particular <UNK> he is sent to see a navy psychiatrist named <UNK> <UNK> played by denzel washington <UNK> helps antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison what makes this film good is the fact that it's not overly melodramatic i was expecting something a little more like good will hunting with a lot of swearing fighting and <UNK> not that i didn't like good will hunting or the swearing fighting and <UNK> of the film were out of place quite the contrary however antwone fisher is a true story and i don't think that washington wanted to <UNK> the story for dramatic affect in the film don't get me wrong there are moments when we see antwone fighting carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him after all in his first session with his psychiatrist the character played by washington <UNK> asks fisher where he was born and <UNK> response is from under a rock ' an obvious <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> on antwone <UNK> soul but i had to appreciate the fact that this film wasn't <UNK> for dramatic affect i think it shows real character on the part of denzel washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichés that are common in hollywood films even those based on true stories one other point that i would like to bring up about antwone fisher is the acting over all performances were good in the film but not great at times i think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors but overall to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous one actress that i would like to point out in this film is <UNK> davis she plays <UNK> mother but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all but not so much because she appears at the end of the film but more because she in shock that her long lost son antwone has found her what i would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her she in basically a character actress and i haven't seen her play any really elaborate roles she made appearances in traffic out of sight kate leopold and two recent films far from heaven and <UNK> in steven <UNK> remake of <UNK> she played a scientist on a doomed space craft <UNK> a planet in that film she is confronted by george <UNK> character and she drawn to tears by what clooney tells her in a particular scene when i first saw <UNK> i remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking wow this woman can act it was as if you could feel the character's grief in that brief shot of her face she gave so much expression and i honestly felt very sorry for her character's sadness and trouble in the film i think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles rather than just as a character driven actress nonetheless antwone fisher is a very good movie denzel washington as always pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut also derek luke is a very talented actor i think that antwone fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man but i think that his public popularity will increase with the release of biker <UNK> which also stars lawrence <UNK> antwone fisher is based on the book finding fish a <UNK> ' by antwone <UNK> fisher
<START> allow me to just get to the bottom line here i've got 3 kids ages 5 to 10 i consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals i've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least <UNK> times i can tell you when the film gets <UNK> in the wizard of oz the over 18 sexual joke in el <UNK> and the tragic flaw with the ending of <UNK> the red <UNK> <UNK> i could probably <UNK> <UNK> from memory alone br br what makes me support the one child of mine it <UNK> who suggests this title for the family movie of an evening in a word <UNK> br br moment of silence br br sigh
<START> it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake there's nothing out there the music they play in this is the funniest stuff i've ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both don't try very hard to sound sarcastic when they're saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop
<START> anyone who doesn't like this film is one who is afraid to explore his or her own demons this film does make the viewer a little uncomfortable at times but that is its intention it asks you to look at your own life and confront the obstacles head on like lou eventually does it asks you to overcome the fear of perception and become who you are meant to be <UNK> <UNK> holds up a mirror unlike any filmmaker has the intention and the message is clear and profound people's <UNK> about this film <UNK> only from their own <UNK> an open minded viewer takes this inspirational message and runs with it sometimes a life changing realization does come in a flash a light <UNK> going on this story is real and changes the lives if its viewers in a real way
<START> an extra is called upon to play a general in a movie about the russian revolution however he is not any ordinary extra he is <UNK> alexander former commanding general of the russia <UNK> who is now being forced to <UNK> the same scene which he suffered professional and personal tragedy in to satisfy the director who was once a <UNK> in russia and was <UNK> by alexander it can now be the time for this broken man to finally win his <UNK> battle this is one powerful movie with <UNK> direction by von <UNK> providing the greatest irony in <UNK> character in every way he can <UNK> deserved his oscar for the role with a very moving performance playing the general at his peak and at his deepest valley powell lends a sinister support as the revenge minded director and brent is perfect in her role with her face and movements showing so much expression as <UNK> love all around brilliance rating 10
<START> nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an audience like or empathize with any of the characters either there are movies so bad they are good a la ed wood or <UNK> slaughter films and there's just plain bad like 99 of uwe <UNK> work this film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented <UNK> <UNK> e g mystery science theatre 3000 thankfully while i am rather talented in that regard it's how my mind works all the time for those who are not so naturally talented in <UNK> <UNK> eventually into this film you'll just want to pull your own head off painfully aware the movie taboo <UNK> you of about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never get back even my <UNK> talents were barely a match for this slow paced boring waste of time the most puzzling aspect of this film is that someone green lit and or <UNK> it i rented taboo solely for the normally talented <UNK> benson who clearly must have been <UNK> into doing this film i've another lesser known film of hers in my rental <UNK> the reviews to which i'd better read first ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive <UNK> mansion for its interior location
<START> considering the risk of showing same sex relationships before the late 1980's personal best could have done better to play the same sex relationship between <UNK> chris <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a more than experimental phase of <UNK> life br br it seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the <UNK> of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole this random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie i suppose the producers were trying to <UNK> the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie the 1980 <UNK> track and field competition br br this review may seem harsh but it is the truth the exploitation of young muriel <UNK> body and the same sex relationship ruined any credit that i would have given to this film br br pepper thompson
<START> you know how star trek fans <UNK> to all the star trek movies even the really bad ones why to see their heroes in action one more time that's the way i feel about doc savage i am a major fanatic for the character and the <UNK> of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming and the first 20 minutes of the film only <UNK> that feeling of anticipation then they decided to <UNK> elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie resulting in a somewhat disjointed film there's a lot of promise in here <UNK> by a number of unfortunate choices the music the camp elements etc but the spirit of doc is there and that's what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to so in my long <UNK> way what i'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie it's just not as good as it should have been and anyone who is a fan of superman james bond indiana jones <UNK> <UNK> and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all
<START> having ran across this film on the fox movie channel on a lazy friday afternoon i can think of no better way to spend a lazy friday evening then putting in my two cents worth especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it doesn't every movie good or bad deserve more than four comments and this movie isn't bad at all br br the first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like april love is to remember the era from which it came in this case the late fifties films were pretty much a happy medium back then the cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen technicolor films in order to <UNK> people away from the gray <UNK> of the evil medium in a box called television i don't know how many people were <UNK> away from the <UNK> tube to see this one but it managed to capture my attention for <UNK> minutes br br teen idol pat <UNK> plays nick <UNK> a young teen sent to live with his aunt <UNK> <UNK> nolan and uncle jed arthur <UNK> out in the country after being put on <UNK> for stealing a car it seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son jed jr so uncle jed seems has lost his <UNK> for living aunt <UNK> is hoping that nick being on the farm will somehow bring jed out of his <UNK> story lines like this being what they are jed and nick don't really care for each other too much of course jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors <UNK> <UNK> michaels and liz shirley jones <UNK> immediately jed develops a crush on <UNK> and of course i don't have to tell you that liz develops a crush on jed then there's the matter of uncle <UNK> horse a <UNK> who has turned wild and won't let anyone handle him since the death of jed jr you could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own seeing as how there are no real surprises doesn't matter though you'll enjoy yourself anyway br br once you get over the image of <UNK> clean pat <UNK> as a supposedly bad boy you'll have no trouble with the rest of the film considering that <UNK> does turn in a surprisingly good performance as nick certainly the role doesn't require much depth but still it's a nicely done job when you would least expect it as jed arthur <UNK> is the perfect choice for the role in the early going he is <UNK> and cold but as he slowly <UNK> up to nick we see that he's really a pretty good guy <UNK> nolan is a lot of fun as <UNK> who is constantly playing the part of <UNK> between jed and nick shirley jones takes a break from <UNK> and <UNK> and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents as liz she's gorgeous to look at great to listen to and quite funny at times <UNK> michaels as <UNK> who is a bit more on the wild side is equally entertaining br br the best thing about april love is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen not one true villain in the whole thing everybody is so darn likable you can't help but enjoy the film i <UNK> find it quite refreshing sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer <UNK> with friends think of it as the old andy griffith show with musical numbers a little more plot and wide screen technicolor the songs are a mixed bag with the title song april love being the best of them another thing i really liked is that they didn't fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it as a matter of fact you'll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didn't <UNK> in that department the chemistry between jones and <UNK> is good best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respect br br this movie will never be confused with great cinema yet sometimes instead of going to <UNK> one just needs a nice outing in the park and that's what april love is br br my grade b br br
<START> jean claude van damme tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of universal soldier but did that movie saved him i think he goes to hell after he dies br br in the first minute we see the inside of a facility where you can see the bad guy of the film scary huh but not as scary as the acting details are following br br then we see van damme with a black girl do not remember the name well it doesn't matter anyway trying to escape from some muscle men of course they are the new universal soldiers more <UNK> less brain just like the movie after a while van damme fights goldberg but then the mission gets <UNK> it was just a test is this movie a test for our nerves it turns out that van damme works for the government on the new universal soldier project who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most <UNK> thing that <UNK> van <UNK> character could do but it is a sequel and a story has to come up ah i forgot he has a daughter very important for the story br br well after about 20 minutes a super computer hears a conversation about <UNK> it down and <UNK> he project of course the cube gets angry and <UNK> all soldiers to kill everyone van damme escapes from the facility but the computer sends some soldiers hunting him it wants van damme as a soldier because he is the best really and guess what goldberg is one of the hunters who was always a silly sentence for the audience before he gets <UNK> funny yes just like the rest of the film br br after some story van damme tries to rescue his daughter of his wife the reporter in the first movie it comes to a final show down where van damme fights the bad guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie please see for yourself it is just too funny to tell br br you'll see that this movie is a waste of time br br so do not watch it but if you do keep a <UNK> with you
<START> this despite not being the original it began life as a play in central europe has <UNK> the several <UNK> that followed <UNK> own remake with period songs in the good old <UNK> the broadway show she loves me even the excellent theatre revival in paris a couple of years ago and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat several previous <UNK> have identified the <UNK> factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the <UNK> fashion in 30s and 40s hollywood for <UNK> attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today try for example <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc from casablanca and yes you'd still have rick and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but they'd just be <UNK> without the rich cake mixture below jimmy stewart and maggie <UNK> were both ideal and <UNK> leads but how much <UNK> they shine when their performances are reflected in those of frank morgan felix <UNK> joseph <UNK> and andy <UNK> sara <UNK> and this is before we factor in that lubitsch <UNK> okay maybe they were a tad more naive innocent even in that jurassic age but how many genuine film lovers <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and in your face sex turn back to those days of stories style <UNK> and skill and <UNK> in great movies like this one by far the best thing about this technological age is not <UNK> but dvd that can at one and the same time make these classics available to <UNK> and show the matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it
<START> the plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify as plot and character the biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark out of focus and <UNK> the fact that fulci filled the whole movie with <UNK> doesn't help on the other hand the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence the inconsistencies are pretty entertaining one of the main characters says he has no friends yet he <UNK> onto the new guy in a minute of screen time and has a whole <UNK> of women on the side though he does show his anti social <UNK> by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b d who's just <UNK> his own business images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from fulci maybe it ruined his career but it wasn't really much more stupid than zombie worth a rental if you like gory italian flicks or are desperate for sword and <UNK> or something bizarre how do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help
<START> if this series supposed to be an improvement over batman the animated series i for one think it failed terribly the character drawing is lousy <UNK> for instance looks awful but what really annoyed me is that it made batman look like a sort of <UNK> who just can't take care of himself in a battle without the help of two even three <UNK> i mean he's batman for god's sake i know the comic books i know that <UNK> and <UNK> are supposed to be <UNK> allies besides robin but still making batman say that he needs help from them what he can't handle a few punches in <UNK> he could face a dozen <UNK> without any problem he's getting old come on br br and another thing i really don't think that batman would allow a kid like tim drake to go into battle that soon without years of hard training one it's irresponsible and batman is everything but irresponsible and two it's not what happened in the comics if we are to remain faithful to them br br batman the animated series made history with its animation its stories and its characters that really was a legend of batman the new adventures series turned the legend into just another batman flick
<START> i saw this movie when it was new later i rented it in japan after having been here three years afraid that i would cringe when i viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience the movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between japan and <UNK> where i'm from not all the stuff is <UNK> spot on but the tone is perfect br br i'm still in japan many years later and i continue to enjoy this film for its even handed treatment of the two sides in the story interestingly although the japanese american actors spoke japanese in the original the dialog is <UNK> in the japan version to cover up obvious second language delivery problems br br i noticed one reviewer uses this in a japanese class i think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with japan by watching this film than by reading any of the serious books on the matter most of which were written in the 80s and <UNK> by <UNK> japanese companies br br don't be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one star reviewers who among other things found it implausible that the japanese would want to build cars in the us of course the japanese operate many <UNK> there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade <UNK> this is a very warm and funny movie that i would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clichés like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music michael keaton has never been funnier
<START> in many ways dirty work is a predictable l h short on the surface with the boys going to <UNK> someone s <UNK> guess what happens next that s right slapstick at its most <UNK> ensues br br but there s one or two things that seem <UNK> ollie for example is very unlikable he s arrogant he s rude and not only to stan look at the way he <UNK> the servant with hey you and takes a childish <UNK> very easily with his <UNK> being i have nothing to say in short ollie plays a bully in a very unlikable way and i much prefer to see him to play the arrogant coward where he s always at his funniest br br dirty work also lacks the <UNK> <UNK> of the other l h shorts like <UNK> long <UNK> and <UNK> which means when we switch to the mad scientist <UNK> there s a slightly creepy atmosphere that <UNK> with the rest of the movie br br having said that this is still a good short mainly down to stan also watch out for a scene featuring a fish many jokes plots from l h feature fish and this is another one
<START> i haven't seen much german comedy but if this film is anything to go by i'm compelled to see more the simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from germany to italy after eva an unemployed mother of two discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer i won't reveal anything further but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion my interest in international cinema has expanded since i first saw this film i recommend it to anyone any adult don't let the inclusion of the young children fool you into thinking it's a family film who love comedy even those unfamiliar with the language
<START> this wartime sitcom written by jimmy perry and david <UNK> who wrote tv's best programme ever <UNK> army was not as good as <UNK> army but still very very funny br br it is about a concert band in india most episodes were about <UNK> williams <UNK> davies trying to get the concert party who he referred to as a bunch of <UNK> posted up the jungle he was always <UNK> as the vague colonel reynolds donald <UNK> and the stupid captain <UNK> michael <UNK> were big fans of the concert party the concert party consisted of <UNK> <UNK> george <UNK> ginger rogers <UNK> <UNK> gloria <UNK> melvyn hayes university educated piano player <UNK> la de da <UNK> graham a k a <UNK> john <UNK> singer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> christopher mitchell williams thought <UNK> was his son he was quite wrong big eater <UNK> <UNK> evans and animal <UNK> kenneth macdonald he was no <UNK> <UNK> also heavily involved in the adventures were faithful indian servant <UNK> ram michael bates with the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> giving ram wonderful support br br the show just like <UNK> army left many <UNK> <UNK> ram used to say to his <UNK> <UNK> don't be such clever <UNK> and he ended a lot of the shows saying here is a very old <UNK> <UNK> e g when wife is having affair with best friend it doesn't stop your house from catching fire it was williams though who had the most <UNK> he would always shout <UNK> say oh dear how sad never mind and when talking to <UNK> graham he would always <UNK> talk in a posh accent br br this show doesn't enjoy the same recognition as <UNK> army did this is probably due to a question of taste this is seen as being crude williams is <UNK> calling his men <UNK> though it has to be said williams is a bore also some people think there is a racial element in the humour using the fact that michael bates was <UNK> up to play <UNK> ram bates was actually born in india though and spoke <UNK> before he spoke english so the bbc will feel a bit uneasy putting it on even though the vast majority of people who have actually watched the show would agree that the show isn't racist i know someone who is half indian and they weren't the slightest bit offended and agreed like i did that it was a very funny show when i see an episode for the first time i laugh probably more than i do for any other sitcom but when i see it second time round i don't laugh all that much but no matter how many times i see <UNK> army i laugh many times in an episode br br best episode the road to <UNK> series 1 episode 7
<START> by no means is this movie as bad as <UNK> <UNK> but it just wasn't funny it couldn't stick to one type of comedy it jumped from snl to adam sandler esquire to romantic to little guy scores big to slapstick to <UNK> the movie types of comedies although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments the fall down the hill no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way <UNK> <UNK> was funnier and felt shorter you never knew if andy <UNK> was supposed to be in high school a college <UNK> or just a loser living at home with his mother sissy <UNK> in her worst choice of roles and poor ian <UNK> the serious actor if i only had to name one is given crap to read into the camera the story drags and is completely predictable up to and including the end no spoilers here in case adam <UNK> mom wants to see it don't spend any money going to see this movie and maybe <UNK> michaels will get the hint and start producing quality yes wayne's world and tommy boy are quality movies
<START> this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen the writer director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you <UNK> nightmare is original and <UNK> different from any other movie you have seen is it a dream or reality this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and <UNK> it has an <UNK> feel with it's dark interpretations of <UNK> dominic <UNK> really became the <UNK> he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either he really <UNK> his whole being into this role from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites i recommend it highly and eagerly <UNK> to see more from this innovative creative writer director cinematographer
<START> making a book into a movie by following the story page by page is never a good idea when people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress and everybody's <UNK> eye <UNK> is different which is why when the <UNK> movie finally comes out you're always going to have a <UNK> off segment of the movie going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up br br all a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see br br there is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of stephen king when filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying carrie <UNK> lot the dead zone or they can be what fans consider to be a <UNK> awful mess kubrick's version of the shining the miniseries for it and the <UNK> br br although it's not even close to being the perfect king adaptation pet sematary has so many moments of just skin and bone deep <UNK> that seemed to have <UNK> onto the screen directly from the book that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings for that we have music video turned film director mary <UNK> to thank she also directed <UNK> not exactly a horror movie but another freaky as hell must see you should put on your list working from a screenplay by the <UNK> <UNK> himself and probably one of his better ones br br since the majority of you know the story i won't put you to sleep with too many of the details dr louis <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country well almost perfect except for two nasty little details the dangerously busy stretch of <UNK> highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back since louis is a <UNK> and has a young <UNK> for a son well even if you haven't read the book do the <UNK> <UNK> it is a king story after all so no mystery where this is headed br br it's not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to <UNK> scream inducing life here rachel <UNK> star <UNK> denise crosby horrific memory of her <UNK> ill crippled sister <UNK> encounters with the <UNK> injured <UNK> victor <UNK> brad <UNK> both before and after his death the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery and that third act if it doesn't give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulse br br good performances by all here especially the late fred <UNK> as the well <UNK> neighbor <UNK> <UNK> who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up sometimes dead is better br br about the only problem with the movie version is the casting of <UNK> son gage <UNK> hughes knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this <UNK> and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately hughes at the time was just too damn cute to sell his intended role as an evil demon possessed zombie this takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged especially <UNK> death scene br br other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets carrie still holds the title for best king adaptation as far as i'm concerned but sematary is right up there in the top five br br still will anything adapted for the screen based on a king book be as terrifying as reading the story not bloody likely for now
<START> in europe it's known as who <UNK> wins in america it's known as the final option but under any title this ludicrous <UNK> action flick asks the audience to put their disbelief to one side for around two hours i find it incredibly hard to comprehend how lewis collins the hero here was almost chosen as roger moore's <UNK> in the bond films this guy is so <UNK> he'd struggle to get a job in a <UNK> museum as a <UNK> luckily judy davis is on hand to partially redeem the affair with a <UNK> performance as a hard line lady terrorist and there's a climactic ten minute action sequence that is quite competently <UNK> by director ian sharp let it be added that it's a very very very long wait for these closing <UNK> to come around and i can't honestly say that a near two hour wait for a bit of decent action was worth the effort br br <UNK> hard man peter <UNK> lewis collins goes undercover among a group of peace <UNK> who would like to see the end of nuclear weapons stock <UNK> he meets their leader frankie judy davis a strong talking and <UNK> woman who might just be capable of taking extraordinary <UNK> to achieve her goals <UNK> dedicated bunch violently lay siege to the american <UNK> in london demanding that a nuclear missile be fired at a naval base in scotland she believes that when the world witnesses a nuclear blast for real everyone will be so appalled that they will join her campaign for <UNK> unfortunately for frankie she makes the mistake of taking <UNK> on her little <UNK> raid and he plans to <UNK> their plan from inside with a little well timed outside help from his <UNK> <UNK> br br the film is inspired quite obviously by the awesome <UNK> assault on the iranian <UNK> in 1981 someone who saw that event on the news apparently thought it would be good to <UNK> a film along similar lines unfortunately the film is rather banal with too much stupid dialogue and a heck of a lot of embarrassingly bad scenes the arch <UNK> debate which <UNK> into a riot anyone <UNK> idea to bring about peace by <UNK> a nuclear blast is ridiculous anyway so she becomes a laughable figure just when the audience is on the verge of viewing her as an interesting villain who <UNK> wins tries to be a celebration of the military legend that is the <UNK> but at the same time it <UNK> into clumsy action clichés and ill thought out plotting the result is a well <UNK> but wholly <UNK> slice of boy's own absurdity
<START> i picked up this movie for 5 dollars at a <UNK> book store adam sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie well it wasn't there was absolutely no story line at all bad jokes and the other comedian said the f word every other word he said <UNK> usually <UNK> bother me but this was over the top and even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie it reminded me of <UNK> the <UNK> when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions and last of all is when they would randomly put in bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie in my opinion don't buy this movie its a waste of money
<START> working class romantic drama from director martin <UNK> is as unbelievable as they come yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro both terrific she's a widow who can't move on he's illiterate and a closet <UNK> you can probably guess the rest adaptation of pat <UNK> novel union street a better title is so laid back it <UNK> on bland and the film's editing is a mess but it's still pleasant a <UNK> <UNK> blue collar fantasy there are no <UNK> to serious issues even the <UNK> angle is just a plot tool for the ensuing love story and no real fireworks though the characters are intentionally a bit <UNK> and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree the finale is pure fluff and <UNK> will find it difficult to swallow though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn't really be satisfying any other way from
<START> this is the best emma in existence in my opinion having seen the other version 1996 which is also good and read the book i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane <UNK> masterpiece the 1996 movie with g paltrow is good too it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether it's very light and <UNK> you don't see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie that one would do fine but the <UNK> of some of the plot points such as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is so much <UNK> over as to be virtually non existent but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit more real and <UNK> the 1996 tv version is the superior emma is a remarkable person but she is flawed kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith yet she shows no <UNK> for having ruined <UNK> <UNK> until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending you see her <UNK> and it mirrors frank <UNK> in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims for emma it was playing <UNK> and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her <UNK> to marriage for frank <UNK> it is <UNK> the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others <UNK> to keep the secret in the book she realizes all of this in a <UNK> awakening to all the <UNK> she has made both kate beckinsale and <UNK> paltrow are convincing in their <UNK> but <UNK> is more <UNK> and <UNK> while <UNK> awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child like selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult both versions are very good but i prefer this one
<START> this movie isn't about football at all it's about jesus god it's the same kind of sappy <UNK> religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who <UNK> for jesus or <UNK> iron for jesus yeah jesus was totally <UNK> liked contact sports and definitely owned a full set of dumb <UNK> <UNK> this movie should have been entitled <UNK> for jesus or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to <UNK> people to christianity and to <UNK> to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the <UNK> that the title is derived from the bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his bible and asking jesus for help the recent sports movie <UNK> was 100 times more inspiring than this was and jesus wasn't even a factor it was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream br br any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant bible <UNK> and <UNK> religious propaganda one gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept jesus as your personal <UNK> but this is simply not true and is therefore a lie being <UNK> by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it the image of the winning <UNK> <UNK> jesus when he wins comes directly to mind what does he do when he loses does he curse jesus of course not when he loses jesus isn't responsible jesus is only responsible when he wins and the logic goes round and round and round and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be every time i had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so i could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath <UNK> is not what jesus taught i find it odd that most so called christians seem to either forget or ignore this message from their <UNK> especially when i see a jesus fish on the back of a huge gas <UNK> <UNK> that passes me like i'm standing still br br another message this movie implies is that jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world the final scene where the insecure and unsure <UNK> boots a <UNK> yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a <UNK> religious red flag on this turkey i only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act
<START> i sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations my expectations were no where near low enough i honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it and if it was a comedy the humor was completely missed the plot was nonexistent and the acting was horrendous my friends and i managed to watch approximately 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and promptly <UNK> the video store to take it back i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are <UNK> trying to watch the worst movies of all time i honestly don't know how this film lasted more than a day in theatres and moreover i can not understand why anyone would willing watch it considering not only it's very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actors actresses in it's cast this review is not a joke and i honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made it's certainly the worst movie i've ever had to sit through
<START> i was so disappointed by this show after hearing and reading all the <UNK> about it how it was a ground breaking show and all sorts of wild promises if quality i tried to watch it br br what a letdown the acting was way forced and exaggerated the story made very little sense as for any hint of the <UNK> look into <UNK> lives i could only see a <UNK> attempt that had as much reality to it as a reality show br br some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show the reason is that it's really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is
<START> thanks to a smart script and a steady hand from writer director kevin meyer perfect <UNK> is an entertaining and very likable mystery thriller the movie starts <UNK> and builds up steam as the clues begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems to be <UNK> <UNK> and hector <UNK> are terrific as they team up to unravel the mystery reminding me of nick and nora charles from the thin man movies kathleen <UNK> is excellent as alex <UNK> tormented wife and the character roles played by veteran actors charles martin smith bruce <UNK> anne <UNK> and <UNK> harris are well done and provide plenty of light moments at just the right time there's even a cameo by rex <UNK> in all i felt like i was reading a good book by the fire
<START> i haven't read a single imdb comment for this movie that mentions how the jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a little baby as a gun is pointed in his face by a racist <UNK> while the movie's lead black character looked in <UNK> down the barrel of a gun br br i don't know how anyone could perceive this as a balanced account of university life i agree <UNK> are not <UNK> of tolerance like they are supposed to be and the title would be fitting if <UNK> didn't make his characters such broad caricatures br br on the surface he tries to portray ice <UNK> character as a bad guy provoking <UNK> to become a racist <UNK> but who <UNK> at the end in the movie's redeeming <UNK> it seems <UNK> points at white as either unable to empathize i didn't say sympathize with his fellow black student or only able to take the path of a racist <UNK> many people who have been <UNK> by people of another race do not turn to extreme <UNK> br br nor do women who have been raped immediately turn to <UNK> which is portrayed more as a cult than a lifestyle quite honestly what was the point
<START> i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart but i was <UNK> when i saw the 5 4 rating to one of my childhood favourites it doesn't wow me as much at 17 but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie kids will definitely love it and won't mind the flaws and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the <UNK> <UNK> of the film none of the film was preachy in any way in fact it has a great message that added to its <UNK> i will admit though that the story is on the thin side and some scenes like <UNK> death which still freaks me out may be a tad on the scary side but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation the music by james <UNK> is very beautiful and the song featured is memorable catchy and amusing i really liked the characters <UNK> is probably the most in depth of them all but the dinosaurs were at least engaging martin <UNK> clown was both hilarious and <UNK> the part when he tells <UNK> i quit had me in <UNK> my favourite is <UNK> though an effective villain who is <UNK> and i suppose intelligent if anything though i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of <UNK> because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth the script while not oscar worthy has its funny and heart warming parts and should keep kids and adults entertained the voice acting for me was what made the movie john goodman martin short <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> smith all gave solid performances but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as <UNK> and almost <UNK> all in all this is a good movie i don't get the rating honestly i don't sure this film isn't perfect and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time but it is good fun 7 5 10 <UNK> cox
<START> my <UNK> drama club will be putting this show in the spring of 2002 and i can only hope we're as good as this i watched this film recently as sort of research for my role <UNK> <UNK> and i'd just like to say vanessa williams is the coolest br br wow the casting for this movie was right on with one exception jason alexander oh my <UNK> is there anything he can't do he was the most wonderful albert peterson ever i especially loved all of his funny facial expressions and dancing during put on a happy face he is so great vanessa williams as i said before is the coolest she was a beautiful <UNK> and her transition from secretary to <UNK> was totally believable <UNK> <UNK> was hilarious as <UNK> obnoxious mother and george <UNK> was superb as the annoyed mr <UNK> however i loved paul <UNK> performance in the 1963 version <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> me up as ursula <UNK> she really <UNK> it up and marc <UNK> was an awesome conrad <UNK> suffer br br there was only one casting that i didn't understand and as you'll see from previous comments many other people didn't understand <UNK> phillips as kim <UNK> what was that i mean she's really pretty and very talented but she looks a bit too old for the role eh maybe i'm <UNK> br br okay well anyways i highly recommend this movie it'll leave you smiling br br
<START> as long as you can suffer it if you like watching people waking up getting up getting dressed having a shower preparing dinner watching each other having sex in the dark then going back to bed to sleep if you like tacky <UNK> narrow <UNK> and <UNK> long minutes of silence if you like getting bored for two hours feeling the thrill of real intimate false art then you will like it but if you don't just try to see a good movie there are thousands as long as you are here but do we want to stay this german movie got the award of the <UNK> gay film festival italian <UNK> still don't understand why the jury took such a bad decision as the festival presented lot of talented movies maybe to be nice with a german as they don't often get awards well the lives of others did but this one is excellent but not gay so maybe it is a question of fashion germans are they in again no matter what or maybe only for a <UNK> glance of some directors
<START> there's a lot the matter with helen and none of it's good shelley winters and debbie reynolds play mothers of a pair of leopold <UNK> like killers who move from the mid west to hollywood to escape their past reynolds a <UNK> jean harlow wannabe opens a dance studio for children and winters is her piano player soon winters as helen begins to crack up it's all very slow going and although there are moments of real creepiness nasty phone calls a visit from <UNK> timothy carey the movie is devoid of any real horror nevertheless it's still worthy entertainment the acting <UNK> are fine and the production values are terrific a music score by david <UNK> cinematography by <UNK> <UNK> and oscar nominated costumes contribute <UNK> with this a place in the sun and <UNK> to her credit does anyone do crazy as well as winters directed by curtis <UNK> a master at this type of not quite a movie exploitation in addition to carey the oddball supporting cast includes dennis weaver <UNK> <UNK> as a very <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the irish orson welles as hamilton <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hammy
<START> this thrown together piece of <UNK> matter adds together so many ludicrous scenarios that in the end it's a laugh riot of absolute hilarity too bad as the premise is promising as it so often is in <UNK> but in the hands of this scriptwriter it <UNK> off into la la land br br lowe is in prison serving time for a <UNK> that killed off his mistress we get to see him having nightmares just so that we know he feels real bad about this then his cell mate neighbor hangs himself or does he lowe has some <UNK> but drops them quickly his <UNK> are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about so why do they then set him up to be killed ah that's where this story could get interesting that's where it falls off the <UNK> and once off the <UNK> it decides it can get away with insulting the viewers attention for the next numbing hour br br spoilers br br i won't bore with an endless <UNK> of the <UNK> of what follows but contemplate this ending lowe has been trapped by the bad guys on a train they want a tape he has because that tape will screw their boss and them so on to the train come 3 cops guns drawn ready to rescue lowe the bad guys kill the cops in front of half the passengers and then continue chasing lowe to get the tape hello killing 3 cops in public will get you into deep <UNK> to hell with the tape yet off they go through a mall shooting up the place as if the public did not exist as witnesses and in the end lowe is grabbed and the bad guy still wants the tape
<START> the <UNK> stranger was another of those rare b movies that <UNK> screened over christmas new year 2005 2006 see also they live by night and the <UNK> <UNK> br br in this one a man walking his dog in central park comes across an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside she was shot and police then try to identify her with only a <UNK> as the main clue after being identified the murderer is discovered and is shot in the shootout at the end br br most of this movie was shot on location in and around new york so we get to see some areas of the city we don't normally see especially the back streets br br mostly <UNK> are in the cast with john miles getting top billing br br the <UNK> stranger is worth seeking out excellent but rather obscure br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> grand canyon falls under a very <UNK> category it is a very clever film with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end i have the impression that it never made it to it's deserved <UNK> and never will because of it's simplicity this kind of flick needs sensitive <UNK> pity thought that imdb makes me write ten lines because this is in no way necessary in this particular case anyway in order to fulfill this request i will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting not that it is bad but it could have been done much better exception made for kevin kline who was perfect go ahead and watch it

<START> even <UNK> if possible than the original i hope i may say that under the imdb <UNK> the french connection at least tried to <UNK> european influences to <UNK> the conventional view of the american police detective even if the attempt was <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and general <UNK> the relative <UNK> boom of the 1960s especially with the <UNK> vague allowed for a huge influence of european cinema in hollywood this <UNK> a new <UNK> and complexity to a weary medium and in the best of them <UNK> bonnie and clyde early <UNK> a new <UNK> of received practice the original connection was part of this movement with its <UNK> <UNK> style and anti detective figure two is old hollywood's right wing <UNK> of american values br br this is figured in the film's very tiresome america vs france <UNK> for instance two is shot like a 70s french <UNK> it was the french of course who insisted on the greatness of american movies when they were ignored at home and this in a sense is a <UNK> a warning against <UNK> <UNK> this can be seen in the pattern of the two movies connection has french gangsters <UNK> new york with the french style <UNK> the american thriller this leads to the <UNK> of the detective figure and <UNK> of plot the baddie got away br br two has the american returning to france with american thriller values <UNK> on the native genre the power of the detective is <UNK> and conventional resolution is achieved this is further <UNK> in <UNK> relationship with french inspector <UNK> whose <UNK> influence he must shake off before he can control the plot br br two seems to follow the original by <UNK> its detective hero from the start <UNK> importance is <UNK> at every turn despite the ending of connection he is considered a hero but he is an american in a foreign land and his inability to control language or customs means he cannot dominate the plot he even <UNK> the signs of the police force <UNK> an informer for a criminal and getting him killed br br a <UNK> power comes from his power as subject to see and interpret but doyle spends much of the movie being watched controlled an object a body literally in the scenes after he is dumped by <UNK> to be viewed and interpreted in connection he <UNK> the action chasing the criminals forcing the plot here he is passive tied to a bed locked in a cell an addict a <UNK> br br this loss of <UNK> power is predictably <UNK> in the loss of his gun and the film follows a <UNK> familiar <UNK> <UNK> in the heroin sequences he is <UNK> by an old lady who says he looks like her son his drugged state is like a return to the <UNK> robbed of adult <UNK> her taking his watch <UNK> the <UNK> of this state <UNK> significant for a man whose career depends on <UNK> and <UNK> br br <UNK> was the first detective and to avoid his fate doyle must reject this false mother who is <UNK> his <UNK> identity and kill the father <UNK> so that he can take his accepted <UNK> role in society <UNK> theory was popular among <UNK> in the 70s ironically <UNK> by a frenchman jacques <UNK> but it's rare to see a film so literally full of it br br if all of these facts tended towards the <UNK> of doyle then the film's style doesn't <UNK> <UNK> us from his hero by <UNK> empathy or character motivation focusing on the <UNK> of plot here doyle is a very conventional hollywood hero instead of being lost in murky long shot he is made <UNK> and understandable to the viewer with the traditional devices point of view shots close ups connecting shots etc br br two is all about the fall and rise of <UNK> doyle plot in this case is <UNK> to the acting which is the usual hackman <UNK> the cold turkey scenes therefore despite their <UNK> are not disturbing we are allowed to share rather than <UNK> observe this a far less <UNK> experience the scenes are also shot through with a <UNK> <UNK> sentimentality that is very american br br so while connection tried to imitate the complex thrillers of jean pierre <UNK> two does the complete opposite <UNK> le <UNK> featured a gangster who started the film whole powerful outside language and <UNK> his eventual <UNK> two starts with a <UNK> character achieved partly through inability with language whose <UNK> begins when he steps outside language the <UNK> action sequences are largely <UNK> br br in the film the locale and language are important as they fixed and <UNK> the detective but as he <UNK> his power figured in the return of his gun and the <UNK> burning of the primal site of vulnerability the tower block where <UNK> held him the <UNK> setting becomes more irrelevant and the <UNK> stand off which could take place anywhere takes over compare the endings of the two films one admits ambiguity and despair the other absolute <UNK> br br
<START> the film was very outstanding despite the <UNK> 17 rating and disturbing scenes in reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it it all starts with <UNK> rosario dawson in superb performance whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her she meets jared <UNK> <UNK> in a terrific performance at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet he invites her out to dinner they look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment they talk and takes her to the basement were they become <UNK> with each other she tries to put an end to it but he rapes her this incident <UNK> her she goes to a club meets a bartender dj adrian <UNK> played by marcus patrick who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far they strike a friendship he also does drugs and <UNK> starts using as well in other words introduces her to a different world she starts going back to school and working as <UNK> teaching assistant and spots jared as one of the students while the students are taking a <UNK> she catches jared cheating jared tries to smooth talk <UNK> but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place will history repeat itself or will <UNK> have a surprise for jared you watch the movie excellent a rosario dawson portrays the role with focus and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does not like he can be a rapist but he does a terrific job as jared marcus patrick is very brilliant the man who saves <UNK> and <UNK> her into a new world this film deserves an award
<START> released some months before the end of the war anchors aweigh is one of gene kelly's major musical <UNK> of the <UNK> br br under the direction of george sidney it had the benefits of a pleasant score <UNK> of <UNK> services of gene kelly in his first true starring role at <UNK> the year before in <UNK> cover girl he had revealed an innovative approach to dance on the screen a light but <UNK> singing voice and considerable charm in anchors aweigh although he was billed under frank sinatra and kathryn grayson he was laying the solid <UNK> for his most revealing years at <UNK> br br the film's story a kind of dry run for on the town four years later follows sailors kelly and sinatra on shore leave spend their holiday in hollywood where they become involved in the affairs of an aspiring singer grayson and her little nephew dean <UNK> br br grayson it appears has her heart set on an audition with conductor <UNK> jose <UNK> she gets the audition of course kelly gets grayson after some <UNK> and sinatra has forgotten to be shy and has lost his heart to a girl from brooklyn pamela <UNK> br br the plot is conventional for the period but <UNK> it now seems barely <UNK> but there is gene kelly who <UNK> the movie with his <UNK> <UNK> perhaps he <UNK> too much but when is <UNK> to dance the film finally lifts off the <UNK> br br i <UNK> her his early song and dance with sinatra is amusing and slightly absurd in which he <UNK> himself as a <UNK> <UNK> in a spanish <UNK> <UNK> maiden grayson with a flamboyant flamenco dance and some athletic <UNK> he also does a charming mexican dance with little sharon <UNK> in the square of a mexican <UNK> in los <UNK> br br the highlight of the movie however is kelly's famous dance with the cartoon character jerry the mouse of tom and jerry fame delightful and innovative it <UNK> combines live action and animation in its tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until kelly a sailor in the <UNK> navy wearing a <UNK> shirt and a <UNK> shows him how to <UNK> look at me i'm <UNK> says the <UNK> mouse king
<START> this was yet another big screen outing for a us tv show from the sixties it is amusing enough but was very much to formula intelligent martian lands on earth and meets the not too bright humans in his view br br the usual <UNK> ensues with the human bridges eventually bonds with him and helps him to get home along the way he also gets the girl hannah br br this is a nice outing for some pleasant hollywood stars who i had not seen for a while br br pleasant enough to pass some spare time if you have not got anything better to view
<START> according to the director this movie was popular in asia it is somewhat difficult to take these <UNK> <UNK> movies seriously since most of his films are shot on a very tight budget almost no <UNK> at all but it is fascinating to establish that <UNK> <UNK> eventually <UNK> something which can be called an action movie the ninja mission is i think the best one among all movies directed by him some special effects are quite enjoyable this is not a b or c movie it is a z movie but an enjoyable and fun z movie
<START> old horror movies are interesting plenty of screams plenty of shouts and plenty of humor to go along with it the blob is a classic in it's own work steve mcqueen 1930 80 plays a teen who tries to be a hero in his town going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens but when the old man discovers the same falling object form the sky he ends up being the victim and steve helps him out the best he can when its up to teen power this movie really provides it i know most teens have had their <UNK> when they act up when danger comes around they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity when the adults in town ended up learn the hard way about the blob running amok they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them the <UNK> <UNK> was rather cute in the day and in my opinion i think it was <UNK> o when everyone <UNK> in to stop the menace the town is once again safe thanks to good old <UNK> i still eat <UNK> and watch this movie all the time if you don't like <UNK> tough rating 5 stars
<START> scary yes scary jam packed with nudity from fat people to skinny people <UNK> beach takes place on a <UNK> beach in s a br br i first saw this film two years ago it's safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day this film was horrible hardly a romantic comedy just a showcase of nudity this movie hit its <UNK> with one of the new age characters staring down between a girls legs br br girl you're not going to find god in there guy <UNK> but i think i found heaven br br steer clear of this one unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as <UNK> adultery and the process of <UNK> one's <UNK> together avoid
<START> this very unfunny failed tv pilot can be found as an extra on the <UNK> <UNK> dvd special edition blazing <UNK> imagine the movie without the satire humor or writing skills but with all the <UNK> of a typical lame <UNK> sit com show complete with <UNK> laugh track and you'll still have no clue how sheer <UNK> this failed show was what the hell was lou <UNK> jr thinking when he signed onto this disaster this was possibly the worst thing he's been in and yes i'm including the first <UNK> movie and iron <UNK> 3 steve <UNK> i understand as he can't say no to crap br br my grade f
<START> this is one military drama i like a lot tom berenger playing military assassin thomas <UNK> this marine is no nonsense in your face and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done there you have billy zane the phantom and others who plays richard miller a former <UNK> form d c works for the government and takes orders only from them who needs a <UNK> i don't when these two are paired sparks should be flying and how however <UNK> teaches the young <UNK> on how it works when the other sniper hits it's wits vs wits cat vs mouse <UNK> vs <UNK> and when the seasoned sniper is caught it's up to miller to put politics aside and save him who needs politics when you a pro like <UNK> he took orders from no one but himself plays by the rules and not the book and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics the movie was a direct hit watch it rating 4 out of 5 stars
<START> i do not fail to recognize <UNK> above average film making skills for example i appreciate his lingering on <UNK> natural day <UNK> settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism however regarding the content of this film i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> relations or feelings and or <UNK> practices the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably <UNK> as is the alienation and <UNK> felt by walter i don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on i mean d s is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something <UNK> or <UNK> it isn't in general films dealing with this subject are really <UNK> behind the times br br so for me i feel that this film ends up being quite a <UNK> film worried with very outdated <UNK> theories isn't it nearly embarrassing and that does not really relate with real life lives and experiences of those engaged in d s relationships personal experience <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even recent <UNK> studies will show this
<START> okay what the hell kind of trash have i been watching now the <UNK> mountain has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet at the same time it's also strangely compelling there's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and i even doubt there ever was a script to work with but somehow i couldn't turn it off the scratching your head with confusion starts right away with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother's cat so you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces heck no because after this intro the girl and her <UNK> simply aren't mentioned anymore then cut to a guy with the most <UNK> <UNK> mustache you'll ever see who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather <UNK> way when she asks him to spend his vacation with her he promptly phones his <UNK> <UNK> him any type of assignment great move the movie finally starts now as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks though not before he picks up a new girl patty shepard and photographs her topless throughout their journey all kind of strange events occur that  you guessed it  are never explained the girl wakes up in the middle of the forest loud <UNK> music plays everywhere and someone even steals the <UNK> really car <UNK> witches apparently a <UNK> of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on <UNK> that's as close as i get describing the plot but there's a good chance i'm way <UNK> more important here is the atmosphere the <UNK> mountain is occasionally very creepy with its spooky music and interesting cinematography the supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing patty shepard plays a good heroine this is the type of european horror film that could have been legendary if only someone had bothered to write a structured screenplay
<START> this movie was awful i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through i didn't get the point of the movie what was the point of this movie the soundtrack was bad acting was bad and the story uninspiring the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting there was no chemistry among any of the cast members i don't know this for a fact but i suspect that most of the actors were first <UNK> the movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot that <UNK> how many useless scenes there were in the movie i would have rather ha a root <UNK> during the two hours of the movie i want those two hours back if you want to watch good funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of <UNK> watch <UNK> dynamite instead
<START> matt <UNK> luke wilson thinks he has found the perfect woman in jenny johnson uma thurman who seems like a quiet but pretty woman though he soon learns that she's <UNK> and <UNK> oh and she's also the superhero g girl though you wouldn't know it from the things she does to matt after he freaks out and breaks up with her br br a promising premise is ruined by a mediocre execution my super ex girlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy however it relies too much on cheap sex jokes and it ends up being a forgettable experience what went wrong the cast and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script and i didn't like the way they played it out i was expecting the guy to be a jerk and it could have been a female fantasy revenge film however they made the guy likable and they made the superhero a psycho it just wasn't very fresh and after about forty minutes the film wore out it's welcome sure there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking out br br director <UNK> <UNK> has lost his touch after a successful run in the eighties and early nineties he started making crap like evolution and father's day i wouldn't say my super ex girlfriend is a complete bust but i don't give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds which isn't too much don payne did an awful job with the screenplay the majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just one note he also kept <UNK> a lot of the same jokes making the thing really tedious at times br br a few of the actors were good enough to save the film uma thurman was great as g girl and she had many funny lines luke wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting i don't think he makes for an appealing leading man and he's better in supporting roles like in the family stone anna <UNK> was just doing her scary movie routine and it's getting a little old she needs a challenge or at least some better scripts <UNK> sykes is either hit or miss for me she was great in monster in law and she was bad in <UNK> 2 here she is just annoying and doesn't bring anything to the movie eddie izzard was alright nothing special <UNK> wilson was just annoying and not funny overall i was disappointed with the movie it wasn't awful yet it had so much potential and the final result was just so average rating 5 10
<START> corridors of time the movie you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide some use guns <UNK> or gas but you want to ruin your brains do not wait any longer corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes thinking christian <UNK> is able to act and to bring you fun i do not miss the 45 <UNK> this poor thing cost me sometimes one has to <UNK> its <UNK> system looking at the absolute zero this film deserves a 2 10 but that's only because i like jean reno too bad for him he also stars in <UNK> i think i'm gonna dislike him
<START> this movie surprised me some things were <UNK> and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very entertaining good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike <UNK> and the 2 wannabe thugs <UNK> and <UNK> providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over again say some <UNK> night when nothing else is on i gave it a 9 for entertainment value
<START> i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users some are saying it's his <UNK> movie ever ' what haven't any of you seen cradle 2 the grave my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on duh what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story then just loaded it up with action of course not black mask is awesome wall to wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time it's also deliciously gruesome and we get plenty of severed limbs <UNK> and creative ways of watching the bad guys and quite a few innocent people too get slaughtered most of <UNK> other martial arts films are <UNK> school when compared to black mask there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence bloodshed or action sequences whatsoever and that made me a happy <UNK> again if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot you are going for the wrong reasons black mask is probably my favorite of his movies though beware of the horrendous dubbing
<START> i totally hated the movie it was so retarded they need to get some acting lessons no wait that won't help because the naked brothers band people a <UNK> you know why i am here even though i am a naked brothers band <UNK> to warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that the <UNK> doesn't get any money from it so then they can't make any more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds not only are the song lyrics retarded they sing badly okay i'm kinda getting off the movie here anyways it was boring and they acted horribly it was not funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be i guess they deserve some credit for that well the movie isn't worth your time just look at its rating the movie and the series is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain seriously if you liked it you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act not <UNK> their lines in a <UNK> i am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually better than those <UNK> and alex guys hurry before it's too late i seriously thought that <UNK> fully loaded was better than this piece of <UNK> i don't even know why i went through even half of that film i don't think it even deserves to be called a film
<START> i remember this film from many years ago certainly the best film on the subject in my experience the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time <UNK> to its impact br br it is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language <UNK> but they were nonetheless very powerful br br this subject continues to <UNK> us even with the passing of years and it was most effectively treated here with the proper <UNK> of historical perspective and <UNK> br br i wish it would be shown on tv at least once or at least be available on tape or dvd or is it is some art film archive <UNK> a copy of it
<START> it <UNK> me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors locations and genres i e douglas sutherland washington d c and political thriller but 'the <UNK> really hits a low it's like they had a great idea up front signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew <UNK> the rest and i wish i could blame it on yet another bland performance from basinger not only do i feel she's one of the worst actors in hollywood but i'm still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one and definitely the only bad actor in the film to win an acting oscar for <UNK> a <UNK> ' but she wasn't the only problem sutherland who i love as jack bauer on <UNK> once again <UNK> i miss his old 'a time to <UNK> or 'a few good <UNK> days douglas certainly took a <UNK> from acting and <UNK> this one in plot someone some secret service <UNK> wants the president dead and douglas is <UNK> being framed will someone believe him actually no spoiler here as quickly as they came up with that subplot half way through it's over before you know it and why did someone s want the president dead is that to be revealed in the sequel too many plot holes too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable 'the <UNK> is if you only see one movie a year you may not know who the mole is but anyone who's familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one <UNK> <UNK> episode you'll know in the first few frames was it terrible not really the cinematography was good and despite sutherland playing jack again he's still got it
<START> shortly after seeing this film i <UNK> the mental <UNK> of every actor and actress that accepted a role elizabeth <UNK> is a commendable actress why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity i must give credit where credit is due though some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather <UNK> but they hardly made up for the <UNK> perverse <UNK> of kevin <UNK> character sebastian caine i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone man or woman that has any form of self respect to account for
<START> body slam 1987 is a flat out terrible movie the low budget <UNK> the direction is pedestrian at best and the writing and acting is lame but if you're into old school wrestling circa 1970's through the mid <UNK> then you'll be more entertained than the average viewer i have to warn you this movie stinks on ice i gave it a two because i felt like being generous this turkey was directed by stunt master hal <UNK> the stars are <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> kid and a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> and c list actors <UNK> <UNK> br br the synopsis of this movie is about a <UNK> who wants to combine hair rock and wrestling but their are others that don't want him to succeed there's more but i don't want to spoil it for you if you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline there's a few surprises near the end for die hard wrestling fans br br i wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy and i mean it
<START> this kind of storytelling is <UNK> the only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it's got george lucas behind it and it has the words star and wars in its title that is an insult to aspiring filmmakers and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story writing and acting but did not get the credit this is a travesty br br first things first the story <UNK> evolution there is none apart from a little make up around the eyes and a little yelling there is none he becomes young stupid cocky <UNK> skywalker to darth vader in a single blow the only thing consistent about darth vader in the original series was his intelligence how good he was at almost everything he did planning fighting you name it the only consistent thing about <UNK> that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity he even loses his body because of a bout of stupid <UNK> br br what part of the emperor <UNK> telling him legends of the <UNK> does not point to the emperor being a <UNK> <UNK> br br the fight scenes used too many digital <UNK> everyone's flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make believe doll house count <UNK> emperor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wan almost every fighter had a <UNK> digital double jumping around br br in one specific fight scene <UNK> wan and <UNK> in the climactic battle they both actually stop in the middle of <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> their <UNK> a few times while <UNK> apart i realize the fights are choreographed but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust br br the writing was awful all the dialogue was of tremendously low quality the good actors like ewan <UNK> and natalie portman did the best they could with their lines but that just wasn't enough i can't say enough bad things about this film too much special effects plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe and absolutely no insights into any of the characters this is the biggest mistake of this film nothing new is offered we know the rough picture of everything all lucas did was colour it in br br we knew <UNK> lost his limbs we knew luke and leia are brother and sister we knew luke is <UNK> son we knew <UNK> wan and <UNK> go to <UNK> we knew everything nothing new is offered in this film if that's all the fans wanted then that's fine lucas couldn't have gone wrong br br but when <UNK> finally becomes darth vader and he asks after <UNK> and hears she is dead he reaches out his arms <UNK> and screams <UNK> that scene screamed b movie all the way and i was half expecting darth vader to go danger will robinson danger at any time that is what this is a b movie disguised by a huge budget and a ultra <UNK> fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the <UNK> of the earth
<START> oh dear i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip off of <UNK> <UNK> well i guess the u s made their version of it as well but at least it was an outright remake so so sad i very much enjoy watching <UNK> movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country so i can't believe this had to happen <UNK> and kris are such big names there surprised they would be <UNK> with <UNK> to any aspiring movie makers out there in the <UNK> you do not have to <UNK> this low to make money there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies <UNK> put out and enjoying them
<START> saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw first the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years several parts of the film had continuity problems for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed br br the copy i saw was missing about 20 minutes or so at least a huge gap with black screen appeared it is too bad because even though the script left something to be desired bergman russell both did fine in the film in their roles it is a shame the large <UNK> is missing but what is here is watchable br br i just wish it was all intact the script makes little sense in that <UNK> character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults some of the time lines don't make sense either there is a stock market crash that resembles <UNK> but the kids grow up to fight in world war 1 all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film i could not see as it was missing
<START> i loved this masterpiece and quite frankly i too found mary <UNK> although i love julie andrews and dick <UNK> to be silly and <UNK> sweet angela lansbury plays her character to perfection and i don't know why people think of this film as distorted it was magical and it was lots of fun to watch every scene held a certain charm as you got to know the characters better you truly see how this little thrown together family learn to bond with each other despite their age and differences i thought the characters were well developed especially charles who was at the age of not believing mary <UNK> may be more popular and <UNK> by others but this little gem will be the one that i will always love and <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> respect for acting is the standard <UNK> in many college theater <UNK> in the book <UNK> presents two <UNK> different approaches to developing a character as an actor the <UNK> approach and the <UNK> approach in the <UNK> approach the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life in the <UNK> approach the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion through a high degree of control of movement and sound br br the <UNK> approach to acting was still partially in <UNK> when this hamlet was made british theater has a long history of this style of acting and olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the <UNK> school br br time has not been kind to this school of acting or to this movie nearly every working actor today uses a <UNK> approach to the modern eye <UNK> highly <UNK> stylized delivery is <UNK> stiff and stilted instead of creating an <UNK> conflicted hamlet olivier made a <UNK> self important <UNK> out of the melancholy <UNK> an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger london theaters but is far too <UNK> to carry off a modern hamlet br br and so the movie <UNK> along <UNK> today <UNK> tendency to e nun <UNK> ate makes some of <UNK> lines unintentionally funny in <UNK> you must <UNK> <UNK> and be get a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that may give it smooth <UNK> instead of crying at meeting his father's ghost as any proper actor could bright fill lights in <UNK> <UNK> give us that impression br br <UNK> <UNK> is the only other actor of note in this hamlet putting in a good <UNK> at the queen despite the painfully obvious age differences he was <UNK> she was 26 the other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done given <UNK> tendency to want to keep the camera on him at all times br br sixty years later you feel the <UNK> of the shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a <UNK> flawed hamlet and instead elected to portray a sort of <UNK> <UNK> final analysis i would have such a fellow whipped for <UNK> doing <UNK> it out <UNK> <UNK> pray you avoid it
<START> i simply cannot believe the number of people comparing this <UNK> with the first film it moved me to leave this comment this is just an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of the first film the dialogue is appalling and nothing like as authentic or compelling as the original film br br the storyline is ridiculous the portrayal of the french police laughable and the characterisation of doyle a mile away from the first film br br how many drug bosses do you think go down to the <UNK> in person to see a <UNK> come in the ease at which doyle finds his guy is just pathetic like all the french police were just drinking coffee until doyle turns up from america and does some real police work what a joke try going to a foreign city and <UNK> the biggest <UNK> in the place with a travel map and some tourist <UNK> pathetic br br a truly awful sequel anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy
<START> this is a very cheaply made werewolf flick the video is dark and poorly lit the audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed the script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver <UNK> filled of course with silver bullets the acting is as wooden as the characters the fx are non existent lots of extreme close ups of werewolf jaws and biting the only thing that is shown is lots of soft core t a instead of dropping 30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf <UNK> dog soldiers with sean pertwee
<START> i'm all for a bad horror movie but this was just a pile of dog sh t how anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me if you like rushed editing to cover the special effects bad acting and a bad script then go for it there was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake i'll take hostel or wolf creek over this pile any day my partner gave up after about 20 minutes she knows a stinker when she sees one i on the other hand <UNK> sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got any better no such luck i haven't <UNK> his other movie <UNK> and i doubt if i'll bother now
<START> i have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films so that was not my problem with it my problem with it is that i felt like i was watching my next door <UNK> home movie imo everything about it just seemed like a guy wrote out a quick story grabbed a camera and started shooting i understand how hard this must be to do effectively but when i pay to rent a film i expect to feel like i am watching some type of <UNK> made movie br br john schneider has a huge resume is a great actor and was fine in this film the other people in it were not i understand how it must be fun and cheaper to use friends and relatives as the cast but it doesn't make for convincing acting it seemed like the way it was shot he was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look but when the writing plot and acting are there to begin with that type of style isn't necessary and it is a distraction br br also on a technical level it had digital <UNK> all over the place in the first scene of all of those fine cars when they did a slow <UNK> of them they appeared to jerk back and forth just a little bit the problem isn't in my viewing equipment <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but somewhere in the production i've never seen that kind of <UNK> in a <UNK> made film before then there was the sound it sounded like they didn't do any voice overs which may be o k unless it sounded like the track in this film it sounded like the built in <UNK> on the camera
<START> <UNK> ebert were terrific on this show whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict their separate professional opinions generated <UNK> took this show down a notch or two because he wasn't really a film critic and because he <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> now when ben <UNK> comes on i feel like i'm watching teen news you know that kids' news show <UNK> by kids for kids <UNK> is not much better it's obvious they've encountered only a steady <UNK> of mainstream films their entire lives the idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous if they are reviewing a non formula film they are completely lost show them something original and intelligent they just find it confusing wait i think i get it abc is owned by disney disney makes movies for kids while <UNK> ebert and <UNK> promoted independent films and were only hit or miss with the big budget studio productions what a surprise these two guys love the big studio schlock and only manage to tolerate a few <UNK> plus everyone knows the age group tv <UNK> are aiming for the blatant <UNK> is the <UNK> on the cake in what alternate universe do these guys qualify as film critics
<START> there is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something try to do something very different and end up being mediocre i was thinking about jordan playing baseball but the same applies to steve martin br br this movie is reasonably well acted and directed but the script is a stinker martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in <UNK> but this effort to bring a victorian drama to the contemporary scene <UNK> straight into a wall of <UNK> if you want to see an old story updated with some style best to rent great expectations
<START> the plot doesn't begin to describe the film a man is writing a film or rather this film it's totally self <UNK> to the point that you think it's going to <UNK> in on itself like a black hole the writer writes something and it happens or something happens and he writes about it br br it's very philosophical like waking life but more <UNK> oriented and for that matter much better in my opinion at one point there are person on the street interviews and then you see shots of these people being filmed and then you discover that their <UNK> are scripted when one keeps <UNK> her lines there is beautiful scenery and <UNK> <UNK> br br i hope it comes out on dvd so i can watch it again more carefully seen at <UNK> the san jose <UNK> film festival on 2 25 2002
<START> i am completely <UNK> as to why this film is even liked let alone held in such high regard especially by so many critics who are otherwise quite sensible br br there is one key word which describes this film to its core irritating br br the most easily explained example of this is the director's use or more accurately abuse of music in the first half a really dull <UNK> tune is played about three times when once is too often but in the second half the <UNK> and the <UNK> california <UNK> is played at least seven times usually at top volume <UNK> whether you liked the song or not beforehand you'd be thoroughly sick of it by the end just think some people claim to have seen this film four or five times this means they've listened to california <UNK> either 28 or 35 times br br all of this needless hyper <UNK> it contributes nothing to the story could possibly be <UNK> if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit or if the story was in any way involving br br but it ain't br br the only aspect i found likeable was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> around and still playing asia the <UNK> in a <UNK> and <UNK> even this wore off fairly quickly br br i'm sure this film's <UNK> high reputation will convince many poor <UNK> to go and see it br br i can only warn you if you've never seen a hk movie before don't start with this one br br if you feel compelled to watch it avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema the fast forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here br br you have been warned
<START> <UNK> <UNK> visits swift sure vengeance on the ruthless crime family that employed him as a hit man in the <UNK> <UNK> thriller big guns after they accidentally murder his wife and child <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a minute to pray a second to die and franco <UNK> of ring of death take this <UNK> about a career <UNK> for the mob right down to the wire indeed big guns is rather predictable but it still qualifies as solid entertainment with lots of savage and often sudden killings <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> is appropriately <UNK> as he <UNK> deals out death to the heads of the mob families who refused to let him <UNK> so that he could enjoy life with his young son and daughter richard <UNK> of the godfather plays a <UNK> crime boss who wants to bury the <UNK> with the <UNK> character but the rest of his hard <UNK> associates want the hit man dead like most crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s big guns <UNK> to the cinematic morality that crime does not pay interestingly the one man who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife and son of the hero survives while another betrays the hero with extreme prejudice <UNK> does not waste a second in this 90 minute <UNK> up apart from the mother and son dying in a car bomb meant for the father the worst thing that takes place occurs in an <UNK> salvage yard when an associate of the hero is crushed in a <UNK> car ostensibly big guns is a rather <UNK> outing but it does have a high body count for a 1973 mobster melodrama only at the last minute does our protagonist let his guard down and so the contrived morality of an eye for an eye remains intact <UNK> stages a couple of decent car chases and the death of a don in a train traveling through a train tunnel is as bloody as this violent yarn gets the photography and the compositions are excellent
<START> soylent green i found to be an excellent movie br br if you like <UNK> run you'll like this br br yes the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting can somewhat be best described as cheesy but the story is excellent br br the story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant br br at the end the mystery wasn't a mystery but the story <UNK> in an easy at the right pace br br it's nearest modern day equivalent would be dark angel in terms of how the us is shown to be third world country
<START> i am a big fan of old horror movies and since i am middle aged old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the <UNK> to 1960's period i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies with one exception being <UNK> 1 which i thought was great i could <UNK> about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal <UNK> and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending all the stories were great though so why did i like them so much the characters had some decent development the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad the horror bits were <UNK> with a close up of a face <UNK> with fear and the funny bits were really funny this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb com lol when george kennedy and an old dorothy <UNK> get top billing it's telling you something 4 of 10 also romero's expertise is hard to find here they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard i don't know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on it's shown on the <UNK> cable channel if your <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to see it
<START> let me start out by saying i will try not to put too many spoilers in this normally i enjoy robin williams movies however this gem was not one of them it was billed as a suspenseful thriller the night <UNK> was anything but to be blunt there were 6 people in the theater opening day 2 walked out for good reason the movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed the acting was alright but again there wasn't anything to work with the movie is about a <UNK> who reads a good book by a dying kid however insert spooky here no one can <UNK> the kids existence so williams goes to <UNK> to try and find the author however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys caretaker there thats it thats all you wait for about an hour and a half and movie ends it had as many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit the homosexual undertones or overtones had really nothing to do with the story and the movie had a little profanity but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and made little sense in conclusion i really can't write a decent review on this film because there was nothing to it it was as captivating as watching paint dry i gave it a 2 because the acting for what it was worth was alright and it wasn't directed by uwe boll
<START> absolutely stunning warmth for the head and the heart the kind of movie western movie makers are too rushed too frenetic to even attempt my kids watched it and they loved it too what real people goes to show you how cultural differences the japanese setting is less important than the human similarities go see it whether you like dancing or not
<START> the sitcom the league of gentlemen follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village <UNK> <UNK> the different scenes are linked together by their common setting br br in the first series a sketch show the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through <UNK> <UNK> consequently more <UNK> visit the small town but edward and <UNK> the owners of a local shop which is actually far away from the town do not like <UNK> whenever a visitor enters their shop they kill him in my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all for example when the couple <UNK> two <UNK> who want to build the new road edward drums while <UNK> is dancing half naked around the victims br br moreover pauline lives in <UNK> <UNK> she works at the local job centre although pauline hates the people she has to work with the woman does not want to loose her job so when an unemployed man gets an interview as <UNK> she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet br br then there is barbara <UNK> a <UNK> taxi driver who goes into great detail about her sexual <UNK> br br furthermore the vet mr <UNK> always kills animals instead of <UNK> them in one case he comes to a farm and is <UNK> into the sitting room where a dog lays in his basket the farmer goes outside on the <UNK> that the dog is the sick animal mr <UNK> <UNK> him a second later the farmer opens the door holding the real sick animal a sheep in his hand br br some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew his friend is killed by the shop owners by the way the couple is very <UNK> they have for example <UNK> in different colours each colour stands for one part of the body besides they have thousands of keys marked with different colours and precisely classified br br in my opinion the actors play very well by playing women the scenes become comical the costumes are suited to the actors too <UNK> is wearing a <UNK> and some crazy characters for example edward have <UNK> black teeth the show has a great deal of dark humour typical british the set design reflects the mood of the series the village and all the houses look grey and are <UNK> around the local shop there is often fog which <UNK> the threatening effect even the village sign is ominous welcome to <UNK> <UNK> you will never leave br br although i think that the actors do a great job this type of series is not my taste
<START> i don't see how anyone who even likes van <UNK> could like this movie br br the movie actually starts out with some promise i would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent the actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story however the film is all down hill from there br br it would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise that is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills one brother is supposed to be skilled in martial arts but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in <UNK> how convenient when the time <UNK> that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great <UNK> and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the <UNK> and high kicks br br the plot action etc are just plain ridiculous my favorite scenes how about when van <UNK> is confronting an armed soldier with an <UNK> <UNK> the soldier is about 100 <UNK> away instead of aiming and shooting at van <UNK> he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him van <UNK> proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him while he is still about 75 to 80 <UNK> away br br this movie has one of the most disappointing endings <UNK> <UNK> is a skilled martial artist however instead of <UNK> a decent fight <UNK> is throwing <UNK> at van <UNK> like <UNK> kong absolutely <UNK> movie that had so much promise if your a van <UNK> fan save your time and see hard target or one of his earlier films
<START> who were they kidding with this there was just too much in this film that was hard to <UNK> right from when <UNK> ajay <UNK> <UNK> wishes death on his father to when he arrives in london with his uncle played by <UNK> <UNK> only to abandon him minutes later the only problem with that theory is that anybody who has ever passed through london <UNK> knows that such a <UNK> would be impossible to pull off and especially not by an indian but the film problems do not end there there's the issue of the two main leads salman khan and ajay <UNK> passing as rock stars on the verge of achieving their dreams i mean yeah we saw success come to susan boyle a woman in the uk achieving her dreams after age 50 but that was a rare case it was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because i felt that the casting of salman and ajay was just ill conceived they would never cast <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to play the same roles so why should we be forced to watch ajay <UNK> and salman khan men well into their 40s <UNK> around desperately trying to hang on to their <UNK> let's not even talk about the most self conscious actress on screen today <UNK> this is her second film that i have seen and she is just hopeless as an actress so conscious of her looks that she only concerns herself with looking good and <UNK> for the camera rather than giving in a good acting performance it's just hard to believe that she turned down all those other movie roles to star in this fluff and then be so <UNK> as an actress nothing to write home about at all and to top all of that the film just <UNK> dragged on there's nothing special about it at all trust me you will predict every clichéd thing that is going to happen in it
<START> this series got me into <UNK> writing and the genre when i was younger and i love this presentation of the story i would however disagree with the above comment from what i have read in the past it is not <UNK> performance that lead <UNK> to refuse to have the series released but the <UNK> that all three books received in the translation to the screen a great example of this is the rewrite of the <UNK> crossing that ended <UNK> field career the scene is not in the book the character who dies in the <UNK> was never in any of the books and the crossing in <UNK> was from east germany to west germany not the polish frontier this whole storyline is cloth the changes in set similarly damage the integrity of the story my perspective on <UNK> performance was that he portrayed the <UNK> of <UNK> during his wife's <UNK> excellently and i believe <UNK> himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class <UNK> <UNK> both pays for his father's <UNK> and suffers due to its influence on his life as <UNK> comments had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department i think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything <UNK> is <UNK> when compared to the <UNK> of the book a physically impressive man capable of using his size to <UNK> a presence
<START> leave it to paul sex on the brain verhoeven to come up with a <UNK> sleazy and juvenile version of the invisible man story if he'd direct a pokemon film i'm sure he'd turn it into some massive orgy of sorts i don't mind sex or even sleaze check my other reviews on film but frankly it's obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn't see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky <UNK> it comes with it it's a shame because it could have been good if the film didn't spend so much time having an invisible kevin bacon <UNK> women br br the game cast of actors does what it can with the one note cheesy script but i felt bad for some of them including william <UNK> who is totally wasted here br br but then what could i have expected from the director of <UNK> which btw is much more entertaining than this stilted bad film
<START> the film had some likable aspects perhaps too many for my taste it felt as though the writer director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters not once a few times but all of the time br br this is the job of television not cinema br br the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed <UNK> <UNK> performance as the pregnant friend br br i felt as though <UNK> <UNK> performance was wan her reactions to things felt forced as though the director were trying to <UNK> the themes of the film through her <UNK> expressions i also can't believe that a director can make the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> into an unbelievable presence br br i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences this is a lazy device especially where the pop music comes from no place <UNK> to the film and or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest br br that said there is a <UNK> quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity <UNK> it with passion and hand crafted charm br br i am curious why the dialogue feels so <UNK> who knows if there's a god like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do or whatever the line was br br perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from <UNK> with a bunch of flowers to <UNK> to his wife i'm giving up smoking br br an anti smoking commercial a <UNK> ad with some <UNK> animation i had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark it was all too much
<START> warning mild spoilers br br the story of joseph smith stands out as an amazing even moving episode in american history and world religious history this movie portrays events in the life of joseph smith whom <UNK> <UNK> as the prophet of the <UNK> of the true church of jesus christ on the earth i've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing br br joseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers alvin <UNK> joseph who at a very young age needed an operation the operation done without our modern <UNK> was bloody and difficult the scene helped to show the <UNK> of the smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between joseph and his parents br br <UNK> religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what <UNK> call the first vision was interestingly portrayed the face of jesus is never shown but you see the <UNK> nail marks in his hands the <UNK> by religious leaders and many in his small new york community is <UNK> at least slightly by <UNK> marriage to emma br br this movie does not clearly map out the events of mormon church history but merely jumps from scene to scene this is not a critique simply a note about the style br br the practice of <UNK> and <UNK> is shown and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a <UNK> about the <UNK> love with a <UNK> face from having recently been attacked br br the movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of <UNK> as an <UNK> church while at the same time the ever <UNK> opposition that spread into the heights of local <UNK> br br the film shows many scenes from <UNK> life including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of <UNK> life including his fierce love for his wife his endless love for children his wit his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition his religious sentiments and his compassion br br as joseph and <UNK> ride to <UNK> never to return home alive most of the characters from throughout the movie whose lives had been touched by joseph are shown along the way helping to <UNK> what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful br br at the end the <UNK> of joseph and <UNK> is portrayed and <UNK> are left to <UNK> the events they just witnessed br br when i first watched the movie i assumed it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to non members i no longer think that is the case although i hope the movie can do just that as an <UNK> i find that the film is a celebration of joseph and excellently <UNK> the good things we already know about him i am curious to see how <UNK> will view the film whether they will simply see it as <UNK> an epic story of an american religious man or something else br br the film is beautifully shot family friendly moving and hopefully something good for everyone that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to <UNK> in light of the many aspects of our culture including freedom of religious expression and respect generally for the law we <UNK> take for granted
<START> viewers <UNK> over everything including the title sequence now that is funny would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle but trust me folks this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see and if you're not laughing at it five minutes in i'd say you've lost your sense of humor br br david niven plays a doomed and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an <UNK> female air traffic <UNK> in an emotional conversation about love just as he's <UNK> to his certain and fiery death isn't it romantic of course he's <UNK> by a <UNK> of <UNK> chance and <UNK> up on the beach just as this same air traffic <UNK> is riding by on her <UNK> they immediately <UNK> br br looking past the bizarre <UNK> erotic <UNK> so over the top you really need to refer to them as <UNK> from a naked boy sitting bare <UNK> in the sand playing the movie's twilight zone esquire theme on his little <UNK> to a <UNK> <UNK> so campy queen y his makeup is <UNK> on more thoroughly than the <UNK> the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love we get it fly boys like girls in <UNK> and heels and girls like 'em back and apparently all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on imdb br br as for the quality of the production the continuity editing is poor enough to <UNK> cringing and the lighting is perhaps even worse than that but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad there are games played with technicolor whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that and <UNK> so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually <UNK> and laughed when then the <UNK> motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck and freeze motion which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were <UNK> off camera br br the best shots are the early ones on the beach but after that it's all downhill the moving like an <UNK> is moving <UNK> is hardly the <UNK> steps to say the least and i'd really caution anyone from feeling like they'd have to see this lame attempt at movie making on their account the movie overall is bad enough to be funny and that's about the best thing i can say for it
<START> the wicker man has done the impossible it replaced cat woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind yes it's really that bad so bad that when sitting down to write this review i thought to myself if i had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot <UNK> shoved in my eyes i might actually go for the red hot <UNK> br br neil <UNK> created a rare movie where joel <UNK> could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind yeah that's some bad direction right there br br i think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line some sacrifices must be made sure it might sound sort of <UNK> ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment seriously the movie is about an island where men are just there for <UNK> and i would still rather with be stuck on <UNK> island with only pictures of <UNK> rice then find myself stranded there br br the most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the <UNK> fart i've ever heard in a movie theater that's not a joke nor is it fictional i've never been to a thriller and heard so much laughter through out the entire film i can't tell you with an <UNK> if the laughs were intentional in some effort to <UNK> the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this <UNK> would actual fly i honestly found myself <UNK> for a power <UNK> or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since <UNK> <UNK> and i <UNK> 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental <UNK> soon to be a law before all <UNK> cage films write to your <UNK> today don't <UNK> at one point i actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and anna <UNK> is going to show <UNK> how i wish br br <UNK> cage throws out so much ham per frame i'm thinking of having a <UNK> test done today to think that i ever thought sean penn was a d <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> acting oh he's still a d <UNK> just lesser of <UNK> sean <UNK> d <UNK> was <UNK> because of this film do us all a favor <UNK> play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and <UNK> you cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars his best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a <UNK> woman to steal her bear suit like the fart not a joke or a <UNK> moment during this review then proceeds to run amok like conan <UNK> <UNK> bear but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he's to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of burning man and <UNK> fair yes i just spoiled the ending for <UNK> if you knew any better you'd build <UNK> of me in worship and sing songs of my legend i sat through this crap fest so you don't have to br br about half way through this little <UNK> i kept thinking to myself jack bauer would have wrapped this case up in 20 minutes of real time ok 35 minutes if kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first even steve martin as inspector <UNK> could have figured this out in under an <UNK> you sir are no inspector <UNK> br br if for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet take the bullet br br somewhere uwe boll is laughing at us all
<START> this one acts as a satire during the women's rights movement era of course that doesn't mean coach the movie is a wonderful experience to behold it runs into the same vein as <UNK> which was better but still tame and is basically standard fare fluff what i mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> their way to sudden victory makes waste it's the same feeling you may get after watching this a nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a man's duty but i expected better things
<START> the <UNK> of two brilliant careers david lynch better known for less accessible material <UNK> a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely premise a man travels to see his estranged brother having no other means of <UNK> his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawn <UNK> richard farnsworth in his last film delivers a stunningly layered and nuanced performance in the starring role <UNK> beautiful in its <UNK> of small things straight story is a classic cinema experience that must not be missed sissy <UNK> is notable as <UNK> daughter an <UNK> middle aged woman living with the loss of her children
<START> this is one of the greatest love story movies i have ever seen yes i can agree that some parts may seem dated but this does not distract from the film one should try to observe criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time clearly by the sex in the city standards charlie chaplin was horribly boring however when judged from the <UNK> of <UNK> america he was fantastic likewise <UNK> is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed race love affair american <UNK> destiny arrogance and prejudice and the complexity of different cultures it is a natural next step to such films as <UNK> <UNK> its purpose however was not just social commentary rather it is entertaining and enjoyable with <UNK> lines that one just doesn't forget br br however even when taken only as a love story it is terrific although some attack <UNK> accent he is at his near best in nuance and characterization buttons and <UNK> who both won oscars and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film br br <UNK> the real star does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for brando while being torn by her sense of <UNK> and loyalty her speech when she first meets and speaks with brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema the dialog between <UNK> and brando in her dressing room in tokyo at the film's end is equally good of course it doesn't have the mouth sucking spit <UNK> and worse that <UNK> love in today's movies but that makes it all the better it portrays true love and passion and not just heat if this movie doesn't touch you then you are just too young too cynical or dead
<START> this is one of the most brilliant movies that i have seen in recent times goes way above even any international movie of any <UNK> i am really surprised why this has not received the recognition it deserved <UNK> <UNK> winning the national award is perhaps the only <UNK> fact <UNK> <UNK> simply <UNK> as she speaks volumes through her eyes there are a few scenes that stand out when <UNK> comes back from the city on <UNK> wedding she and <UNK> meet for the first time in many years <UNK> notices a change in <UNK> but not a single line of dialogue is said the entire gamut of emotions is conveyed through subtle mannerisms and the eyes there's another towards the end when <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to marry <UNK> instead if you are not moved by that scene you don't have a heart br br watch this movie for sheer movie making brilliance and acting <UNK>
<START> i just viewed <UNK> last night and i liked what i saw it was a cool fun movie dolph looked superbly cool on the bike he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies he is now in a pretty good shape the story was ok and the other actors were also passable i wouldn't call this movie his best but its still a good movie br br but it also had its share of problems the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target they should've had shown the <UNK> escaping the bullets in a better way another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the <UNK> the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers there should've been more bad guys last problem was <UNK> the fact that the set looked cheesy but that was due to the small budget overall the movie was a good movie i enjoyed it i would recommend others to watch it p s now u r a dead beat cop some one liners were also cool br br
<START> i wouldn't dare say this film is better than the original but it is very good in it's own right the comedy in this film is just as good as the original though there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them br br the story in this film is even more bizarre than the original but that's what makes it so great peter <UNK> does a great job directing this film with a great cast the core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles i don't care what anyone says i think keanu reeves is a great actor i really enjoyed his portrayal of ted in both of these films as i did alex <UNK> bill i was very happy to see george <UNK> returning to the role of <UNK> very cool hal london jr who plays the part of ted <UNK> father does a really good job the scene where ted possesses his fathers body and hal london jr begins acting like ted is a great scene and he pulls it off <UNK> well i can't forget to mention william <UNK> as death he completely made the movie for me the rest of the cast is quite good as well br br if you liked the first installment of the bill and ted series then i would hope you would like this film as well but don't expect it to be as good as the original i really hope you enjoy the film thanks for reading br br chris
<START> the plot of <UNK> was decent but one actor in particular ruined the entire film justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he <UNK> during the movie he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire f r a t squad br br whether it was an emotional scene an action scene or even a silent scene justin timberlake managed to ruin it br br do not waste your time watching this film don't even bother <UNK> it midget porn would be a much better choice br br and justin if you're reading this stick to music even though you're no good at that you've done a wonderful job <UNK> people into thinking you can actually sing
<START> let me start out by saying i'm a big carrey fan although i'll admit i haven't seen all of his movies <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> bruce almighty was enjoyable none of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end i dont know what the writers were thinking somehow i couldn't help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re creating liar liar br br on a positive note the daily show's steve <UNK> is hilarious and so is the rest of the cast see bruce almighty if you're a big jim carrey fan or if you just want to see a light hearted <UNK> soft piano music somewhat funny comedy
<START> director edward <UNK> does in a little more than one hour what other more expensive and hyped films fail to do mr <UNK> shows us a police story written by phillip h <UNK> jr that while is not one of the best of the genre it keeps the viewer involved in all that's going on br br this is clearly a b type movie in fact the best thing going for the <UNK> stranger is the opportunity to take a <UNK> at the way new york looked in those years the crystal clear cinematography by william o <UNK> either has been kept that way through the years or has been lovingly restored br br there are great views of new york in the opening sequence later we are taken to brooklyn to the <UNK> section and later on the film travels to the <UNK> and the gun hill road area with its many <UNK> stores in the area br br john miles and walter <UNK> made a great detective team patricia barry is perfect as the plant expert from the museum of natural history jack lord who went to bigger things in his career is seen in a non speaking role br br it was great fun to watch a city as it was because it doesn't exist any more
<START> this movie was bad beyond belief i saw it during the 2004 san francisco film festival before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before which happened to be its world premiere i don't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point we all understood by the end br br its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie <UNK> in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie <UNK> movies the movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least a scene would start going then someone would say wow you're so great bettie why don't we make another movie this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a bettie <UNK> remake which was almost as ridiculous as and even more boring than the normal part of the movie by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie <UNK> movie remake came up it was that ludicrous i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre but people were not laughing with the movie maker they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or <UNK> br br i know movies are expensive i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen the movie looks like it was made for 12 the cuts the <UNK> and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience this movie makes dude where's my car look like citizen kane br br my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good apparently the previous night the night of the world premiere the director writer producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie bettie <UNK> movies were destroyed they should destroy this movie too
<START> an album of songs so old everyone thinks they're new this film has the <UNK> combination of pace and mood that set some films apart from the opening moments and why not <UNK> talent from dame <UNK> <UNK> as a widow who plays <UNK> with a street musician to help him get the songs right to olympia dukakis as the merry widow living in a scottish castle on the <UNK> of her many <UNK> to ian <UNK> as the drummer who loved all the members of a world war ii all girl more or less swing band but wait there's more add in leslie caron on bass and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on lead vocal at last and the blonde <UNK> are the <UNK> band in england since the beatles well ok not really but this movie is a winner br br elizabeth <UNK> spends the whole film trying to reunite the blonde <UNK> to play at her <UNK> school dance and before you roll your eyes imagine how difficult and courageous it would be for a bunch of <UNK> women to step <UNK> in front of the britney spears generation following an act called open wound br br in an age when actresses careers are over by the time they're 30 most <UNK> second album is a greatest hits <UNK> and music more than a month old has almost no chance of <UNK> it's great to see real talent real music and a really good movie come from where else the bbc br br i love this movie and i know i'll watch it many more times and enjoy it more each time
<START> and i actually gave it a zero on my personal 1 10 scale i have been attending movies since <UNK> and have seen well over 1000 in the theater i don't rate movies that i see only on tv this is the only movie i have ever rated zero br br my wife and i took our four children then aged 15 11 8 and 6 and even the kids thought it was terrible in fact it was my daughter now 26 who <UNK> me to this site amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of 4 br br the animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time and is even worse in retrospect the acting particularly by sean young is atrocious and the story line is simply silly br br
<START> this wretched movie shows that not even some of <UNK> best can salvage a true <UNK> <UNK> br br i could spend much time describing everything that was bad about this effort but that would require more time and i've already wasted <UNK> minutes watching it br br looking at it now after <UNK> death shows how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors had become br br donald sutherland why br br i have to fill more lines to get this accepted i have to fill more lines to get this accepted i have to fill more lines to get this accepted br br don't waste your time with this movie i'm <UNK> to do something interesting bye
<START> you can give <UNK> and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget but the movie is still sub par dont get me wrong <UNK> the series is by far the best tv series ever but if i was an <UNK> seeing this movie i <UNK> have ordered the series i dont like <UNK> as an actor the costumes are silly and there are tons of cliches the same can be said for most of the first season with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> and survivors bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle if you are a <UNK> fan and <UNK> seen this movie see it if you <UNK> a <UNK> fan dont you wont want to watch the series
<START> most people especially young people may not understand this film it looks like a story of loss when it is actually a story about being alone some people may never feel loneliness at this level br br <UNK> character johnson reflected the total opposite of <UNK> character <UNK> where johnson felt trapped by his <UNK> <UNK> was trying to forget his life in the same perspective <UNK> is a wonderful <UNK> to the cast and sandler pulls tears cheadle had the comic role and was a great <UNK> for sandler br br i see oscars somewhere here a very fine film if you have ever lost and felt alone this film will assure you that you're not alone br br jerry
<START> it's hard to believe people actually like this dreck i do think kids can enjoy it but to me it's the kind of kid film parents can't bear to sit through predictable plot boring belushi and possibly the worst kid actor of all time i will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid but she was truly painful to watch i feel embarrassed for her now having people know it was her when she sang the star <UNK> <UNK> i had to turn the sound off then i came here and discovered they did that because she won star search i've always felt jim belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful sadly missed brother and this crap shows why zero stars
<START> i'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private however pushing daisies is my exception i became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show i was skeptical about it at first especially after the finale of six feet under was still in my head here we go again i thought i watched the first second third and all the other episodes wow first of all i thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was <UNK> without being morbid the characters were engaging and i like the thought of ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life chuck without the consequences of her dying br br most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have besides ned and chuck <UNK> <UNK> for ned lily and vivian <UNK> for their niece chuck and <UNK> is always longing for the <UNK> <UNK> from the mysterious deaths they solve i think the characters are picture perfect and believable i like how <UNK> who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an african american i like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him br br all in all this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that i've seen out of the 2007 season i think the show has enough romance for the <UNK> and enough who done it for the mystery buffs i just wish the writers would get back to work so that the show can continue to <UNK>
<START> yep the topic is a straight quote from the movie and i think it's pretty accurate i was so bored to dead with this pointless effort all the flashes etc making no sense after first 20 minutes is just bad film making if you are <UNK> you would have died at least five times already of course all the david lynch fans would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be the best film ever made because it doesn't make any sense and when it doesn't make any sense it's got to be art and art movie is always good right i say wrong this kind of artificial art grab is just a pathetic way to try to show that you're a good film maker anthony hopkins as a excellent actor should just stay acting
<START> excellent episode movie ala pulp fiction 7 days 7 <UNK> it <UNK> get more depressing than this movie rating 8 10 music rating 10 10
<START> given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its <UNK> <UNK> minutes including end credits so roughly <UNK> minutes of actual film but what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed br br the gags are quick and sometimes not even funny the only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the <UNK> basketball spots james <UNK> portrayal of max van <UNK> character in the exorcist and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film very unfunny was the take off of charlie's angels which like the first scary movie and the matrix spin off scene basically <UNK> the scene without much humor <UNK> into it br br today's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70's such as the exorcist and maybe of the <UNK> <UNK> et al br br hopefully scary movie 3 will take some time to put together making the spoofs more enjoyable br br one thing though the film features more than the last one of promising young actress anna <UNK> whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel just for her casting and acting ability i give this movie a 3 out of 10
<START> i totally agree that nothing is a fantastic film i've not laughed so much when watching a film for ages and david <UNK> and andrew miller are fantastic in this they really work well together this film may not appeal to some people i can't really say why without spoiling it but each to their own i loved it and highly recommend it br br the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it br br although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch
<START> i watched the presentation of this on <UNK> in the u s when it originally aired in 1988 assuming the miniseries was available on dvd i purchased first <UNK> of all three books last year since then i have been searching for the series on internet movie sites today i found this web site i will give up the search br br i too would like to buy this complete 26 episodes miniseries after buying the dvds i would read each book then watch the episodes for that book that is what i did with john <UNK> <UNK> trilogy and larry <UNK> texas ranger trilogy br br does anyone have any <UNK> for great books or book series that became very good tv miniseries or movie series that are now available on dvd
<START> this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who aren't really <UNK> movie <UNK> don't get me wrong there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it you know you're either a <UNK> or don't really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with <UNK> and i thought there was a lot more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults <UNK> nice to find a good movie that's not filled with sexual references and drug <UNK> a great film not to be overlooked based on public <UNK> this one is a must buy
<START> had to see this <UNK> it looked like a great scary premise prisoners finding magic book <UNK> <UNK> claustrophobic terror ensues etc br br but there didn't seem to be a story to go along with the great idea rather than chilling <UNK> horror it relied on effects out in the open fire and <UNK> body horror which didn't scare at all if your over 12 br br the logic at the end is ridiculous with characters being killed off for nothing other than <UNK> waste of good characters which were the best thing about this film br br obviously low budget which doesn't spoil it the film really goes nowhere and <UNK> believe im going to say this it needs a hollywood remake you simply loose interest in this version definitely not in the same league as other french films coming out in the last few years like <UNK> rivers which were at least watchable entertaining <UNK> isn't watchable to the end to be honest and i bet you can guess the ending before you have watched the film really really disappointing impossible to recommend
<START> this is a run of the mill nature porn movie by porn i don't mean sex i mean gratuitous images of for example thousands of birds together or hundreds of <UNK> or a giant <UNK> or iceberg several of the shots in the film seem to exist solely to make their way into the trailer to get people into theatres to see it for all of ten seconds before it disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the film br br there is almost no plot in this film told to expect a story of three animal families better than march of the <UNK> the movie simply doesn't deliver the blame rests in three key areas 1 the writers who gave james earl jones some of the worst lines to <UNK> in nature film history 2 the music team who over <UNK> everything to tell you what you should be feeling even when the film fails to <UNK> and lastly but most importantly 3 the <UNK> who had the story jump from place to place with no rhyme or reason no continuity no flow sucking the life out of the entire film a film about life when we got to the <UNK> halfway through the film i sunk back in my seat with dread hoping against hope that the film was more than halfway through and that i'd be able to survive the long <UNK> test along with the animals on screen br br there was also almost no science in the film at all they attributed hot and cold all of it not just the seasons solely to the <UNK> <UNK> ignoring the fact that we'd have even greater extremes from location to location if there was no <UNK> because the <UNK> would never warm and it would be worst if we had no <UNK> relative to revolution like <UNK> because half the planet would <UNK> and the other half would freeze then near the end they used the phrase humans and animals as if humans are not animals somehow <UNK> from the laws of nature so much for science br br i must credit the camera work however and again that is why i call this nature porn everything from super slow motion to what appears to be a finely tuned <UNK> controlled time <UNK> photography was put to use to provide some and i caution only some stunning moments that do raise the bar compared to other nature films that said i am not convinced that it was all nature on the screen some of the shots showing the great <UNK> hole in africa as it changed from season to season seemed like cgi to me a director might have expected such suspicion and built in other shots to demonstrate that it's all natural but they didn't do that br br for a film about earth i had expected a lot more of earth to be shown what we saw was <UNK> we had to take the <UNK> word for it that some species are at risk due to climate changes they didn't show us evidence of it they didn't show us <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> visible from space they didn't show us the great pacific trash <UNK> they didn't show us a <UNK> picture of human light <UNK> around the planet these are as much earth as anything else why cover it up for a feel good <UNK> br br my last criticism of the content is of <UNK> any time a predator was shown on the screen actually hunting prey the music turned almost into that <UNK> doom scene from lord of the rings with the predator portrayed as some kind of <UNK> ultimate evil character but <UNK> aren't evil they perform a necessary service <UNK> that the best members of the prey species survive we are <UNK> ourselves any time the predator caught the prey we immediately cut away to something else to sort of pretend that death and eating don't really happen the final insult was the dad polar bear being left to die after he <UNK> to try to eat bad bear bad you can almost hear them say br br on to the presentation itself my theatre may be in part to blame for this but maybe not i had expected to see something with greater clarity than i could see on my own <UNK> <UNK> at home but the picture was <UNK> and was presented in the same 16 9 ratio i could get at home instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days and during one action packed scene near the end the film i can't imagine this happening <UNK> from how it looked was damaged and we lost several of the colors eventually <UNK> out completely that repeated about three times br br if they actually do plant a tree on my behalf it will have been worth it but how will i know
<START> and how it made it into production <UNK> me the main character is an obnoxious show off who isn't the least bit funny i can't stand the character at all he's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show br br this is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years no joke the story lines are both poorly written and executed the jokes are as bad as the ones on disney's sweet life of <UNK> and cody i could not dislike this show more it's terrible and should be canceled even the theme song is bad the title even worse br br it's as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think they're hot stuff when they're really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor br br johnny test go away far and fast
<START> i saw this pilot when it was first shown and i'm sure countless spirit fans hate it because like batman the green <UNK> etc it took the character in the direction of camp but i evidently never got enough of batman because i thought it was entertaining in some of the same ways as that show there are two parts that stay with me first when <UNK> partner has been <UNK> wounded and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law and <UNK> the exact letter of it then he says something like boy was i stupid which is his way of telling <UNK> to become a vigilante instead which he does though the tv batman kind then there's the scene where he tries to seduce the <UNK> into letting him go by kissing her but she isn't fooled because he's too honest to kiss her convincingly this was a great example of camp that was also <UNK> by both the actor and actress
<START> thieves and <UNK> presents us with a very <UNK> depiction of the levels of corruption that affect many puerto <UNK> and force them to make difficult if not impossible choices about their and their loved <UNK> lives the cast is excellent considering that some are non professional actors an excellent choice that <UNK> the level of reality in the film the photography <UNK> the story without <UNK> as it should be in this type of film the script captures the <UNK> and attitudes of the <UNK> in a very deep way sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary watching this film you feel as if you've secretly entered the real puerto <UNK> society and stand <UNK> watching it <UNK> i loved it
<START> may contain spoilers may contain spoilers br br in the age of shrek the movie pixar the studio this is a much more traditional animation film it put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together not to mentioned try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father they begin as enemies and end as best friend if this sound like a disney film it is only made through 20th century fox the trailer to the movie was one of the best i've seen in ages but the movie doesn't live to the expectation the trailer set the problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film yes there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children the parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min their children's attention is focused on something else than them the backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film children will love this film adults will only like it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has everything we can expect from a straight to video movie it's the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star the only thing he needs is to get her on stage surrounded by cameras and <UNK> a simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail the problem with the movie is not the basic plot but how it is made everything is supposed to be funny but it isn't it is trivial and clumsy the characters are shallow and the end sequence is totally without climax or emotion the last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing but only at how pathetic the whole set up is
<START> this movie looked like it was going to be really funny i was very excited to see it but was very disappointed it was very unrealistic the plot was also pretty weak i was expecting it to be really funny but the jokes weren't even that good i was also really disappointed with the ending i would not recommend this movie to anyone
<START> the film begins with people on earth discovering that their rocket to mars had not been lost but was just <UNK> out in space near out planet when it's <UNK> one of the crew members is ill one is alive and the other two are missing what happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member br br while on mars the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug eyed monsters oddly while the sets were pretty good the monsters were among the <UNK> i have seen on film plus in an odd attempt at realism the production used a process called <UNK> unfortunately this wonderful <UNK> just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of mars and the intensity of the <UNK> practically made my eyes bleed it was that bad despite all the cheese the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel for lovers of the genre it's well worth seeing for others you may just find the whole thing rather silly see for yourself and decide br br while by today's standards this isn't an especially good sci fi film compared with the films being made at the time it <UNK> up pretty well br br ps when you watch the film pay careful attention to dr <UNK> he looks like the spitting image of dr quest from the <UNK> quest cartoon plus he sounds and acts a lot like him too
<START> i have always liked spike lee's movies but this one was a total waste of 2 1 2 hours i expected more about son of sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the 1977 serial killings the talking dog was laughable you know you're in trouble when all the movie <UNK> burst into laughter <UNK> the whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting the sex scenes were totally <UNK> to the plot i'm not opposed to sex in movies but it should have some point unless it's a <UNK> movie all in all we were very disappointed at this spike lee effort
<START> for a mature man to admit that he shed a tear over this film is a mature response to a mature film br br if one need admit more then perhaps one could say that life can never be the same after viewing such <UNK> for it has moved us to the next level br br
<START> i <UNK> up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a <UNK> texas day but was pleasantly surprised after suffering through saturday night <UNK> i had no desire to see a re make in some south texas <UNK> and i didn't john <UNK> was good as the jealous redneck scott glenn was well cast as a <UNK> ex con and debra <UNK> was as always a delight love that woman plus the soundtrack was dynamite and this comes from a guy that can't stand the sound of country music a fun film all the way
<START> <UNK> 3000 should do this movie it is the worst acted movie i have ever seen first of all you find out that the <UNK> has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job also the head of security for the <UNK> would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a <UNK> if the president was shot this movie sucked i cannot express the <UNK> that this movie was every single actor was terrible even the chick at the trailer park i crap on this garbage what a waste of time
<START> by rights there should never have been a first blood part ii the original script for first blood had john rambo committing suicide at the end of the film but this was changed to allow him to live not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing nevertheless someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties plus the recently released fourth <UNK> br br the official title of this film was rambo first blood part ii but it is more <UNK> known simply as rambo it starts with the title character in jail where he is presumably <UNK> the crimes he committed in first blood although this is never made too explicit he is removed from prison by his former commanding officer colonel <UNK> for a secret mission rambo is to return to vietnam to investigate reports that american <UNK> are still being held captive by the communist regime he is under strict <UNK> not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy his is to be simply a fact finding mission br br what rambo does not realise is that he is being set up not by <UNK> who is portrayed as brave <UNK> and <UNK> but by the <UNK> of the mission a military <UNK> named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that the mission will prove that there are no american prisoners in vietnam partly because that will improve relationships between the american and <UNK> <UNK> partly because it will make his own life easier unfortunately for <UNK> rambo discovers that not only are americans still being held prisoner they are also being kept in <UNK> conditions of course he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate and tries to rescue them the rest of the film is more or less one long battle between rambo and a few allies including a beautiful <UNK> girl and the evil <UNK> soldiers and their russian allies most of the evil <UNK> of course end up dead although i was surprised to learn from your trivia section that the total death <UNK> was as low as <UNK> at times it seemed as though rambo was trying to wipe out the entire <UNK> army br br the tone of this film is very different from the first in first blood rambo was <UNK> a criminal even though his responsibility for his crimes was <UNK> by severe <UNK> and by his mental <UNK> in rambo he is a <UNK> <UNK> all american hero a few years earlier the director george pan <UNK> had made the <UNK> crossing a biased piece of left wing anti american propaganda <UNK> however was nothing if not versatile and rambo proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right wing pro american propaganda the one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad br br first blood had its faults but it also had its virtues its stance that the anti war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by vietnam vets in <UNK> to <UNK> life was a controversial one but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war social attitudes to war and the roots of violence in society rambo by contrast has very few virtues except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing it is essentially a sort of <UNK> revenge fantasy for those americans who were still sore about the vietnam war rambo re fights the war single handed and this time the right side wins take that charlie <UNK> br br by this point no doubt the film's <UNK> and there seem to be plenty more than 2 000 voters have already given it ten stars will have <UNK> that i am a liberal <UNK> loving <UNK> far from it in fact i have always <UNK> communism as a <UNK> ideology what i dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems including <UNK> <UNK> is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible it makes no attempt to understand the political <UNK> of south east asia or why not everyone in the region was pro american for all its anti communism the film is the sort of moronic <UNK> propaganda that the <UNK> were very good at <UNK> out themselves except that they attributed all the world's problems to capitalism or <UNK> or <UNK> or whatever other <UNK> they had taken a dislike to compared to rambo the green <UNK> was a <UNK> piece of political analysis 3 10
<START> i cannot say that <UNK> is the worst bollywood film ever made because i haven't seen every bollywood film but my imagination tells me that it could well be br br this film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director and i for one be believe he has been successful in his mission no a list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the <UNK> this film is bound to carry with it br br but lets not just blame the director here there is the cinematographer who looks like he's <UNK> for the amateur home movie maker of the year award there is the over dramatic score that hopes to carry you to the next scene the lighting man who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light <UNK> on pole in the other and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene and of course the actors some of them are by no means <UNK> else all could be forgiven here the ensemble of actors in <UNK> were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re make of <UNK> most loved movie of all time <UNK> one must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film they are a list and willing participants to something that let's face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation so it begs the question amitabh aside for now did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original did amitabh bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this <UNK> abomination of a film don't be stupid of course he didn't this was a <UNK> to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walk br br i truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film which only succeeds in <UNK> everyone's mind when they watch the original
<START> i am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film which i first saw soon after it was first released in the early fifties has had such a poor reception more recently in my opinion it has been greatly underrated but perhaps it appeals more to the european sense of humour than to for example the american maybe we in europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more since we are closer to some of them in real life particular mention should be made of the limited but good music especially the catchy and memorable song it's a fine fine night which was <UNK> <UNK> on an <UNK> <UNK> record 10 inch <UNK> label i think in the fifties i would urge anyone interested to give it a try if you get the chance you may have a pleasant surprise
<START> i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched it this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format br br holy <UNK> how i wish those days would come again i tried putting a bubble window on the side of my car <UNK> <UNK> 1984 but the <UNK> formed <UNK> <UNK> didn't quite cut it also in my <UNK> sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water bed as is brilliantly depicted in 'the <UNK> br br 'the <UNK> is of the <UNK> side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn if you watch some scenes <UNK> br br i highly <UNK> that sam <UNK> the director has achieved his <UNK> br br ratings john 1 2 sam
<START> director paul verhoeven's american vehicles are of varied quality but most of the films he made in his native country are <UNK> <UNK> this is the story of alcoholic and <UNK> sexual writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman but the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman's handsome male lover in the meantime the writer is plagued with strange visions at first they look like hallucinations <UNK> by alcohol abuse but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of <UNK> fascinating <UNK> thriller very original and provocative i love films that make you think they are about something but then you realize they are about something completely different this is one of those movies a thriller during the first half and a quasi religious <UNK> saga during the second half very erotic original and <UNK> not for kids or people that go to church every sunday great cinematography by future director jan de <UNK> highly <UNK>
<START> if you haven't seen this you do not know what you are missing the first time you do you will <UNK> be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard and having probably wet yourself as well br br it is that funny there hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that i have seen that tops this or even comes close so many classic one liners stories and <UNK> br br the drunken uncle at the <UNK> <UNK> joe mr t <UNK> goo goo ice cream man you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and i'll bet you dollars to <UNK> they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter or <UNK> the rest of the dialogue from the act br br pure classic shame you can't get it on dvd br br rating 10 out of 10
<START> not that all disney films are garbage br br anyway i saw legend of <UNK> creek first and absolutely loved the film when i heard it had 2 sequels i was <UNK> i finally found a copy of this and watched it one night i don't see how they can make a g rated sequel to a horror film the original is a movie documentary about the <UNK> monster and can scare anyone return is for kids and should not be watched by anyone i don't remember the plot too well as it's been quite some time since i watched it and i will not watch it again but it's about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill bigfoot three little kids <UNK> out of the house to stop them a big <UNK> comes through the hunters get hurt are saved by the kids then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of <UNK> on top and try to wait out the storm then all of a sudden bigfoot comes and does something really sick i don't wanna ruin the ending for any of <UNK> but it's not scary well
<START> this film was in one word amazing i have only seen it twice and have been hunting it everywhere a beautiful ensemble of older screen gems who still have that energy judy <UNK> ability to carry the whole film was amazing her subtle chemistry with the knight in stolen <UNK> was great
<START> now admittedly i'm no <UNK> student of the genre as a matter of fact i've tended always to shy away from westerns because in spite of all their critical <UNK> as america's primal stories or whatever they seem to me to forever <UNK> into tiresome <UNK> of either shoot up the <UNK> the big <UNK> or hey let's form a <UNK> in other words it always seemed to me a genre so <UNK> in and tied to convention that it left precious little room for surprise or originality and yes i have seen at least some of the so called <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> them into this negative <UNK> including <UNK> <UNK> bravo my darling <UNK> and of course the infamous but profoundly dull clint eastwood sergio <UNK> <UNK> in the '60s br br but when i saw this movie on tv as part of a <UNK> jimmy stewart weekend upon his death i finally got it i understood at least in theory what the western <UNK> has to offer as a serious <UNK> <UNK> aside from just action and thrills it is the push pull between <UNK> and order the american west represented freedom but also the <UNK> of the wild the <UNK> respectable folk could get hurt out there which of course meant that perhaps just perhaps it wasn't meant for respectable folk and that the only residents should be the amoral and the <UNK> those who <UNK> justice strictly from the barrel of their <UNK> and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land in such an environment of course the true heroes are the ones who are <UNK> and free spirited enough to be out there in the first place and so reject society at least as it <UNK> itself on the eastern <UNK> and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just is not right catching and <UNK> that <UNK> between law and disorder in the main character himself is i believe after seeing this movie the highest and <UNK> goal of any western sadly it is so often not the case as the white hats are completely white the black ones completely black and let's not even get started talking about the indians ok and there is precious little shades of gray in between br br not in this one jimmy stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of <UNK> before him into the <UNK> wilderness to <UNK> for gold he is joined in this by his <UNK> buddy played by walter brennan perhaps the western cliché character to end them all but nevertheless enjoyable here as always and no one else <UNK> they are out for themselves and while stewart displays his <UNK> charm come on we could never really dislike the guy now could we we are left with little doubt that his is basically a self centered self interested character none of his gosh or oh <UNK> gee <UNK> is allowed to come through or rather it has to be earned by the end of the picture in the way i described above he must confront the <UNK> in himself and <UNK> it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the <UNK> starting point on their gold dust trail this town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff mr gannon played by john mcintire in one of the best bad guy performances i've ever seen he comes on with so much charm and humor and has such a relaxed and interesting <UNK> with stewart that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he is the bad guy so that when it finally sinks in it does so with double force further by establishing a type of <UNK> if necessarily <UNK> <UNK> between mcintire and stewart the film plays up the notion of how close in <UNK> they really are and so how far a moral distance stewart must walk by the end of the film br br i won't go through all the twists and turns the plot takes see those for yourself as well as the rugged and gorgeous <UNK> scenery filmed on location mind you not cheap painted stills that the studio made up what's key here is how much this story focuses upon character with great dialogue and character interaction <UNK> for <UNK> much of the time although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static read talky definitely one of the greatest performances i've seen from stewart showing he could play the <UNK> the man's man just as convincingly as the decent and <UNK> guy next door if anything in fact his <UNK> qualities lend greater strength to his characterization making him seem less <UNK> or overblown like say eastwood or john wayne and more a three dimensional <UNK> his relationship with brennan is well played understated but nevertheless touching with a faint suggestion of george and <UNK> from of mice and men an altogether different type of western br br i certainly have more westerns to see but this is for now my favorite and the <UNK> by which i will necessarily judge all the others it deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is
<START> despite what the title may imply pigs is pigs does not star <UNK> pig rather it features a young <UNK> with an <UNK> more <UNK> than john <UNK> character in animal house his mother repeatedly <UNK> him but it does no good so much so that he goes to another house where a deranged scientist force <UNK> him more than any mere mortal can handle but there's a surprise at the end br br i would mostly say that this cartoon seemed like a place <UNK> in between the really great cartoons <UNK> duck <UNK> three months after this came out but make no mistake about it they do some neat things here the whole force feeding sequence looks more relevant today given the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> our country br br anyway not the greatest cartoon but worth seeing
<START> what is wrong with you people if you weren't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are <UNK> screwed in the head of course the film isn't a masterpiece i don't think it was aiming to be it was fun and funny i never watched the show when i was younger i only recently saw one episode and when i watched the movie i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere the movie seats were practically shaking and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in <UNK> <UNK> and jessica simpson is plain hot i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences all in all i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd people enjoy it for what it is
<START> i saw this movie at the theaters when i was about 6 or 7 years old i loved it then and have recently come to own a vhs version br br my 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it br br i have enjoyed watching it again too though i have to admit it is not as good on a little tv br br i do not have older children so i do not know what they would think of it br br the songs are very cute my daughter keeps singing them over and over br br hope this helps
<START> john <UNK> life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been <UNK> dead after a <UNK> accident that involved changing a <UNK> on her car during the days she has been missing he confronts a man that's been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other side through e v p electronic voice phenomenon naturally he doesn't believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about e v p soon enough john is hooked onto it but something supernatural doesn't like him <UNK> with the dead as now other then <UNK> his wife the white noise is <UNK> events before they happen br br since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now i thought i better get around to watching it since it wasn't my copy but then again i don't think the owners were in a hurry to get it back as they haven't question me about it oh well so i decided to give it a play as i was in an <UNK> mood after hearing and reading all the bad press on it i wasn't expecting anything remotely good but i was kept entertained for 90 minutes well more so the 60 minutes as the last half an hour was pretty much a <UNK> of confusion the film is nowhere as good as it could have been but the time <UNK> by quick enough even though it's a rather tepid supernatural thriller i thought it wasn't all a waste the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and there's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle <UNK> and tragedy that <UNK> you but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film that's when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesn't fit in with the context it becomes rather <UNK> loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and <UNK> camera work that gets to close into the action i couldn't understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey it's a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big but hits rock bottom i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and <UNK> camera work other then the <UNK> stark lighting the score kept this flick <UNK> gloomy all of it is very <UNK> done with its <UNK> up and fancy <UNK> which makes it come across as very <UNK> and empty br br you can easily see that the film's heart is in the technical <UNK> and not in <UNK> the characters and story there's just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material after a while it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood <UNK> stuff from beyond the grave it just got rather <UNK> watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while the e v p machine was the star on the show well it did have more impact than the limp performances michael keaton is more than capable actor but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers he really deserves much better though everyone else is pretty <UNK> and forgettable not because of the performances but of the lack of depth in their characters this <UNK> wasn't bad to begin with but it does go <UNK> shape by falling away drastically br br i wouldn't care to see it again and i wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horror thrillers it's just a damn shame that this over produced flick couldn't put it together successfully as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand i didn't hate it but what a disappointment
<START> i was one of the few non <UNK> who showed up to see <UNK> video it was quite an experience in propaganda film making and boredom br br i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moore's visit to my local school <UNK> but it turned out to be another liberal slash and burn effort to slam <UNK> and the local religious community it sure seems self serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his <UNK> on issues br br what's more surprising is to see all the <UNK> votes his <UNK> have posted here did they even see the video <UNK> gee batman this must rank with all the <UNK> men their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film br br yeah like <UNK> the votes at imdb will help a lame movie maybe my vote will help balance this out
<START> this movie is a very realistic view of a police squad in a small german town as seen through the eyes of a woman <UNK> she brings her way of dealing with the law which means more than simple <UNK> the strong performance of the main character supported by good dialogues makes this flick very enjoyable
<START> all i can say is before watching the movie i did not have a hint indication who <UNK> <UNK> was or what was her life story and i have to confess that the movie was hardly a help to reach these data and even it was not successful to <UNK> me to do some research by <UNK> few words on <UNK> website however all i can say is that the actress <UNK> <UNK> was great with her mute facial expression she really played well and showed a deep depression mental status as it is in real br br after all based on the script the movie has happened in turkey and <UNK> as well as afghanistan but believe me i am familiar with the area it was all about an <UNK> desert in <UNK> turkish people and <UNK> people are completely different in face and culture as well as in language which is not <UNK> br br i suppose for making a film like this documentary type a <UNK> research about all these minor elements is mandatory
<START> a true story about a true revolution 25 of april a revolution against a <UNK> regime of <UNK> years that was <UNK> a colonial war on it's <UNK> for maintaining an empire <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> s <UNK> e <UNK> the first and the last of the great colonial <UNK> of europe of <UNK> years since it's beginning in the conquest of <UNK> in <UNK> a revolution by the army for the people and for a <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> surprising fact in this revolution is that it were no people killed in it except those that died in the <UNK> of <UNK> the political police of the state during a brutal <UNK> against an <UNK> crowd <UNK> in front of it's <UNK> in the day of the revolution in 25 of april 1974 has it show's on the film and has all <UNK> it has it's heroes one them of was captain <UNK> <UNK> a returned soldier from the war whose <UNK> along with the rest of the army was that they were fighting since <UNK> a hopeless war and that sometimes a soldier has to <UNK> it's country
<START> when rodney <UNK> is on a roll he's hilarious in my 5 wives he's not on a roll the timing of the one liners is off but they're the best thing going for the movie the five women who play the wives don't add up to one whole actress between them the plot is very weak even the premise is pretty weak there are a few jokes about having multiple wives but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie most of the movie could play the same way even if <UNK> character had only one wife so the premise seems more like an old man's fantasy than a key part of the comedy another old man's fantasy we're supposed to accept that <UNK> character is an athletic <UNK> br br jerry stiller seems to be <UNK> in his role just to do a buddy a favor and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for work br br the odd <UNK> to political correctness later in the movie don't really do anything for the movie for those who like their movies politically correct the non pc humor is still there in the first place and the seeming apologies for it still don't get the point for those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness the pc add ins are just annoying <UNK> br br this has to be the <UNK> r rated movie i've ever seen there are some <UNK> jokes and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking tv 40 years ago but that's about it maybe it was the topless men kidding br br the dvd features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles i kept wondering if they were serious or kidding they seem to be serious but i kept thinking they must be kidding there's also a peculiar <UNK> suggesting that since the movie never actually names the <UNK> or the church of latter day saints that somehow it's not about them never mind that the movie features a <UNK> religion in <UNK> and makes reference to <UNK> young br br in short my 5 wives was a disappointment i was hoping for rodney on a roll but the best i can say for the movie is that rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time
<START> a drama at its very core anna displays that genuine truth that all actors age and sometimes fade away anna is a character that believes america is her safety net her home and it can do her no wrong  but she refuses to <UNK> herself to do work she doesn't believe in she is hard <UNK> optimistic stubborn and arrogant when it comes to her life yet not afraid to let others in yet drop them at a moments notice anna flip <UNK> between personalities which makes this film ideal of an aging star but not idea of the viewing audience anna has been praised for its star sally <UNK> and her ability to get <UNK> for the role but a month into 2008 anna does not remain a <UNK> of film culture it is dated dull and <UNK> chaotic br br director <UNK> <UNK> has a message hidden within anna about the <UNK> of <UNK> both politically and socially but <UNK> refuses to let them <UNK> her <UNK> is not afraid to play with the camera to use wooden frames to allow <UNK> to stand out and he is not afraid to <UNK> the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film it is <UNK> you remember if it isn't obvious this film didn't sit well with me from the opening of the first act and deep within the second anna felt like a high school theater production the characters were non existent there was no <UNK> pre story and there was no definition of time or place there was sally <UNK> <UNK> saying that she is better than the other actresses <UNK> for the same lifestyle that she wants randomly she encounters a friend a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to america for the <UNK> and <UNK> and two of them within the span of 20 minutes build a friendship that could break all walls it is emotionally boring and unbelievable again randomly we meet <UNK> boyfriend daniel played by the weak robert fields who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character  only to boost the attention onto <UNK> anna through the course of nearly two hours we watch as more random acts coupled with <UNK> characters <UNK> together to <UNK> create a story that is held together by loose threads  and sally <UNK> <UNK> it pains me to continue to say this but anna could have been a fantastic film had <UNK> presented equal time between anna daniel and <UNK> but instead we are forced into a one sided game where emotional scenes speak <UNK> than plot br br is this where <UNK> <UNK> found inspiration for her beauty less role in monster or <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> ball was sally <UNK> one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character oscar will shine in their direction throughout this film i was disgusted by <UNK> portrayal of anna and <UNK> lack of excitement for anything else <UNK> <UNK> gives us an anna that doesn't work hard for her parts doesn't care for others and is generally mean spirited  yet we are to feel sympathy for her near the beginning of the film she forces what she wants to do onto others and gets upset when she doesn't get her way sure aging actresses my have that appeal to them but <UNK> creates a more childish character instead of a mature one that is where anna could have improved if this was a mature <UNK> i would have <UNK> it up but this <UNK> childish anna was impossible to believe while my favorite scene was near the end where anna goes to watch one of her older films playing included is absurd make out characters and the film burns this scene is also one of my least favorite anna has made a phenomenal life for herself creating films and building the dream yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight she gets jealous and <UNK> this didn't make for a character i wanted to stand behind nor win oscars coupled with the classic 80s background <UNK> the outrageous over the top wardrobe and the <UNK> ending where did that come from and what happened  anna slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema it was a show piece an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time in this one it worked but i don't think i will be fooled again br br overall i cannot say that i was impressed with this film anna is not a film about an aging film star it is about sally <UNK> and only sally <UNK> <UNK> tries to do more with the story but fails either because <UNK> will not allow him or he just realizes that there isn't enough to support a full story there are one or two decent scenes in this film but nothing that <UNK> this film as innovative or influential <UNK> did not create a character that audiences would believe tear up for or <UNK> a sunday afternoon with  he created an annoyance <UNK> wasn't anna she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and <UNK> on the sides perhaps i missed the scope of this film but what makes films like this work is the <UNK> of everyone involved that wasn't the case here in anna <UNK> orders daniel to act like a dog apparently as a symbolic act and yet during the entire emotional scene i couldn't help but think that was what <UNK> was like to those on the set she didn't make this into a film she transformed it into her own production and because of it anna failed i cannot suggest this to anyone  from one czech to another  skip it br br grade <UNK> out of for that <UNK> theater scene that <UNK> me out
<START> green street as it was called in the uk or <UNK> is a bad film the story is full of <UNK> ideas and premises that anyone who lives in england has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately br br my first main <UNK> with <UNK> is the poor casting of the two main characters don't get me wrong i like <UNK> wood and have a great respect for his work but despite his best efforts he <UNK> to pull off this role the main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal however he spends much of the film <UNK> and <UNK> only displaying his <UNK> up <UNK> in one brief scene towards the end of the film this linked with his looks and <UNK> make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football <UNK> at no point during the film was i convinced that a he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b the <UNK> of thugs would accept such a person into their <UNK> br br the other main character is played by charlie <UNK> charlie looks the part and is fairly convincing as a thug unfortunately being a native of <UNK> upon <UNK> in the north of england he demonstrates the worst east london accent since dick van dyke tried to go <UNK> en y in marry <UNK> details such as this probably will not bother an american audience who will be less <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> in the uk but being from the uk it was a problem i couldn't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me the supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast especially the role of <UNK> the <UNK> playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that charlie played with a film like this you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible unfortunately the casting failed imagine if you made a film like the godfather and had sean hayes jack from will and grace playing michael <UNK> part you would not be convinced the story in <UNK> is also full in <UNK> i am no football <UNK> but i am a <UNK> football fan i know how <UNK> a group of <UNK> football supporters can be as such it <UNK> it impossible for a non football fan who is not a fan of the club in question is not from the area in question and not even of english <UNK> to be <UNK> by a <UNK> who <UNK> to a secret <UNK> in some severe cases my final and biggest problem with this film is the way it portrays football <UNK> i take <UNK> to the film's idea that despite being very violent individuals <UNK> are <UNK> as they live by some sort of code of <UNK> in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other this is complete rubbish football <UNK> are complete <UNK> they take football the national sport of england and use it as an excuse to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> people they only represent a tiny <UNK> of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation they are not brave or loyal they are cowardly and evil if the <UNK> in this film truly loved their club west ham why would the <UNK> their lives to being a <UNK> on its name <UNK> are an embarrassment to football and to english society football <UNK> do for the reputation of football what hitler did to the reputation of germans although this film tries <UNK> to show the <UNK> side of football violence it does nothing more than promote it as some kind of <UNK> activity for extreme fans of the sport it does not show the poor innocent by <UNK> at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing <UNK> <UNK> glass into the crowd it does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with <UNK> and broken windows it does not show the real fans of football <UNK> who suffer <UNK> and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to european games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone if you want to see a good film about football violence watch the bbc drama 'the <UNK>
<START> students often ask me why i choose this version of othello shakespeare's text is strongly <UNK> and the film contains material which earned it an r rating br br i have several reasons for using this production first i had not seen a depiction of the <UNK> that actually made me sympathetic to othello until i saw fishburne play him i saw james earl jones and christopher plummer play othello and <UNK> on broadway and it was wonderful <UNK> energy was especially noticeable but in spite of <UNK> incredible presence both physically and <UNK> the character he played just seemed too passive to <UNK> from me a complete emotional <UNK> in the <UNK> sense jones in fact <UNK> what i felt when in an interview he noted that he had played othello as passive seeing <UNK> as basically doing him over unfortunately this <UNK> my grief for the character destruction thus i felt sympathy for <UNK> <UNK> but not the horror over his corruption by an evil man in contrast <UNK> othello is a strong and <UNK> figure familiar with taking action thus <UNK> temptation to <UNK> deal with what is presented to othello as his wife's <UNK> is a <UNK> of the <UNK> positive quality to be active not passive 1 the horror of the story is that this good quality in othello becomes perverted <UNK> depiction is therefore <UNK> tragic br br second fishburne is the first black actor to play othello in a film both <UNK> wells and anthony hopkins did fine film versions but they were white men in black face 2 why is this important why should a black actor be the black man on the stage 3 certainly in shakespeare's day they used black face just as they used boys to make girls perhaps then the reason is the same female actors bring a special quality to female roles on the <UNK> stage because they understand best what shakespeare's genius was trying to present a gifted black actor should play the <UNK> because his experience in a white dominated culture is vital to understanding what shakespeare's genius recognized the pain of being <UNK> because of race an important theme in othello is isolation caused by racism although it is a mistake to insert american racism into a <UNK> play there can be little doubt that racism is still working among the characters many including <UNK> father think that a union between a <UNK> white christian woman and a north african black christian man is unnatural br br third shakespeare was never g rated he never has been his stage productions were always <UNK> by violence and strong language but shakespeare's genius uses these elements not as <UNK> but for artistic honesty
<START> i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend and <UNK> along with my friends to check out a movie any movie and since the only movie we'd not seen was inspector gadget we decided to go in for that br br big mistake this is a movie that might appeal only to kids oh and it's not like i don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention if you have nothing to do at home go to sleep better than wasting hard earned cash on this go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid
<START> i gave this a 10 out of 10 points i love it so much i am a child of the 80s and totally into heavy metal for many years those are the reasons i like this movie so much its so cool to see those posters in the bedroom of that boy <UNK> priest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> twisted sister and his <UNK> collection <UNK> the wicked by <UNK> rise of the mutants by shock metal master <UNK> and killing is my business by <UNK> also the soundtrack by <UNK> is totally incredible and fits very well with the plot if you are into metal then trick or treat is your friend don't buy or watch this movie for <UNK> or gene simmons because they are in the movie for seconds watch it because the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the glory 80s you will not be the same person after
<START> having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a <UNK> amongst <UNK> that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based upon this point i cannot comment having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously however what i can say with <UNK> is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely <UNK> a sense of humour <UNK> let's be honest here this film is just so much fun br br <UNK> so i must <UNK> the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character s but let's put this into a clear <UNK> do the same individuals who are <UNK> on about this film also <UNK> the fact that the classic 1960's batman series does not remain faithful to the original <UNK> comic book character or perhaps is there still <UNK> in same persons that the 1980 film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series br br the point is yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm br br former tarzan ron <UNK> plays the eponymous hero in this and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael <UNK> br br best scene far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the <UNK> when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux <UNK> of <UNK> coke <UNK> and milk at a <UNK> occasion also the often noted scene near the end of the film <UNK> savage <UNK> his nemesis captain <UNK> <UNK> various martial arts <UNK> which are <UNK> on screen  priceless br br simply put the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it great fun from start to finish and you'll be singing the john phillip <UNK> adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed
<START> people tried to make me believe that the premise of this <UNK> supernatural horror thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer whose name escapes me at the moment whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never ending murder spree it's not a highly original idea to <UNK> a horror film on by the way other low budget <UNK> <UNK> the exact same basic premise like house 3 shocker and ghost in the machine anyway the first power a k a <UNK> isn't a completely terrible effort but the script overly <UNK> to clichés and lacks genuine thrills the film starts off as an okay albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop hero lou diamond <UNK> <UNK> a maniac who <UNK> bloody <UNK> into the <UNK> of his victims he receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium played by the gorgeous and underrated tracy griffith she leads him to the killer but also begs not to <UNK> him as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe thanks to <UNK> helpful hints detective logan quickly captures the killer and <UNK> his death penalty but patrick <UNK> made a <UNK> with satan himself and returns to the rotten streets of california to do some more killing the first power gets pretty bad once the murderer <UNK> as a vengeful spirit instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world that's what i would do in his position <UNK> simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the <UNK> he annoyingly calls him buddy boy all the time and possesses the bodies of <UNK> friends and colleagues in order to trick him even though never really boring or poorly realized it's a very weak film to endure mostly because you constantly get the feeling of <UNK> <UNK> writer director robert <UNK> shamelessly uses every dreadful cliché the killer got sexually abused as a child and even the <UNK> lines can easily be predicted as soon as griffith explains she's able to predict the future you just know that somewhere at some point in the film she's going to say the ridiculously <UNK> line i tell people who to live their lives but my own life is a mess yawn lou diamond <UNK> performance is adequate enough but it's rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of la <UNK> and stand and deliver serious as a tough <UNK> there also are decent supportive roles for <UNK> <UNK> forrest <UNK> carmen <UNK> when a stranger calls and b movie horror legend david <UNK> re animator appears in a <UNK> cameo at the very beginning of the film
<START> i waited ages before seeing this as all the reviews i read of this said it was horrible i rented it expecting the worst and while it is hardly the best sandler film out there there are much worse sandler frequently talks to the camera and the film does not take itself seriously but that is all part of the fun a great way to waste an afternoon and you might even find yourself laughing once a twice a good film well worth renting
<START> the story line of the thief of bagdad is complex <UNK> to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important <UNK> woven together the screenplay by <UNK> <UNK> and the dialogue by miles <UNK> keep the story moving <UNK> at all points the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> a man for having different ideas he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for <UNK> deeds and hate him he is imprisoned by <UNK> where he meets abu the young thief the two escape and take a boat to the city of <UNK> there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss then he is captured when <UNK> comes to win the princess of <UNK> for himself ahmad attacks the evil <UNK> who <UNK> him and turns abu into a dog <UNK> then asks for the <UNK> hand and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the <UNK> of <UNK> the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the <UNK> accompanied by abu as his dog the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her so <UNK> sends his servant <UNK> for ahmad and the dog in hopes the prince can <UNK> her he does <UNK> her she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad but she is captured by <UNK> who then throws the dog overboard she then allows <UNK> to take her in his arms on his promise to <UNK> <UNK> sight and turn abu back into a thief the princess sees a vision of ahmad he is in a boat <UNK> sends a storm to <UNK> him and abu is <UNK> on a deserted island abu finds a genie or <UNK> who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a <UNK> then <UNK> him in again for <UNK> him he gets three wishes his first is for <UNK> in the meanwhile the princess <UNK> with her father to refuse <UNK> but <UNK> shows the <UNK> a new mechanical toy one of whose six arms stabs him to death abu makes a second wish to find ahmad the cunning genie flies him to the <UNK> of the all seeing eye abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye battling a giant spider then <UNK> the <UNK> statue abu <UNK> into the <UNK> and sees ahmad in a canyon he has the genie take him to ahmad ahmad uses the eye to see the princess she <UNK> a flower and forgets everything at once abu wishes they were in bagdad but the genie laughs and leaves <UNK> tells the princess that she is in love with him <UNK> mention of ahmad ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess but <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> abu finds himself in the land of legend where the old men who rule want to make him their king he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead to hurry to save ahmad and the princess the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the <UNK> using his bow from the flying carpet to the wonder of the <UNK> who had come to watch the execution <UNK> tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse but another shot from the bow finishes him ahmad is <UNK> again and plans to <UNK> his princess but when he tries to make abu his <UNK> the young thief refuses saying that what he wants is adventure not hard work and <UNK> in a palace however grand it may be this fantastic story was given a <UNK> production by producer alexander <UNK> the production was designed by vincent <UNK> who was also art director while georges <UNK> did the colorful cinematography the directors credited are <UNK> <UNK> and michael powell with tim <UNK> alexander <UNK> william cameron <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong oliver <UNK> and marcel <UNK> the production apart from its gorgeous and expensive looking visual <UNK> i claim is dominated by two other elements the <UNK> music of <UNK> <UNK> and the performance by conrad <UNK> as the evil <UNK> rex <UNK> plays the genie with a curious accent plus his usual intelligence and power june <UNK> is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful <UNK> and miles <UNK> a properly bumbling and <UNK> <UNK> as ahmad john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some he is <UNK> good in his winning role this film has a <UNK> about it that is found i <UNK> in other <UNK> works also its imaginative content stands in contrast to very strong realistic sets costumes and set design elements this is one of the most memorable idea level fantasies of all time worthy to be enjoyed over and over
<START> love it love it love it this is another absolutely superb performance from the divine miss m from the beginning to the end this is one big treat don't rent it buy it now
<START> for starters and for the record the term <UNK> describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does not in any way relate to having sex with <UNK> that is called <UNK> and yes i know it's an obvious difference but i'm already getting a lot of remarks from <UNK> and relatives that i sport a perverted taste in movies this movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy in fact and merely just qualifies as boring inept and terribly bad <UNK> makes at least one top five <UNK> namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made now director bert i gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces on his <UNK> there are titles like earth vs the spider king dinosaur and food of the gods but he really <UNK> himself here with a totally senseless redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and <UNK> little towns shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead <UNK> and her husband frank move to the quiet little town of <UNK> where frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory <UNK> is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of <UNK> especially with the town's <UNK> and owner mr <UNK> behaving very <UNK> and mysterious that's another thing how can anybody own a town and everybody in it either way <UNK> gradually discovers that everybody in <UNK> is a witch and mr <UNK> exclusively <UNK> her to the town because of her supernatural ability to <UNK> the dead since many years already <UNK> has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and he's prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes i honestly don't see the point of the whole movie it's a blatant rip off of rosemary's baby  one of the alternate titles even is rosemary's <UNK>  but the script is muddled and <UNK> beyond belief why isn't anyone allowed to have children for as long as <UNK> son remains dead that's just really selfish when where and how did <UNK> suddenly learn to <UNK> the dead <UNK> definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments but these are <UNK> accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget the grainy photography provides the film with an eerie ambiance and the set pieces look cheap enough to be creepy orson welles' performance  undoubtedly the low point of his career  is <UNK> and still it's the best aspect about the entire movie
<START> i have never seen a barbara steele movie that i haven't liked and have always been a sucker for a good haunted house story especially for such wonderful pictures as the legend of hell house and the original versions of the haunting and house on haunted hill so i had a feeling that castle of blood would be right up my alley and boy was it ever this french italian <UNK> while perhaps not the classic that <UNK> first horror film black sunday remains to this day is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric chilling entry in the <UNK> genre filmed in black and white it manages to convey a genuinely creepy <UNK> the film concerns a journalist who <UNK> one lord <UNK> and an author named edgar allen poe that he can spend the night in <UNK> castle on the night of all saints day when the spirits of those killed in the castle <UNK> their fate the viewer gets to see these deaths and they are pretty horrible for the most part the film does indeed send <UNK> up the viewer's spine and in the uncut dvd that i just watched thanks to the fine folks at <UNK> even features a surprising topless scene and some mild <UNK> and barbara is wonderful in this movie her <UNK> beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic <UNK> her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable not for nothing has she been called the queen of horror
<START> i saw this when i was 17 and haven't seen it since the <UNK> late <UNK> used to show it on a regular basis at one point i remember how sad and <UNK> it was it truly made me sick to my stomach effects then weren't what they are today but nevertheless it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the amazon after losing both parents and searching for a way out very well i remember the bugs and <UNK> the most so realistic they were eating her flesh it's a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time even though likely it was strongly edited for tv i wish i remembered more details and if i ever get the chance to see it again i can comment more i have been looking for this for years i believe it may have been shown on cbs under yet another title i have no idea whether it was ever released on video
<START> this movie makes a promising start and then gets very confused and muddled kamal <UNK> has made a lot of effort in getting the period look right pity he did not spend more time on the plot most of the small characters in the movie show up for no particular reason br br overall very disappointing i would recommend avoiding this movie
<START> a well cast summary of a real event well actually i wasn't there but i think this is how it may have been like i think there are two typically american <UNK> evident in the film <UNK> and parallels to <UNK> hitler these should be evident to most independent <UNK> anyway <UNK> does a great performance and so do lots of other well known actors the last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable and i mean it anyone who can sleep well after them is <UNK> that's why it's so terrible it all happened and it probably looked just like that but actually did that last scene on the air station really take place
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is set during the <UNK> century where famous spanish <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ian <UNK> has landed in mexico with six of his best men including lieutenant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they intend to claim the land in the name of the spanish maybe steal some gold too if the opportunity <UNK> within minutes they have their first sight of local aztec <UNK> within minutes after that <UNK> his men are captured held prisoner if that wasn't bad enough it turns out that a couple of <UNK> rex live there like to eat the locals in an effort to win their lives the spanish offer to help the locals get rid of their monster problem but with various hidden <UNK> <UNK> motives it's not just the dinosaurs they have to watch out for br br directed by brian <UNK> smith who <UNK> made one of my all time favourite <UNK> films turkey shoot 1982 which i <UNK> recommend to one all also more <UNK> known under the spoof sounding title of aztec rex the title was changed by the sci fi channel when they aired it maybe as the original title <UNK> <UNK> sounds like it might be a foreign film this is yet another idiotic cheap looking sci fi channel <UNK> <UNK> that's all you need to know really based on around the real spanish <UNK> <UNK> during his expedition to mexico the film definitely doesn't <UNK> for historic accuracy although i will admit that the story tries to do something slightly different here but ultimately <UNK> <UNK> is still just a <UNK> <UNK> with a bunch of people running from some poor cgi computer graphic of a monster despite it's period setting not too sure what else i can say despite being set centuries ago the usual clichés are here the character's are the usual cardboard <UNK> make stupid decisions the selfish one the heroic one the <UNK> one the <UNK> victim who exists just to get eaten the pretty woman are all here easy to spot the film is predictable silly dull doesn't really entertain on any level although it does move along at a decent pace there's one or two half decent moments of gore if that sort of thing interests you the story isn't that good has plenty of holes too this is also the sort of film that you will have completely forgotten about within a few days br br now i have seen commented on plenty of sci fi channel <UNK> <UNK> usually the cgi computer effects are terrible while <UNK> <UNK> doesn't exactly buck the trend i will admit there are a few effects shots which look alright but then they are usually ruined by an absolutely awful effects shot straight afterwards there's a few decent gore effects here too there's a cut out heart a guy's leg is bitten off there's some blood splatter a cool shot of a guy left holding his own intestines after he has been attacked by the dinosaur there's a few dead bodies seen someone is stabbed with a <UNK> the t rex gets to eat a couple of people too the production values are really cheap the aztec set looks like one of those theme park <UNK> made from <UNK> those spanish men must have been imprisoned in the worst <UNK> in cinematic history with the fence supposedly keeping them in lower than a mans <UNK> they could have simply stepped out of it run away it was so low br br with a supposed budget of about <UNK> 000 i can't see where the money went shot in <UNK> in hawaii in apparently fifteen days the acting isn't great from no one i have ever heard of br br <UNK> <UNK> really isn't any better than any other cheap sci fi channel <UNK> <UNK> despite an almost interesting unusual premise that basic statement should basically be enough for you to decide whether you will enjoy this or not at a guess probably not
<START> this film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the <UNK> of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely <UNK> this ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> messy film completely lacks vision and if there is any point to the plot it wasn't put there on purpose werewolf woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a <UNK> bad it's <UNK> film but i completely disagree normally i enjoy films like this but werewolf woman is indeed a bad film and despite all the sex and <UNK> on display it doesn't even make for a fun watch and that really is unforgivable the film really doesn't have much plot but the thin <UNK> we are given involves a young woman who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf she dreams of going out and finding men having sex with them and eventually killing them back in the real world she falls in love but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge br br the film is made up of scenes of sex and gore which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters <UNK> over the recent events these scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters but they really don't do that and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely <UNK> film it would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice the sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic but the gore works well the premise is <UNK> for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation as there's plenty of naked women and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of <UNK> but this isn't <UNK> on and while i can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines i really can't stand watching films and being bored overall i wouldn't even recommend this film to big exploitation fans there's plenty of better stuff than this out there and while the title may sound intriguing the film isn't
<START> will farmer <UNK> plays a computer game that <UNK> a terrorist attack and <UNK> the super government computer designed to profile potential terrorists tracks him because will borrowed by <UNK> some money from his next door <UNK> bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in philadelphia the next door neighbor whose computer will was <UNK> has relatives in the mid east who thru their bank send money to the <UNK> bank and <UNK> sees a terrorist connection <UNK> has the power to call up missile strikes oh oh br br this version of war games has a much faster pace and more <UNK> than the war games movie in the early 1980s well the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days makes sense so the movie <UNK> us with fantastic cgi on computer screens and once joshua the <UNK> to <UNK> is found <UNK> we are left with watching computer against computer and the humans are cringing hoping <UNK> sort of oh oh ing <UNK> ing and more cringing hoping things will go their way in other words we are now experiencing a made for tv type movie and it's oh hum time go back to the 1980s and watch the original war games movie it's much better br br but we really have to ask ourselves are we making computers too intelligent where one day in time they will rule us <UNK> br br violence yes sex no nudity no language no
<START> this tv production of 1970 starring <UNK> york and george c scott is another proof of how difficult it is to adopt jane eyre to the screen and how much can go wrong in doing so it is true that the movie suffered in the transfer to dvd some scenes which were complete in the original were <UNK> and so badly edited that there are striking continuity gaps and that even one crucial scene between jane and rochester starts in the middle of a sentence but even if the editing were better the film would not be the script is bad the portrayal of the characters is untrue to the novel and nearly all actors are miscast as a consequence one does not have the feeling of watching an adaptation of charlotte <UNK> novel at all the problem is not only that a number of scenes are <UNK> or left out this is the case with all the short adaptations but that the remaining scenes do no at all capture the tone the spirit the atmosphere and the concept of the novel br br this jane eyre for example completely leaves out <UNK> and begins with jane's arrival at <UNK> while this is perfectly all right since some scenes must by necessity be left out it is not understandable that instead of using the time gained so to speak and thoroughly portraying jane's friendship with helen the influence helen has for jane's development the lecture in christian <UNK> that she teaches her the film nearly exclusively concentrates on the physical ill treatment of helen which is driven to absurd extremes in this adaptation what helen has to suffer is bad enough as described in the novel but here miss <UNK> is portrayed as a kind of sadistic prison ward who deliberately wants to drive helen to a <UNK> death and this is about all which happens at <UNK> if you compare that to the deep impact the years spent in <UNK> have on jane in the novel one can only state with regret that the movie does not even touch the surface of that particular episode in jane's life and this is the problem throughout this adaptation it rushes from scene to scene very often without transition and nowhere comes even near the essence of the novel the dialogues are an odd mixture of made up lines and lines from the novel very clumsily <UNK> together and the scenes between jane and rochester are so <UNK> that both share only 5 minutes together on screen before they fall in love and the little conversation they have contains nothing of the brilliance the intensity and also the humour of the conversations between rochester and jane in the novel but the scriptwriter not only did <UNK> language injustice but in addition managed to ruin her moral set up with just one sentence when rochester and jane go to see <UNK> wife after the would be wedding rochester says yet i once loved her his wife as i love you now the whole moral concept of the novel depends on the fact that rochester is indeed an innocent victim of an amoral scheme and was trapped into marrying a mad woman whom he never loved and that his effort to seek a true life partner is if not <UNK> by god's and man's law yet understandable and forgivable but this one sentence completely <UNK> <UNK> whole carefully constructed moral concept and turns rochester into a dirty old man who wants a new young wife because his old one is of no use to him any longer br br from the errors regarding the script to the errors regarding the casting now i am by no means one of those who insist on physical resemblance between an actor and the literary figure he portrays but by no stretch of imagination is it possible to picture lovely blonde blue eyed and full mouthed <UNK> york as the <UNK> plain heroine in addition ms york was in her thirties when the film was shot and looks it played by her the <UNK> shy reserved and inexperienced young jane becomes a perfectly <UNK> <UNK> and mature woman completely sure of herself and her <UNK> i do not say that <UNK> york does not play well and convincingly but the woman she portrays is not <UNK> jane eyre to cast george c scott as rochester must have been motivated by the desire to have a rochester who looked old enough to make the 18 years difference in age between jane and rochester plausible scott looks as if he were around 50 but acts in various scenes as if he were 70 br br to compliment the maturity of the leading actors all passion desire and despair seems to have been deliberately <UNK> out of the script the scene between jane and rochester after the wedding the emotional climax of the novel has become a calm rational conversation between two middle aged persons at the end of which rochester falls asleep when jane returns to him in the last scene he is just as mildly pleased as a grandfather who has just been paid a visit in his old people's home by his favourite <UNK> the only character who displays an appropriate amount of emotion is st john of all people ian <UNK> plays him so <UNK> and his eager <UNK> for jane's love is so touching that one gets the impression that <UNK> was <UNK> his st john on the rochester of the novel but good though <UNK> is his st john is just as far from the novel as <UNK> jane and scott's rochester the only redeeming features of this very disappointing jane eyre are the locations and the score and i would only recommend this production to those who want to watch and compare every single adaptation of jane eyre
<START> i loved it having been a fan of the original series i have always wondered what the back story would be it didn't fail to delight me i also love the fact that apart from eric <UNK> i didn't <UNK> one person this is refreshing much like bsg it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent can't wait for the series to start airing well done to ronald d moore and team excellent job the special effects dialogue and acting were all spot on and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline i know there are <UNK> out there that will probably disagree with my <UNK> but i felt that caprica was far superior to most of the sci fi stuff produced in the last decade
<START> i grew up watching the original disney cinderella and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn br br <UNK> i was excited to see that cinderella 2 was coming on tv and i would be able to see it br br i should have known better br br this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm it seems to me quite rough and almost brutal right from the don't sing a <UNK> to the characterization br br while i remember the character's telling a story through a song this film's soundtrack was laid over the top and didn't seem to fit <UNK> transformation into a human is a prime example where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little <UNK> in here and there he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall and in the ballroom there's old <UNK> dance type country music it's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set the upbeat <UNK> certainly didn't fit br br even the artwork and animation in cinderella 2 isn't up to scratch with the original the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed and we see part of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which doesn't feel right br br the movie itself could have been it's own story i think that it should have been just that i wouldn't say that i hate it but i believe that it had many shortcomings it seems to <UNK> in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original
<START> actually the movie is neither horror nor sci fi with a very strong christian religious theme this movie delivers minimal content and no suspense second <UNK> actors do half decent jobs of reading their boring roles the only good performance is by sydney penny who plays a role of a mother of i won't spoil the movie it's either christ or anti christ avoid watching this movie unless you a christian religious fanatic obsessed with apocalypse br br being a non christian i had to force myself to watch this movie just because i wanted to write this review it's a pity that sci fi channel had to air this movie at the peak evening time
<START> i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations basically because of kamal <UNK> he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the <UNK> of time forever but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in <UNK> and clockwork orange looks far better br br the protagonist <UNK> is a very daring police officer who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders <UNK> <UNK> finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree finally <UNK> kills them both after <UNK> many innocent lives br br these two psycho killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters the murders and sexual <UNK> and rapes are shown very <UNK> which the movie could have survived without br br to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty the director <UNK> should realize that he also has some <UNK> to the society and his audience certainly i am never going to the movies looking like <UNK> name on the production list
<START> the screenwriter poorly attempted to re create the <UNK> but put in some blah blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged there is no substance whatsoever in this entire film it had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people <UNK> about things nobody cares about extremely boring i wanted to leave the theater when i saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so i had to <UNK> the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about br br they use computer graphics in here that instead of <UNK> me as it intended i hate cgi just ruined the movie even more some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how thought provoking and slow paced without action because it's an intelligent film it was what is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest who has a love interest and <UNK> his religion seems like an uninspired concept oh and there's some <UNK> <UNK> about the sin eater movie was originally going to be titled sin eater lame concept but the movie took the sin eater thing too seriously making the movie become pathetic and <UNK> about how dark and intelligent it was yeah i know there were really sin <UNK> in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy br br nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget why i even bothered to see this movie if you want horror films that actually have depth watch rosemary's baby the tenant naked blood society cannibal holocaust pin exorcist omen or any of the romero dead trilogy films nonsense dialogue does not <UNK> to intelligence people mainstream movie fans think that though same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece if you want mind numbingly boring horror watch the order this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride
<START> when the matrix appeared in 1999 and <UNK> existence and identity it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration that didn't really happen surprisingly and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear but to say cypher is a clone would be to its <UNK> br br the story is of a morgan sullivan who applies for a job with a high flying <UNK> company called <UNK> his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company while under an assumed and false identity his home life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he's actually doing however things start to take <UNK> turns and before he knows what's going on he starts to question who he actually is this is not helped by a strange woman who turns up br br twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable br br it's an enthralling journey through a not too distant future and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat br br highly recommended
<START> i watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful i urge anyone to watch this just to see how <UNK> awful a movie can be surely it was deliberate i <UNK> at every <UNK> attempt at humour carried out in such a childish <UNK> badly executed way that it was beyond belief this is the movie that makes <UNK> look like <UNK> think i am <UNK> well give it <UNK> and think again dreadful utterly dreadful if this wasn't a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again
<START> i sat down to watch midnight cowboy thinking it would be another overrated '60s '70s movie some of my favorite films come from the '70s in the same vein as midnight cowboy taxi driver mean streets panic in <UNK> park etc but there are many many overrated ones as well that have gained strong <UNK> amongst critics for being groundbreaking unfortunately a vast majority of them don't hold up as well today i sort of feel this way about easy rider although it too is one of my favorites br br so i didn't expect much from midnight cowboy but got a lot back it's a touching story well made and well told with some of the best performances of all time dustin hoffman as <UNK> ratso rizzo gives one of his best it's a bit funny at times he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks maybe because of the <UNK> simpsons connection but hoffman is entirely convincing half of the film's budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in hollywood opposite him is the second billed jon voight as joe buck the cowboy who travels north to the big apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he <UNK> up with a crippled <UNK> artist named ratso who offers to become <UNK> manager for a certain <UNK> of <UNK> br br the movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long some films can tend to drag especially some of the films that were made in the '70s because as it's been said in easy riders raging <UNK> the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too <UNK> with their material going on too long <UNK> characters scenes etc that aren't important just about the only scene i felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party it makes the film seem extremely outdated similar to the drug <UNK> in easy rider and really <UNK> its flow because it's not needed br br other than that midnight cowboy is an almost flawless motion picture i was pleasantly surprised it does have its flaws flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been for instance and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy such as the gay movie theater sequence but if you can handle its content midnight cowboy is a truly great motion picture an <UNK> examination of life on the streets in the late '60s early '70s it's a depressing movie yes and by today's standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of life is horrible etc but i still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long long time br br highly recommended one of the best films of the '70s it was technically released in late 1969 but i'd still <UNK> it as a 1970s film it also won the best picture oscar being the first and only x rated motion picture to do so it was later re rated r on appeal br br 4 5 5
<START> i read the book <UNK> prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book many of the <UNK> most interesting points do not even come out in the movie it is a b movie at best many events characters how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur the flow of events that in the book are very smooth are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child the character development is very poor <UNK> of the characters <UNK> from those in the book the direction is similar to a b horror flick i understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book but they screen play base missed many points the casting was very good
<START> this is hands down the greatest stand up show ever i've seen a lot of stand up shows been to a lot of stand up shows and watch <UNK> comic view but i have never seen anyone who could match the skills of murphy on this show the impressions are excellent the skits are great and the timing is perfect you can even tell the crowd gets really into when he did raw a few years later it was also really good but this is 1 in my book also shows that at one time particularly the early to mid eighties that murphy was funny my favorite parts of the show is when he is retelling the family <UNK> and ice cream <UNK> the ice cream man is coming another great part is where his mom is like clint eastwood
<START> a wonderful television mini series completely ruined by a 45 year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16 year old <UNK> no exaggeration that's the actual age of the character played by ali <UNK> when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at pearl harbor this tv mini series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one i refer to whenever the topic comes up br br that alone makes this completely unwatchable despite the fact it's one of the best filmed wwii <UNK> dramas tv has ever produced if you have the stomach or a decent fast forward ability you might be able to enjoy the late robert mitchum in a very strong performance br br i'm stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story pun intended did they watch the film with their eyes closed or are they aging <UNK> who never <UNK> to <UNK> me with their <UNK> memories and <UNK> vision i'm a <UNK> myself so don't think for a second i'm some <UNK> young punk 45 will always look 45 get used to it deal with it age <UNK> <UNK> br br the winds of war could have been so good how much more would we be talking about this mini series today some 25 years later had an actual <UNK> been cast in such an important critical role right now with the constant <UNK> old <UNK> distraction that alone <UNK> out most of the wonderful aspects of the winds of war
<START> the deadly look of love is essentially fatal attraction with a couple of twists added onto the back half the ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies of the week it is yet another <UNK> tale about <UNK> to temptation and it adds nothing fresh to the genre br br brett vincent <UNK> is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a <UNK> trust <UNK> even though he has it all he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with janet jordan <UNK> janet a <UNK> eyed blonde from <UNK> falls falls hard for brett and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement shortly after the wedding mrs brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large <UNK> home she shared with her new husband when the police question brett he promptly points the finger at janet following her arrest janet seems to get <UNK> by the minute not that she was the picture of <UNK> before her defense attorney holland taylor is convinced that janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it br br did she do it or didn't she how will it end you can find out the answers to these questions the next time the deadly look of love <UNK> on your local station and be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story men are pigs and women are crazy
<START> the whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts no problem this film features a line up of some of the most <UNK> creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast the segments are <UNK> around the same theme love in paris but the resemblance ends there actually considering that the approach to the theme from all these different directors takes so many forms it is amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same film no great effort has been made to turn it into a <UNK> whole this <UNK> has so many great ingredients i am glad nobody tried to put them all in a single dish
<START> one of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt german <UNK> the highly atmospheric style of film making developed during the <UNK> in berlin classic movies like <UNK> <UNK> des dr <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> were the most famous direct results of this movement and while the movement didn't have a long life its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today specially in the horror genre one of the key figures of this style would be director paul <UNK> director of <UNK> der <UNK> <UNK> er in die <UNK> <UNK> as in his debut as a filmmaker seven years before the making of that classic he was already making experiments with <UNK> in film that early prototype of german <UNK> was incidentally another horror film der student von <UNK> br br der student von <UNK> the student of <UNK> is the story of <UNK> paul <UNK> a student with the reputation of being the best <UNK> in <UNK> but who always find himself with financial troubles one day <UNK> <UNK> the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident <UNK> falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again but soon he discovers that he'll have to compete with her rich cousin <UNK> von <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who also wants to marry her knowing that he can't offer her much <UNK> wishes to be wealthy and this is where a <UNK> named <UNK> john <UNK> enters the scene <UNK> offers <UNK> <UNK> wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room <UNK> accepts the <UNK> only to discover in horror that what <UNK> wants is his reflection in the mirror br br loosely inspired by edgar allan <UNK> short story william wilson and the classic legend of <UNK> the story of der student von <UNK> was conceived by german writer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider <UNK> as valid as any other form of literature written at a time where cinema in germany was still being developed as an art form der student von <UNK> shows a real <UNK> to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes like most of the <UNK> of his time <UNK> screenplay is still very influenced by theater although der student von <UNK> begins to move away from that style while a bit poor on its character development specially on the supporting characters <UNK> manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of <UNK> br br while der student von <UNK> was paul <UNK> directorial debut and <UNK> <UNK> second film as a filmmaker it's very clear that these two <UNK> had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly giving great use to <UNK> <UNK> cinematography the two young filmmakers create a powerful gothic atmosphere that <UNK> what the german filmmakers of the following decade would do <UNK> would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his <UNK> series from <UNK> and <UNK> despite having very limited resources <UNK> and <UNK> manage to create an amazing and very convincing for its time visual effect for the scenes with <UNK> reflection played by <UNK> too already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film <UNK> directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the <UNK> style of previous filmmakers br br as <UNK> paul <UNK> is very effective and probably the best in the movie it certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer but one can't deny that <UNK> was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract john <UNK> plays the sinister <UNK> with mysterious aura that suits the character like a <UNK> few is said about <UNK> in the film but <UNK> makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared the rest of the main cast is less lucky with <UNK> <UNK> being pretty much average as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> making a poor <UNK> von <UNK> however it must be said that <UNK> <UNK> was pretty good in her <UNK> character and fritz <UNK> made an excellent baron <UNK> <UNK> showing the dignity that <UNK> character should have had br br considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake made 13 years after this film is superior in every possible way it's not difficult to understand why der student von <UNK> hasn't stood the test of time as well as other early films the movie's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what <UNK> story needed to be fully developed this makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times or even <UNK> as if there was something missing in the narrative of course there's also the possibility that the existing print is really <UNK> however der student von <UNK> is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time left a powerful impression in history br br as the direct predecessor of the german <UNK> movement it's hard to deny the enormous importance that der student von <UNK> has in the history of german cinema probably in the history of cinema in general it may look dated even for its time but considering the limited resources its director had it's truly better than most films from that era as the movie that started paul <UNK> career and with that german <UNK> der student von <UNK> is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history 7 10
<START> this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last <UNK> of the <UNK> empire well told and provoking we see the inner <UNK> of a world now gone and learn about the people who lived there br br i enjoyed the story characters acting and scenes a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly otherwise a wonderful piece br br the main character <UNK> is played wonderfully by marie <UNK> who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it the scenes with her and alex <UNK> <UNK> are charming and lovely br br i recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are <UNK>
<START> i was recently online looking at a site that featured public <UNK> movies in their long list of films was this film and i thought i must be <UNK> at such an offensive title and premise but no that's really what it was and since the film was only about 27 minutes long i decided to give it a try if it had turned out to be some porno movie i would have stopped watching instead it turned out to be the most bizarre film i have ever seen the danish production crew tried with a budget of about <UNK> to make a star trek style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy <UNK> out female <UNK> by killing all the women like they <UNK> to do on the earth and in every case they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet br br subtle this ain't with some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters i've ever heard i don't even think i can write them on imdb without having my review removed however despite the utter <UNK> of it all it was strangely watchable and worth a <UNK> but as i mentioned already due to the crude names and odd subject matter though no nudity it's a film for adults only br br by the way this movie left me with <UNK> questions as to who would make this why make it and who was the intended audience it may not be the absolute worst thing i have ever seen but it probably is the <UNK> and possibly the most offensive
<START> the danish movie slim slam <UNK> surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date i didn't think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad b movies but this one deserves the gold it's not funny it's bad acting it's bad filmed and the storyline is bad the only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it i truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> danish film ever made and that's truly something <UNK> in advance
<START> this movie got off to an interesting start down the road however the story gets convoluted with a poor <UNK> of ancient black magic <UNK> the male lead was very good even though he gets the worst end of the stick in the climax in comparison this is <UNK> meets <UNK>
<START> winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after wwii director anthony mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction jimmy stewart does an excellent job but i think stephen <UNK> and john mcintire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the <UNK> winchester 73 going to the winner this is a good script with several stories going on at the same time look for the first appearance of rock hudson as young bull thank god with in a few years we would begin to let indians play themselves in western films the film is in black and white and was shot in <UNK> arizona i would not put winchester 73 in the category of <UNK> high <UNK> or <UNK> but it gets an above average recommendation from me br br
<START> this film moves the cinderella story forward to the early 1950s and makes good if eccentric use of the <UNK> of man as a background the ugly sisters have become wildly glamorous upper class english girls and together with kathleen turner as the stepmother they <UNK> about in various wonderful period costumes the story is altered a little from the traditional version early on it is oddly combined with the plot of king <UNK> and in later stages cinderella is rather more <UNK> than is usual it looks splendid and works on the whole pretty well but does go over the top at times
<START> the makers of this film have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in every state but women are <UNK> for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences in other words this film is every <UNK> worst nightmare the political agenda is so heavy handed here and the style of the film is so low key that it just loses steam pretty quickly regardless of which side of the fence you're on i'd recommend skipping it
<START> about two hundred members of a cleveland <UNK> usa film society named <UNK> gathered on august 19 2000 to view a <UNK> <UNK> print of <UNK> <UNK> 1970 film zabriskie point <UNK> director john <UNK> who does a <UNK> job of <UNK> the finest <UNK> for his series shared with the audience beforehand that this print was specially <UNK> over from italy for this one showing only br br the audience was held <UNK> as the film <UNK> its <UNK> on the huge <UNK> screen watching this superb print shown the way antonioni intended made one aware that this is indeed a modern art work it was all the more fitting that the series is <UNK> in the cleveland <UNK> of art in university circle br br <UNK> compositions are created for the <UNK> landscape his beautiful <UNK> of images striking use of colors sweeping <UNK> movements all are the work of a genuine artist using the screen as his <UNK> br br at last the audience could understand zabriskie point as its narrative <UNK> it became obvious that this work is not about story per se but rather an <UNK> <UNK> rendering of fleeting images of his subject the setting of some of the more <UNK> activities of the sixties provides only a dramatic <UNK> for the <UNK> sweeping <UNK> br br antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards and can pause at any point to <UNK> <UNK> an event with <UNK> <UNK> the audience willingly went with the flow of his remarkable imagination as his huge images on the massive <UNK> held one in <UNK> attention while the audience may have been only <UNK> involved in character relationships it realized the theme here is human <UNK> the director's recurring theme br br it was also realized that no print any smaller or of lesser quality than this original one in <UNK> can do justice to this particular rendering the audience was therefore all the more <UNK> of viewing zabriskie point in its original breathtaking format and broke into <UNK> applause at the end

<START> i'll be honest the only reason i watched this one on tv is that it's in the imdb bottom 100 and right now i'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another <UNK> on that same list br br van damme is luc <UNK> who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a <UNK> to defend itself and yes after all the <UNK> explosions shoot outs and chases he is the last one standing combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set up it makes sure it's place in the infamous list is just br br only for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list 2 10
<START> an art house <UNK> dream overrated <UNK> overdone a pretentious <UNK> that not only did not deserve best picture of 1951 on its own merits it was <UNK> by the competition from the start place in the sun detective story <UNK> named desire <UNK> and <UNK> meet the invisible man you name it if it came out in <UNK> it's better than this <UNK> <UNK> the closing ballet is <UNK> for the intellectual crowd out of place and in the wrong movie few actors in their time were less capable at acting or less charismatic than kelly and caron my 12 worst of <UNK> i saw <UNK> movies and among the 5 worst best picture oscar winners
<START> i show this film to university students in speech and media law because its lessons are timeless why speaking out against injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by the <UNK> why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential to democracy this is a must see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the <UNK> of steven biko and the <UNK> of donald woods it also gives an important lesson of free speech you can blow out a candle but you can't blow out a fire once the flame begins to catch the wind will blow it higher from biko by peter gabriel on shaking the tree
<START> this self <UNK> very talented artist have directed easily the worst spanish film of the 21st century lack of emotion <UNK> rhythm skills humor it repeats the same situation over and over again it shows no character development it does not even show any violent and or sexual content and it does not add anything new to the psycho killer sub genre so lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of what not to do in a first movie br br btw where the hell is the talent there are scenes which have been shot almost <UNK> there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason the camera almost never moves as if the very talented artist was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills the actors playing the main roles act like amateurs and the supporting cast is hardly believable there are more holes than plot in the script if ever there was one br br a really <UNK> movie and a whatsoever talented director
<START> i'm a fan of both shakespeare and mst3k so i waited <UNK> to see this episode i'll comment on the movie first then the mst3k episode the recipe for this movie take talented actors rich and beautiful shakespeare material and a 1 25 budget mix well then drain of all life and movement until dull and lifeless serve cold in a big plain stone <UNK> movie i give 3 out of 10 because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit okay now the mst3k episode i'll admit it the first time i saw it i fell asleep halfway through i understand that was the reaction of several other <UNK> as well however when i watched it a second time i realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines i missed the first time around the trick with this episode is listen carefully it takes a couple of viewings to catch each line give it a second chance and you'll see what i mean mst3k episode 7 1 2 out of 10
<START> very silly movie filled with stupid one liners and jewish references thru out it was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously a familiar movie plot being at the wrong place at the wrong time an atrocious subplot involving kim <UNK> very robotic and too <UNK> i have noticed that al <UNK> acting abilities seem to be going downhill a <UNK> with troubles but nothing more <UNK> than <UNK> horrible <UNK> accent damage control needs to fix this damage of a film ok my one liners are bad but not as bad as the ones in this film this movie manages to not only be boring but revolting as well usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons this movie is unwatchable i did manage to sit through this the plot if written a tad bit better with perhaps a little better acting and <UNK> the horrendous subplot and even dumber jokes could have pulled this thriller out of the <UNK> what we are left with is a dull silly movie that made sure it was <UNK> into our heads that eli <UNK> was jewish an embarrassment to all the good jewish folk everywhere
<START> this picture in <UNK> walked away with all kinds of <UNK> for best director john ford actor victor mclaglen and music by max <UNK> victor mclaglen gypo nolan call out the marines <UNK> gave an outstanding performance as an irish rebel who <UNK> to a rough and tough crowd who were all fighting for a cause and at the same time getting <UNK> and <UNK> with plenty of drinking gypo nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend in order to take a trip with his gal to america and a new way of living preston foster don <UNK> <UNK> diary <UNK> gave a great supporting role as the leader of the irish rebellion and was anxious to capture the informer of his group gypo nolan becomes haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel just like a <UNK> great film for <UNK> and wonderful acting by mclaglen but rather depressing in every aspect of the film
<START> i give this a generous four out of ten stars or <UNK> or <UNK> or something br br there were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie all the scenes with amy p and tina <UNK> and greg kinnear greg kinnear moved along <UNK> enough br br otherwise the usual <UNK> in stereotypes blazing speed <UNK> pushed along by a stupid soundtrack and soundtrack is generous br br anyway the two really really funny scenes involved amy p she's just really hilarious in an animal kind of way she's a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on snl and lucille ball br br i hope they amy p and tina <UNK> just flat out admitted they did this for the money because if by doing it it gave birth to the sarah <UNK> parodies then i guess we can say yeah it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role who's really there to help you be more human br br blah 4 outta 10 like i said is generous br br but no more girls ok oh i almost forgot the mom from two and a half men is in this movie and she's had some kind of plastic surgery so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old so every scene she's in i'm like trying to <UNK> her face or put it together in my mind or just answer the question no wait wait has she had plastic surgery because as a viewer you really don't want her to have had plastic surgery
<START> les <UNK> <UNK> was the first film i saw in 2000 and i doubt i'll see a better one this year this beautiful <UNK> by <UNK> filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> is set in the industrial <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car a <UNK> for him to do this the son has to break the record opening doors what the father actually wants his for his son to be someone because he himself has never made it further as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironically called <UNK> hope of course nothing works out as planned this film can best be compared to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> clouds although it is more dramatic and the humour is darker just like in that film however the tone is more <UNK> than depressing and the ending upbeat without being <UNK> happy the humour is absurd without making the plot unbelievable and <UNK> finds stunning images in the bleak settings that never seem artificial the best thing about les <UNK> <UNK> is the acting by <UNK> this actor shot to fame with the also brilliant cult classic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> in which he played the charismatic <UNK> ben since then he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the <UNK> because as he said in an interview he was not convinced of his own acting <UNK> and all the roles he was offered were <UNK> of the ben character with his return to a leading role in <UNK> there should be no doubt anymore about his acting he's simply brilliant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery but smart enough to realize what he's done and be torn by <UNK> about it a must see
<START> set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of <UNK> in the 1950s this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such american <UNK> as gun <UNK> and violence <UNK> and keeping up with the <UNK> fear of others slavery golf and the <UNK> of the dead yes it all sounds a bit heavy but trust me on this it's nearly as light as a <UNK> br br zombies are featured <UNK> among the characters crucial questions <UNK> such as who will become a zombie 90 of the <UNK> folks choose this final path while only 10 prefer a traditional funeral who owns how many zombies to do their <UNK> like robots they've become a mark of social status and what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of <UNK> dead br br somehow director andrew <UNK> who also co wrote the lively screenplay with robert <UNK> and dennis <UNK> keeps this improbable material <UNK> along for an hour and a half without once <UNK> for want of a good laugh a super cast helps carrie anne moss billy connolly dylan baker henry <UNK> tim blake nelson mary black and <UNK> bennett are the principals aided by young <UNK> ray as timmy the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the <UNK> of the <UNK> having seen her only in <UNK> and the matrix i had no idea that ms moss had such fine <UNK> chops br br the production design and music are <UNK> 50s to a <UNK> maybe this one isn't for everybody it surely will be a hard film to beat for my <UNK> <UNK> award but intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie making for me anyway fido is a hoot my <UNK> 8 5 10 a seen on <UNK> 30 <UNK>
<START> i wish i could say that this show was unusual in it's <UNK> but it is usual in every way it has the dumb husband his smarter but boring and conventional wife along with the idiotic sidekick for comic relief it sorely needs it stale predictable jokes with even more predictable reactions from the <UNK> <UNK> this <UNK> mental <UNK> <UNK> unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma but it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average american a <UNK> to which they can truly identify a regular guy just like you and me i live in the southern u s so to me this show is just the opposite of <UNK> down here that obnoxious character is everywhere in some form or another seeing him on television is brutal <UNK>
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br this second <UNK> of the che films moves the story forward to the late 60s where the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of south america surviving without enough food and water and with tensions <UNK> between the group everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him down br br without the <UNK> between time and places of the last film <UNK> second <UNK> focuses solely on the action in the hills and manages to be an even <UNK> experience and more <UNK> the score has been drowned out giving the second <UNK> more of an <UNK> air of <UNK> that proves just as <UNK> there's just an <UNK> air of boredom to the film that never lets up you can't fault <UNK> ambition or del <UNK> drive in the lead role it's just a shame that somewhere in the production things managed to take such a disappointing turn
<START> after some difficulty johnny <UNK> arrives at his <UNK> <UNK> ranch to take over day to day <UNK> only to find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold <UNK> wife and the woman's vicious brother br br good production values a likable performance by mark damon and a <UNK> action packed script combine to make this an entertaining if not exceptionally deep above average addition to the spaghetti western genre br br co star <UNK> <UNK> is one of the <UNK> european babes ever to grace the screen here she's absolutely perfect as the cold hearted user and <UNK> of weak men br br damon and <UNK> appeared together in at least one other picture the devil's wedding night a pretty good horror movie that's of particular interest for those of you that want to see what's underneath <UNK> dresses
<START> br br what can i say this is one of the most perfect films ever made its a <UNK> to the <UNK> sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s but with a modern touch the screenplay bursts with wit charm humor and <UNK> the <UNK> is breathtaking nyc never looked so beautiful and of course there is the cast dudley moore turns in the performance of his career as <UNK> drunken arthur bach he is also <UNK> and real one of the film's best lines is his poignant not everyone who drinks is a poet some of us drink because we're not <UNK> the great sir john gielgud won a much deserved oscar for his splendid performance as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and caretaker although he considered it a take the money and run role he brings to the character all the talent experience and <UNK> of an expert <UNK> and a sly comedian the supporting cast is also out of <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> sassy grandma bach to stephen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the score is also extremely memorable and <UNK> the film perfectly the only real problem with the film is the ill <UNK> sequel it <UNK>
<START> i'm sorry to say that there isn't really any way in my opinion that an <UNK> would really be able to keep up with a <UNK> <UNK> twin <UNK> the power to weight advantage possessed by the <UNK> would just be too great the <UNK> has a power weight ratio of 3 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> while the <UNK> has 4 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> low end is much better too sorry <UNK> fans but the <UNK> just gets it done so much better br br as for other parts of this film i just have to say it's so <UNK> as to be pathetic the story is way too weak the acting in this <UNK> is worse than daytime <UNK> br br i can say that as far as it being a <UNK> on negative psychology its kind of a gem this film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what <UNK> and <UNK> are all about its all about these rich <UNK> getting their rocks off while showing only <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too br br i can't give the film a 1 star rating because it didn't <UNK> me to actually walk out of the theater i also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of <UNK> br br ps the guy who plays jason is <UNK> the <UNK> row version of james <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter br br this being a variation on the arthur <UNK> play about the same theme the director <UNK> the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact <UNK> the film has a sophisticated <UNK> look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own <UNK> br br the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one <UNK> a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere <UNK> as one <UNK> is the case with most of the people we encounter br br the acting is good under mr <UNK> direction steve <UNK> rosario dawson carol kane michael <UNK> adrian <UNK> and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive br br we wish mr mattei good luck and <UNK> <UNK> for his next work
<START> a well put together entry in the serial killer genre that unfortunately gets <UNK> down in its own <UNK> to be really satisfying willem dafoe is superb as a nyc detective trying to track down what appears to be a <UNK> using the same renaissance art related killing techniques used in a series of murders he solved years earlier scott <UNK> is <UNK> junior partner and they have pretty good chemistry at least for a while other characters pop up to conveniently tie the two cases together <UNK> <UNK> is the friend of an earlier victim and peter <UNK> is some sort of art <UNK> mentor to dafoe that's a bit hard to take although <UNK> is of course never dull the film's ending is particularly disappointing look fast for deborah harry as <UNK> less than <UNK> neighbor
<START> it's a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather <UNK> if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a <UNK> <UNK> or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong sudden impact is one of those cases where clint eastwood as star producer director shows when he can be at his best or at his <UNK> of times when dealing with a crime mystery detective story in his dirty harry fame we get that <UNK> my <UNK> line and un like in the first film where his <UNK> i feel <UNK> speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails here it's switched around he gets into another <UNK> with the department as usual when he tries to fight crime <UNK> way in particular with a diner robbery inspiration for pulp fiction and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus he's told to <UNK> a <UNK> and that's the last thing on his mind this whole main plot isn't very convincing aside from the <UNK> of the story and lines which just adds to the frustration but soon his story <UNK> with the sub plot that eastwood develops from the start br br enter sandra <UNK> character jennifer spencer whom we soon learn after some appropriately mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel <UNK> sexual assault <UNK> outright rape and is <UNK> undercover like getting revenge her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film the most intense and finally when it goes into <UNK> storyline he's getting facts in the same small town she's in on a murder the film finally finds a focus between eastwood's classic form of clearly defined good vs evil though sometimes <UNK> to be sure eastwood films the flashbacks not to say too much about them expertly in a fresh experimental style the trademark <UNK> <UNK> score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others it almost seems like a couple of times an art house sensibility has <UNK> into eastwood's firmly straightforward storytelling style which helps make the film watchable br br it's a shame though that in the end it goes more for the <UNK> or maybe not <UNK> points and until the third act callahan doesn't have much to do except his usual <UNK> smith <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> however with locke he gets out of her a very good performance more subtle and touching than the one in the <UNK> and an exciting climax at an amusement park in a way i do and don't agree with <UNK> remark that it's like a <UNK> <UNK> in eastwood's style here i admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both the <UNK> but the scenes where eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video it's cheesy it's hard edged it's not up to par with the first two <UNK> pictures but hey there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the <UNK>
<START> the us state <UNK> would not like us to see this movie because they have a <UNK> with the iranian <UNK> however it shows us just how <UNK> iran really is despite the content of the film which centers on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the <UNK> of terms the ability to watch a soccer game at the stadium which is strictly limited to male audiences alone the film is hilariously funny and in and of itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in iran i enjoyed this movie intensely five girls try to <UNK> the police border at the ticket gates to a soccer match between iran and <UNK> the ensuing comedy is too funny to describe from the bus trip to the stadium to the <UNK> of the police and subsequent <UNK> of the girls to the resulting end don't miss this classic film its a must see one of the best foreign films i've seen in years
<START> husbands beware is a remake of the <UNK> classic <UNK> <UNK> the film's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great the stooges are always funny when they cook however after the first few minutes of cooking footage we cut to original footage of <UNK> <UNK> one thing i noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they do fit with the new story they do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match br br husbands beware does have a new ending but i won't give it away to those who want to be surprised br br out of 4 stars
<START> generally i like something light and fun so this film shouldn't have <UNK> to me but it grabbed me from the start the story of a family's choices and challenges seem obvious but it raises the question over and over what if it was my family my choice i cried and laughed when they did because i really felt what the people involved felt it was in places difficult to watch but more difficult to turn away the story is true and life is sometimes difficult to watch it shows what film makers can do without sex violence or special effects a good story is a good story all by itself the best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones like real life you really don't know <UNK> happen next or why people do the things that they do
<START> i was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received but after viewing it i was terribly disappointed <UNK> is a totally unfunny film mixed with a todd <UNK> type of disturbing family reality sans <UNK> brand of humor the story drags along and each scene is worse than the last maybe i missed the point but if this film is an example of every girl's growing up experience i am glad to be a man
<START> i enjoyed a lot watching this movie it has a great direction by the already know <UNK> <UNK> born in spain and it is precisely in spain that the movie takes place in <UNK> to be more precise br br <UNK> explores once more the theme of an <UNK> in this case the <UNK> of a young boy for the women's milk there are some psychological concepts in this story such as the <UNK> complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother in the movie this is what leads to the <UNK> of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mother's milk go to the recently born son so he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him he finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around this br br this movie lives a lot on imagery more than the story itself the <UNK> captures certain moments unforgettable moments and certain symbols the movie deserves a <UNK> <UNK> on almost everything that happens because it usually means something the surroundings the landscapes typical from the region as well as the surreal <UNK> of the characters also symbolic and the <UNK> ambiguous soundtrack by <UNK> <UNK> transport us to another dimension not parallel to the real world but which <UNK> it from times to times worth living in that world worth watching this movie even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive <UNK> which is perhaps taken beyond the limits br br i also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist 8 10
<START> i'll admit to being biased when i reviewed this since it was my introduction to the series i saw this film for the first time in 2005 on the late night fear friday on <UNK> which often pulls obscure gems like this out of cold <UNK> for new generations i made it a point to watch the entire <UNK> anthology series before reviewing any of them here to make sure i had perspective looking back i still rate the house that <UNK> blood as my favorite followed closely by tales from the crypt and then asylum br br i think all of the elements that make this series charming the vintage '60s '70s style cinematography creepy to <UNK> far fetched tales and the utter <UNK> of it all right down the backing music came together better here than any of the others overall the movie centers around a very old english country house and the misfortune that <UNK> all that <UNK> within br br the first story involves a horror writer and his wife who moved into this secluded place to get a break from the city so he could concentrate on his passion he creates a murderous character called dominic and soon starts experiencing great difficulty telling reality from fiction there is a subtle <UNK> here via his torment that i found amusing yet creepy oh and those horrible prop teeth then again these are british actors maybe those were real br br the second story is the tale of a lonely old man peter cushing that has moved here to escape his loneliness yet it only <UNK> as he is haunted by lost love he seems to have found possible salvation at a local very creepy wax museum but it turns out he would have been much better off alone br br the third story includes the great christopher lee my <UNK> british horror actor as a single father with a rather disturbed and thoroughly creepy young daughter he is constantly <UNK> of her getting into things she shouldn't like witchcraft she has a natural talent for it with good reason lee is superb here as the ice cold <UNK> that man has a true talent for playing characters that are absolutely devoid of warmth but despite his best efforts the little <UNK> does in fact learn forbidden knowledge and bad things follow br br this final story is the tale of a cynical old veteran actor that feels the young director he's working with isn't <UNK> to capture a proper vampire film right down to the quality of the costumes and his cloak in particular so he goes to a old curiosity store in the middle of a <UNK> night to get something more authentic little does he know that he picked up a truly authentic <UNK> cloak putting it on at the stroke of midnight has rather noticeable effects by the time i had gotten to this fourth and final story it was after 3 am and i couldn't quite stay awake on the first try not from boredom but i did experience something that i have hundreds of times a curious bonding experience i have with films or music when i drift in and out of sleep and the film music becomes part of my dream great fun this bizarre story was perfect for that and seemed much scarier the first time than it actually was because i woke up right when he was <UNK> by the <UNK> power and couldn't quite comprehend was what happening at first not long after the lovely ingrid pitt a <UNK> on his movie set came to visit and he warned her not to put on the cloak at midnight but he <UNK> have bothered for she was a real vampire herself the <UNK> keyboard <UNK> that followed as she flew toward him on the <UNK> was simply hysterical and again in my half asleep state seemed rather confusing side note make sure to catch lee and pitt along with the stunning <UNK> star <UNK> <UNK> in the all time classic film the wicker man 1973 br br the weakest link here was the <UNK> commentary between stories but based on the stories themselves this is a classic <UNK> i would say the third story is best but i like the 4th most because it makes me smile so much very highly recommended for horror fans and if you're a british horror fan it's mandatory i'd say it's worthwhile to view the series in <UNK> order if you can the last film of this series monster club 1980 is certainly the weakest i think the first 3 4 films except for the at times mediocre torture garden 1967 are the best but if you like any of them you should watch them all at least once you'll probably be back many more times to watch your favorites
<START> don't mistake war inc for a <UNK> <UNK> satire or a <UNK> comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs it isn't br br this is an old fashioned screwball comedy with ridiculously <UNK> plot twists stock characters given some depth in fun performances by john cusack joan cusack marisa tomei and <UNK> duff and a straightforward approach to the political content br br you see the <UNK> political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true yeah we understand that the <UNK> <UNK> off the war are corrupt inept pigs the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept <UNK> and american <UNK> has never looked <UNK> and more out of touch than it does right now but none of that is the point br br here all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon sometimes in genius ways as the backdrop for a silly romp as john <UNK> character the hit man with a heart tries to change his life with the help of the do <UNK> journalist who doesn't trust him tomei and the young middle eastern <UNK> who wants to call off her marriage duff <UNK> sister joan plays his assistant with an almost <UNK> enthusiastic quality ben kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless cia boss br br that's all and it works it's simple fun but if somehow you can't see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there's no corruption and people in the middle east wish our western culture would <UNK> theirs then you might not find it as funny br br for all the rest of us it was a light comedy with a political edge
<START> there was not one single redeeming factor in this movie the girlfriend and i both love action films especially fight scenes <UNK> and <UNK> was awesome but this movie was not entertaining five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and angry facial expressions the main hero is a troubled character who has seen battle and thus is forced to look seriously <UNK> at all times the army has <UNK> his <UNK> movements on top of <UNK> his fighting technique the music isn't good either they fight to the rap and hip hop style of the streets 'cause these guys are thugs the rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise to low budget dramas br br everything about this movie is classic b style the actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left burning in some rotten hollywood <UNK> the film is called honor but there was no honor in making this film it was simply a waste of money and spending wisely is something i consider to be honorable br br go see <UNK> instead the fight scenes and situations are more real
<START> my child my sister dream br br how sweet all things would seem br br were we in that kind land to live together br br and there love slow and long br br there love and die among br br those scenes that image you that <UNK> weather br br charles <UNK> br br based on the novel by elizabeth von <UNK> <UNK> april can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four london women four strangers decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april it is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that enchanted april an ultimate feel good movie is perfection of its genre lovely and sunny tender and peaceful kind and magical it is like a ray of sun on your face during <UNK> when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of <UNK> happiness and <UNK> it forever this is the movie that actually affected my life i watched it during the difficult times when i was lost unhappy and very lonely when i had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some <UNK> truth about myself it helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible i had promised to myself then that no matter what i would pull myself out of misery and self pity and i would appreciate every minute of life with its joy and its sadness i promised myself that i would go to italy and later that year i did and i was not alone br br charming enchanting and heartwarming enchanted april is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love this little film is a diamond of highest quality
<START> i read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all bad i think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies if you are not a person that enjoyed the <UNK> or little house u will not understand nor enjoy these movies br br now about loves <UNK> joy i knew he was bad news from the start of the movie i wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think it this movie has a lot to do with jeff it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in girls br br i want to say that i have enjoyed all 4 movies so far was not crazy about the books cant wait until the next movie the way clark talks will get you every time i would love to see january jones do an appearance maybe a family reunion or something
<START> this movie shows a row of sketches which partly pass over into one another i realized the passing over late in the movie at first it only irritated me br br many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable <UNK> and simply try to <UNK> around that fact using absurdity and <UNK> the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails br br my <UNK> and maybe <UNK> result after watching this movie my god it hurts in my head every time i call it movie a bold attempt to turn nothing into something great but it failed at least the director made something out of nothing but it isn't something good br br many movies didn't turn out as funny as they were planned but this one tops them all it's the real life <UNK> of the worst case scenario of film making no to correct myself it's even worse than that a movie with gags so bad that they aren't funny at all it's not even fun to watch the lead actor writer and director all three the same guy by the way <UNK> by drowning in the sea of bad movies the movie is too bad for that
<START> this was truly a great movie i loved dennis quaid and the entire baseball team jay <UNK> is also a very likable actor that is very enjoyable to watch the chemistry the team had once they got things together was spectacular it just goes to show what you what can accomplish when minds <UNK> as one with one goal this team came back from the brink having multiple losing seasons to winning just about everything i love movies like this as they really are very inspirational br br on top of that dennis <UNK> character getting a place in the major <UNK> you can't do anything but root for this guy it just seems like when someone is supposed to do something they are going to do that things just happen to fall into place and makes everything click br br based on a true story this film will really make you think about the fact that nothing is impossible
<START> i can always tell when something is going to be a hit i see it or hear it and get a good feeling i did not get a good feeling watching the preview i was not at all enthusiastic about this film and i am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films i was in fact proved right br br the first thing that threw me off was the title not that i have a problem with <UNK> i am black by the way but for a movie they could have used a better title and for this time use a title that doesn't have bad <UNK> i heard the dialog saw the acting and all i could do was make faces br br i also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone at least you got served was better than this in my opinion even the soundtrack didn't thrill me
<START> it was 1974 and it starred martin sheen br br that alone says what to expect of this movie br br and it was a movie according to the movie <UNK> had <UNK> got a good woman and didn't want to fight br br in real life <UNK> may have been a naive innocent or he may have just wanted to manipulate the system br br whoever <UNK> was or wasn't is for history to decide but this was a movie that dealt with <UNK> at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting and the movie took sides br br with no regard to <UNK> who were in <UNK> <UNK> either in 1974 as willie nelson would say let's tell the truth it was about the <UNK> <UNK> war not wwii <UNK> was as <UNK> as <UNK> ho was in the forties br br according to this movie <UNK> stated his position plain and simple he had a nervous problem heck i have a <UNK> nervous condition and trust me if i had done military duty it would have been no problem for me to either just let my nerves go and fail at my tasks and get a <UNK> or put on <UNK> duty or <UNK> duty with no problem br br if we believe the <UNK> <UNK> didn't have that option no doubt because of his criminal history br br whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer i've learned that movies from this decade or that decade in dealing with service or military duty will pretty much take the same stance over and over br br 1940s and 1950s serve your country br br 1960s and 1970s mock your country br br this is the history br br the whole movie seemed predictably hollywood to me he refused to serve and only when he was being <UNK> up to be executed does he show emotion br br such an emotional <UNK> could have easily worked to his advantage in his <UNK> of his nervous condition but obviously the movie wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become <UNK> br br i'm not a catholic but i thought the <UNK> of the <UNK> mary by ned beatty and sheen at the end with the <UNK> <UNK> was funny as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster br br i don't see how this movie could be watched without realizing it was aimed at <UNK> dick <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> war br br i hope it was all worth it for <UNK> and anyone who chose to follow his example
<START> warning does contain spoilers br br open your eyes br br if you have not seen this film and plan on doing so just stop reading here and take my word for it you have to see this film i have seen it four times so far and i still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film that is all i am going to say because if you have not seen this film then stop reading right now br br if you are still reading then i am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think br br i remember my grade 11 english teacher quite well his name was mr <UNK> to me he was wise beyond his years and he always had this <UNK> way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on if we didn't like shakespeare then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it our class room was never a room it was a <UNK> and we were on the lake reading a book at our own <UNK> time this was his own <UNK> way of <UNK> something into our <UNK> like minds br br i begin this review of vanilla sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly <UNK> in my mind like the phone number of a long lost best friend and it finally made some sense to me after watching the matrix now if i didn't know better i would have thought that the <UNK> brothers were really just an <UNK> for my teacher mr <UNK> but giving them the benefit of the doubt we'll assume it wasn't him but that was the first time this assignment was anything more than <UNK> br br he had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real show me how you can tell that you are real this got the class <UNK> off all of the usual ideas that i'm sure you can imagine everything from pain to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of <UNK> were <UNK> off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real after every scenario that we gave him he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless br br what if you are nothing but someone else's dream br br what if you were someone else's dream what a messed up question that is this was a question scenario <UNK> to us about 15 years ago before the <UNK> use of the internet and rapid <UNK> of computers how possible could it seem back then but if you look at today's technology now ask yourself what it you were a part of someone else's dream br br another brilliant but surreal film this year david lynch's <UNK> drive explored similar areas but vanilla sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to in short this is one film that will literally if you let it blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you br br open your eyes br br tom cruise plays david <UNK> a young hot shot righteous full of himself <UNK> and owner of several magazines he inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business <UNK> his board of <UNK> the seven <UNK> think he is a rich <UNK> born with a silver <UNK> in his mouth they feel he has done nothing to deserve the <UNK> of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them br br early in the film we meet one of david's gorgeous toys named julie <UNK> played with <UNK> but <UNK> perfection by cameron diaz david and julie play a good game both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a <UNK> committed relationship this is the type of relationship <UNK> with david's other <UNK> he's had in the sexual prime of his life and although both talk a good game we can tell that only one is really telling the truth br br next we meet brian <UNK> played with a stroke of genius by kevin smith's good buddy jason lee brian is writing a book that david is going to <UNK> but they are also very good friends this is something that david has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film brian has one famous line that he keeps telling david over and over again and that is the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter he goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to <UNK> with all of the <UNK> who inhabit his bed for a night or two br br at david's huge birthday bash so huge that the likes of steven spielberg wish him a happy birthday brian enters with his date <UNK> <UNK> played of course by penelope <UNK> with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress this is a bash by invite only and at first david and <UNK> seem intrigued with one another and in typical david fashion despite his best friend being there he begins to <UNK> with <UNK> to <UNK> things julie shows up <UNK> and begins <UNK> on david david then spends the night with <UNK> but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another there is no <UNK> <UNK> the next day as david is leaving <UNK> apartment he is <UNK> by julie who offers him a ride and from there well i think we have all seen the commercials br br that is all i will really say about the plot because from here the film <UNK> us with what is reality and what is <UNK> perception we are introduced to a character played by kurt <UNK> and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this <UNK> like <UNK> there is a subtext of death and possible <UNK> like cure <UNK> that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life this is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us but it doesn't end there br br like many movies seem to <UNK> on today this film has a secret sixth sense may have began this <UNK> but look even further back and you can maybe thank angel heart for starting the <UNK> regardless of how it <UNK> vanilla sky has one of it's own <UNK> gut <UNK> and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an <UNK> solution to the <UNK> of truth and lies you have just put yourself through i have seen this film four times and every time it has been because i want to see if there is something more i can pick up something more i can understand to be able to work your mind in the theater to <UNK> it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film all of the <UNK> so called best pictures of the year have been good but nothing spectacular they lack substance a beautiful mind was intriguing but flat the royal <UNK> was interesting but uneven vanilla sky is a <UNK> because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet <UNK> your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it i know this film has received mixed reviews but i just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it br br this is what film making is supposed to be like this is what a film is supposed to do to you it is supposed to make you feel something most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces this one isn't br br 10 out of 10 the best film of the year i would love to see this get nominated for best picture and i would love to see <UNK> up for best actress diaz for best supporting cruise for best actor and jason <UNK> should be a shoe in for best supporting actor cameron <UNK> should there as well none of this may come to pass and that is a shame this is one film that should not be missed br br and on a final note i am quite sure mr <UNK> would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question can you prove you are real or are we just a <UNK> of someone's imagination are we <UNK> <UNK> for someone else's <UNK> this is a film that <UNK> more questions than it does answers and i'm sure that is just fine with him br br open your eyes
<START> maybe i've seen one too many crime flick or maybe i don't take the right drugs br br this was the most cliché ridden plot <UNK> plot absurd just plain stupid movie i have seen in a long time br br as for the direction it looks like it took less time to show this than it did to put it together br br in fact it looks like to made it straight to video before it was completed br br it's a bad rip off of m the classic fritz lang film starring peter lorre you'd be so much better off renting that instead
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen i was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car scenes races what i got was nothing the racing scene are so low budget they <UNK> them up to make it look like the cars are going fast in one scene a <UNK> <UNK> goes from over 200 to 0 in like 4 seconds by just spinning around in circles its just ridiculous br br if you wanna see a real movie about cars see the fast and the furious series they may be a little cheesy but <UNK> better than this movie could ever hope to be better yet just watch <UNK> 3000 the best car movie ever made i think
<START> if you're watching this movie you're either a fred <UNK> ray fan you found it on the 4 99 shelf at <UNK> and thought what do i have to lose or you <UNK> around the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touched br br this movie is hysterically bad it's got everything a terrible movie needs a screenplay featuring jaw dropping dialogue and <UNK> <UNK> in the plot wacky science involving <UNK> and other <UNK> continuity that seems to travel through <UNK> in time and space actors that are not only wooden but seems to border on <UNK> gratuitous nudity not all of it is what you necessarily would ask for and of course a <UNK> monster played by what i assume is fred <UNK> <UNK> kid br br underneath it all however there is something resembling heart as if mickey judy decided to get together all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie hey my dad can direct it yeah we can use red paint from my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> store and i know this ex stripper who can act in it br br watch for the <UNK> reel over the credits you get to find out why the final cut of the movie was so crappy br br incidentally <UNK> ii the alien force is also worth a look but doesn't have the same <UNK> crappy <UNK> this one does
<START> although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special br br if you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney's <UNK> <UNK> from the film they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a <UNK> for so many other films and film makers br br i've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten which is where a good portion of this film <UNK> because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end from the point from the departure of the <UNK> to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting it doesn't kill the film but it does <UNK> it br br still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie
<START> please even if you are in the worst of the <UNK> <UNK> from watching this flick br br i don't think whether anything was right with this movie at all on a friend's recommendation i watched this and i literally <UNK> <UNK> and 48 min of my life down the closet poor acting stupid direction weak storyline and pathetic action sequences and when you blend this together you get double impact even least of the expectations were not met br br i guess i did learn one thing never watch van damme action flicks they are pure <UNK> of time
<START> it was jon pertwee who said it s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly well if that s the case <UNK> faces is very easy david baker as director screenwriter and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior <UNK> like lock stock and <UNK> using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very <UNK> alan <UNK> especially suffers from this type of <UNK> performance but not enough to ruin the film because there s not enough of a film to ruin br br <UNK> faces is terrible on all <UNK> especially <UNK> i <UNK> t understand why it ended the way it did it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner oh and other glaring errors are that you need a <UNK> to visit the usa and a green card in order to work there this film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in america without any <UNK> that you still get paid to <UNK> blood in america people who i know in america and who <UNK> blood tell me <UNK> for <UNK> stopped several years ago and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop as far as i know gun laws in america <UNK> from state to state but no gun <UNK> sell anti tank guns over the counter so we <UNK> got a very <UNK> view of america from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film maybe this is revenge for braveheart a very hollywood view of the <UNK> perhaps but this <UNK> t stop <UNK> faces from being a crap comedy
<START> a good deal of running around a badly conceived <UNK> with very little complexity a scientist who works in <UNK> sending off <UNK> into space and receiving them gets caught up with aliens along with his pretty wife he <UNK> their territory and is given secrets about them he becomes rather <UNK> in the process granted he is given little choice anyway there is a scene where he gives them everything they want this is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens the plot isn't technically bad it's just that we are usually following a car a trip through a woods investigating a building this is what editing is all about i suppose the story wouldn't technically support much more not much here
<START> before i begin let me tell you how great this stand up special sounds when you play <UNK> adventure i <UNK> director's cut at the same time red mountain level in particular so while watching this stand up special i suggest no demand you do it br br carlos <UNK> takes his stand up to the extreme in san francisco california there he makes fun of everybody with absolutely no apologies br br i am pretty much <UNK> god here that carlos didn't do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over and over and over and over again he does a tremendous job making fun of everyone and at the same time be truthful about it i know a couple of times i said after carlos said a joke damn this guy makes a good point and then the game over screen came over my tv because i forgot i was playing <UNK> adventure i <UNK> director's cut my bad so yeah there's nothing to complain about this stand up special if you have <UNK> or something like that please do yourself a favor and record this historic hour
<START> well i rented this movie and found out it <UNK> sucks it is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a photo to damaged building and weird things and weird movie and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agrees etc etc etc they go to that town which no one know it exists blah blah blah and the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you don't understand what is that movie i have seen many mystery movies but that was the worst honestly it doesn't have a description at all and i wish i didn't see it
<START> this was recently on <UNK> vibrant movie classics and i had to laugh i had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of voyage to the <UNK> core and mysterious island i was sorely disappointed not only in the acting <UNK> but in the silly story line that reads from a five year <UNK> comic book be sure to catch sight of the <UNK> that are holding on to the <UNK> wings when they grasp <UNK> a half idiot pre modern man who befriends the lost <UNK> the ending left it open for further <UNK> of the same effects in people that time forgot don't waste your time
<START> the story of a woman ann on her death bed her two daughters nina and <UNK> and her thoughts about her past the flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young ann is in the wedding of her friend <UNK> at the wedding she meets harris who will impact her for the rest of her life through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love her daughter <UNK> is older more responsible a mother of two and has things together nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life br br first of all the good the period detail in the movie is great the dresses hair cars houses etc really put you in another time and place and there is some very quality acting in the movie vanessa redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end claire danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young and she is an outstanding singer hugh <UNK> brought a lot of life to the character of <UNK> brother buddy br br now for the bad which unfortunately is everything else things constantly <UNK> the story as it is being <UNK> for us the chemistry between young ann and buddy is great they have fun and dance then you are supposed to believe that she doesn't really like him more than a friend and that his <UNK> only <UNK> her and i thought the whole he might be gay thing was out of the blue and didn't serve a purpose br br then we have harris the character acts wooden and creepy had this been another genre you would have known that harris was the serial killer from the get go it is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out br br and the <UNK> problem of all why don't ann and harris get together they fall for each other they have this great night of sex in an old dirty <UNK> shack come home to find out about <UNK> tragic end and then br br nothing br br they meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and i couldn't help but wondering why why the movie doesn't let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so i had a hard time feeling sorry for them br br the part of the story in the present is fairly boring the cliché good daughter and the cliché bad daughter nina changes over the course of the movie but i am not sure why i'm not sure what convinces her to change her life there is a touching scene where the daughters are connecting that <UNK> with old ann dreaming she's chasing a <UNK> it is really lame and embarrassing br br there are no mistakes ann <UNK> at us the statement doesn't ring true with the story and it doesn't ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn't wasted the talent of such good actors
<START> first up this film according to the slick said it won best film at <UNK> film festival in <UNK> texas hmmm must have been a quiet year br br wouldn't call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks is pretty much just as terrible as other aussie b <UNK> body melt but at least that film didn't look like it was shot on hi 8 video br br my guess is the film makers watched a lot of troma films and really bad b grade gore films thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film br br don't get me wrong i love really low grade films just the fact that some of the characters put on fake american accents almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something really disappointing ending as well the showdown could have been way more exciting and some good fight scenes you can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy bad taste with the whole car explosion rocket <UNK> and endless amount of people being <UNK> down yet the finale lacks any over the top humour or style like bad taste br br if you like watching really bad gore films or are interested in no budget film making watch it otherwise stay away

<START> i think i've seen worse films so i'm giving this a 3 but it's a struggle to remember what they could have been possibly <UNK> nasty dull or possibly creep just plain dull but it is a struggle to think of something worse it's difficult to know where to start let's just say it's a poor man's under siege starring an even <UNK> man's jean claude van damme the only redeeming feature was seeing casper van <UNK> i always wondered what happened to him after starship troopers yes he was johnny rico if you really want to know br br judging from this site he's been stuck in tv movie hell casper be more <UNK> please <UNK> i've just turned over and there's a half decent film on called criminal law now i'm beginning to get really <UNK> about the last 1 <UNK>
<START> the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didn't have to pay for it i saw it for free at college and if a college student can't find humor in something that was free it's hopeless br br stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent yet <UNK> set design that goes out of its way to market <UNK> <UNK> i don't know what michaels myers was doing in this movie but i have never seen anything more depressing this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch which has its opponents but i enjoyed it very much it's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to <UNK> it br br you want a funny seuss adaptation go with the grinch
<START> a very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of boston and <UNK> park as a baseball fan and light movie addict it hit a <UNK> for me plenty of laughs and plenty of authentic baseball scenes with real <UNK> and real references to past <UNK> failures and how enjoyable was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an <UNK> over the hill self serving kevin <UNK> attempting to make <UNK> out of a critical audience jimmy and drew did a fine job as a young love struck couple suffering from <UNK> <UNK> jones it was a bit <UNK> and out of left field but there really are sox fans that are that fanatic and live their lives through the <UNK> of their beloved team the movie <UNK> along at a fast pace and the ending although predictable had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies without being overly pretentious br br also enjoyable was the return of willie <UNK> to the screen i miss the forever popular <UNK> <UNK> from sex the city he's always funny even when he does or says very little br br so buy yourself two box seats some popcorn and get ready for a fun time fever pitch is a winner
<START> this is the first american film to successfully adopt the <UNK> style used by europeans particularly the french and <UNK> for at least a decade and isn't it about time following three high school girls in the crown heights neighborhood of brooklyn during the last days of their summer break between <UNK> and <UNK> years it does what all good art should it discovers the universal in the particular even though the girls' <UNK> are <UNK> conventional boys sex popularity money freedom and clothes we glimpse how their whole lives are being shaped the universal <UNK> between character and destiny br br the <UNK> is whole complete the film <UNK> stays in the moment <UNK> real time the story tells itself the medium and its <UNK> for once are not the message the film <UNK> <UNK> conveys the childhood perspective of its characters it does not <UNK> its own adult meanings or morals details emerge of their own are never pushed and thus seem all the more real and powerful for their understatement even though great pains have been taken to capture the authentic social reality of crown heights part of the largest black ghetto in new york city and one of the most dangerous violent places in the us the subject is childhood in the ghetto not the ghetto itself br br documentary footage of the practice sessions of a <UNK> band the jackie robinson <UNK> <UNK> the film at regular <UNK> with an explosion of color movement and sound otherwise the camera stays very close very intimate a patient sly and <UNK> <UNK> the language is rich spontaneous the acting transparent some scenes standout such as the girls <UNK> about each revealing her deepest fantasies <UNK> confession of her acceptance of a death by random violence is the most shocking one of the deepest <UNK> of the ghetto her sharing with her mother her confusion and fear before the stark challenges of adult life is equally moving and beautifully <UNK> <UNK> br br social realities are respected not <UNK> all three girls are being raised by single <UNK> only one <UNK> has a father active in her life and not <UNK> of the three she is the most emotionally stable and <UNK> to others and the one with the most self respect two of them suffer from <UNK> a disease <UNK> prevalent in the inner city <UNK> an accepted daily <UNK> only <UNK> <UNK> their conversation only one of the girls joy feels hope for feels she has control over the future while the other two to varying degrees have already accepted despair br br this is by far the best dramatic american film i've seen in years see it see it see it
<START> after a long hard week behind the desk making all those <UNK> serious decisions this movie is a great way to relax like wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci fi <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> died in the great charge of the <UNK> he was a brave man ' the jack nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket and always remember to beware of the <UNK> of death ' keep in mind the number one rule of this movie suspension of disbelief sit back and relax and <UNK> to die earth <UNK> ' you just have to see it for yourself
<START> it came by surprise the impact <UNK> this film had on my automatic way of being <UNK> to people situations most vividly was the stirring of the emotion anger much like the way a spoiled child would be when <UNK> to not getting their way a temper <UNK> if you will thinking i was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all what was this <UNK> me <UNK> much love <UNK> many <UNK> now i'm present to how incredible <UNK> myself feels and having an ongoing attitude of <UNK> for life for what is happening in the moment without my wild expectations for life to be a particular way the way i think life or people should be this film has contributed to the freedom i now feel to connect with others without limits expectations and to connect with genuine love without fear of loss just to love first and accept what love is given
<START> i love columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot a mind <UNK> tedious pointless muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored looking peter falk the <UNK> such as it is just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with one part of the proceedings which i found extremely puzzling or possibly annoying was peter <UNK> character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as <UNK> columbo if the producers insist on keeping <UNK> first name a secret why couldn't they have <UNK> this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous like i said this is the <UNK> and all true columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague
<START> dreadful horror sequel to the howling this picks off with karen <UNK> funeral she was killed at the end of the first film <UNK> <UNK> christopher lee sadly arrives there and tells <UNK> brother ben <UNK> brown that karen was a werewolf he's going to <UNK> to kill <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the head werewolf ben and a <UNK> of <UNK> annie <UNK> join him br br a terrible script bad direction inept editing and truly horrendous acting by brown and <UNK> single <UNK> sink this one the werewolf effects are mostly kept in the dark for good reason they're terrible when you see them <UNK> special effects also although i did like the cartoon lightning that comes from <UNK> fingers there's also a werewolf orgy which is particularly stupid and <UNK> takes off her top at least eight times during the closing credits br br there are a few good things i found the village in <UNK> amusing it looks like it came from a universal horror flick from the 1930s there are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes brown and <UNK> have good bodies and lee and <UNK> are good in this but they can't save it really why did they do this where that they hard up for money this is one of <UNK> lowest rated movies that alone should tell you something supposedly <UNK> was horrified when she saw the movie i can understand why a must miss
<START> a perfect little atrocity i doubt if a single shot lasted for more then the <UNK> mtv 4 4 seconds <UNK> casting worse even than in <UNK> version a reminder he managed to miscast juliet <UNK> and ralph <UNK> but hey the rich got what they deserved dark and brooding <UNK> reduced to the state of a golden locked angel <UNK> and <UNK> catherine presented as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> meek and weak <UNK> is a <UNK> tom and innocent <UNK> becomes sara michelle <UNK> character from cruel intentions 15 year old eddie bauer and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> take notice this thing was made for you it is an hour and a half long music video where everything is given to you you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters but even from initial shock at their actions the actors tried but as i stated before they were <UNK> decent photography but editing is on the level of tv production class in high school i <UNK> you all read the book or the <UNK> even watch the previous versions of it even <UNK> but stay away from the numerous future reruns during which you will not receive the benefit of the commercial free premiere
<START> this really was the worst movie i have ever seen michael <UNK> is hot but who is this woman and she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie the hair is so bad they talk in like <UNK> voices and there is <UNK> chemistry the cover of the dvd does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is really really boring i had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch i really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good <UNK> they literally just like talk and say yeah and there is no passion whatsoever i could not tell at all that they were in love i'm sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie i think i have ever seen
<START> before he became defined as nick charles in the thin man series william powell played another <UNK> detective named philo vance the supporting cast is strong in this early <UNK> and <UNK> star quality is evident mary <UNK> who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of <UNK> <UNK> does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all
<START> what a dog of a movie <UNK> <UNK> performance is quite good but it sits amidst a jungle of <UNK> <UNK> mediocre direction and wooden acting from the bulk of the cast many of the characters are woefully miscast particularly the ever overrated colin <UNK> br br very little works in this pretentious garbage much of the character development is done through a silly angst ridden voice over and frequently completely <UNK> the behaviour of characters on screen in fact it's hard to even figure out who the voice overs are talking about because they describe such different characters to who we see on screen how are we meant to know colin <UNK> <UNK> is meant to be an <UNK> violent and <UNK> <UNK> one of these silly voice overs tells us for crying out loud the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a <UNK> voice over the real killer is the characters everything about them their clothes are perfectly <UNK> and look fresh from the rack despite the fact we are constantly reminded they are meant to be artsy <UNK> they are all <UNK> well spoken for <UNK> none seem to have any real <UNK> of life on the <UNK> or on <UNK> and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them br br monkey grip deserves no more attention than a <UNK> tv movie <UNK> <UNK> like this perfectly well shot and technically presented but a cliché driven <UNK> drama that shoots so wide of being plausible and <UNK> about for hours without really going anywhere at least <UNK> gets down to her birthday suit at every given opportunity there's no other sane reason to endure this junk
<START> there is a story possibly <UNK> about an exchange between bruce willis and terry gilliam at the start of twelve monkeys gilliam allegedly produced a long list think about the aircraft one from the fifth element and handed it to butch bruce it was entitled things bruce willis does when he acts it ended with a simple message saying please don't do any of the above in my movie br br there is a fact about this movie definitely true gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing br br i would <UNK> that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary if not commercial success that is the twelve monkeys br br visually the twelve monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a gilliam film it is also full of <UNK> <UNK> and general but magnificent <UNK> gilliam <UNK> in wrong <UNK> his audience although the ending of the twelve monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real gilliam borrows heavily from <UNK> in the clockwork <UNK> relentless movement of the characters towards their fate it is this journey and the character developments they <UNK> which <UNK> br br i love gilliam films brazil in particular but they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness he seems to have so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his films almost <UNK> end up as a <UNK> mess brazil in particular i still maintain that brazil is <UNK> tour de force but there's no denying that the twelve <UNK> is a breath of fresh air in the tight plotting department style substance and form seem to <UNK> in a way not usually seen from the ex python br br whatever the truth of the <UNK> above gilliam also manages to get a first rate and very <UNK> performance out of the bald one bruce is excellent in this film as are all the cast particularly a suitably <UNK> and very scary brad pitt br br it's been over a decade since this film was released when i watched it again i realised that it hadn't really aged i had changed of course and this made me look at the film with fresh eyes this seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that partly at least is about <UNK> in mirrors altered perspectives and the absurd one way journey through time that we all make a first rate film 8 10
<START> a cinderella story made for adults who live in <UNK> the romance is very unrealistic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perfect etc the cinderella plot till the very end and shahid kapoor is the only reason for my stars if you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist this is definitely you're movie but for the rest of us real world people i'd highly recommend saving your three hour watch time wake up people br br four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film we had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes maybe i'm missing something i just can't believe a movie like this can beat a classic like <UNK>
<START> i don't know if this is a sitcom or not but i agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever it's great that this show still <UNK> and i love michelle it's cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked and she sometimes said something funny <UNK> br br this show can relate to children and teens and well families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family i don't know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone br br i love the episode when i think her name is <UNK> the older girl accidentally stole a <UNK> and she learned a lesson about stealing that was a great episode an example that this tv show shows the family working things out as a family br br i recommend this show for everyone
<START> checking the spoiler alert just in case br br perhaps one of the most horrendous movies i have ever seen <UNK> and monsters felt like i wasted 101 minutes of my life the only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious but just ended up being funny since they were so bad evil dead anyone unfortunately for m m fortunately for us it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy this movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character <UNK> played by hanks encountered throughout the film it ended up being a fear <UNK> video about stereotypes that helped fuel the d d is the devil movement in the 80s br br if you want to avoid wasting your time and money steer clear of this junk br br p s even though the cover looks kinda interesting which is why i guess my brother bought it it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm unless you consider new england or new york city to be such a place
<START> sam thomas <UNK> and gray heather graham are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things ballroom dancing 1940s movie musicals and much to their surprise an attractive woman named charlie bridget <UNK> historically <UNK> gray is confused by her new feelings br br gray matters proves to be one of the <UNK> films i have ever seen it's dull predictable unfunny poorly acted and poorly written nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy also this isn't really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a coming out movie sue kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part unfortunately she failed miserably the first half was largely unfunny and only heather graham was able to hold it up a little then the film took an awkward tone and got all serious the serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phony br br i guess i would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic the brother and sister relationship was very weak and they didn't really appear to be that close their relationship just didn't feel very natural also the relationship between tom and bridget felt very unnatural if two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in vegas in the same manner of asking a <UNK> what the <UNK> are there was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such <UNK> characters br br the acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast heather graham gave the only good performance in the movie she was funny and had a few charming scenes but it's too bad that all of her co stars were complete <UNK> bridget <UNK> was very weak and her performance <UNK> false on every level also it seemed like she was reading her lines thomas <UNK> was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion the chemistry between thomas and heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony i can usually rely on molly shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying sissy <UNK> had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them finally alan <UNK> just had an embarrassing character and his performance wasn't very good overall gray matters is a lame film and it isn't worth watching rating 3 10
<START> the movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story kill kill would have been nice the movie <UNK> taboo scenes to make the viewer move back in their <UNK> the scenes are unnecessary and choppy the movie is something a <UNK> screen writer could have <UNK> just a waste of movie props and network money i have to write 10 lines of text to critique this film when it is not worth 10 lines of my time but i have to push on to let the people know to avoid the nonsense if people are counting on you to choose a good movie for movie night pick something else if you have a soul don't damage it by <UNK> yourself to this filth
<START> academy award winner robert redford best director ordinary people 1980 captures the <UNK> of the montana wilderness and the strength of the american family in this acclaimed adaptation of norman <UNK> classic <UNK> br br craig <UNK> stars as the young norman and brad pitt stars as his brother paul an irresistible <UNK> driven to challenge the world br br growing up both boys rebel against their stern minister father tom <UNK> br br while norman channels his rebellion into writing paul <UNK> a <UNK> path to self destruction br br also starring emily lloyd as wild hearted jessie burns br br the film won an academy award for best <UNK> in 1993
<START> this movie is so cheap it's endearing with ron <UNK> major vaughn providing the most entertaining on screen <UNK> in film history i own 2 copies of this movie on video on one ralph <UNK> is caught actually cracking up in the background at major <UNK> while he is <UNK> at <UNK> obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film but it goes to show just how funny the movie is when the actors themselves can't keep a straight face
<START> i am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really <UNK> westerns or war dramas even star wars which is visually brilliant has one of its central images a futuristic gang that couldn't shoot straight imagine your coming upon about <UNK> people with conventional weapons most of them having an open shot and they miss br br i have read much science fiction and wish there were more movies for the thinking person forbidden planet one of the earliest of the genre is still one of the very best the story is based on a long <UNK> civilization the <UNK> who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps unfortunately what they hadn't <UNK> for is that the brain is a center for other thoughts than intellectual the primitive aspect of the brain the id as <UNK> called it is allowed to go <UNK> it is released in sleep a bad dream come to <UNK> existence walter <UNK> dr <UNK> is the one who has <UNK> his brain to this level and with it has built machines and <UNK> that keep him barely one step ahead of the horrors of the <UNK> of his own mind his thoughts are creating horrors that he soon will not be able to defend the <UNK> a much superior species could not stop it it destroyed them the landing party has never been of great interest to me the rest of the actors are pretty <UNK> ann francis is beautiful and naive and certainly would have produced quite a reaction in the fifties adolescent male her father's <UNK> is <UNK> by her innocence and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for they are more like construction workers on the make than real <UNK> they are always trying to figure out <UNK> the cook is a great character with his obsession for <UNK> <UNK> the robot has much more personality than most of the crew and one wonders if mr spock may not be a <UNK> to the literal thinking of this artificial creature the whole movie is very satisfying because the situation is the star <UNK> can't turn back and so he is destined to destroy himself and everything with him there are few science fiction films that are worth seeing more than once this is one that can coast right into the 21st century
<START> superman and the mole men is quite possibly <UNK> <UNK> adventures ever br br lois lane and clark kent are sent to <UNK> home of the world's deepest oil well while there some <UNK> mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town jeff corey and many other <UNK> try to <UNK> of the <UNK> mole men can superman change the people's ways in time to save the mole men can superman warn the people in time about the <UNK> danger the mole men bring br br in my opinion superman and the mole men is a very intelligent well written and well acted movie even though we only get to see superman fly once briefly it still makes a great superman adventure a must see for anyone br br 10 10 stars
<START> kurt russell is strong and mostly silent in this futuristic action thriller from paul anderson event horizon resident evil set on a garbage dump planet soldier plays like a cross between rambo and <UNK> with russell barely speaking as the title character an <UNK> genetic soldier left for dead the supporting cast of <UNK> including connie <UNK> sean pertwee and a surprisingly <UNK> michael <UNK> is able they spend most of the movie being scared of russell and the rest of it running for their lives <UNK> performance here is one of the best he's ever given with almost no words to say he conveys emotion feeling and meaning with looks and <UNK> it is almost a <UNK> performance when the action sequences kick into gear he kicks ass and does so in a strong silent matter of fact way there are flaws jason scott lee is <UNK> as a superior genetic soldier jason <UNK> does a great impression of frank burns from m a s h as a <UNK> commanding officer and gary busey <UNK> a gut and nearly <UNK> his <UNK> as <UNK> mentor this is an underrated and excellent sci fi flick and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of blade runner david <UNK> peoples wrote both screenplays
<START> i've been a fan of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tsui for many year since school this film is the best fantasy movie in years i dont think action is the right genre though <UNK> lot of action and <UNK> <UNK> wait did i mentioned this is an oriental fantasy <UNK> please keep in mind that do not use hollywood formula to rate this film and for the guy who poo around i don't blame you 'cause you still young and need to know more about culture
<START> this is actually one of my favorite films i would recommend that everyone watches it there is some great acting in it and it shows that not all good films are american
<START> the <UNK> implies that warren beatty and goldie hawn are pulling off a huge bank robbery but that's not what i got out of it i didn't get anything in the first half there's a new character without introduction in every other scene the first half hour is completely incomprehensible the rest is just one long annoying <UNK> chase scene there's always an irritating sound in the background whether it's a loud watch <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> a train <UNK> or even the horrible score by <UNK> jones there are a lot of parts that are laughably bad too like the bad guys chasing beatty on thin ice with a car or the police arriving at the scene roughly fifteen times i really hated this movie
<START> a very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who <UNK> his <UNK> on <UNK> and must come home and re <UNK> himself with the help of family and friends an excellent cast of actor's helps make this movie very entertaining <UNK> <UNK> role as the girlfriend was worthy of an oscar nomination she has such an innocence to her in this movie ann <UNK> role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles i especially like the hometown aura of pre war <UNK> the hunting scene is very good of course the war scene on <UNK> truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle a well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten
<START> veteran <UNK> bruno mattei is at it again with this erotic thriller that clearly echoes joel <UNK> <UNK> but as expected mattei does his movie on a <UNK> budget so that it already looks obscure when it's newly released br br after her daughter gets <UNK> a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography because the <UNK> belong to an international organization that direct snuff films as long as the <UNK> <UNK> pay well the search for her daughter does not only lead the mother across europe but also into prostitution she goes to bed with some guys to get her clues when she finally reaches contact with the snuff organization lead by the mysterious doctor <UNK> she's getting into great danger herself br br there is not much good to say about this one even though it starts promising problem is that the movie is by far not as sleazy or explicit as one might expect from the director who made films like blade violent snuff trap which was first released in russia is neither gory enough nor does it contain the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewer's attention the plot isn't that special either except maybe for the surprisingly many different locations throughout europe the ending is hugely disappointing the acting isn't really remarkable either except for anita <UNK> who plays doctor <UNK> she looks and acts extremely creepy you don't want to meet her like this in a dark alley or your bedroom for that matter br br all in all snuff trap only appeals to <UNK> of bruno <UNK> films but it's good to see the man back on the <UNK> again it was his first thriller since <UNK> giallo <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is very much like <UNK> you know that dance flick with jennifer <UNK> that film is probably the most boring film i have ever seen since it's not even bad enough to be funny g i jane is much better than that film but that doesn't say much here <UNK> moore <UNK> a lot and there's high music and we get to see her fight and everything but it is certainly not very engaging i really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting but the script is too clichéd and <UNK> scott can't do anything about that well like i said it's better than <UNK> 4 10
<START> the most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it the characters were stereotypical white trash the movie's plot was <UNK> from the beginning and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body <UNK> it was funny <UNK> that was the only funny thing in the movie ms <UNK> would be better served if in the future she would <UNK> from using her life story to entertain people it was simply that bad the one positive aspect of this movie this has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the film is that my brother <UNK> out the money for this stinker
<START> is it a remake <UNK> the thing 1982 1951 i think it is there are so many factors from <UNK> previous movies do deny it br br so the acting is bad james <UNK> does a <UNK> stargate re <UNK> of himself with his <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> strange thinking movements but that's about it the other actors i <UNK> even <UNK> you don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters and the plot <UNK> is slow boring and <UNK> i know what is about to <UNK> in <UNK> score music is <UNK> <UNK> there are alot of <UNK> people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit but this is major crap some of the special effects are nice if it was made in early 90's if you like slimy aliens chills and thrills don't <UNK> this movie its a dull combination of the thing alien 3 <UNK> and some jerry bruckheimer michael bay production gone really really bad now this combination would be cool if <UNK> knew what they where doing and the only ones on this production that knew that was no one br br though i have seen far worse i would not <UNK> this movie to anyone but if you are up one cold night and just wanna <UNK> at something it will pass the time slowly
<START> the write word br br what you see is what you get not really what <UNK> <UNK> brave and brilliant <UNK> <UNK> does is destroy the myth attached to the <UNK> and <UNK> that colour the pages of our <UNK> and whose lives read party <UNK> we follow with such <UNK> <UNK> which only our <UNK> <UNK> streak can explain br br the page 3 phenomenon is as <UNK> as it is enigmatic how exactly did it gain such control over the <UNK> word and when did it start to <UNK> into the front page is subject for another debate <UNK> cleverly avoids that he is concerned only with the <UNK> of this grotesque existence and in doing that he pieces together the various elements of this way of life like robert altman although i'm not comparing <UNK> to altman's genius <UNK> uses <UNK> characters to further his motive whether it is a page 3 wannabe <UNK> the gate <UNK> the newly rich an upcoming model a <UNK> politician or an erotic <UNK> <UNK> all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate character sketch even if their parts may be <UNK> and <UNK> lays the film's appeal br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK> a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for nation today initially content with her job she soon begins to see the <UNK> of this <UNK> that is covered by its fake and <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> the temptation to make this subject into a moral <UNK> movie and avoids <UNK> on one character alone hence the movie is not only about <UNK> but also equally about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> editor who <UNK> accepts his role as a <UNK> of a larger <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> from the social <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> engineer a homosexual make up artist and <UNK> roommates pearl <UNK> <UNK> the sassy <UNK> and <UNK> tara <UNK> an aspiring actress it seems like an impossible task to <UNK> so many characters and more in one story but full credit to nina <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> a tight screenplay the dialogues by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> have been written with great attention to detail br br any narrative no matter how good can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances thankfully <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with actors and not stars <UNK> goes through her author backed role with <UNK> ease <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets the best written part but almost <UNK> it <UNK> <UNK> is wasted though with an <UNK> character at times the director seems too keen to <UNK> as much as possible <UNK> homosexuality etc but the <UNK> in which they are used do not make them look rushed br br ultimately <UNK> attempt is to <UNK> our <UNK> but he takes it a step further he takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this <UNK> of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world these are the same people that <UNK> in new year's <UNK> while a few hundred <UNK> away their fellow <UNK> had been <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> clever writing <UNK> <UNK> songs able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of <UNK> and poor production values <UNK> <UNK> is an <UNK> way to enter a new year of cinema br br <UNK> <UNK> br br rating br br poor average good very good excellent br br <UNK> january 2005
<START> expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine boy was i wrong br br i'll start with what is right with this movie at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh and it's due almost entirely to him being given the <UNK> room to do his thing he's an undoubtedly talented individual and it's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be in my opinion a total train wreck br br with that out of the way i'll discuss what went <UNK> wrong br br the film begins with dan burns a widower with three girls who is being considered for a <UNK> <UNK> advice <UNK> he <UNK> his girls for a family reunion where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other br br the family is high <UNK> the list of things that make this an awful movie no family behaves like this it's almost as if they've been transported from <UNK> or leave it to <UNK> they are a caricature of what we think a family is when we're 7 it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating touch football <UNK> puzzle <UNK> family <UNK> and talent shows are not how actual people behave it's almost sickening br br another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for <UNK> her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be <UNK> what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded br br it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet i left the theater wondering what i just saw after thinking further i don't think it was much
<START> this was the first walking tall movie i saw i think in a 2 movie theater along hollywood <UNK> so i didn't have any reference to the first installment done by joe don baker i remember being shocked at the <UNK> system of <UNK> county and the brutality of the redneck gangs i was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he's not going to let it slide and went out to do something about it courageous i thought so to a point where it sent <UNK> up my spine br br i think this movie is a great story about american courage to stand up and do something about a system that's only serving its own interest i was pretty blown away about it and think this is still one of the best movie of the hero anti hero genre which one might laugh but includes recent movies like the the <UNK> but even more so because it's a true story the recent remake starring the rock just doesn't do any justice to the real fire in the story of <UNK> <UNK> br br a classic that i'm sure will <UNK> again in the future
<START> this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies but this movie was a disappointment the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures when they entered the house and found the man he could have at <UNK> explained them he doesn't really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents and unless i missed something the didn't say how he managed to escape either not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially <UNK> the creatures after her own near death experience it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the cross incident
<START> if there were a movie that deserved a 0 out of 10 this would be it <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> the term bad movie other bad movies such as <UNK> a stranger <UNK> or <UNK> will actually look much better when compared to <UNK> of the <UNK> the basic plot of house of the dead is a group of twenty somethings travel to a remote island to attend the rave of the century when they get there they only find some <UNK> a bar a stage and some bloody t shirts they decide to stay anyway and they are soon attacked by zombies br br there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie it is not entertaining instead it is painful to watch because of how terrible it is the acting is unbelievably bad in a dvd interview one of the actors claimed that uwe boll the director is not afraid to tell someone when they are doing a good job or a bad job in a scene this is a blatant lie the script appears to have been written by an 11 year old who decided to include a scene of someone throwing up on a girl's chest and to include the hilarious line it <UNK> like someone <UNK> out here the characters have no personality or depth and they do some of the most moronic things ever seen in a horror movie somewhere along the way the characters also magically <UNK> into a <UNK> team to take down the zombies it's like they don't even have to aim their guns and they automatically shoot the zombies in the head br br the scariest thing by far about this movie is the directing there is something wrong with uwe boll <UNK> camera work is astonishingly disjointed his pans to zombies running through the forest are more silly than menacing worse yet boll actually thought it would be a good idea to include small bits of footage from the house of the dead video game into the movie quite often and at the most random times you will suddenly see an animated zombie getting shot it makes no sense no one in their right mind would think that was a good idea it's like boll wants to remind us repeatedly that this movie is supposed to be based on the video game uwe boll also decided it would be cool to include slow motion <UNK> degree <UNK> shots during the action scenes a la 'the <UNK> unfortunately he does it way too often and each shot is nauseating the soundtrack to this movie also <UNK> the mind most action scenes are accompanied by loud rap track this also adds to the ensuing <UNK> caused by the atrocious <UNK> of the <UNK> br br <UNK> of the <UNK> isn't bad because it's based on a video game in fact it has very little to do with the video game it also does not fit into the category of <UNK> bad that it's <UNK> it does however fit into the category of <UNK> bad that it's <UNK> this movie just plain sucks uwe boll should never be let anywhere near another movie set even his presence will curse a production to all the directors out there whenever one of your movies gets a bad review all you have to do is remember that you didn't make <UNK> of the <UNK> and you will feel much better i will never get those 90 minutes of my life back to sum it up words really cannot describe just how bad this movie is everyone involved in the production of this film especially uwe boll should be ashamed of themselves although what i have said may make <UNK> of the <UNK> sound funny it really isn't nothing about it is funny avoid this at all costs
<START> i just watched this movie in high definition on television i am in a wheelchair due to a <UNK> disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical <UNK> br br at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream <UNK> job market is great and my problem isn't with the real person who did these things he was a great man but this film is completely <UNK> and <UNK> opposed to the very message it is preaching that i found it insulting br br first of all they didn't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical <UNK> sure they were competent actors but it seems completely <UNK> genuine to <UNK> about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film further <UNK> by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a <UNK> on <UNK> appearing to have only one leg but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful what they couldn't find an actual <UNK> anywhere for the film for a 5 second shot it was more <UNK> sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual <UNK> at that point in the film i found it so <UNK> and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and <UNK> about it like the pathetic <UNK> i am br br figure that out
<START> beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature forbidden lie 2007 is simply a better cinematic version of norma <UNK> book forbidden love and that was a best <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> of literary fraud and of a pretty woman lie is the very best in <UNK> reality tv br br cleverly edited and colourful <UNK> storytelling is <UNK> by moving <UNK> of norma <UNK> <UNK> blowing smoke i disagree with variety that it's overlong instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on <UNK> just recorded <UNK> on a single watching your sense of narrative becomes <UNK> so i watched it twice br br this oscar worthy effort is at once genuinely funny <UNK> and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another the apparent con <UNK> in the australian state of <UNK> via very personal <UNK> of <UNK> friends and fans clearly these friends are now turned the funniest on camera line <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rachel richardson who speaks her <UNK> in flat no nonsense <UNK> i think it's a load of sh t personally br br we need to learn from their experience hence my belief in spoilers any <UNK> lie <UNK> caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie br br there's some breathtaking footage of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> this very <UNK> who instead <UNK> her con artist repeatedly for <UNK> br br since being <UNK> by sydney morning <UNK> <UNK> caroline <UNK> and david knox a year after <UNK> <UNK> has been on the run but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name she <UNK> supposedly because a she's either terrified of her sly more italian sounding than greek husband or b because she needed her <UNK> <UNK> to clear her name br br unlikely br br a more plausible reason was that the fbi <UNK> her trail in <UNK> before she again <UNK> overseas one guess no not jordan according to a closing card <UNK> is still under investigation by the fbi in 2007 br br i guessed audiences might just give <UNK> the benefit of the doubt once she <UNK> the need for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> instead the audiences i sat with slowly became just as <UNK> as the <UNK> people on the screen once they caught on there was plenty counter <UNK> and <UNK> earlier <UNK> <UNK> had <UNK> from <UNK> who just didn't know how to take <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the filmmaker gets props for so beautifully <UNK> this convoluted tale from beginning to end not leaving anything out not even her own self sacrifice br br anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by <UNK> herself the <UNK> reason for <UNK> it is <UNK> very <UNK> at first key to how a <UNK> liar <UNK> in half truths <UNK> is nevertheless a very pretty and smart <UNK> old with rather <UNK> charm and surprisingly worked out <UNK> br br gradually we're introduced to less and less <UNK> aussie <UNK> <UNK> and fans who at first bought the extent of <UNK> honour killing <UNK> hook line and <UNK> later we see their more <UNK> reactions quite self controlled and matter of fact if some perhaps a little bitter br br it was <UNK> anti honour killing <UNK> who took deepest <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> because its pot stirring forced them to <UNK> the pace of change honour killings do happen in jordan it's just their <UNK> that's at odds with <UNK> book plus <UNK> other facts in 2003 these <UNK> <UNK> australian random house with 73 <UNK> checked <UNK> br br the <UNK> houses across 4 <UNK> who'd jumped at the chance to <UNK> first time author <UNK> never tried to check any facts leaving any <UNK> to a <UNK> in their author contract they too were fair game so a massive hot topic fraud was as easy to <UNK> upon the world as <UNK> it up in internet <UNK> br br later still we're shocked to discover that the factual errors <UNK> to <UNK> bio as well for one thing she's not only not a <UNK> old virgin her <UNK> is that she merely didn't <UNK> people of their <UNK> but she has a <UNK> husband and 2 teenagers sometimes she's just too fast talking in her american accent she also seems too comfortable with <UNK> technology and western clothes i realise observations like these might sound <UNK> to the very <UNK> women who don't need any western <UNK> from me but when even cultural <UNK> don't <UNK> in addition to <UNK> facts you've got to start questioning your source br br at some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion she makes an admirable effort to hold <UNK> to account in person in jordan the last third is consumed with a fact finding trip back to <UNK> where one fact after another falls eventually <UNK> forces her con artist to admit the decade <UNK> in her story and it's after this that <UNK> records her <UNK> secret confession into her own digital camera secret because in it <UNK> american security guard jeremy is heard to have an australian accent he's an actor we never find out how anna <UNK> it br br so this becomes the <UNK> triumph as she never <UNK> in her tone or commitment her on camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a <UNK> of reasonable doubt fbi documents and <UNK> most shocking initial crime br br anna <UNK> watch list her now is even clever enough to use the one artistic device key players cross commenting on footage to kill two birds making her audiences want to drink from the same well again br br in fact despite her <UNK> <UNK> approach she made me re confirm that <UNK> and knox really did win their 2004 <UNK> in investigate <UNK> for their norma <UNK> investigation br br <UNK> made me look 10 10
<START> br br robot <UNK> is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age you have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant <UNK> to much about the bad parts so just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it
<START> snl is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a short skit on snl is a little dumb minded it's nothing like snl it's just a stupid piece of crap br br andy <UNK> tries to act like jon <UNK> but fails although jon <UNK> is only funny in <UNK> dynamite andy tries his hardest and people think he's funny br br only funny people in the movie were danny <UNK> and bill <UNK> the only part that was <UNK> funny with andy was the pool part br br they could have made the quiet place a lot better if they didn't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes br br the part where he's <UNK> his <UNK> more is retarded they try going with it too long and half the time it looks like andy is laughing while he acts he's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie br br this movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy which is about half the united states
<START> an annoying experience improvised dialogue <UNK> cameras for no effect <UNK> plot contrived romance <UNK> to the whole mess ron silver was the only real actor <UNK> <UNK> was terrible henry <UNK> did better with eating which suited his style much more
<START> this third darkman was definitely better than the second one but still far worse than the original movie what made this one better than <UNK> was the fact that the bad guy had been changed and <UNK> was not brought back again furthermore there was actually some hint of character development when it came to the bad guy's family and darkman himself this made my heart <UNK> and i gave this flick as much as 4 10 i e
<START> it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb because i would not have <UNK> in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars br br i like many others bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it it could be good no chance this film was shocking imagine a movie length 'the bold and the <UNK> well primal instinct did not even come close to that good and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length 'the bold and the <UNK> br br michael madsen how could you do this to us the worst part is i didn't fast forward a bit i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film br br where do i start directing zero stars screenplay zero stars acting zero stars cinematography zero stars digital effects zero stars production design zero stars make up zero stars casting zero stars editing zero stars trailer half a star graphic design half a star dvd menu half a star br br however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list
<START> so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it we would watch it all the time when our friends came over we would have <UNK> and we'd watch big rock candy mountain and <UNK> magical toys i'm 21 now and i still love this movie some old friends and i recently got together and watched it we knew all the songs and we <UNK> and talked about how much we hated <UNK> when we were little one friend actually bought this movie and <UNK> magical toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe no violence no bad language just lots of great songs and important lessons
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is best in movies on marriage and here he is back to his <UNK> on <UNK> as the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage a movie you can watch with your entire family around you a movie you will hate watching alone the story is simple but the music is good cinematography is excellent direction is best everything about the movie has a class of its own there are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the movie br br shahid amrita <UNK> has given us hit movies earlier like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> though <UNK> was a good movie it wasn't accepted well by the public a truly shahid amrita film
<START> first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots i really enjoyed them i really enjoyed this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan greg <UNK> is pretty lackluster brosnan <UNK> into this character so well that it is really hard to remember that this is the same guy that played bond it also shows his range and depth as an actor it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that <UNK> the movies at this time of the year i found the characters to be well crafted the twist in the middle i felt was especially good i also liked how the characters come off realistically so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking stereotypes i like the different approaches this movie takes i think of <UNK> when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall
<START> probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet not surprising since king himself wrote the screenplay the story follows the <UNK> family moving into a beautiful <UNK> house one of the other residents is <UNK> a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area one is the highway that runs right through their <UNK> the other is a path leading to the pet sematary where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway soon enough <UNK> <UNK> cat church is found dead luckily this happens while the family with the exception of louis the father is away for <UNK> <UNK> takes louis to another burial ground beyond the pet sematary where church is to be buried later louis is <UNK> not so <UNK> by church he's returned appearing to have <UNK> his way out of the bag he had been buried in maybe he was buried alive maybe not nothing more i can say without ruining the story br br of all the king <UNK> i've seen this would be the most terrifying the characters are real and the situations are normal mary <UNK> does a great job directing the proceedings suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film due in part to the plot development the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever then of course we have the conclusion easy to determine what's going to happen but <UNK> pulls off some genuinely scary and sometimes disturbing moments br br overall this is a good film and an excellent adaption if you enjoy being scared and don't mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then pet sematary is just what you're looking for non horror fans will want to avoid this
<START> yes as the other reviewers have already stated this may not be vintage l h but it's far from being their worst work as at 20th century stupid i mean fox this film certainly has all of the basic ingredients for things to go wrong for the boys but it's their serious approach and determination that makes them funny they don't play it for laughs as other comedians might but they take their work and situation quite seriously and that is the essence of their eternal humor in this film they are faced with some basic issues that really might be encountered by any one of us today namely job related stress first we would get checked out by a doctor and he would <UNK> some much needed rest and perhaps staying by the sea that's where the <UNK> comes in to all of this l h always take a most plausible set of circumstances and <UNK> it but never to the point of being incredible except maybe once in awhile this makes us laugh because we can relate to their self caused <UNK> and attempts at <UNK> that's what makes stan and ollie universal in their appeal in this film all those ingredients are presented in a delightfully <UNK> and <UNK> slapstick way not their best in comparison to their earlier work probably because this was the actual last film they did for roach because he wanted to mirror the big studios and go into making features exclusively and also wanted to hurry up and finish their <UNK> <UNK> big mistake they should have all stayed together and continued for maybe five more years what the world may have missed in their not considering this as an option watch laugh and enjoy this as their last great performance
<START> wow you guys are way too nice corny corny corny that is how i feel about that film it started well with a good idea a guy edward <UNK> escape from jail dressed as santa a bunch of kids find him and believes his the real santa so the fake santa <UNK> the children to help him find a bag of stolen money the film is like a christmas version of <UNK> down the wind the movie start well but gradually it becomes <UNK> and <UNK> to the point that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you just cant take this film seriously for example you get the scrooge type character called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who's a total <UNK> who treat his young son like a pile a rubbish he treat his son so bad that he don't even buy him decent clothes the poor kid wears <UNK> with holes in it but a 45 second scene with fake santa visiting <UNK> and by the end of the film you get the guy all happy singing christmas carol and giving his neglected son a hug yep that is how corny it is i'm all for feel good movie especially during christmas and i am a big fan of <UNK> tv movie but this one is way too over the top for me it is a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie is <UNK> a supernatural element to the film that just don't match with the rest of it it's not totally bad there are some solid acting especially from the children but there are plenty of better christmas film around
<START> slaughter high starts like any other day at <UNK> county high school where little <UNK> carol <UNK> caroline <UNK> has tricked resident nerd marty <UNK> simon <UNK> into the girls locker rooms where she tells him to get <UNK> in the shower while doing so <UNK> gang of friends come in give the now naked marty a big surprise as they film him as they stick his head down the girls toilet in an april <UNK> day joke the <UNK> sports coach marc smith saves marty <UNK> the gang who rather <UNK> blame marty they decide to play another trick on him only this time things get out of hand marty is caught in an explosion has <UNK> acid <UNK> over his face years later the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there they all venture inside where they quickly learn they aren't the only ones there as marty is back has revenge on his mind br br originally shot under the title april <UNK> day which they changed probably because of another slasher film named april <UNK> day 1986 made the same year this american english co production is unusual in that it has three credited writers directors george <UNK> mark <UNK> peter <UNK> after never seeing a film with three credited director's i've now seen two in a week the other being the jean claude van damme flick <UNK> 1989 i have to say i really rather liked slaughter high even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation one of the things i like about the script is that it is a pure <UNK> slasher flick it doesn't try to be anything else it just accepts the genres rules short <UNK> <UNK> plays up to them basically it delivers what it promises a homicidal killer blood boobs babes i thought the character's were alright the story was ok even though it's just an excuse to get a load of teens inside an isolated location so some killer can <UNK> them off one at a time i actually liked the twist ending as well which is also something for which slaughter high gets a lot of <UNK> for the first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of <UNK> as there is one gory killing after another some of the situations character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who's complaining br br despite three credited director's slaughter high turned out pretty good i liked the look of the film a lot the isolated <UNK> school made for a really atmospheric location looked good the makers throw in a good <UNK> as well there's some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive <UNK> long lasting <UNK> tracking shots which follow carol through various corridors of the <UNK> school while not particularly stylish it certainly looks nice enough is <UNK> made there is some good gore here including burnt bodies people <UNK> with acid <UNK> stomach explosions <UNK> in faces death by <UNK> as well as someone who gets drowned in <UNK> matter down a drain the special effects are also better than one would expect i was both impressed pleased with the higher than expected body count br br technically the film is better than i had expected beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today i would have thought it was relatively low budget itself though supposedly set in america this was very obviously shot in england harry <UNK> <UNK> another score which sounds exactly like all of his other musical scores is basically the same as the theme from friday the 13th 1980 it's sequels anyone living here in the uk will probably <UNK> billy <UNK> who played frank as a regular in <UNK> farm one of our nations top rated soap operas in which he plays terry woods while most horror fans will <UNK> the sexy caroline <UNK> in a rare staring role legendary exploitation producer dick randall did the deed on slaughter high actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer talk about <UNK> you can also see a poster for the misunderstood brilliance that was pieces 1982 which he also produced behind him in his office br br slaughter high is a slasher film that i liked a lot did you see that i didn't say it was great i actually said i liked it on a personal level i'm sure the predictable plot lack of story will probably put many off so i can't recommend it but i can say i liked it make of that what you want make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out if your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then slaughter high won't change your mind but if your looking for a simple effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this
<START> i'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler but i'm playing it safe so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie br br i adore this movie and so does everyone i work with and that is the point i spent a large part of my working life in cinema without being an actor such people are the sung heroes of this movie the <UNK> the <UNK> the on air directors the <UNK> and writers the costume people etc etc and the whole thing is told from their point of view at least to a great extent most actors are nuts and self absorbed to the point of absurdity which is what this movie spoofs so well but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real life drama possible spoiler alert in one great scene the two leads both actors are discussing how to discuss something personal something entirely <UNK> of <UNK> with another actor and they start making up lines <UNK> them and <UNK> each other's performance br br since this movie appeared in what was it <UNK> it has become <UNK> to do this especially on tv but hardly anyone has done it so well
<START> kalifornia is the story of a writer and his girlfriend photographer who are looking for someone to help pay gas money and take turns at the wheel for a cross country road trip to famous murder sights ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer great performances all around by the leads with pitt in particular being exceptional check it out
<START> a good idea badly <UNK> while that could <UNK> 99 of the scifi <UNK> movies it really applies here i love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and i like action movies and i like all of the main actors so this could have been great however despite some good acting this movie fails due to bill <UNK> bad writing and directing br br another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there this movie doesn't it's put together in such a <UNK> way that you know the words second draft are not in bill <UNK> <UNK> there is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone <UNK> this scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle br br this movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front it also had a habit of <UNK> a fight early probably just because they couldn't afford it there are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic <UNK> seriously what is that br br if you are a fan of <UNK> <UNK> watch this movie because she's ok she does manage to break out of her <UNK> persona a few times and make for a good tough chick but not always john de <UNK> plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing q back in st <UNK> so that's nothing new br br in all i gave this movie a 4 10 rating
<START> hi br br my name is jessica i'm italian br br some time ago i have seen this film ' for the very first <UNK> with <UNK> corky <UNK> it was the story of micheal and mary margaret i need to know the title of the song of the most important love scene in <UNK> bedroom br br in italy this film hasn't been <UNK> for many years and i don't know how to find the song a lot of thanks for who can help me i love this film is very romantic the soundtrack is beautiful i love <UNK> <UNK> jessica
<START> it's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film but the problem is that it's not very good there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn't bother for any of them br br rather bland and sometimes downright bad photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you can't expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it it's unfair to review the film and compare it to other high budget films but alas that is what one must do on its own it's not very good and compared to others it's still not very good but it is not without its good points i liked the plot it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end sometimes in the really dark scenes it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well br br however in the end the film fails to impress the characters are pretty much non existent and we don't care for any of them any of them might die but it's possible to <UNK> the final survivor from very early on
<START> i've seen this movie when i was young and i remembered it as one of the first films i have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy so in my later years i decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie to my surprise the movie held to my every expectations it's a great movie emotional in the right amount some jokes nice songs not great though and that actually explains why i did not remember it was a musical and all in all a great use to my time i was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that i have <UNK> did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie which i first saw in the second grade made me cry today just like it made me cry then maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not but the important thing is that it made me feel and that's why filmmakers make films that and the money of course yes there are continuity <UNK> yes the script has holes but it doesn't matter the movie itself is fun and smart so don't be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life because nothing is perfect and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect it gets 10 simply because it made me feel
<START> horrendous <UNK> of a classic br br it wasn't written convincingly at all why mary should develop such sympathy for bates he may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him but he still doesn't help himself at all with his actions <UNK> a <UNK> stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently <UNK> motel telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues lying about the knives etc this in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept mary extremely <UNK> of him but this somehow doesn't happen just so they can play the <UNK> identity murder game later on which in itself is also ridiculous <UNK> and so is the real killer plus her as well also him there were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didn't need <UNK> br br it was good to see <UNK> <UNK> his famous role again but that's about the only small pleasure to be had it's definitely not a <UNK> on hitchcock and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldn't be bothering at all
<START> this movie is one of my all time favorites cary grant victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jr what a cast not to mention sam <UNK> as gunga din drama action adventure and comedy all rolled up into one the final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears if you haven't seen it i'd strongly recommend it
<START> not a bad martial arts film fight scenes were good michel <UNK> did a good job directing his first film without van damme story worked without foul language and too much blood screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> has a good line to the story that works it would be great to see something else from her in the same genre she likes the art and having strong women <UNK> it was definitely worth watching i recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers
<START> think of a no budget version of china syndrome being directed by a film student who <UNK> john woo and you'll get <UNK> play ' the idea was good but the execution acting and dialog absolutely killed it not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie br br this is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a <UNK> <UNK> group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the <UNK> of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of <UNK> the rather <UNK> reporter going up against what should've been a more ruthless bunch of company <UNK> is chased around town along with anyone he speaks to in order to clean whatever <UNK> evidence might remain of the <UNK> faults br br unfortunately there is no real sense of <UNK> because the characters interact with much <UNK> coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting not to mention the viewer who may only be attracted to the movie for it's action genre appeal is forced to endure a <UNK> body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em ups plus <UNK> disaster scenes all of the focus was put in the wrong place to <UNK> compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should've <UNK> the story it <UNK> been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story creepy villains a naive reporter and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong doing <UNK> it is formulaic but at least it would've been entertaining
<START> through the similarly minded antics of eric <UNK> a not particularly talented director has <UNK> a not particularly good movie yet i still found myself sitting through it to the closing credits if for nothing more than to see what happens next br br a rapist escapes from prison and calls up his old flame after capturing her even though she came willingly and threatening her into having sex another event she was also willing to do he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who <UNK> her in the past he then decides to kill her huh but is <UNK> and dies instead the girl's mind <UNK> or something like that and she takes out her rage on the unlucky <UNK> in the basement br br alright the writing sucks it's long <UNK> loaded with ten <UNK> words and there is way too much of it br br the acting sucks what a minute what acting br br the filming sucks home video is bad enough but 20 minutes of graveyard footage is just a damn insult br br and the budget is a joke get it <UNK> that was the punchline br br and yet there was a charm to the thing back in the 70's these kind of movies came out in theatres with actual budgets and talent attached to them not in this day and age though if you want to watch this kind of violent sexually <UNK> trash don't lie some of us do then this is all your gonna get nowadays br br some brief hardcore shots in a sex scene torture with <UNK> material fun with <UNK> <UNK> rape by <UNK> stick and a lengthy shot of the crazy chick <UNK> with the same <UNK> stick are some of the better items on the menu br br it's not good and it won't be remembered but not since the <UNK> of joe <UNK> have people made movies like this br br 4 10
<START> somebody called howard <UNK> a <UNK> but he did write the screenplay for casablanca didn't he or didn't he maybe there's more than one <UNK> <UNK> around in hollywood and i'm not too fond of casablanca anyway wait a minute yes there is another howard <UNK> <UNK> around <UNK> that's the one who wrote casablanca no matter i'll put as much care into this comment as howard w <UNK> put into this production which is to say only a little br br you know what this sounds like somebody read <UNK> notes on shakespeare's king <UNK> and decided since no original thoughts were aboard the <UNK> inspiration express to update it and <UNK> it with a happy ending br br there are differences <UNK> decides to <UNK> up his vast <UNK> between three sisters and before doing so asks them how much they love him two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on <UNK> but in the play <UNK> remains alive to regret his decision to give the two <UNK> his <UNK> and <UNK> the honest girl he winds up crazy and naked during a <UNK> on the <UNK> putting flowers in his hair and <UNK> kids can do that to you take my kid for instance after all the effort i <UNK> on raising him does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer no in the end everybody in the play dies br br in the movie evidently the good sister is <UNK> and <UNK> but when she tries to off herself somebody jumps in and saves her so the ending is more or less happy that's the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient <UNK> itself
<START> unlike other <UNK> i found this film fascinating even with all its faults and the zombie acting of some of the actors br br being a <UNK> i found that the experiments interesting and the <UNK> realistic although the reading of people minds via computer sounds fantastic experiments are being <UNK> now to do just this i will note that this experiments are in a very early stage with results so far not <UNK> br br the characters in the movie are well cast the girl although overacting a bit looks suitable dumb the truck driver is a a <UNK> for real truck drivers the minister conveys doubt at first the principal investigator tells the minister that him the minister is not sure whether he believes that god created man or that man created god but the minute when the <UNK> are down he falls back on his faith only the <UNK> plays the zombie the secrets that they harbor are suitably appropriate for their characters in the face of death they react as real human beings would br br the movie is a warning against the dangers of <UNK> <UNK> by government as strictly a thriller the movie does not have enough thrills as a scientific exercise with philosophical <UNK> it is fascinating
<START> i agree that capital city should be on dvd i watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with <UNK> <UNK> as hudson <UNK> it was nice to see americans who work abroad in london in the financial industry for a change i loved <UNK> in this role and loved every other role that he has been in i can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes i liked william armstrong as <UNK> flamboyant charming friend in the series when they aired this show in the new york city area it was always late at night or at off times the show is less than an hour long i felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting i didn't care for sylvia but missed the actress julia phillips lane in the previous season i felt this show took chances and often it worked it showed americans who loved and chose to live in london the american characters were not arrogant or tried to <UNK> their british counterparts i also liked the fact that they had tried to <UNK> the cast rather than make them all british i liked watching julia <UNK> in an early role i felt this show should have lasted longer i felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour they could have transferred the cast to new york city and it would have been a hit in america
<START> washington square is a flat <UNK> adaptation of the short novel by henry james indeed the novel is very good but far from the level of <UNK> masterpieces moreover its simple <UNK> story seems <UNK> to make it into a film although william <UNK> with his the <UNK> gave in 1949 a beautiful version of the novel br br anyway the movie completely betrays the spirit of this work of the great american writer in the novel the heroine catherine is shy not very attractive and somewhat clumsy but nonetheless she is a sound intelligent young woman and she's not as naive as it may seem her <UNK> for her father is <UNK> and <UNK> with no morbid sides in it along three quarters of the movie catherine jennifer jason leigh just seems to be mentally retarded poor thing in the last quarter she suddenly and incredibly becomes intelligent aware of her dignity as a woman and all that br br the director <UNK> holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story the first when the nervous child catherine has well troubles with her <UNK> the second scene when we see on the background a sort of open air <UNK> with prostitutes taking their customers behind <UNK> and so on nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of henry james it is notorious that the writer was extremely decent and <UNK> even for the standards of the victorian age i defy anyone to find any <UNK> anywhere in the thousands of pages of <UNK> huge literary production i really was particularly annoyed by these two scenes br br yes i know that a director needs reasonable freedom in the screen adaptation of a novel but if a director utterly ignores or <UNK> the art of an author here henry james i don't see the point of using his work to make a bad movie br br the acting is adequate to the movie poor and flat in spite of the talent of albert finney and maggie smith washington square is definitely a non <UNK> film
<START> while some performances were good victoria <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the two italian girlfriends come to mind the story was lame and derivative the emphasis on the <UNK> racial background was handled clumsily at best and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes not as real people i found myself <UNK> <UNK> at many moments that were supposed to be funny i can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in sf said this was a good movie and wonder who posted the glowing review here on imdb very disappointed in this movie and mad i actually went to a theatre to see it based on the <UNK> connection to garden state which is a far funnier more inventive and touching movie than this one i must especially mention the emotional climax in the church which was so wooden and by the numbers that i nearly left and some in the audience actually did that was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard which i saw coming 10 minutes before it happened i really don't like being <UNK> to spend my money so <UNK>
<START> the problem i find with this title is that i am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie a blend of the two genres just doesn't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere this is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary if it is meant to be a thriller drama this is too dull and monotonous in either case what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience that around us there are people who ill treat others who are willing to be ill treated that there are many crazy <UNK> around us so so what
<START> this is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of jules <UNK> mysterious island the sound editing is pretty bad you hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time this is an amateur film with actors from boston and shot around new <UNK> for those living in new <UNK> and who is reading this comment will be <UNK> with a capital w this film is full of flaws you get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress ok now stand up as for the other characters there is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien the alien guy talks with a deep voice when he is <UNK> or <UNK> when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice as for the special effects man this was brett <UNK> early work for crying out loud the creatures are good but the animation is jerky really jerky sort of like karl <UNK> animation in journey to beginning of time 1955 the special effects are imaginative <UNK> music is good bottom line this film makes <UNK> or planet of the dinosaurs look like a ray <UNK> epic did you know mysterious planet was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget a must watch for aspiring film makers
<START> this was the worst movie i have ever seen billy zane in i understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new <UNK> who did pretty good for <UNK> but over all the movie was not believable br br with all of the <UNK> you would think the police would have <UNK> even the <UNK> being a bug on sean was stupid the way sean suddenly realizes the <UNK> is the bug was not realistic br br looks like this movie was slapped together fast poor job get a better writer br br the count down to the end was not in sync with anything it took longer to fight and what a coincidence that each time billy was going to blast sean he'd be out of bullets once i can believe but not twice br br actually <UNK> character was goofy it was so stupid when sean punches him out at the end it was like a comedy bad bad bad
<START> this did for crime what not another teen movie did for school i laughed all the way through as 2 inept gangs <UNK> with each other and among themselves an <UNK> comedy using overt jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way i suppose the biggest gag in the entire film was that time never seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the 30's
<START> the story by norman <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> film is a mediocrity he adds banal scenes of the <UNK> brothers going over a falls and of them double dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story the <UNK> brad pitt trying to play the charismatic paul <UNK> a genius <UNK> proves either <UNK> or depressing depending on what the original story meant to you some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful also tom <UNK> as the father and craig <UNK> as norman are strong and <UNK> as men were once expected to be none of the women make an impression in the film which is <UNK> because <UNK> loved the women in his story and made this clear even poetic
<START> twelve monkeys 's got all the elements to become terry <UNK> masterpiece an outstanding screenplay a <UNK> rhythm clever sometimes ironic dialogs moreover he had a good nose about the cast twelve monkeys is also the first movie where bruce willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies here a jaded and hopeless character which you could <UNK> a prisoner took over from a <UNK> and <UNK> hero as it was the case in die hard no matter how he tries he's a prisoner of the time the movie contains a very thrilling end too it's got a real dramatic power but this terrific movie is also a reflection about man the dangers he <UNK> notably the ones that could cause the end of the world and here these are virus that can create <UNK> no matter how long it will take twelve monkeys will be <UNK> at its true value one of the masterpieces made in the nineties
<START> good lord and that coming from an <UNK> this movie is bad br br much has already been said by the reviewers before the ones who rated this piece 3 and below to which i fully agree i just like to add a few things br br among the three guys who had to eat their own <UNK> end products got chopped up by an axe raped by a <UNK> had their balls blown away the ex boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl's endless and pointless <UNK> at the kitchen table as do we but at least we have the mercy of the mute button br br had the director cut out the point and endless graveyard and <UNK> scenes our suffering would have been over after 30 minutes br br the only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are emily <UNK> tits one point br br forget it don't buy it don't waste your time and your sanity my brain is so fried after watching this i feel the <UNK> need to watch and suffer <UNK> right now
<START> i was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever i didn't realize it was disney until it was too late i was appalled by the many <UNK> of crucial parts of the story it was as if someone made a movie out of a 4th <UNK> book report on the novel meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses mrs murray <UNK> mother was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet and that's just the beginning by halfway through the movie i found myself shouting at the screen much to the <UNK> of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn't read the book i wish i had more thumbs so i could give four thumbs down for this one the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book this movie is kinda alright
<START> this is a very old and cheaply made film a typical low budget b western in so many ways gary cooper was not yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of the early films of john wayne that were done for poverty row studios with both actors their familiar style and persona were still not completely formed this incarnation of gary cooper doesn't seem exactly like the cooper of just a few years later he talks faster in this early film among other things br br however unlike the average b movie of the era there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique if not good if you ever want to see the woman that was married to errol flynn for seven years this is your chance <UNK> <UNK> stars as the female love interest and this is a very very odd casting choice as she has a heavy accent she was french and wasn't even close to being movie star pretty incidentally she was also married to director michael <UNK> br br but for me the most memorable and weird aspect of the film is the seemingly gay subplot sort of like a <UNK> mountain from the 1930s and we thought this was a new idea gary <UNK> character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep cooper clear of females this <UNK> alone doesn't necessarily mean much but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple in particular towards the end when one of them is killed the other is shot by an arrow and holds off dying long enough to crawl over to the body of his fallen friend and then falls with his arms <UNK> around him this was pretty edgy stuff for the time and i think this makes this dull film really fascinating today as far as cooper and the plot go the film is a bit of a disappointment and very skip able unless you are curious about <UNK> or the homosexual undertones do yourself a favor and find a better western
<START> <UNK> is by far the best porn movie i've ever viewed this is a must see and if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it just skip over the naughty scenes of course this <UNK> the movie to a length of about 15 minutes but even then it's enjoyable this movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie even <UNK> redemption
<START> this movie is just plain bad it isn't even worth watching to make fun of it the lunatic professor is just plain annoying even <UNK> disbelief to allow for <UNK> which i <UNK> do for the sake of good bad movies and allowing for exceedingly stupid victims in a horror movie this movie asks for even more than that if you are looking for women's locker room shower scenes and random sexual encounters get a porn if you are looking for a good bad movie get something else if you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie rent this
<START> the movie seems disjointed and overall poorly written the screenplay moves along as if 10 different people wrote it and none of them were <UNK> with each other apparently they wanted to take a page from a miracle on <UNK> street the original type film but it is done in such a poor way that the movie falls apart this film is for only the very young and even they will see the fact that whoever scripted it knows little to nothing about baseball such as br br <UNK> when the angels are in dead last place the owner doesn't seem to care nor is he bothered by the fact his manager just got into a fight with his <UNK>  on the <UNK>  or that he <UNK> the <UNK> play by play <UNK> on live tv however when the team is one game from winning the division he gets bent out of shape over a story <UNK> by a 6 year old that the manager is getting help from a kid who claims to see real angels what sounds worse a losing violent out of control manager whose team has lost 15 in a row or a winning coach on the verge of the <UNK> that is acting a bit eccentric and is helping foster kids the <UNK> reaction makes no sense and he's moved to change his mind by maggie and her <UNK> out of cliché <UNK> speech during a news <UNK> br br <UNK> the angels are supposed to be playing for the division in the final weekend series against the white sox however at the end of the game the <UNK> keep saying the angels <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> is not decided until someone wins the league championship not the regular season division title br br <UNK> <UNK> bass the <UNK> <UNK> is the starting <UNK> and wins the game that breaks the angels losing streak  then is the starting <UNK>  the very next day br br <UNK> mel clark tony <UNK> is said in the <UNK> <UNK> to have thrown <UNK> <UNK> in a low <UNK> <UNK> typically in low <UNK> games the pitch count is much lower than this usually around 80 90 <UNK> br br <UNK> al the angel says at the end <UNK> have to be won on their own even though he and his angels have been <UNK> and <UNK> games throughout the whole second half of the season br br i could go on and on as there are many other examples where the story is poorly written br br for younger kids under 10 this movie may be entertaining it's too bad  done right this could have been a classic done wrong like this and it's a forgettable mess that will forever live as a <UNK> cable saturday morning <UNK>
<START> loved joan great performance what isn't she good in i watched this film and then jane eyre right after she just keeps getting better my heart was racing great old movie drama just what i want from a classic movie facial expressions are worth the whole film i'm glad i have it on video don't know what more you need in a film beautiful woman wealth greed murder detectives a trial br br the costumes are very nice makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie wish they still made films like this whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie films in black and white still hold a certain mystery
<START> this movie was a rather odd viewing experience the movie is obviously based on a play now i'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn't feel terribly interesting enough to watch the movie is way too <UNK> and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie instead what is presented now is an almost literally re filming of a stage play with over the top characters and staged dialog because of all this the storyline really doesn't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore and <UNK> viewing experience br br it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching at first you think its a drama you're watching with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a <UNK> that <UNK> really more toward the comedy genre rather than the drama genre br br the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over the top one that at times really become unwatchable sure the actors are great peter o'toole and <UNK> york amongst others but they don't really <UNK> the movie to a level of <UNK> <UNK> br br the story feels totally <UNK> <UNK> the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother sister characters played by peter o'toole and <UNK> york but what exactly is the story even about the movie feels like a pointless and <UNK> one that has very little to offer like i said before i'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn't fitting and simply doesn't work out br br the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences br br more was to expect from director j lee thompson who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed stage play translated to screen project br br really not worth your time br br 4 10
<START> this was a horrible film i gave it 2 points one for angelina jolie and a second one for the beautiful <UNK> in the beginning other than that the story just plain sucked and cars racing through cities wasn't so new in 1970 the <UNK> was probably what annoyed me the most <UNK> seen anything so constructed
<START> worst film ever this is a statement that people here on imdb often throw around whether it's an uwe boll movie bad classics like <UNK> the hands of fate or the latest no brains summer action fest from michael bay people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they're <UNK> that there is nothing worse in the movie world br br i envy these people because they're <UNK> ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit hole of crap movie making really goes there are films out there so bad so hideous so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that <UNK> form around them to celebrate their awfulness and their discussion boards are the <UNK> places on the internet due to everyone <UNK> <UNK> that said film is really that bad br br ladies and gentlemen i present to you ben and arthur an 85 minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it's a lot like a violent car crash you know it's awful but you can't stop looking at it the <UNK> of self <UNK> hollywood actor director and may i add <UNK> whale sam <UNK> this film is <UNK> terrible let me give you a hint of how ego driven this project was mr <UNK> not only directed this film he wrote it produced it executive produced it scored it edited it and then finally starred in it this is a man so <UNK> by his own ego and so believing of his non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child he fails to <UNK> just how <UNK> his bastard creation really is br br everything in this film fails on an epic level the acting is the worst you will ever witness the plot is the most ridiculous the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a <UNK> i'm aware i've gone on a bit of a <UNK> here but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it i would say this film is horse crap <UNK> into a film reel but the truth is it wasn't even shot on film it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust don't get me wrong i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting for example as much as i disliked it the blair witch project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film ben and arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on even if this film was shot on a budget of 20 million with <UNK> finest actors it would still suck the plot is that atrocious and the characters are even worse one of the main characters arthur who is portrayed by non other than sam <UNK> is one of the most whiny <UNK> little <UNK> ever put in a film you'll dislike him within 5 minutes of the start of the film and by the end of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing apparently mr <UNK> forgot that we're supposed to root for the hero br br i don't want to spoil all the gut <UNK> hilarity you'll experience watching this film which i urge you not to pay for so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is tame and mild as in amongst the least <UNK> mistakes in the movie in one cut we hear one of the main characters say how they know a good lawyer and will give him a call the shot fades out then fades back in and this him they spoke of earlier is actually a woman quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think the second is simple seconds after seeing this <UNK> lawyer the characters are told to fly to <UNK> we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area i've never been to <UNK> personally but i'm certain you won't find any palm trees there br br imagine this kind of stupid amateur <UNK> stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then <UNK> it by 10 and it still won't fully prepare you for ben and arthur imagine the absolute worst film you've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won't be on the same level as ben and arthur this film is really that bad br br however we should be glad in a way films like this are a true <UNK> they give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves or that we can be screenwriters simply because we'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this br br the real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered and it is called ben and arthur
<START> you cannot deny that we have an <UNK> for speed that's why movies like fast and the furious <UNK> <UNK> get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences especially local ones we live on a tiny island and i cannot <UNK> why for the relative <UNK> of the public <UNK> system most of us want to get into debt by <UNK> a set of <UNK> which come with 100 tax when they reach our <UNK> and the <UNK> of <UNK> and bills to pay when operating one not only that the high end sports cars were once <UNK> by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear <UNK> they reach the sea br br and these movies are relatively easy to make hot <UNK> and hot chicks always go down well together in <UNK> the required <UNK> for once those <UNK> <UNK> exposing uncanny <UNK> and short <UNK> <UNK> legs two <UNK> long can't compete with the attention given to those beautiful <UNK> that exotic cars possess in movies such as these of course there are amongst us <UNK> those that go for the <UNK> portrayal of women as mere sexual objects otherwise explain why <UNK> shows come with <UNK> of models and movies such as these cannot do without a <UNK> model in a frame however they don't warrant the kind of collective <UNK> <UNK> whenever the four <UNK> come on screen even when they do exactly nothing and have their <UNK> into park the guy sitting beside me i swear he wet his pants every time his dream car s appear and <UNK> his pants even more when he hears those <UNK> engine <UNK> br br so there we have it the fan boys who turned up in <UNK> just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie with the fast and the furious franchise the japanese models like the <UNK> and the <UNK> take <UNK> as does the <UNK> here the ford <UNK> takes on an incredibly <UNK> worthy <UNK> <UNK> that even i'm impressed alongside the latest models like the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and every car out there that has wings for doors but seriously my heart goes out to the cars each time they're mercilessly <UNK> just for entertainment i mean this are perfectly fine high performance models that are at the <UNK> of <UNK> but yet because whoever <UNK> the movie had millions to blow they do so because they can br br there's no story in <UNK> just excuses to put together a movie full of <UNK> the cars that is that can rip down the <UNK> in probably the most boring fashion possible and with the usual shots of <UNK> always the <UNK> mind you <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> to <UNK> and earn you no respect <UNK> <UNK> gear shifts always shifting up and not down all these while having the actors make pretend that they're the <UNK> <UNK> with an engine <UNK> and giving each other dirty looks not a very tall order for an actor and that's why we get the most <UNK> performances ever with lines that seem to be written by <UNK> <UNK> br br the heroine yes it made a statement that girls can drive natasha a very <UNK> looking <UNK> <UNK> is one of those million dollar finds a girl with model looks who don't mind getting down on <UNK> and immersed in oil who has racing <UNK> within her and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable every line had to do with cars and when singing about love just had to string those <UNK> like shifting gear <UNK> <UNK> and going for rides introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a <UNK> called infamous eddie <UNK> she gets drawn into family <UNK> involving a leo <UNK> <UNK> iraq war veteran and some sleazy <UNK> looking rich uncle everything else well like i said just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race br br and it's almost always the same as there's very limited to what you can do to <UNK> tension between race cars especially when you know the race is <UNK> for narrative reasons and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line while fast and furious had quite charismatic actors and i will put my head on the <UNK> block by <UNK> paul walker sun <UNK> and of course the star it created <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had none just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately it looks like a tv movie in its treatment from the get go with a very insipid opening sequence where it's one man one car and a <UNK> minutes race against time to get to vegas br br if not for the cars then this movie seriously is a piece of junk with bad acting bad lines and bad action strictly for the car fans or those who like their movies with countless of <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> their bodies without any speaking lines
<START> my dear lord what a movie let's talk about the special effects first don't get me wrong here i am not one of those effect fanatics but i was truly thinking that <UNK> was a practice of the long gone past mainly the 60's so for some time i thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it but as far as i know they did not have cell phones in the 60's br br what i am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message acting is secondary effects are secondary i do not even mind a few little inconsistencies however in a movies like this bad acting <UNK> etc add up to make a bad movie even worse that's what happened for me with the <UNK> prophecy br br my wife said the book was actually really good and even though i am not into all that spiritual stuff i can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way the movie failed to do so br br there could be one single reason to watch this one though if you really love cheesy movies it'll be the right one for you if the imdb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality i must have rated this movie ten stars br br by the way three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there like critical mass look up the comments on that one hilarious the <UNK> prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree
<START> since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite since then i've seen it countless times and i never get tired of it the setting has a lot to do with it the <UNK> i know would be jealous but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes there has not been a movie i can compare this too john <UNK> plays a smart villain but i love how he is completely out of his element he has to follow tucker around and that's what keeps it interesting this is an action movie at it's best i don't think i'll see another that is so entertaining br br you don't need 50 000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie it just has to keep you captivated not shell shocked
<START> the woman in black was a british made for tv movie which was first broadcast on the bbc on <UNK> eve of <UNK> and again in <UNK> i believe it made a round on american tv on a e it was released on vhs in britain in the early 90's but went out of print a u s company released it on dvd later but that version also sold out according to the website of the author of the book the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won't be released again and that there are <UNK> <UNK> being sold on ebay br br i first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out i found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks it's certain to be a <UNK> from a <UNK> in the far east even though the dvd says made in canada ha ha but it's a good copy and you can't really fault the <UNK> <UNK> for releasing stuff that is rare out of print and lost in legal <UNK> br br i love the movie it's a period piece set in the <UNK> with all the very authentic and quaint british settings of that time the woman in black is very atmospheric and dark for the most part the movie is very low key but effective and scary there is no self indulgent gore violence or much at all in special effects but the woman in black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments it's a chilling classic <UNK> ghost movie the movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930's except for the color without all the flash of all the modern horror movies i'm afraid this film will always just be a lost gem for me it places itself as one of my all time favorites
<START> claire denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will br br ostensibly the idea within the <UNK> of a most non linear film is the older man living on the french swiss border a man devoted to his dogs who still has a lover but whose <UNK> status increasingly threatens his life he has a son with a little family who <UNK> meet with him but when he discovers he is in need of a heart transplant he <UNK> for going to <UNK> via japan to obtain a heart transplant on the black market and to <UNK> a long lost relationship with a son he had form a <UNK> women years ago br br what denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul the <UNK> of nature man's interaction with people vs animals etc much of the time the <UNK> doesn't make sense but that is because we try too hard to connect all the <UNK> laid out before us in beautiful pictures life is sort of like that we look see observe <UNK> process and make of it what we will br br in using this form of film making much as she did in the strangely beautiful <UNK> <UNK> claire denis has developed a signature technique whether or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual methods of <UNK> visual and <UNK> information this is an interesting and visually captivating film but many viewers will find it an overly long <UNK> about very little perhaps watching again will change that grady <UNK>
<START> not a movie for everyone but this movie is in my top 10 i am a lover of black comedy with a cast including richard <UNK> <UNK> jeff goldblum mick larry bishop nick and gabriel <UNK> ben <UNK> <UNK> london in the leads the lines can't help but be dry the supporting cast is nearly dead center counting the minor flaws in the movie ellen <UNK> make up gave her face has a washed out look there were a couple of <UNK> cameos by joey bishop and richard <UNK> that served no purpose and michael j <UNK> screen time was too short over all the cast was just incredible without <UNK> to wreck a fine script if you have seen larry <UNK> writer director film underworld a dark crime flick you will enjoy this one his next outing writer director actor is hell ride with michael madsen and quentin tarantino
<START> acclaimed director <UNK> <UNK> puts drama on film that <UNK> with the best of soap operas high drama is found in the loves and <UNK> in new <UNK> social set oh yes don't forget jealousy can bring about <UNK> hearts and murder the all star cast features barbara stanwyck van <UNK> james mason <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and nancy davis
<START> there is no relation at all between <UNK> and <UNK> but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes <UNK> looks <UNK> <UNK> looks classic <UNK> plots are quite simple <UNK> plot are far more complicated <UNK> looks more like prime suspect if we have to spot similarities the main character is weak and weirdo but have <UNK> people like to compare to judge to <UNK> how about just enjoying funny thing too people writing <UNK> looks american but on the other hand arguing they prefer american series maybe it's the language or the spirit but i think this series is more english than american by the way the actors are really good and funny the acting is not superficial at all
<START> i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy i know i wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc br br but everything in this movie is bad <UNK> jokes people getting eaten and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time br br it's a really bad film that you have to stay away from all the jokes are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old br br i'm surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this
<START> let's see where to begin bad acting i'm not sure if i'd even call it that as it more along the lines of a no effort script read the actors didn't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and <UNK> sure there was a scene or two with nudity but that couldn't save this movie from it's lifeless characters br br to call the main character a <UNK> is an insult to the people who actually do the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless <UNK> br br budget did this movie even have a budget it seemed like they used less money than i've seen in a home shot youtube video bad lighting props poor sound post production bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so but there was no life to this flick i don't care who directed it br br i've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom don't waste your time or you'll be wishing you listened to this <UNK> review check the ratings you'll see the <UNK> are rapidly <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> with hardly anything in between wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time what a suck fest
<START> i tried as hard as i could to sit all the way through this irritating mess but i just couldn't do it brad <UNK> absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only <UNK> worse br br the whole thing is just ludicrous from the awful acting to the laughable fx to the stupid plot br br complete waste of time don't bother root <UNK> therapy would be more enjoyable <UNK> <UNK> under the <UNK> would be a lot more pleasant br br watching a uwe boll movie would be only a little worse than this get the idea
<START> i just saw this movie tonight opening night it was great i'm a big fan of sports movies and this was right up there as one of my favorites dennis quaid was great oh by the way mr quaid if you read this my sister lives in austin where you live and she was supposed to buy you a drink once well she kinda stood you up but she didn't mean to c not that anyone's going to believe that anyway it's a great movie everyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see it c
<START> i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point the guy being awake during the surgery had nothing to do with the outcome it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had 4 <UNK> suits against him and he didn't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table give me a break jessica alba is completely talentless and <UNK> is almost as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish i'm fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a <UNK> you would be in more pain than that
<START> as others have said no <UNK> is a more apt title or response to this movie title for entertainment the great opera singer should stick to singing not that he's a terrible actor it's just that this movie stinks br br the first 25 minutes were fine a nice family movie as it were but after that it's nothing but a boring soap opera br br appropriately playing a singer pavarotti as <UNK> <UNK> loses his voice a few times and the doctor pamela taylor kathryn <UNK> comes to the rescue the singer then falls for the doctor the doctor slowly falls for the singer the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goes br br pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy it's <UNK> that <UNK> things and after watching her here i am not surprised she didn't become a star br br there is nice scenery in the movie to enjoy good shots of san francisco and italy at least in the first half of the film i got bored and don't remember much about the second half of it
<START> oh god i must have seen this when i was only 11 or twelve don't ask how i may have been young but i wasn't stupid anyone could see that this is a bad movie nasty gross <UNK> and very silly i've seen more impressive effects at <UNK> i've seen better performances at a school play and i've seen more convincing <UNK> at the <UNK> where they do nothing but sit in the water ignoring the children <UNK> on the glass br br the story is set in northern australia a handful of ambitious young people are trying out a new water sport surfing in shark filled waters it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water after they learn what they get the help of a <UNK> middle aged <UNK> who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family br br i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years the best of which is lake <UNK> and the worse of which is its sequel blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think with <UNK> and crocodile <UNK> closely behind br br the australian <UNK> <UNK> is one of the most dangerous creatures out there resulting in more than a hundred <UNK> or deaths every year movies like blood surf however ruin not only the <UNK> image of such a creature but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life unless you really want to see it avoid blood surf
<START> really when it comes down to it this movie is just not funny josh kornbluth is the <UNK> of funny and yet he thinks he's hilarious the plot about <UNK> the 17 letters was fine at first until <UNK> look at me i'm wacky approach began <UNK> each and every scene the <UNK> priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been <UNK> to and that is saying quite a bit since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie and as for the incredible <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> i have just one thing to say what did the <UNK> ever do to deserve a fate like this what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to write direct produce star in such a terrible movie
<START> a retired <UNK> played nicely by michael york goes to russia to get revenge on the russian gangster that murdered the <UNK> policeman son there the <UNK> meets an exceptionally strong and decent russian cop who helps him bring the russian gangster to justice br br i remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the russians as evil bad guys out to <UNK> the righteous u s government it's interesting to see this time the russian guy as a hero br br not a great flick it's really typically a b action flick michael york lends some class to this mediocre movie alexander <UNK> who plays the russian cop is kind of blah but surprisingly has some chemistry with michael york face it michael york is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with <UNK> the handsome adrian paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie now if adrian paul was in this movie longer it would've been an above average b action flick all i can say about adrian paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie the villain played by richard <UNK> is your typical bad guy he's very blonde and very villainous in this movie br br rent this flick if there is nothing else on tv to watch it's okay it doesn't suck too bad the action scenes are decent the acting could be better the plot could've moved much faster but hey you get to see what russia looks like today
<START> forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this wide screen entertainment was aimed at a mid fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the film's sometimes <UNK> pacing doesn't help but the story's compelling central idea involving the ancient <UNK> <UNK> civilization and monsters from the id hasn't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie what i'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked that good on home video and it's elements are in dire need of <UNK> i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic
<START> i previously thought that this film was the <UNK> of the muppet films i would like now to <UNK> that statement in my opinion now the <UNK> muppet film was the tv movie it's a very merry muppet christmas am it's a wonderful life rip off that was truly dreadful muppets take manhattan is nothing special but miles more enjoyable than merry muppet christmas br br the best songs are that <UNK> can't take no for an <UNK> song the one the muppet babies sing and the songs for the big finale itself as i loved the muppet babies tv show i loved the muppet babies sequence here i'm told that it was what inspired the muppet babies show br br the manhattan <UNK> show itself was the real <UNK> with muppets from <UNK> street even appearing for the wedding as <UNK> puts it in his final line <UNK> better way could anything end ' but i wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining there are cute cameos from brooke <UNK> and gregory hines and a great dance sequence from rizzo and the rats choreographed by the late great jim <UNK> himself and the film certainly entertains i must state though that muppet movie great muppet caper and muppet christmas carol are the three <UNK> muppet movies
<START> of all the movies of the seventies none captured to <UNK> essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel i mean yes there were movies like the exorcist and other ones but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one if you have time check this one out you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such but this is a story worth getting into then there are all the stars and soon to be stars my absolute favorites were eli <UNK> sylvia miles and burgess meredith then there are the subtle clues that lead to what's going on too pay close attention i had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like <UNK> and white cat black and white <UNK> plus the books are really good as well i'm just sorry that they're not going to turn the second book into a film it's so scary that it would <UNK> this movie
<START> <UNK> overlong <UNK> which attempts to <UNK> the birth of the federal <UNK> of <UNK> begins quite <UNK> with a still relevant <UNK> into an airplane explosion however the melodrama involving james stewart and wife vera miles just gets in the way miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under <UNK> and her <UNK> nerves arrive here right on schedule <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this adaptation of don <UNK> book but despite the talent involved the picture fails to make much of an impression best performance is turned in by murray hamilton as stewart's partner however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the <UNK> pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is 1 2 from
<START> casting aside many of the <UNK> comments that have obviously come from friends and or relatives that pepper this and many other low budget <UNK> listed on imdb one is lost when it comes to using these reviews as an accurate <UNK> so eventually you have to go out and rent the flick just to see for yourself one of the first things you must understand are the catch phrases that <UNK> the reality of the movie in this case the term dark psychological thriller read hack writer director who thinks he's an auteur who <UNK> plot story and action with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul his great insight <UNK> and repressed childhood <UNK> emerge to wreck havoc when we become adults wow i bet <UNK> would be really impressed too many would be film makers like <UNK> who were raised on low budget horror flicks of the last few decades fail to dig their own fresh grave instead they fall into the pre <UNK> graves of the many other directors that came before them they are content with <UNK> old and tired horror clichés that they borrowed from a dozen or more films the result is an unoriginal uninspired unbelievable waste of film stock

<START> i agree with many of the negative reviews posted here for reasons i will go into later on but this miniseries is powerful and convincing because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of hitler's world br br peter <UNK> is perfect as <UNK> <UNK> the brutal <UNK> leader each scene he has with hitler is explosive hitler is so evil he <UNK> everyone but the <UNK> primitive <UNK> and he clearly <UNK> <UNK> for just that reason the interplay between <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the way hitler <UNK> <UNK> brutality but later sacrificed him for political reasons br br <UNK> malone turns in a <UNK> performance as <UNK> <UNK> hitler's doomed niece and the victim of his <UNK> <UNK> without revealing any of the sexual filth directly <UNK> malone plays out all the horror of the slow <UNK> of a young girl's spirit she uses her eyes and voice to suggest all the horror that will be visited on millions in the years to come and she's brilliant <UNK> <UNK> very nearly matches <UNK> malone with her portrayal of eva <UNK> eva is clearly sick cruel and heartless but at the same time almost <UNK> <UNK> on her <UNK> twisted <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> scene between them <UNK> at the spine <UNK> truth of hitler's enormous self loathing is both chilling and erotic br br <UNK> <UNK> gives a deliciously <UNK> like performance as <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> man about town who is <UNK> by hitler's promises of wealth and power while a <UNK> like <UNK> simply loves the idea of <UNK> <UNK> under his boots <UNK> character is one of many germans who <UNK> nazi violence but can't resist the quick and easy route to money and power his weak <UNK> <UNK> over hitler soon loses him the respect of his wife played with style and <UNK> by the stunning and regal <UNK> <UNK> they provide a true portrait of marriage and betrayal br br these performances carry the mini series along easily <UNK> occasional weaknesses in the script there is one exception <UNK> matthew <UNK> acting chops just aren't up to snuff his noble <UNK> <UNK> journalist ruins every scene he has the viewer can hardly wait for <UNK> brown shirts to <UNK> that smug righteous look off his ignorant corn <UNK> low rent hollywood golden boy face but the story still works br br now in regard to the factual inaccuracies of the script hitler's <UNK> and cruelty are rendered in a vibrant compelling drama but the battlefield record of <UNK> hitler is badly distorted as if afraid the audience can't handle the idea of evil and courage in the same person the writers make hitler look like a whining coward who <UNK> for an iron cross as if anyone in the <UNK> army could get a <UNK> just by whining about it the movie makes it look as if hitler were a coward in the <UNK> when he was a <UNK> soldier they also suggest his <UNK> <UNK> him when in reality he was widely admired by officers and <UNK> men alike the depressing thing is that the mini series succeeds so well in representing hitler as a monster in honest ways but they just couldn't resist the cheap shot br br all in all however hitler rise of evil is a <UNK> success <UNK> by powerful performances
<START> there are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it's not very good limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal the character design looks like a cross between the original star wars clone wars and disney's kim possible brendan the main character in this also <UNK> an uncanny similarity to ron <UNK> in kim possible background design <UNK> as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark yet by today's standards overall it is still poor and cheap looking many of the backgrounds bare <UNK> to eastern european or <UNK> animation from the mid 80's nice in its own way but for modern child audiences used to cg slug <UNK> and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body <UNK> in the wind is sure to disappoint the story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors aren't overly impressive <UNK> the usually brilliant brendan <UNK> who appears to be <UNK> in his part there are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly cliché and <UNK> racist however some of the characters are good the <UNK> villains although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound there is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by wolves from a <UNK> attack that is very nicely put together the look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film <UNK> down including a blatant rip off homage to the ghost rabbit of <UNK> the look is also clearly and obviously inspired by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look the film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner including a pretty match cut and a large scale <UNK> attack that is very moody and impressive best of all though is the music much of the background music is <UNK> and moving specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers if the whole film was as poetic as this moment and it tries then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience but instead it isn't a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn't stand up to modern animation standards overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time not sure how that was possible
<START> my mother worked with dennis l <UNK> for eleven years not to mention shared an office with him when it was announced he was btk she was shocked the whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the <UNK> killer i've heard her re tell them many times i've <UNK> her about a lot of things and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to i've read the entire book written about <UNK> <UNK> is my hometown and i was surprised that such a thing could happen in kansas br br there was another btk movie on tv not too long ago and i thought this one would have been better at portraying <UNK> killings maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives br br i'm going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie this is based on my mom's portrayal of him all my <UNK> on him and the video tapes i've seen of him talking br br first of all the camera angles were horrible it looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera the acting was terrible and i couldn't even bear to watch it br br dennis <UNK> never had long hair dennis <UNK> was a very <UNK> man and was a follow the rule book kind of guy he wasn't as nice as the movie made him look he was very polite and abrupt business like same goes for his killings as far as we all know if you've seen his confession in court you can already guess br br and as for the obsession with the slaughter house no never have i read or has dennis <UNK> <UNK> to having a problem with animal cruelty or people <UNK> bugs in fact he <UNK> on cats and dogs for <UNK> methods yet through out the whole movie he was putting animals in his <UNK> faces and acting like he cared about the well being of them br br dennis <UNK> never killed the people that he knew he <UNK> this but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also br br i really don't even want to go in to this movie and i'm already <UNK> this is not what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of btk this is not what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie if you want a badly shot half porno with some slaughter scenes served the side then this is your kind of movie
<START> i've read most of the comments here i came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that 9 11 is a shocking piece of history there are a few who think that the added narrative is weak and br br i agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary about two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the cliff <UNK> about tony but i don't think narration is unnecessary like i lot of <UNK> i think that our own lives are <UNK> we are living and making our own autobiography so if we tell about our lives this is always in the form of narration we don't sum up facts like birth childhood high school etc we create a story about our live br br because we are familiar with stories we want to put history in a story as well because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves we can better understand the things happened in history when its told in the form of a story so that's the purpose of adding a story in documentary the story is weak so be it but we understand whats going on if it was me out there i would be worried sick about my brother br br and the second point making a blockbuster movie about it true it's been to recent to come up with a big movie about 9 11 though there have been a few about the subject but none of them like this documentary but what if there will be a movie in about 5 years i agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of 9 11 but i also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history how many movies about the world war 2 have we seen if i had not seen these movies my view of the <UNK> would me totally different i remember seeing <UNK> list and i cried for an hour during class movies give you a good image of the things that happened in history and although it is fiction it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the <UNK> br br so my point telling stories is not always bad it makes us identify with the story and makes us never forget what happened
<START> no nonsense inspector <UNK> a solid turn by john bennett <UNK> the disappearance of a famous <UNK> and <UNK> the wicked past history of a creepy old house first and most mundane tale method for murder successful author charles <UNK> nicely played by <UNK> elliott is haunted by images of the murderous fiend he's writing about in his latest book although this particular outing is too obvious and predictable to be anything special it does nonetheless build to a real <UNK> of a genuine surprise ending second and most poignant <UNK> <UNK> lonely philip grayson the always outstanding peter cushing and his equally <UNK> friend <UNK> rogers the splendid <UNK> <UNK> both become <UNK> with the <UNK> wax statue of a beautiful but lethal <UNK> third and most chilling <UNK> <UNK> to the sweet quiet reserved and <UNK> widower john reid a typically terrific christopher lee in a rare semi sympathetic role hires <UNK> ann norton the fine <UNK> dawn porter to take care of his seemingly cute and harmless daughter jane a remarkably spooky and unnerving performance by the adorable chloe <UNK> this stand out scary episode is given a substantial disturbing boost by the exceptional acting from gifted child actress <UNK> who projects a truly unsettling sense of <UNK> evil lurking just underneath a <UNK> sweet and innocent <UNK> <UNK> fourth and most amusing yarn the cloak pompous horror movie star paul henderson delightfully <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> by jon pertwee <UNK> a mysterious cloak that causes him to <UNK> into a vampire whenever he wears it this item makes for good silly fun and further benefits from the <UNK> <UNK> presence of the <UNK> ingrid pitt as <UNK> <UNK> carla director peter <UNK> working from a deliciously macabre and witty script by noted horror <UNK> robert <UNK> maintains a snappy pace throughout and does an ace job of creating a suitably eerie atmosphere kudos are also in order for ray <UNK> crisp cinematography and the <UNK> score by michael dress highly recommended to fans of <UNK> fright fare
<START> across the country and especially in the political landscape people with any kind of political ambition should take time out to see this film the movie is called city hall and with little imagination its synopsis can take place anywhere in america it just so happens to open in new york here we have the story of a popular politician named mayor john <UNK> al pacino with enough <UNK> to run a major <UNK> city with very little effort his right hand man is none other than deputy mayor kevin <UNK> john cusack an equally bright individual who's ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office everything points in that direction until a police shooting <UNK> an investigation <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> bridget fonda who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor a six year old boy and a police <UNK> death are blamed on a career criminal who's questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover up by political pay offs and city corruption involving union leaders like danny aiello played by frank <UNK> corrupt <UNK> officials like judge walter stern martin <UNK> and mafia bosses like paul <UNK> anthony <UNK> who are deeply involved also <UNK> are party officials like larry <UNK> richard <UNK> who works for the <UNK> office of new york but it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting a great vehicle for cusack and a sure bet <UNK> to become a classic
<START> the subject notwithstanding this is an amateur <UNK> movie or an effort at one which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school <UNK> composition book full of death poetry to be sure it will <UNK> viewers who are hell bent on being disturbed but the success will be <UNK> to themselves not to the director to genuinely get under <UNK> skin requires sensibility discipline technique and talent as well as an eye and an ear the film does contain one <UNK> image shown as a still and also used on the video case but with no development leading up to or away from it if the director had had an eye he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie that is a movie
<START> as a kid my friends and i all believed that <UNK> was the most violent bloody movie ever made i'm not sure who started that <UNK> it was probably born out of the frustration of 10 year olds who weren't allowed to see it for one reason or other years after <UNK> was released it became a <UNK> late night cable movie and as a result i've been able to make up for lost time i must have seen scenes from this dreadful excuse for a film over a dozen times and i can always spot it from 1 2 seconds of screen time however aside from the forced <UNK> of <UNK> and martial arts the bad dubbing the stiff dialog and the outrageously difficult story line the film has some things going for it with all that's bad about the movie visually the sound is actually pretty entertaining never before has a punch or kick landed with so little force and so much volume the <UNK> kung fu sounds are <UNK> but the <UNK> and pitched down music and the nearly 5 minute slow motion scene are truly weird the chase through the city of demented blood <UNK> villagers isn't really tense as much as it is irritating and there are enough bad <UNK> and extras who all but look into the camera and wave to make this train wreck a little fun could it be headed for cult classic status where is mst3k when we need it
<START> well where to begin let's just say this avoid this movie at all br br costs it's based on a cartoon series the movie makes the cartoon look br br like hamlet filled with <UNK> actors who seem embarrassed to be br br here lousy camera work terrible music and enough product placement to br br make you want to never visit <UNK> again this movie is really the br br bottom of the barrel to quote the new <UNK> matthew <UNK> and br br rupert everett <UNK> their way through this picture with the gay abandon br br of men who have spotted a rare species of paycheck in the distance br br they should pay us some of the millions they earned for watching it br br awful
<START> if you enjoy the original snl cast and shows then avoid this movie at all costs when this first came out my friends and i waited in line for over an hour to get in to a sold out movie house half way through the movie the theatre was 3 4 empty we refused to leave thinking it would get better when the movie ended we were the only ones left in the theatre the movie lasted only one day in all theaters then <UNK> from sight in interviews with mr mike he refused to comment on this film the film was an inside joke on the episodes of snl that came out right after the films release and closing in one day we all tried to contact mr mike by phone and mail to get a <UNK> but were totally ignored
<START> in 1967 mine workers find the <UNK> of an ancient <UNK> civilization named <UNK> that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness when they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago something evil slipped through before the gate was closed twenty two years ago the government <UNK> research agency <UNK> <UNK> was directed by professor lionel <UNK> matthew walker who performed experiments with orphan children on the present days one of these children is the <UNK> investigator edward <UNK> christian slater who has just gotten an <UNK> <UNK> in south america and is chased by a man with abilities when an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night he <UNK> that demons are coming back to earth with the support of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tara reid and the leader of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> richard burke stephen <UNK> and his squad they battle against the evil creatures br br in spite of having a charismatic good cast <UNK> by christian slater tara reid and stephen <UNK> alone in the dark never works and is a complete mess without development of characters or plot the reason may be explained by the brilliant interview of director uwe boll in the extras of the dvd where he says that <UNK> are the <UNK> of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore further his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty five years old sorry but i find both <UNK> <UNK> with the younger generations i have a daughter and a son and i know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says further imdb provides excellent <UNK> to show that mr uwe boll is absolutely wrong my vote is three br br title brazil alone in the dark  o <UNK> do <UNK> alone in the dark  the awakening of the evil
<START> okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free first this movie was meant to be in <UNK> 3d it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to <UNK> what it's not that hard to film in a car second the story isn't very good there are a lot of things wrong with it br br third why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed watch it for a good laugh but don't waste your time buying it just <UNK> it or something for cheap
<START> i don't know much about the rat pack and frank sinatra always seemed a bit too self <UNK> full of himself to me so when i call this one of my all time <UNK> it's nothing to do with a tribute band mentality as another reviewer says mad dog time is about symbolism not realism it's <UNK> a pity kyle <UNK> is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd when he was so good as <UNK> k it's stylish knowing <UNK> and slick jeff goldblum is <UNK> his way around a variety of characters trying not to get shot and acting <UNK> rather than <UNK> trying to stay <UNK> of what he knows and others don't whom he can <UNK> and whom he can't gabriel <UNK> and richard dreyfuss his best performance have a ball and the supporting cast look spot on the symbolism the settings the one <UNK> motion shot with jeff goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much <UNK> <UNK> the dialogue style not <UNK> is the order of the day it's all about characters <UNK> not really <UNK> fun to watch must've been fun to do what the critics were up to is really a mystery
<START> after watching revolt of the zombies starring future academy award winner dean jagger i was left with one burning question how was a society that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever defeated in the first place br br that's the question you'll be <UNK> if you take time to watch revolt of the zombies towards the end of world war i the french discover a cult from occupied cambodia where these undead creatures who cannot be stopped with bullets form a <UNK> of monks who go over the top and <UNK> the <UNK> br br this scares the living <UNK> matter out of everyone concerned so an international expedition is formed to find out destroy the secret of these zombies so no nation can get their hands on it and rule the world br br but we've got some <UNK> in those ranks first is <UNK> <UNK> villain roy <UNK> who murders the <UNK> monk who has the secret and second is dean jagger power is the ultimate <UNK> as we all know and he's determined to woo dorothy stone away from rival robert <UNK> br br i think you've got some idea how this comes out especially since a race of zombies didn't <UNK> the world for one country dean jagger as he got the oscar for twelve <UNK> high must have <UNK> every time he thought about this film and the awful dialog he tried to give a spark of sincerity to br br moral of the story you might make an ultimate warrior with the zombie <UNK> and the zombie <UNK> but you can't make an ultimate love slave
<START> it's easy to see how this below average screenplay got by in the early sales pitch <UNK> at <UNK> films and later with fox cross the superhero genre with a comedic take on fatal attraction <UNK> i don't know how on earth a talented director like <UNK> <UNK> got involved unless the pay was just too <UNK> a <UNK> employee at an <UNK> design firm in n y c meets a girl on the subway and asks her out despite the fact she's distracted and unpleasant he eventually gets her into bed only to find out later she's the big <UNK> resident superhero g girl this <UNK> superman with powers <UNK> upon her by a fallen <UNK> isn't a fantasy heroine however screenwriter don payne has conceived her as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bitch he <UNK> this to us from miles away though uma thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs this is the kind of worthless movie that can't let an insult slip by our introduction to leading man luke wilson talking with <UNK> wilson on the train is accompanied by a sour dig at gays it <UNK> at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly <UNK> men after being approached by g girl's nemesis who wants to <UNK> her powers wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman <UNK> and isn't that better after all <UNK> early performances in films like henry june and jennifer 8 <UNK> an intelligent woman with <UNK> grace and hypnotic <UNK> her films with quentin tarantino helped expose her <UNK> <UNK> and intensity but that came at a price the actress has seemingly lost her <UNK> touch the picture is exceedingly well produced and shot with expensive seeming special effects yet nobody bothered to find the humor in this scenario it's <UNK> <UNK> ugly and badly cast <UNK> frozen faced wilson can't tell any of his co workers that he's dating g girl because she made him swear he'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up his <UNK> i wonder if writer payne actually thought that was hilarious or indeed if anyone involved did from
<START> this was a very well scripted movie great fun if you just want a stupid film not great production value ok the sound really sucked but the performance of danny masterson more than makes up for it br br watch this movie and laugh out loud
<START> i firstly and completely and <UNK> disagree with the user who calls this a spoof <UNK> glover is very serious about his film he personally introduced the film at the screening i saw in chicago he had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy what is it is <UNK> <UNK> attempt at an art film in the vein of those he <UNK> by <UNK> lynch etc br br i had heard <UNK> of this film years ago epic porno movie with all down syndrome cast directed by <UNK> glover when it finally came out i watched the trailer on line and read the synopsis and i was <UNK> at the mouth with anticipation i went to chicago to see it and it was a major disappointment if he took out the goofy sh t such as the pot smoking grandma and the dancing dolls he would be left with something much better but only about 10 minutes long br br in other words just watch the trailer be entertained and leave it at that there are some striking images and fantastic <UNK> and phrases but its lack of focus amounts to disappointment
<START> this film is mediocre at best angie <UNK> is as funny as a bag of <UNK> her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out <UNK> in this horrible anti comedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and <UNK> marriage hopefully that effort produces better results
<START> reviewing <UNK> and saying it's a bad movie isn't hard at all after all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves <UNK> this film saying it was among the worst films of the decade so the fact that i say it's bad or anyone else says it's bad is certainly no surprise it's like someone talking about wwii practically no one says that was a good thing right the question i have and no place on imdb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place after all it's obvious to anyone who isn't severely brain injured that the film would be horrible but movies like ed a baseball playing <UNK> cool as ice starring the ever popular vanilla ice <UNK> 2 which doesn't even have any <UNK> in it baby geniuses <UNK> like superhero babies and <UNK> in outer space huh prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen so the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright <UNK> br br the film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky <UNK> the <UNK> in the <UNK> of the school like the punk from free willy this kid is somehow <UNK> in other words a total brat and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown just once i want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film eventually while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of <UNK> him the genie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes but the kid doesn't believe him and the <UNK> magic seems a tad rusty br br eventually the brat does realize that <UNK> is for real however unlike most kids he <UNK> making his wishes so in the meantime <UNK> is forced to follow him around everywhere like his own personal servant and according to the cliché you know that by the end of the film max and <UNK> will have become <UNK> buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed oh and max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fiancé i'm gonna gag apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a <UNK> of wishes br br as for <UNK> <UNK> speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap very poorly i'm a middle aged white guy and i think i could probably rap at least as well he's an amazing basketball player and i've heard he's a nice guy but a <UNK> no way as far as his acting goes he wasn't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it's hard to hate him even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things br br so is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you've probably heard through the first two thirds of the movie i would have said no <UNK> seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script however later in the film the bad becomes horrid as <UNK> seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he's really needed and out of nowhere the plot gets really really weird as the guy who wants to make <UNK> a rap star turns out to be an evil mobster and oddly this guy seems to accept that <UNK> is a genie with no <UNK> br br in addition the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill max and his dad i know that the kid was annoying but this is supposed to be a kids' film what part of <UNK> to kill the <UNK> didn't the writers not understand then in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history <UNK> becomes god or something and it all was like a drug induced <UNK> this ending was even dumber and <UNK> than the one in the black hole and boy did it make my brain hurt <UNK> the horrible dialog was just too much to bear br br overall it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were <UNK> insane yes folks with a messed up message bizarre non kid friendly material and horrible characters this is one wretched film sadly given the idea and actors it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse br br by the way if you want to see a genie in a modern world film that is good try the british made for tv film bernard and the genie a charming and exceptionally well written film from start to finish
<START> embarrassingly i just watched this movie for the first time 13 years after its release it's a story that any father or brother can relate to one brother is a bit <UNK> ' the other brother is the typical older child craig <UNK> is a little too <UNK> as the oldest brother but pitt is amazing and <UNK> is perfectly cast as the father the fishing scenes that were filmed in montana are absolutely breathtaking i had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive the movie closely follows the book with only a few <UNK> to make it more appropriate for a movie format unlike most book to movie stories this one <UNK> up it's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie
<START> i am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film and of the few reviews that there are to be positive i saw the movie and was pretty <UNK> i didn't find it very enjoyable at all it was slow and lacks the entertainment value even the murder scenes are lackluster with real close up shots of generic <UNK> that don't look good at all and the supposed great twist ending is really not much i did see it coming and then the ending just seemed cliche this movie may not get much mention but by the little that it does get it is overrated i would not recommend this movie
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> greatest movie david niven plays the <UNK> <UNK> pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is <UNK> and <UNK> an angel to investigate the scene when the young soldiers men and women black and white all killed in action arrive in heaven to be <UNK> for eternal life is <UNK> poignant watch out too for roger <UNK> a deeply under appreciated actor and kim hunter as the love interest later of course <UNK> in planet of the apes incidentally steven spielberg cast the actress who played the chief angel kathleen byron as the elderly wife of the eponymous private in saving private ryan half a century later an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic <UNK>
<START> child <UNK> is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and i feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an <UNK> sexual nature in order to shock and <UNK> the audience after having seen both <UNK> and <UNK> one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws the other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with <UNK> music and the odd suicide br br i do not believe that turning this issue into a hollywood tear <UNK> is a useful or necessary <UNK> to adopt and i must <UNK> the makes of <UNK> for engaging subtly but <UNK> with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure <UNK> <UNK> between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts i found this <UNK> and at times offensive to the cause if i had wanted a cheap laugh i would not have signed up for a film on child <UNK> br br for anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something i would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of <UNK>
<START> to be completely honest i haven't seen that many western films but i've seen enough to know what a good one is this by far the worst western on the planet today first off there black people in the wild west come on who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly no no completely retarded secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns <UNK> whats with the asian chick speaking perfect english if the setting is western asia isn't where your going finally the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning now don't get me wrong i'm not racist or white either so don't get <UNK> after reading this but this movie this movie is the worst presentation of black people i have ever seen
<START> if you are planning to see this movie please <UNK> i don't usually post my comments about something i've seen on television but this one was such a waste of my life that i needed to do something <UNK> to get that bad taste out of my mouth <UNK> this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it i will just simply say please do not ever see this movie it was a complete waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things utterly inept or working for the company that produced it again i guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie
<START> i went on a visit to one of my relatives a while back and we popped by a theatre so we'd thought we'd go in and give this film a go what a mistake this film is awful in every department i'd never heard of the film before and literally everyone still hasn't no wonder this is as rank as it gets it's a comedy so it says well the only thing funny is the ability or lack of it of the director to make such a film getting so close to christmas this should be titled how to under cook a turkey in nearly one and a half hours or however long it was as i walked out at the end of the film you'll come out feeling as though you've been food <UNK> on a sick turkey and regret you wasted your time on such <UNK> who knows why such things get made some people had walked out from the theatre before the film was well over and i blame myself for not walking out a lot earlier it really <UNK> me that you pay good money to see something decent and all that you come out and see is a poor tv movie that should be showed at 2 <UNK> in the morning in fact it's that bad day time tv shouldn't be showing it what else can a say probably not enough bad words could do it justice
<START> until i saw this special on hbo i had never heard of eddie izzard i sure am glad that i have now he is one of the funniest comedians i have ever seen rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then eddie i could not stop laughing for the entire show if you like to laugh you have to see this special
<START> people like me will tear this movie apart it's just not realistic the plot is <UNK> predictable you can <UNK> everything that happens <UNK> of course they find the treasure and become filthy rich and trick the bad guy we've seen it a million times before the writers of this movie must think that the majority of the movie going public is stupid they must be right because the majority of people actually liked this film i mean solving <UNK> in a matter of seconds the secret treasure room hidden under the manhattan subway you'd think with all the work that's gone on in new york underground that room would have been discovered before and all that was constructed during the civil war please and the love story between ben and <UNK> how cute and i thought the romance in clive <UNK> novels was weak they just fall in love like that in 2 seconds whatever i'd be more concerned with saving my own ass then getting some the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper 1 10 garbage
<START> good deaths good mask cool axe good looking girls but watch out no plot and little scares completely lower it's standards they tried to make an i know what you did last summer but ended up making a scream but hey what do people expect from a horror movie answers totally <UNK> rent it if you want but i regret ever seeing it
<START> i became a fan of the tv series homicide life on the <UNK> late in the show's run but became a fan very quickly it was a cop show unlike any other visually different in its use of hand held cameras taking the viewer everywhere with its <UNK> and <UNK> cast and their varying and fascinating personalities and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department including the corruption and personality <UNK> that bubble up to the surface br br homicide the movie the reunion follow up to the series is as good as a made for television film can be after lt <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> now a candidate for mayor of <UNK> is shot the <UNK> cast members are back to help find the killer in addition the cast members who left the force and those who died also manage to have their place in the film the intensity and fire that marked the series return and the script <UNK> with the same fire that marked the series all in all a terrific tv movie br br vote 9
<START> i don't think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake especially for originality yes the scarecrow is a kung fu fighting <UNK> but why not no one else is willing to go that far i really haven't had this much fun watching a movie since <UNK> so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow even his mom doesn't care about him then he gets killed and the spirit is <UNK> with in the scarecrow who then goes on a killing spree his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going the <UNK> at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors but with most dedication towards <UNK> <UNK> really struck me as cool these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs with one liners you'll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick i would say grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a off with this movie i love it for its originality most fun
<START> audrey i know you truly <UNK> your husband ted's memory but please do his legacy justice and <UNK> his wishes dr seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason we beg of you to please stop <UNK> in on his stories images fantasies and characters they are getting <UNK> by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these <UNK> and grotesque interpretations that will forever <UNK> the loving warmth and innocence of his books br br it is indeed your property to do with as you wish i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while save what is left of dr seuss thank you
<START> perhaps i missed the meeting when the meaning of b movie was explained but what i just saw was ridiculous you want a good synopsis of this movie take aliens replace the <UNK> with vampires then remove everything that was good about it and that's pretty much it br br 5 minutes into the movie the v san squad that's the dumbest <UNK> i've ever heard <UNK> out a base thats been <UNK> by vampires and then they climb down down what a ladder obviously attached to a <UNK> with an obvious present day train in the background when is this supposed to take place <UNK> okay hold on i'll get back to that br br yeah the characters wow well there's the token lesbian asian chick the redneck cowboy wannabe the <UNK> captain the <UNK> vampire hot topic part time <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> second in command all of them are played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition it almost <UNK> me to see micheal <UNK> in this flick isn't he getting enough money being the voice of sam fisher in <UNK> cell pretty much the only thing original about vampire wars is about how bad it is br br watching this <UNK> of a film the only amusement i got was from the feeble attempts at set making since when does <UNK> <UNK> computer cards on a wall count as a ready room on a starship the money required to do this film could have been put to much more better use
<START> i'm not saying that just as a chris rock fan i'm saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong the first flaw was it's everything works out ending that everybody saw coming flaw number two was i found that the chemistry between <UNK> king and chris rock seemed fake finally the acting in this movie was sub par with the best actor being <UNK> king and the worst being mark <UNK> but i saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy in a heads up scenario watch heaven can wait instead it's better so for all you chris rock fans out there watch this movie you'll enjoy out he has some good stand up in this movie br br overall 7 out of 10
<START> the first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape complete with a digital <UNK> at the bottom of the frame it presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her the hapless victim is beaten <UNK> and <UNK> with raw meat before having her <UNK> pulled out with <UNK> her hand <UNK> with a hammer her eye <UNK> with a <UNK> and so forth br br in the most nauseating scene the woman's <UNK> burn her with hot water and drop live <UNK> into the burns the series received a great deal of publicity when american actor charlie sheen believing the series to contain actual murder attempted to <UNK> its distribution in the united states an fbi investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers sick re creations using nasty but obvious special effects <UNK> staged by acclaimed japanese comic book artist <UNK> <UNK> who also directed the third and fourth episodes this film is a sure way to clear all but the most <UNK> of rooms but <UNK> probably won't find anything special
<START> i am not a big fan of horror films and have only seen a handful of them and none of the halloween s or friday the <UNK> s but i can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore and i'm pretty sure this isn't scary br br what's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere in all of its appearances there are <UNK> establishing shots so there's no real surprise in any of this film not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway but br br the plot concerns claus von <UNK> third cousin john hudson who marries a donna reed look a like <UNK> <UNK> giving one of the worst performances ever who begins seeing <UNK> and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of <UNK> on her husband's mansion did i mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident <UNK> wonder who did it br br this is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and or drive their wife insane if you want to see a well done version of this stuff try <UNK> of fortune and btw jeremy <UNK> is one hundred times more talented than john hudson br br the <UNK> was okay but nothing special paired with the <UNK> short however it makes for good viewing br br two stars for the screaming skull eight stars for the mst3k version br br and now to <UNK> mr von <UNK> himself how bad is this film you have no idea
<START> as one of the few <UNK> not to have seen the 1st film i found this to be a very disappointing movie br br yes it has a funny awkward type of humour if you can bear the highly morally dubious premise however it fails <UNK> in the important areas br br there is thin and nonsensical plot line involving gordon <UNK> generous friend who may or may not be <UNK> in a conspiracy to supply dangerous <UNK> to third world countries possibly in free computers or possibly not vague long <UNK> and <UNK> the lack of any substantial ending is so <UNK> and what is present is pompous and wholly illogical the film feels half finished br br suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher maria doyle kennedy can be drawn to gordon <UNK> unimpressive character especially when he <UNK> off her advances laughable it <UNK> later in the film when he achieves his romantic ambitions then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value br br not many films leave me feeling cheated but i felt my time was stolen
<START> jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value completely lacking in <UNK> excitement or leading ladies with appeal one decent fight a few moments of mild suspense and a one note plot br br the movie <UNK> <UNK> in a series of conversations between <UNK> character and a <UNK> homicide detective well played by timothy <UNK> but despite their best efforts both actors are <UNK> to the cross of the film's <UNK> br br with a lesser actor in the lead role and without the benefit of oliver <UNK> cinematography <UNK> would blend into the sea of low budget vampire <UNK>
<START> the movie has several story lines that follow several different characters the different story lines don't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times br br it may sound weak and cliché but it's true you're way better of watching the crocodile hunter series on the discovery channel with steve and <UNK> irwin it's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is i'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure for a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and steve and <UNK> irwin just aren't good actors not even when they play themselves their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their <UNK> feel long distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times br br the movie had quite some potential i mean steve irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch so when i first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile <UNK> my first reaction was brilliant the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters the movie does has a certain entertainment value at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still i must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie br br watching this movie felt like a waste of time still this movie might be watchable just once when it gets on tv on a rainy afternoon it does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential br br 4 10
<START> <UNK> what a dreadful movie dodgy camera work a script with more corn than <UNK> and acting so hammy you could open a pig farm with it br br to cap it all it doesn't know which audience to aim at we have <UNK> <UNK> or is that corny <UNK> getting on his soap box about the <UNK> of smoking any time someone lights a cigarette dear oh dear and in another awkward scene we have the baddie <UNK> forcing his <UNK> if you will <UNK> <UNK> to do a <UNK> dressed in a bikini try explaining that one to the kids br br throw in an overly contrived treasure island <UNK> jaws type storyline and the result is a film so unintentionally funny it's enjoyable i shouldn't expect a special edition dvd any time soon though
<START> atlantis the lost empire has some of the best <UNK> animation and cleverly written dialogue of any disney movie i've seen and i was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes i especially love don <UNK> voice work on vincenzo <UNK> and phil morris as joshua <UNK> sweet too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate at least in the first act one important aspect of any disney movie is a satisfying antagonist which atlantis doesn't provide he's average at best halfway through the movie there's a mediocre twist that's all it's a great movie nevertheless everyone should check it out
<START> after eagerly waiting to the end i have to say i wish i wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first place the final episode was everything against the previous seven years it has ruined everything the journey was 23 years but captain <UNK> has the power to <UNK> it let say seven years only why seven why not just one or nothing why not avoid the whole adventure <UNK> were dying all along the journey why she wants to save seven of nine only the others don't count or what the most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them as the say journey is more important than the destination unbelievable and at the finale scene the are surrounded by other <UNK> ships and the earth is in sight nothing about landing returning to the normal life br br worst ending ever
<START> cut is a film about some film students making a film it's very much in the scream mold an ironic self <UNK> horror flick which for me at least falls down because for all its irony it's still just a bad horror film same as the films its referring to br br but it was not without its charms well one charm anyway molly <UNK> was fantastic as the <UNK> bitchy american actress hating every minute of working with the amateur australian film crew she was so convincing that its <UNK> to believe it wasn't an act although everyone involved with cut says she was lovely to work with br br seriously every scene of her <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> was great everyone else however <UNK> between being ok and being terribly wooden br br anyway cut has some laughs a few <UNK> of gore some of it surprisingly gruesome and ultimately is just another bad horror film
<START> historically accurate hmm perhaps if you <UNK> and light falls upon the subject just so but core accuracy is no <UNK> for a dismal <UNK> and inconsistent plot <UNK> of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfying conclusion the principal characters are merely characterizations embarrassing stereotypes that range from the <UNK> and <UNK> american indians through to the <UNK> but <UNK> british officers a wretched and <UNK> rendition of a fascinating period in american history i want my money back
<START> i am totally addicted to this show i can't wait till the week goes by to see the next showing it's a great story line and it has the best actors and actresses on the show i will tune in every week to watch it even if i am not home i always have my vcr set to tape <UNK> <UNK> simon rex is the best actor on the show it is suspenseful and exciting i think this show should stay on the air and i believe everyone should tune in to watch it i saw the very first episode and actually i wasn't going to watch it but i was watching lifetime one day and i decided to watch it because it was on and i absolutely love it and right now it's my favorite show i am really mean it
<START> firstly i won't tell you why i rented this movie as i'm still confused myself br br air rage is much like any movie i've seen where a plane is <UNK> there is of course that one important person on the plane and the <UNK> looking for revenge the sad thing is some of the methods to stop the <UNK> have already been used in other movies are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly br br although it's ice t who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at acting while he's not busy putting the c back in front of rap who is <UNK> on the cover the movie actually stars the less than amazing kim <UNK> as a <UNK> who is <UNK> overlooked by the five <UNK> which naturally comes back to haunt them as for the rest of the cast the only person i managed to recognize was steve <UNK> more <UNK> known as kenny <UNK> from seinfeld br br i can't forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie when a <UNK> used about a pound of <UNK> to blow a lock off a door brilliant br br the plot was <UNK> predictable br br the script atrocious it got to the point where i could say something which i felt would make a stupid comment and it would be the next line in the movie br br as for special effects the only thing special about this movie is that i wasted the cost of electricity to run my tv and vcr for 100 minutes br br and the title the movie did take place in the air but due to the less than stellar performances the only rage in the movie was that of the viewer br br so if you're in the mood to even pick apart a movie just because it's bad please save yourself don't choose this
<START> arguably this is a very good sequel better than the first live action film 101 <UNK> it has good dogs good actors good jokes and all right slapstick br br cruella devil who has had some rather major therapy is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them many including chloe simon owner of one of the dogs that cruella once tried to kill do not believe this others like kevin shepherd owner of 2nd chance dog shelter believe that she has changed br br meanwhile <UNK> with his mate have given birth to three cute <UNK> <UNK> little <UNK> domino and oddball br br starring eric <UNK> as <UNK> the hilarious <UNK> glenn close as cruella herself and gerard depardieu as le <UNK> another baddie the name should give a clue this is a good family film with excitement and lots more one downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick but not quite as excessive as the last film this is also funnier than the last film br br enjoy <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie was disappointing it was <UNK> and dull while alec baldwin tried to portray himself as the perfect fair and just <UNK> not to mention executive producer the movie never showed any of the defense <UNK> or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible path br br sure nobody wants to defend the <UNK> point of view but that was the point of the <UNK> <UNK> four hours of simply bashing on the <UNK> c'mon thats been done already br br i really think alec baldwin should just stick to being kim <UNK> husband br br right after the movie ended <UNK> showed the 1959 movie trail at <UNK> that movie is far superior
<START> having read some good reviews about this film i thought it was about time i go and see it well i don't know why i bothered basically this family is <UNK> with a clue that leads to a whole big <UNK> of ancient treasure hidden by the knights <UNK> during the war of independence apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the british at all costs firstly why did said knights move the treasure from europe to america how did <UNK> <UNK> character figure out that <UNK> was in fact a ship how do they figure out all the clues and <UNK> in about a minute and how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best <UNK> bit of paper in the world these are just some of the plot holes in this inane bit of hollywood action gone wrong cage has been in some great action movies <UNK> <UNK> and 'the <UNK> so why has he <UNK> himself to this is he getting too old his character is pretty annoying really somehow this <UNK> guy steals the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> thieves with guns escapes from the fbi and generally seems <UNK> the whole film doesn't really make any sense and all in all it was quite a disappointment
<START> maybe it's because i looked up the history of the irish troubles in the 1920s and then the sad civil war that <UNK> the free state after the <UNK> of the <UNK> before watching this movie anyway the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes br br victor mclaglen isn't as famous today as he was back then and he should be better remembered in this film i think he's playing himself as he would have been without his <UNK> talent and brains for example the scenes where his buddy in the crowd is challenging men to fight with him is probably quite reminiscent of what mclaglen actually did in earlier years when he was a world class bare <UNK> boxer john ford is partly responsible for that the imdb trivia section shows how he tricked mclaglen into getting a really bad <UNK> for the trial scene this director also could bring out a lot in his actors even without such tricks mostly though mclaglen is firmly in control especially when his character is almost totally <UNK> which is difficult for an actor to do <UNK> and he also plays gypo nolan with a depth and emotional power that is surprising for someone who has only seen mclaglen later in his career in the quiet man i especially like the contrast between this role as an ira man and the much more obviously controlled performance he gave as the ira man denis hogan in <UNK> house br br in the quiet man of course mclaglen is a country <UNK> at odds with the local ira victor mclaglen was big and bully in the old fashioned sense of the word but he was a good actor too and capable of wide range and fine nuances of performance that we just wouldn't expect of a such a man today it's a rather sad comment on our own set of expectations and prejudices br br ford as usual packs a lot into a little bit of film all the characters are excellent though the <UNK> mostly american accent is distracting note there be spoilers ahead knowing that gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man but let him talk his way out of it instead we really empathize with the man who draws the short straw for <UNK> gypo and the humanity he shows most notably when they go to take gypo in <UNK> room br br john ford really shows his genius here taking what could have been a gruesome and yet expected outcome to the whole story and instead using it to set up a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying ending that makes us think not just of gypo and the other characters but of poor ireland during that tortured time
<START> watched this last night and was <UNK> over by the heartfelt story line the excellent character development and the good <UNK> vibe <UNK> from the acting and movie as a whole br br without giving away too much of the plot it begins with an ordinary joe who <UNK> to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons along the way the protagonist and the <UNK> characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves br br the story has a prologue about what dancing in japan <UNK> <UNK> so it isn't exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the u s br br the film is lighthearted you'll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags yet it is also <UNK> in a way hard to describe all of the film's characters are taken seriously as they are and none are <UNK> because of their <UNK> br br i've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends it just so happened a friend <UNK> me the video on learning to dance is this <UNK> or what i think so because now i'm really <UNK> to give it a try br br watch this wonderful family film small children might not get it but teens certainly would and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again br br why they would make a remake of shall we dance is a mystery as it is perfect as is
<START> <UNK> writer mark <UNK> as edgar allen poe tries to <UNK> old <UNK> and start a new life for himself as a <UNK> <UNK> magazine <UNK> however <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> his efforts he would also like to <UNK> romance with an old sweetheart a significantly flawed <UNK> as things turns out mr <UNK> also directed this <UNK> of the mysterious last days of edgar allen poe <UNK> employs a lot of black and white color and trick photography to create mood kevin g <UNK> as dr john <UNK> performs well relatively speaking it's not enough
<START> i thought this was an excellent and very honest portrayal of <UNK> and racism this movie never <UNK> to the audience and never gets predictable the acting was top notch and the movie reminded me of one flew over the <UNK> nest
<START> <UNK> is one of the movies that kids just love and mom and dad can have fun watching as well growing up in the 80's i enjoyed this movie it's plot and all the actors i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did the plot is fun a group of kids <UNK> on a journey they never expected when they were <UNK> into space by a <UNK> robot they were in <UNK> at first but when they realized they didn't have enough <UNK> to make it back panic sunk in once they <UNK> enough <UNK> from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life
<START> i was really disappointed in this movie those that voted this thing a 10 have a screw lose the acting was ok kinda wooden and cardboard the ending was sorry i just didn't care for this at all br br no way could i recommend this mess
<START> this movie is great brad pitt will never be able to out act the performance he gave in this movie duchovny was top notch as was forbes and lewis the 4 main characters <UNK> on a <UNK> road tour of historic murder sites in one of the coolest cars ever made 1960's model lincoln <UNK> early grace is a <UNK> with a taste for dry <UNK> and carnage he likes his women to not curse or smoke and wear <UNK> dresses duchovny and forbes are a pair of artists from the city while early and lewis are trailer <UNK> from the rural <UNK> even though the majority tone in the film is dark there are plenty of funny scenes to be had the writing directing and acting are brilliant if you like road movies murder humor and narration watch this film everyone delivers and you will want more when the credits roll one of my all time favorites hey <UNK> that dog n teach it to hunt
<START> on october of 1945 the american german <UNK> leopold <UNK> jean marc <UNK> arrives in a post war <UNK> and his bitter uncle <UNK> <UNK> hugo <UNK> gets a job for him in the <UNK> train line as a sleeping car conductor while traveling in the train learning his profession he sees the <UNK> occupied germany and meets <UNK> <UNK> barbara <UNK> the daughter of the former powerful <UNK> of transport business and owner of <UNK> max <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> leopold stays neutral between the allied forces and the germans and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called werewolves killing the <UNK> of the allied and <UNK> <UNK> actions against the allied forces he falls in love for <UNK> and sooner she <UNK> that she was a werewolf when max commits suicide leopold is also pressed by the werewolves and need to take a position and a decision br br europa is an impressive and <UNK> <UNK> story of the great danish director lars von trier using an <UNK> style that recalls fritz lang and <UNK> a magnificent black white cinematography with some colored details this movie <UNK> a difficult period of germany and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war very impressive the action of the <UNK> forces destroying resources that could <UNK> a faster <UNK> of a destroyed country and the corruption with the jew that should identify max jean marc <UNK> has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody the hypnotic narration of max von <UNK> is another touch of class in this awarded film my vote is nine br br title brazil europa
<START> this is a short <UNK> animated series by david lynch as it says in the beginning and it follows the <UNK> of a backwoods overall wearing large man with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son both of those elements are <UNK> upon repeatedly in the short episodes and there's no real plot to be seen it's easier if you think of this as an exceptionally odd slightly macabre looney tunes with far more gore profanity bloody violence and occasional moments of hilarity br br i bought the dvd along with <UNK> having previously seen <UNK> don't look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece this is anything but in fact it seems to almost be a statement against such things as its rough style <UNK> in the face of any sort of animation convention you may see as lynch says if this is funny it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all
<START> this could be a strong candidate for the worst flick ever perhaps without the presence of john hurt it could be <UNK> as a kid film however the tragedy of this entire <UNK> is that john hurt one of the <UNK> greatest actors <UNK> himself in this i gave it two points just because mr hurt showed up i take away 8 points because he didn't run from it fast enough as far as the rest of the cast they are simply terrible <UNK> turner as pretty as she might be cannot act to save her soul and the lead actor is for all <UNK> and purposes awful if you can spare yourself this embarrassment please do so it's so bad it almost hurts
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen however the little slave girl alice and jared harris imitating christopher walken is what makes this movie entertaining <UNK> smoking drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting i have to applaud jared for his christopher walken imitation and christopher walken for allowing this to be in the movie
<START> this movie is about human relationships charming funny and well written with meaningful text it seems that morgan freeman surely have fun at the set also good music paz vega is a beautiful and smart woman i really enjoy her acting woman like her are a good motivation to learn spanish language from the moment morgan freeman meets the cute paz vega the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed 10 items or less is about <UNK> of life if you enjoy this film see also the pursuit of happiness with will smith and his son thats not a action film or a nude comedy its all about human relations
<START> if i had just seen the pilot of this show i would have rated it a 10 i was immediately hooked on this gorgeous new world subsequent episodes have not completely lived up to the promise but i will keep watching and hope that it keeps getting better the production values are incredible and the acting is first rate i don't mind that it doesn't seem to <UNK> perfectly with bsg because i am so intrigued by the premise and let's face it they are two different shows i'm thrilled that both <UNK> <UNK> and one of my all time <UNK> eric <UNK> are back in my life if only weekly as i've missed them both this is a show that requires a bit of thought from its audience and that is always a good thing you kind of have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show things are not always as they seem and certainly there are shades of gray both literally and <UNK> in plot lines characters and of course the various virtual worlds we all know how it ends but the journey is looking to be quite a ride
<START> what happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him <UNK> homeless people answer to no one they have no <UNK> rent <UNK> or idiot bosses homeless people don't have to worry about the irs or performance reviews or credit card <UNK> but give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly they have to worry about entering the rat race buying gas for <UNK> paying insurance on their car and working for someone else they get a chance to be a <UNK> citizens this film was about as <UNK> as a film can be it's a way for the rich and middle class <UNK> to say see what happens when you try to help the poor and it <UNK> <UNK> arrogance br br why not a film that asks what happens when you take away everything a rich man has
<START> story says that on that on december 28 <UNK> a small group of thirty three people was gathered at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> du grand <UNK> to witness the <UNK> a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of <UNK> named august and louis <UNK> the small audience reunited that day some by <UNK> most due to curiosity didn't really know what to expect from the show and when a <UNK> photograph appeared projected on a screen most thought that the <UNK> was just another fancy <UNK> to present slide show <UNK> until the photograph started to move what those thirty three people experienced in awe that cold day of december was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day br br of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day la <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> literally <UNK> the <UNK> factory was the very first to be screened the film shows the many workers of the <UNK> factory as they walk through the gates of the factory leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work while a very basic <UNK> film movie depicting a real event the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise as their concept of moving pictures was limited to <UNK> <UNK> show machines the <UNK> the <UNK> invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe as the people and the horses moved across the screen the idea wasn't entirely new le prince shot the first movie as early as <UNK> but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary br br la <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> would become the first in the long series of <UNK> films that the <UNK> would produce over the years this primitive form of documentary was the <UNK> favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the <UNK> could have despite the initial lack of enthusiasm after the first showing the <UNK> became a great success and la <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> quickly became an iconic image of that first screening it definitely wasn't the first movie the brothers shot that year and it probably wasn't the best of the 10 movies shown that day personally i think that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was the best of the 10 however it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates as literally this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it 8 10
<START> this is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen it is really refreshing to watch and i was in <UNK> many times i guess there is a social awareness factor to this too which makes it quite interesting if these were white girls would they get the same reaction maybe they would maybe they wouldn't the characters know no limits check my lyrics and do not <UNK> anyone from their twisted sense of fun there are so many funny sketches my favorites is the bob the <UNK> one it's so silly it's genius if you like twisted black comedy then this is for you if you like keeping up appearances it probably isn't 3 non <UNK> is yet another hilarious british bbc comedy shown on tv it is such a funny show and the characters unleashed on the unsuspecting public are laugh at loud funny it would be impossible to keep a straight face watching the crazy characters and the reactions of the public this series easily adds to the excellent comedies being produced
<START> a plot that <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> differences in opinions <UNK> a <UNK> havoc with one side pro life and the other a <UNK> of a <UNK> seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which <UNK> each other to death despite the title itself being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with it's <UNK> depictions crashed apart like a <UNK> old <UNK> chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and <UNK> when it finally came to the end
<START> this film is beautiful to look at but is like watching really bad experimental theater the plot if there was one doesn't make any sense but it is very artistic lots of shots of half dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other's eyes lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame <UNK> and people wandering <UNK> lingering close ups of faces and bodies by the time you get to the <UNK> on the roof with the cat you'll be ready to throw a bottle of <UNK> at the screen br br it is supposed to be about a father and son's relationship but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f each other and get it over with if you have always wanted to see bad russian gay porn without any money shots your wish has been granted
<START> claire <UNK> movies seem to fall into one of two categories the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate <UNK> definitely falls into the first category but it's not so awful as trouble every day or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br now ever since i saw <UNK> i've made it a point to see every new movie denis makes and i have always been disappointed <UNK> was no exception she has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one br br you get a lot of the denis <UNK> an older but still magnificent <UNK> <UNK> who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips the gap between her teeth her ample <UNK> and a couple of nice <UNK> the black guy from trouble every day and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> colin and that <UNK> or russian girl michel <UNK> character was interesting enough but the camera <UNK> on him at such length that i got annoyed by that curly <UNK> of hair hanging over his <UNK> and was <UNK> when somewhere in korea i think he finally got it cut br br there was certainly some action gruesome murders a man's search for a son and there may even have been a plot but one viewing wasn't enough to figure it out and two viewings are i fear out of the question for one thing the score was jarring and <UNK> as in beau <UNK> for another the seasons changed too abruptly leaving you even more confused about what was going on oh there were a few pretty shots and if you liked friday evening with its shots of the <UNK> in heavy <UNK> and <UNK> you might appreciate the <UNK> of <UNK> otherwise steer clear br br i saw this movie in french and it's possible i missed something crucial but the dialogue in a denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages double <UNK> and with ample <UNK> in <UNK> the silence is sublime in <UNK> it's just dull
<START> ship <UNK> was probably made in order to showcase mgm talent the film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to san juan puerto rico at the time in which the country was involved in wwii this was typical fare for the studios which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times the country was living br br the beautiful <UNK> powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be <UNK> with red <UNK> is also seen in a straight part with not too much <UNK> as he <UNK> the beautiful ms powell on the ship that is bringing them to puerto rico the irresistible bert <UNK> has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man also virginia grey is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone br br there are good musical numbers featuring tommy <UNK> and his orchestra in which one sees among others the amazing buddy rich who has a few <UNK> with mr <UNK> and ms powell a young frank sinatra appears also as the lead singer of the band backed by the <UNK> <UNK> br br this is a nostalgic trip that should be <UNK> by fans of this genre which mgm totally controlled
<START> the only reason i didn't score this a one is that <UNK> does show that he is <UNK> at the technical aspects of making a film it is a technically <UNK> film br br that having been said this is a film based on lies and <UNK> that are quite easily <UNK> most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact and <UNK> <UNK> proof that the <UNK> were <UNK> is easily <UNK> if you know anything about <UNK> <UNK> br br i do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at <UNK> video for free don't let bart <UNK> profit from your curiosity
<START> i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex <UNK> <UNK> their triangle love were full of <UNK> frustration and jealous at last alex <UNK> up and realized that they would not have result and future ending up was sad br br the director <UNK> <UNK> was in <UNK> theatre on sunday 12 <UNK> on <UNK> 10 <UNK> with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the <UNK> to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of <UNK> br br on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love <UNK> of alex and <UNK> and <UNK> and her brother <UNK> were kind of next door neighborhood story br br the two main reasons i don't like this movie are firstly the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which <UNK> was living then two girls are fall in love it doesn't make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much <UNK> you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didn't have a scene of alex and <UNK> sexual <UNK> that 's what i was waiting <UNK> however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear <UNK> part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear <UNK> to appreciate <UNK> love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate
<START> for daniel <UNK> queen <UNK> was much better for <UNK> kinski paris <UNK> was much better the biggest <UNK> were from chris <UNK> <UNK> and a world <UNK> cannot even be compared with this one and <UNK> <UNK> for use of a version of the same musical theme from queen <UNK> for this movie attention to the end of the film if this was an american pop movie i would not feel surprised at all but for a european film with more independent actors and director a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple minded and disappointing there are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the <UNK> people there are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone and finally there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys every character is shown in simple black and white terms the good versus the evil plus from the very beginning i could understand how the story would end is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse i believe that the difficult issue of child <UNK> and <UNK> is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie i think this movie was not disturbing but very disappointing
<START> my favorite <UNK> movie and one of the best action adventure flicks of all time grant mclaglen and fairbanks dominate the screen with daring do and wise cracks to please all but the most pc of film goers memorable scenes abound the 3 <UNK> and their 20 <UNK> fighting off hundreds of thugs <UNK> cutter giving bobby <UNK> the <UNK> punch save some for the elephant cutter to <UNK> i'm an expedition din breaking cutter out of jail with a <UNK> what do you think i'm trying to break out of a <UNK> <UNK> and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then <UNK> bold as <UNK> all right you're all under arrest br br i could go on but suffice it to say i try to catch this film whenever it is on for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours
<START> horrible horrible tv show why comedy central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me it really sucks i am of course speaking about the seasons after the first two the first two seasons were golden and if i was exclusively talking about those seasons this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars none of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are any good they were and are awful the comedy is not funny at all at all br br the original cast was full of very talented comedians like <UNK> lange phil <UNK> and mary <UNK> or whatever her name is all of whom should have gotten better deals after they left mad tv this show is highly overrated and less worthy of your channel surfing time than saturday night live another horrible show go out on saturday night and have fun and leave mad tv to <UNK> and die as it deserves to
<START> while it certainly wasn't the best movie i've ever seen it was certainly worth the 8 which can't be said for many movies these days br br this was a pleasant account of a true story although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie ie billy <UNK> character was three or four people in the real story combined together robert deniro was of course good and cuba gooding jr was also impressive
<START> the <UNK> rivers is one of the most over directed over the top over everything mess i've ever seen come out of france there's nothing worse than a french production trying to out do films made in hollywood and <UNK> is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror action buddy flick i almost stopped it halfway through because i knew it wouldn't amount to anything but french guys trying to show off br br the film starts off <UNK> like some sort of <UNK> horror film but it quickly shifts genres from horror to action to x files type to buddy flick that in the end <UNK> is all of it and also none of it it's so full of clichés that at one point i thought the whole thing was a comedy the painful dialogue and those silent pauses with fades outs and fades ins just at the right <UNK> moments made me <UNK> i thought only films made in hollywood used this hackneyed technique br br the chase scene with vincent <UNK> running after the killer is so over directed and over done that it's almost a thing of beauty the climax on top of the mountain with the stupid revelation about the killer s with <UNK> and reno playing buddies like nolte and murphy in 48 <UNK> completely <UNK> what little credibility the film had by then br br it's difficult to believe that the director of the <UNK> rivers also directed <UNK> which though had its share of problems doesn't even come close to the awfulness of this <UNK> confused film
<START> <UNK> mates just watched croc hunter the movie it was alright but the show seems more real this just seemed like a longer <UNK> episode with funnier lines and more characters a few things steve described snakes <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> you know that hurts and cant they jump up high hes all <UNK> them by the tail and stuff there was two major <UNK> shots in this movie when terry find that baby joey she goes like we have to <UNK> them just like a baby <UNK> i thought she was gonna up breast feed that kid that <UNK> made it pg 13 though while on terry did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show <UNK> knowledge on ritual <UNK> she knows her sex <UNK> movie takes place in <UNK> <UNK> i want a <UNK> <UNK> and joey br br <UNK> dog <UNK> actually has a purpose in this movie albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite wielding <UNK> br br oh and if anyone else watches this try and agree with me in saying that country <UNK> fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in <UNK> the croc he was eating her sheep i would be mad too
<START> director sam fuller has something of a cult following particularly in europe yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable he did however direct one really terrific movie in pickup on south street made pretty early on in his career the movies that followed were vastly inferior br br from the first to the last frame pickup works on all levels it's filmed with flawless <UNK> <UNK> fine performances all round richard widmark and thelma ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances are at their peak widmark who was no stranger at playing villains while truly mean to the core still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making jean peters character's falling for him all the more credible br br fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie there is a scene in which jean peters get <UNK> up by widmark it's truly shocking in its reality this is not a case of carefully choreographed photography br br less self conscious than many film <UNK> of the period this remains a great example of the genre
<START> this police <UNK> is no worse than many others of its era and better than quite a few obviously it is following in the steps of <UNK> and naked city but emerges as an enjoyable <UNK> the best thing about it is the <UNK> look it provides into a world now long gone the lower class new york of the late 40's early 50's here it is in all its seedy glory from the old school <UNK> <UNK> to the cheap <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> these old police films are like <UNK> to a <UNK> era and very bittersweet to anybody who <UNK> the <UNK> soulless <UNK> of today br br also intriguing is the emphasis on the nuts and <UNK> scientific aspect of solving the crime in this case the murder of a <UNK> woman found in an abandoned car our main heroes detectives <UNK> and <UNK> do the <UNK> but without the tedious and <UNK> efforts of the lab boys they'd get nowhere although the technology is not in the same league the cops here use the <UNK> <UNK> of a c s i investigator to track down their man br br the way some reviewers have written about this movie you think it would have been directed by ed wood and acted by extras from his movies what <UNK> i enjoyed john miles as the <UNK> ex marine turned cop <UNK> he had a happy go lucky easy going approach to the role that's a welcome change from the usual stone faced <UNK> of most movie cops of the period patricia barry is cute and delightful as his <UNK> girlfriend who helps solve the crime walter <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> as the older detective <UNK> i rather liked the chemistry of these two and it made for something a bit different than the sort of robotic <UNK> approach br br the mystery itself is not too deep and the final chase and shoot out certainly won't rank amongst the classics of crime cinema but during it's brief running time the <UNK> stranger more than held my interest
<START> an old saying goes if you think you have problems visit a hospital that has been updated in recent years to if you think you have problems watch a tv talk show especially jerry <UNK> this movie is one of those that is so bad it's good that's why i gave it a seven it's all right but not great it's a great way to waste 95 minutes just as the daily talk show is advertised as an hour of your life you'll never get back all the familiar themes are here <UNK> husbands boyfriends the <UNK> audience on television women flashing jerry etc the shocker was watching molly <UNK> who normally plays sweet characters seinfeld and <UNK> head playing a trailer trash mom and <UNK> <UNK> my name is earl as her equally trashy daughter performing sexual <UNK> for virtually every man with whom they came in contact the men including the staff producer were presented as quintessential <UNK> who deserved what they got i don't want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show here in phoenix it's shown back to back for two hours every morning and after that everything else seems to pale again i give this movie a seven it's good but not great jerry springer is best taken in small one hour doses
<START> i don't know why but i thought i've seen this movie before maybe it was the name maybe it was the way poster looked i don't know anyway it was quite promising in the beginning and even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments maybe its because i'm not a huge fan of the horrors and i don't watch them a lot but this one actually looked fresh sometimes but the rest of it is not so good laughable at times the movie is slow paced sometimes you will get so bored you'd forget what was the story about characters are not great either all of them the butcher is ok seems creepy and crazy enough although i didn't get what were those weird looking things on his chest that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out of the blue and why he was collecting those in <UNK> at home the main lead is plain his character is really hard to believe in and very undeveloped but i guess thats <UNK> fault like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend side cast is bad too but the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl my god when will women in horror movies have any brains its ridiculous the girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera tries going to police that fails and then she thinks of the best idea ever why don't we just go and take it i know where the maniac lives <UNK> thats <UNK> and then look for the camera in the bathroom why not and then walk in the room see a bag that was not there before and just have a look inside maybe camera is there not there but loads of interesting stuff shiny <UNK> to realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain then of course the never ending falling while running away trick that really made it look bad then to put the final nail into the character in the end of the movie she walks into the <UNK> full with dead bodies hanging feet up screams <UNK> like she just ripped her <UNK> bag and walks further into the <UNK> <UNK> come on no one else thinks its just well stupid just awful if her character wasn't so bad maybe the movie would get another star or two from me and i would even forgive <UNK> characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer that dude in the train who the conductor killed butcher <UNK> that can protect from bullets weird and cheap looking monsters in the end i didn't read clive <UNK> novel so i have no idea where those monsters came from the fact that no one cared that hundreds judging on the <UNK> in the <UNK> disappeared in the city and main character that didn't bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out he barely noticed it i guess oh and the predictable ending damn i knew the ending half way in its just disappointing the only reason i'm still giving some credit to the makers is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i've watched past few months visual style is nice some shots were really nice and good cgi that made the killings look really brutal although blood didn't look real at all i guess some people will enjoy it some like me will watch it if there is nothing else to watch some will absolutely hate it
<START> one of the more sensible comedies to hit the hindi film screens a remake of <UNK> 80s <UNK> hit <UNK> <UNK> which in turn was a remake of the 60s <UNK> hit of the same name <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the standard of comedies in hindi cinema br br akshay kumar has once again proved his is one of the best super stars of hindi cinema who can do comedy he has combined well with the new hunk john abraham however john still remains in <UNK> shadows and fails to rise to the occasion br br the new <UNK> are cute and do complete justice to their roles br br a must watch comedy leave your brains away and laugh for 2 <UNK> after all laughter is the best medicine ask <UNK> and akshay kumar
<START> i first saw this film as a teenager it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks with a cast that features <UNK> from family ties gene simmons of kiss and <UNK> <UNK> as a preacher how can you go wrong backwards evil messages played on <UNK> yes thats right they use records in this movie in one scene eddie <UNK> is listening to a message from the evil <UNK> on his record player when things begin to get scary monsters start to come out of his <UNK> and his <UNK> becomes possessed as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine almost 20 years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies
<START> hi for all the people who have seen this wonderful movie im sure <UNK> you would have liked it as much as i i love the songs once you have seen the show you can sing along as though you are part of the show singing and dancing dancing and singing the song one is an all time <UNK> musical song too and the <UNK> at the end with the mirror its so oh you have to watch this one
<START> the haunted world of edward d wood jr isn't a particularly good documentary <UNK> it's lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on <UNK> which make it very <UNK> and in cohesive but this adds to it's charm i say this because it's a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow <UNK> and as such there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of <UNK> there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the <UNK> of wood and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the <UNK> of the documentary overall it's worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general but don't expect brilliance here expect a documentary made after <UNK> own heart
<START> my left foot is an epic outstanding film explaining the life and times of christy brown who had cerebral <UNK> a severe <UNK> and had only the use of his left foot but he was <UNK> he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds br br i have seen this film a lot of times and each time i see it i find it equally brilliant each time i wonder how did this amazing film not win an <UNK> for best picture it is a <UNK> by the academy awards jim <UNK> is to me one of the greatest directors in the world the screenplay the music and anything else is excellent in this film as the film goes on you would nearly feel your in the brown household as everything occurs ray <UNK> and brenda <UNK> are amazing as <UNK> parents and <UNK> shaw is equally brilliant as d r <UNK> cole who helps christy on his battle of <UNK> br br the irish film industry had noting much to its name before my left foot my left foot was the start of a wonderful period in irish film films so powerful and brilliant such as the field the crying game in the name of the father and michael collins followed my left foot these irish films were regarded so highly around the world and were nominated for multiple <UNK> and won some a wonderful period for irish film my left foot is a powerful outstanding film br br daniel day lewis plays the crippled christy brown so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for hugh o <UNK> who plays young christy to me those two performances are two of the best ever film performances especially daniel day <UNK> performance which i would regard as high as <UNK> hopkins in the silence of the <UNK> daniel day lewis has proved in his career that he is an great actor br br this is an excellent masterpiece in film see it
<START> it was nice to see all the familiar characters again but the story bothered me we loved ariel in the first movie so why is the second one centered around her daughter the new characters were annoying and i didn't like the plot of this worst of all christopher daniel barnes didn't come back as the voice of eric disney please stop <UNK> classic movies with these shoddy <UNK>
<START> during the opening night of the <UNK> a woman is found dead on the <UNK> above the stage as the show continues the police attempt to piece together who killed who and why before the final curtain br br i had always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery so i was excited to find myself a copy unfortunately no one told me about the musical numbers which go on and on and on while the numbers certainly are the type that hollywood did in their glory days they become <UNK> because they pretty much stop the movie dead despite attempts to <UNK> action around them this wouldn't be so bad if the music was half way decent but its not there is only one good song worse its as if the studio knew they had one song <UNK> for two and we're forced to endure four versions of it a <UNK> a big production number as the <UNK> finale and in the background as incidental music i don't think spike jones and his city <UNK> ever played it that much the rest of the movie is pretty good with victor mclaglen <UNK> nicely with jack <UNK> charles <UNK> is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the wardrobe mistress br br by no mean essential i can recommend this if you think you can get through the musical numbers or are willing to <UNK> through them its a fun movie of the sort they don't make any more
<START> i don't want to go off on a rant here but this is the worst film i've ever seen worse than the <UNK> incompetent directing disjointed writing and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout shot on very cheap video it looks like a high school project but without the emotion the lighting frequently looks like a single sun gun the sound is slightly better than a single <UNK> on the camera but everything else about this thing is just awful the plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution the <UNK> elements are <UNK> absurd and the editing looks worse than a rough cut it's not even bad enough to be funny it's just bad btw the <UNK> is intentionally misleading br br <UNK> gate owes me 4 00
<START> i have read all of the love come <UNK> books knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book but generally they at least have the main point of the book i was highly disappointed in this movie the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that <UNK> father comes to visit although in the book both parents come that is all the story line was so twisted and far <UNK> and yes sad from the book that i just couldn't enjoy it even if i didn't read the book it was too sad i do know that <UNK> life was rough but the whole movie was a <UNK> the rating is for having the same family <UNK> of the film that makes them great
<START> are you kidding that was awful br br but that notwithstanding i got given this film and 3 others and they were all on dvd the film starts of pretty much an ok movie but goes downhill from about the middle <UNK> br br and the ending well let's just say it was one of the most anti climatic endings in recent film history lots of gore in the end sequence and if you like a dose of schlock horror then this is the film for you br br 3 10
<START> i don't know what it was about this film that made me react so <UNK> against it perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about perhaps it was the <UNK> storyline perhaps it was the fact that rob lowe wore a long <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s perhaps it was because everything was a <UNK> <UNK> perhaps it was because a character <UNK> his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out i don't know what it was that made me hate it so but if it means trying to watch it again i'm not willing to find out
<START> <UNK> is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier the hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the <UNK> of the climate and the lack of medical care are <UNK> with the <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> the drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the <UNK> of real people whose <UNK> still live there it was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people no one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department <UNK> ferrell is just wonderful she is an example of the strong <UNK> people who came to <UNK> in the early 20th century and let no <UNK> stand in their way of a new life in a new land
<START> there are two kinds of characters on the shield people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes and everyone's only hope more than any other show the shield is about <UNK> and self <UNK> unfortunately the <UNK> and self <UNK> are the shows heroes and as such have the typical genre fiction <UNK> improbable <UNK> to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again making fools out of all of their peers br br the show boasts excellent camera work the lead ins and the fade outs are always superb it really is a work of art to see unfortunately the story is a <UNK> overwrought wish <UNK> scenario of gratuitous violence rape and lies br br the hero who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme is <UNK> like a warner bros cartoon character always escaping and making fun of all the elmer <UNK> anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes automatically <UNK> any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice and always <UNK> your ears with his excruciating self <UNK> if another cop <UNK> something wrong with something he's doing and someone gets hurt because of his actions he always blames the suspicious cop regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause every time br br like 24 this show relies on <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to drag its story out for season after season boring unbelievable long term stories are <UNK> into the storyline every season to provide a <UNK> on which to hang the bloody perverted <UNK> of meat that are the characters' corrupt acts and the inevitable cover ups br br most disappointing though is the <UNK> <UNK> as they try to change the <UNK> <UNK> back and forth to and away form the characters on <UNK> sometimes they want us to see <UNK> as the enemy sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul sometimes they want us to see <UNK> as a dangerous sexual <UNK> sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold sometimes they want us to see <UNK> as a low down vile <UNK> then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with <UNK> that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic br br none of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of <UNK> they want once they've shown these characters ruin other people's lives for their own ends that's it it is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth but then it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling <UNK> drawing every super model in existence to their <UNK> and running a crime <UNK> right out of the police station right under everyone's <UNK>
<START> br br the movie starts out as an ordinary comic hero movie it´s about the boy who is picked on has no parents and is <UNK> in love with the schools 1 girl nothing surprises in the movie there is nothing that you <UNK> guess coming in the movie toby <UNK> shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest you <UNK> get away from thinking of movies like x men batman and <UNK> all of those titles are better i almost walked out the last 20 minutes one thing that could have been good though was the <UNK> but not even that is anything to put in the christmas tree so my <UNK> <UNK> see this film even if you get paid for it
<START> what happened to these unlikeable people alan arkin was as usual unfunny and just walks through the role the kids are all a mess <UNK> tomei probably wishes this role had never come her way and what are carl <UNK> and rita <UNK> doing in this really bad mean movie if you enjoy watching losers <UNK> in their <UNK> and not try in any way to do better this is your film all others take a walk read a book or see something else br br jane
<START> i have a lot of time for all the columbo films but this one in particular was extremely well written and the solution at the end very effective however my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film between columbo and the murderer i <UNK> if i've not remembered every detail of this exactly it's the most striking image of columbo i've seen the view is from inside the darkness of the <UNK> where the victim was murdered and into the room beyond which is lit up by daylight columbo is sitting in a high backed <UNK> facing the <UNK> and us <UNK> the <UNK> and almost in <UNK> due to the contrast in light there's no sound the camera slowly moves out of the room and up towards him he's deep in <UNK> <UNK> gently on a <UNK> <UNK> of smoke from the <UNK> <UNK> slowly <UNK> as he thinks then the dialogue starts superb
<START> i have just seen this film and fallen in love with it there is a little bit of something for everyone and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between <UNK> and <UNK> when they are on the beach i nearly cried there is the <UNK> realization that time is the most precious <UNK> and it is most evident when they are together this idea taken from several angles from marriage to <UNK> to finding love in the least conventional of places the film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last <UNK> was particularly wonderful in his role of <UNK> i've always had a soft spot for the accent but i nearly <UNK> with his portrayal of his character the way this film was shot is also beautiful with the music backdrop of the open fields and superb acting all together this is a wonderful film that <UNK> at all of human emotions
<START> many people here say that this show is for kids only <UNK> when i was a kid approximately 7 9 years old i watched this show first it was disgusting for me i talked with other kids about this and sure other shows and know what this was the measure of disguise whenever we wanted to emphasize <UNK> silliness either on tv or anything else we said uh just like power rangers and laughed br br and before visiting this site i could not imagine that there actually are fans of <UNK> it was so strange for me that i decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it i did not enjoy that viewing but it <UNK> upon me maybe i have not enough imagination it may be however this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star
<START> a documentary about two rocks bands <UNK> a number of years brian <UNK> massacre and the dandy warhols what makes it special is the examination of the complex <UNK> personalities and the <UNK> of success and failure br br anton <UNK> the main man of brian <UNK> massacre is widely <UNK> as a musical genius not only by his colleagues his friends and rivals the dandy warhols but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him sadly he and his band members are also incapable of <UNK> with the real world <UNK> picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan <UNK> knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different <UNK> writes and produces all <UNK> music can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day has a prophet like <UNK> with his own musical genius but is also a heavy drugs user flies into <UNK> at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life and can blow deals as fast as he makes them <UNK> go through a large number of record <UNK> in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise <UNK> talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally <UNK> br br the warhols acknowledge their debt to <UNK> creativity and don't even put themselves in the same <UNK> <UNK> of greatness  but the warhols have something that <UNK> don't  the ability to <UNK> their talents with common sense the real world and their market  as a mixing pot of talent even if much of it is <UNK> from guru <UNK> and <UNK> they are the very definition of <UNK> ' dig follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing <UNK> at one point <UNK> pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death <UNK> and hate messages to the warhols in a box containing live <UNK> and insults like a bar of soap <UNK> clean up their <UNK>  only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a <UNK> order against <UNK> by the time the dandy warhols take off in europe with hits like <UNK> day should be a <UNK> and <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> is becoming increasingly isolated <UNK> are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the warhols get <UNK> for drugs around the same time let off with a warning and even allowed to keep the grass br br the wider appeal of dig is that the lessons of genius versus <UNK> go way beyond two bands or even rock music the downside is that it is still a documentary however intimate and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands <UNK> may well be a largely <UNK> genius and there are <UNK> glimpses of this in the film but to the <UNK> ear there is little more than the <UNK> of the people interviewed to <UNK> to this in the words of one of the band members in every spiritual tradition you burn in hell for pretending to be god and not being able to back it up <UNK> isn't pretending  but <UNK> there are maybe still <UNK> people to appreciate him in his own lifetime and dig has an <UNK> struggle to <UNK> the balance in favour of a tortured but largely <UNK> genius
<START> i am anthony park glenn park is my father first off i want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the <UNK> alert system is a good one however the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible the major problem i had with the movie involved the second half with <UNK> <UNK> and father glenn park the events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct my father was suffering from psychological <UNK> at the time and picked up <UNK> without any intent to harm her at all he loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that he was <UNK> her from some sort of harm or neglect that he likely believed was coming from her mother who paid little attention to her over the 3 plus years that my father took care of her and <UNK> raised her so her mother could <UNK> about the movie depicted my father in a manner that he was going to harm her in some way shape or form the funny thing is that <UNK> had spent many nights sometimes <UNK> at my fathers place while sharon would be working or doing whatever she was doing the reason that my father was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be conceived to be weapons on his truck my father was a <UNK> the items they deemed to be weapons were <UNK> tools that he kept in his truck all the time for work my recommendation is take this movie with a grain of salt it is a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie at least the <UNK> <UNK> glenn park portion are largely inaccurate and depict the failure of the director to discover the truth in telling the story the funny thing is that if the director would have interviewed any of <UNK> friends who knew the situation they would have stated exactly what i have posted here
<START> i just saw this film on dvd last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning it seems that i robot has <UNK> the critical viewing community here on imdb and given rise to a lot of insults and name calling too br br i find this somewhat surprising as this film is not great or even good but neither is it terrible or even really bad what this film really is is depressing depressing that the us film goer population is so ready to lap up insipid clichéd re <UNK> and acclaim them as spectacular new works this film as <UNK> written all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of <UNK> and modern day uber action to smith's character a smart mouthed <UNK> with a <UNK> of <UNK> to the special effects that borrowed from matrix and a few others br br i robot is sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience superficial plot <UNK> snappy dialog and lots and lots of <UNK> smith is mediocre but we already knew that he seems to be hollywood's latest <UNK> attempt to create a black bruce willis the story has lots of holes in it of all <UNK> but i don't think most people drawn to this film are <UNK> minded enough to notice perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards but very b movie compared to true winners
<START> there's a legion of mick <UNK> <UNK> out there who feel he couldn't direct a horror film of quality if he had to and <UNK> screenplay written by stephen king is often used as an example of this i like <UNK> though i fully am aware that <UNK> just says f <UNK> it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie forget character or plot development who needs them anyway it's about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of <UNK> <UNK> human <UNK> creatures who suck the <UNK> from <UNK> female <UNK> moving from town to town living a <UNK> existence truly powerful set their sights on a teenager who doesn't surrender without a fight before all is said and done many will be slaughtered as a mother <UNK> tolerate the possible death of her beloved son br br <UNK> wastes little time setting up those to be executed as a teacher glenn <UNK> <UNK> handsome all american <UNK> charles brady brian <UNK> to be someone entirely different from who he claims gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into charles <UNK> pretty <UNK> into his arms drawing their energy in turn feeding his hungry mama mary alice <UNK> the fresh new target is <UNK> robertson <UNK> <UNK> and she seems to be easy <UNK> but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a struggle thanks to a <UNK> cat <UNK> <UNK> vengeance will be <UNK> on all those who get her way mary come hell or high water will retrieve <UNK> in the goal of refreshing her dying son br br like many teenagers i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies such as amy <UNK> i was smitten with <UNK> <UNK> she's simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles unaware of his <UNK> motives i just knew that <UNK> <UNK> would be destined to be a scream queen but this would never be the case too bad because i would've welcomed her in the genre with open arms br br <UNK> is <UNK> as the menacing damn sexy but vicious and mean bitch who <UNK> out an entire police force and poor <UNK> parents in one fail <UNK> in less than ten or so minutes she stabs one in the back with a corn <UNK> she bites the fingers off of poor ron <UNK> before cracking his arm a bone <UNK> knocking him unconscious with his own <UNK> she <UNK> <UNK> mom through a window after breaking a rose <UNK> over her father's face a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charles cop <UNK> falling on the <UNK> for extra impact poor <UNK> is dragged by her hair from her home by mary driven to the brady home and forced into an <UNK> dance with the crippled monster the sheriff is <UNK> onto a <UNK> fence and we see how cats combat the <UNK> unlike humans we see mary and <UNK> abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of <UNK> writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as <UNK> officers joe <UNK> and john <UNK> as photograph experts br br the film is shot in a tongue in cheek let it all hang out manner with music appropriately <UNK> this technique home it's about the ultra violence simple as that with some deranged behavior and jet black humor <UNK> <UNK> direction and king's screenplay the incestuous angle of the <UNK> is a bit jarring and in your face without a <UNK> of complexity this is closer in vein to king's own demented <UNK> <UNK> than his more serious works
<START> vivah is by no means a classic however in the days of hardcore action path breaking special effects complex plots none of which bollywood has <UNK> yet its quite refreshing to see a simple film like vivah the story as we all know is a journey from a <UNK> first meeting to their eventual wedding after some <UNK> moments and testing times nothing more nothing less the music isn't quite in the same league as <UNK> or <UNK> but doesn't jar your senses either two songs stood out for me <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> do <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were <UNK> shahid performs sincerely shows a lot of potential its good to see him play something else but the cool dude he normally does amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a <UNK> small town girl to perfection <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are terrific supports and the rest of the cast does a reasonable job <UNK> direction is simple but effective the movie's prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers but all in all a good clean decent family movie
<START> on september <UNK> 2001 millions were killed but 2 <UNK> lives ended in an especially gruesome manner they were the victim of a plane <UNK> by <UNK> whose sole mission was to destroy buildings but more importantly people this film takes an in depth look at four people whose lives were cut short by this disastrous event and one man whose life was <UNK> by the loss of their lives br br charlie <UNK> played by adam sandler a former dentist living in new york loses his wife and three children on september <UNK> as they were on their way to los angeles emotionally <UNK> by the events he eventually loses touch with everyone who reminds him of his former life including his in laws and his best friend played respectively by robert <UNK> melinda dillon and mike <UNK> he goes into completely denial and does his best to forget about his former life this continues until he runs into his old college friend alan johnson played by don cheadle who <UNK> doesn't seem to remember the two begin to catch up but <UNK> believes johnson was sent by people from his former life to <UNK> him into finding help slowly but surely <UNK> <UNK> his trust for johnson br br while all this is happening alan <UNK> life is going down the wrong path he is a self man dentist who helps start a dental practice one day a patient of his named donna <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> attempts to make a move on him telling him that she would like to perform <UNK> sex for him this is an <UNK> surprise to dr johnson since he is a married man with two children as he is coming home from work on a particular <UNK> he sees his old friend <UNK> and tries to flag him down he is <UNK> but he gets another opportunity and <UNK> <UNK> to get a come of coffee with him to catch up despite the fact that <UNK> doesn't know who he is br br one of the most interesting things about this movie is its use of music as a <UNK> one of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is music particularly <UNK> and other classic rock artists when <UNK> is asked to open up about his past or to talk about things he finds unpleasant he puts on his <UNK> and <UNK> out the world with things his music br br when the film was over i had me thinking how would i cope with the loss of my family how would i deal with such a tragic events it's something we don't really think about too often we always think they'll be there and we often take them for granted whether we intend to or not we usually realize how important they are when it's too late and a blow like that can destroy someone physically emotionally and <UNK> i really don't know how i would be able to deal with something like that would i face the problem head on cope and move on with my life or would i just put my <UNK> on and block the world
<START> what a great actor to have in such an awful story br br the film and its production however is quite good even though set in london but with <UNK> in <UNK> no matter  see one <UNK> you've seen 'em all sort of br br the story however is about a man born with the power to <UNK> death and destruction upon anybody and anything should he so wish with just a passing reference to true life instances of <UNK> the narrative builds a picture of a man <UNK> and <UNK> as a boy a teenager and finally as a man so much so in fact that he <UNK> vengeance at will literally over time he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot  just by thinking about it br br the trouble with the narrative however is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and <UNK> it all with quasi religious <UNK> to produce a <UNK> <UNK> theory about it all mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works  and i'm afraid richard burton had to <UNK> awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing his very best scene however is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal <UNK> as they left his home sharp witty and deadly dialog delivered as only burton could br br a good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better though beginning with <UNK> <UNK> whom i last saw in garde a <UNK> 1981 as inspector <UNK> harry andrews as assistant <UNK> the much under rated lee <UNK> as dr <UNK> derek <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> and a few other well known character actors br br i liked the way the story was presented as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of <UNK> richard burton the writer with the killer <UNK> up till that point it was a good piece of visual detective work by <UNK> and his english sidekick still it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would be murderer br br then they went and <UNK> it all in the last fifteen minutes if you want a clue about what that is think <UNK> and <UNK> 1949 from the <UNK> cecil b de <UNK> and how <UNK> got the bad guys in the end and the very last scene is just plain stupid why because there are at least a hundred ways that <UNK> <UNK> could have been stopped absolutely br br shame actually because this could have been a lot better story and movie i guess burton really needed the money br br if you're burton fan then spend the time to see that scene i mentioned above otherwise don't bother
<START> i never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes when i first purchased casper friends <UNK> about africa i so much wanted to see the very first casper cartoon entitled the friendly ghost 1945 but when i saw the next cartoon there's good <UNK> to night 1948 it made me break down i couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing <UNK> fox get killed i never saw anything like that in the other casper cartoons this is the saddest one of all it was so depressing i just couldn't watch it again it's just like seeing <UNK> die at the end of a movie i know it's a classic but it's too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me if i wanted to watch something old and classic i rather watch something happy and funny but when i think about this casper cartoon i think about my cats
<START> dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography <UNK> is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect this is almost a silent film with what dialogue there is in german and highly <UNK> german at that perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the <UNK> possible european audience as anyone with even a little high school level <UNK> can easily <UNK> with the subtitles the story is of little importance anyway with the film <UNK> on a cinematic level not a narrative one symbols of <UNK> and the power of nature <UNK> the human characters there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star hedy <UNK> and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> if the film has any message to convey i think it's a political one <UNK> man is <UNK> and <UNK> working class man is a happy <UNK> creature and woman is the creator destined to be <UNK> until she has <UNK> a child this blend of soviet <UNK> realism and national <UNK> dogma doesn't <UNK> the film by any means it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era and oh yeah hedy does get her <UNK> off
<START> i didn't know what to make of this film i guess that is what it was all about really i have never seen a film like it and i doubt that i really ever will again glover puts together something that is unique to him i think to appreciate it you have to read some of his poetry maybe see one of his slide shows i really like this guy he is just so bizarre i can't help it note i saw this film before it was through its final editing so maybe what i have seen and what others have seen are different i will know i guess if i choose to view the film again i think i will have to be properly drug influenced
<START> i really wanted to like this movie a lot more than i did that's because i love wacky foreign comedies particularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise however although this one frequently caught me by surprise these were almost never pleasant surprises it reminded me of south park in that nearly every social norm was <UNK> until the only ones left to <UNK> were too sick to be funny for example after exploring adultery drug abuse of nearly every sort ranging from pot heroin speed to <UNK> <UNK> prostitution s m suicide murder etc the movie got to the hilarious topic of <UNK> mom encouraged her one son who looked about 12 years old to sleep with <UNK> men in fact at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in <UNK> of <UNK> for dental work funny you've got to be kidding this movie just goes too far and <UNK> into the black hole of comedy what should they make fun of next cancer or <UNK> <UNK>
<START> first of all this plot is way overdone girl wants to make it everyone loves her <UNK> girl <UNK> all looks lost girl pulls through everyone loves her again etc throw in the fitting in thing an attractive male <UNK> on the heroine plus single parent troubles and it's so predictable that you can practically <UNK> along with it br br second of all i really hate how they keep on <UNK> classical music they send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and <UNK> and close minded in fact i don't recall the quote exactly but i remember at one point in the movie holly says why do they have to be so uptight so classical it's really insulting how label classical music in this way br br third i've went over it dozens of times but the only reason that i can think of for making this movie is to promote britney spears there just isn't any point at all br br and oh yeah while the actress who portrayed holly i'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not had a reasonably good voice it wasn't as amazing as they were making it out to be especially when she was <UNK> she was <UNK> the whole time br br 1 10 stars
<START> when i first saw this movie i thought it was the typical love <UNK> <UNK> stuff the more the movie was going on the more i got involved acting is magnificent from both actors direction was great the story unusual cried my eyes off first time in my life for a movie a real must have in any serious <UNK> 11 out of 10
<START> but i enjoyed this show anyway i've been reading some of the comments prior reviewers have had to say about this show and i'm having a hard time completely <UNK> all the criticism in my own head except one that the show was stale this program was anything but stale a lot of the stuff people take issue with about this show is on the money pretentious forced overwrought desperate for attention self satisfied annoying ever present narration but you know what i really liked it it was different it was original it really really tried and that made up for all the <UNK> the show was bright verbal quick witty interesting fun to look at you know it was only on once a week i could take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it i will <UNK> its passing but i guess nobody will be bringing this back to life
<START> the color purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life every character had an element of the color purple in them the movie touches on love lost hope hate and triumph whether it be <UNK> having lived through hell and losing her sister and <UNK> coming into her life to show her love again albert not being man <UNK> his wrong toward <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by her father and <UNK> to him in the end <UNK> and her <UNK> good and bad and even <UNK> they had their <UNK> and <UNK> through the film but was overcome in the end and that's the sign of a good movie good job to all the cast and crew
<START> i'm not entirely sure rob <UNK> qualifies as a master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called wrong turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and <UNK> episodes of the entire second season of the masters of horror franchise there was a similar underdog story in season one when william malone made on of the best episodes with the fair haired child even though his other long feature films fear <UNK> com and house on haunted hill sucked pretty badly br br the story of right to die cleverly picks in on the nowadays <UNK> hot social debate of <UNK> but thankfully also features multiple old fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous <UNK> pitch black humor and comic book <UNK> violence whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery the <UNK> couple are involved in a terrible car accident cliff walks away from the wreck <UNK> but his wife <UNK> is fully burned and needs to be kept alive <UNK> whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car <UNK> <UNK> mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a <UNK> and blame everything on cliff meanwhile <UNK> hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in <UNK> surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices after a few victims cliff realizes it might be <UNK> for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well right to die is a <UNK> episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv series concept like masters of horror it's violent and gory with a sick twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences the <UNK> theme and the whole obligatory media circus that <UNK> it is <UNK> into the script very well yet without unnecessarily <UNK> to political <UNK> or morality lessons the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which is always a welcome plus and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean spirited and <UNK> bastard great <UNK> episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons
<START> director douglas sirk once said there's a very short distance between high art and trash and trash that contains <UNK> is by this very quality <UNK> to <UNK> this statement <UNK> his cinema perfectly a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations adventure and war films westerns and of course his famous <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> were as the very word <UNK> dramas with music the music sets the tone for his masterful style and every stroke of his brush sirk was also a painter leaves a powerful image on the screen turned <UNK> but this ain't life but its representation an imitation of life sirk never tried to show reality on the contrary none of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by hollywood most notably technicolor to <UNK> the artificial from the real thing let's remember that his golden period <UNK> with the time when hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama <UNK> jungle rebel without a cause sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else br br another of <UNK> statements <UNK> this you can't reach or touch the real you just see <UNK> if you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet <UNK> i defy anybody that has seen written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen one ends up giving up br br therefore we are in a hall full of mirrors where there's no difference between real and its false copy nobody can say that the hadley are real people that town ain't real either with those hideous oil <UNK> all over the place so in this realm the acting is affected the <UNK> is fake the trick is visible everything is pushed a little bit off the limit the sexual <UNK> of dorothy malone with the oil tower for example sirk was <UNK> and <UNK> at the same time br br the angles are the director's thoughts the lighting is his <UNK> in written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a <UNK> way and in terms of light and shadows the <UNK> house with its different levels connected by the spiral <UNK> <UNK> in a strictly <UNK> way a house that resembles a <UNK> that no party can cheer up as tragedy progresses from <UNK> daylight to shadowy night <UNK> photography becomes an <UNK> of the inner state of his characters and so are the colours of the clothes they wear drama is thus <UNK> to every element at the service of the director's craft br br sirk considered himself a story <UNK> because he <UNK> the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose written on the wind is a good example it wouldn't work in any other hands br br the other director that was using similar <UNK> was frank <UNK> who was for 50's comedy the same that sirk was for melodrama their films are full of the <UNK> of american life advertising tv sets <UNK> <UNK> machines sport cars <UNK> <UNK> to depict its <UNK> and <UNK> i'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences the game was played by both sides so it was camp now we regard them as <UNK> or <UNK> because we are not those <UNK> anymore that is why todd <UNK> homage far from <UNK> turns into a <UNK> because it <UNK> <UNK> work nowadays as if nothing happened in between then sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that <UNK> moore and the <UNK> discuss in the aforementioned film br br sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly there were always <UNK> characters rock hudson and lauren bacall here against which he could <UNK> a series of split ones his balance through <UNK> is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters because these are the ones sirk is interested in too when robert stack flies the plane and <UNK> lauren bacall with all sorts of mundane <UNK> of the world below them obvious <UNK> echoes we are strangely fascinated with him too as we are when the <UNK> <UNK> little sister painfully evokes her past with mitch alone by the river br br in the <UNK> universe the studio often <UNK> happy <UNK> have no negative impact in fact they worked just great sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the <UNK> ex <UNK> of his day thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the hadley <UNK> br br it was pointed out the many similarities between written on the wind with the godfather saga i absolutely agree and i'm sure the parallel is not incidental both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family the <UNK> son portrayed by robert stack has an amazing physical resemblance with jimmy <UNK> sonny <UNK> the action of fighting her sister's male friend is <UNK> the non son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films as the fact that both families carry the names of their town even details as the gate that gives access to the property and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves suggest that coppola had written on the wind in mind while setting his <UNK> because both films deal with the subject of power the <UNK> of power its manipulation and legacy even kyle <UNK> <UNK> the event that <UNK> the turmoil is an issue easily tied to the central theme of power in this case a weakness in sexual power the other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is citizen kane one wouldn't think at first of similarities between welles and <UNK> films but there are a good many starting with the <UNK> business as the origin of the family's fortune and ending in the fact that mitch wayne rock hudson as charles foster kane was adopted by a <UNK> having his own father alive amazingly the same actor harry shannon perform both wayne and <UNK> fathers this detail is cannot be a coincidence br br written on the wind is a masterpiece in every aspect in execution and vision in style and technique a highlight in the career of this wonderful director some say that this is his best film in my opinion magnificent <UNK> all that heaven <UNK> there's always <UNK> and imitation of <UNK> are just as good and for those who put sirk in the level of dallas or <UNK> i wish them no happy end
<START> this movie should be nominated for a new genre complete mess except for a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore this movie is a complete waste of time calling it campy doesn't even cut it campy implies fun which this movie was not you spend the first half of the movie thinking its got to get better right in fairness it does at the very end when its finally explained who the brother sister team are and what they want but by then you hardly care anymore because you've spend the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did mr <UNK> ms <UNK> do to <UNK> someone off this badly to be stuck in such a horrible movie br br
<START> when i rented this movie i thought i was going to see a horror movie however there is little horror in this typical seventies mystery drama directed by strange james t <UNK> nice looking matt boston carries the picture with his fine performance and the typical strange atmosphere of <UNK> movies is all present
<START> as others have mentioned all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous the plot very <UNK> shows the <UNK> of the female <UNK> when men are around they want to be pursued but when no men are around they become the <UNK> of a 14 year old boy and the boy becomes a man really fast we should all be so lucky at this age he then gets up the courage to pursue his true love
<START> can any movie become more naive than this you cant believe a piece of this script and its <UNK> predictable that you can tell the plot and the ending from the first 10 minutes the leading actress seems like she wants to be <UNK> but she doesn't make it the doll has more acting skills br br the <UNK> that the character passes and remains in a a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography i wont even comment on the <UNK> of the characters but the one good thing of the film is <UNK> performance which manages to bring life to a <UNK> like one dimensional character br br the movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth i can think some 13 year old britney obsessed girls shouting o do give us a break if we want fairy tales there is always the brothers <UNK> book hidden somewhere in the attic i gave it 2 instead of one only for virginia madsen
<START> after seeing the movie last night i was left with a sense of the <UNK> faced by <UNK> trying to tackle the problem the film portrays the scale of the prostitution seems so large that it's hard to see how it can be defeated without major <UNK> changes in cambodia br br anyway on with the review br br although it is a <UNK> movie with an uncomfortable central relationship this is a very compelling film and i'd even go so far as to say it was enjoyable the film was well edited for the running time and the performance by <UNK> <UNK> was excellent i also felt ron <UNK> played a very difficult role well br br it would have been nice to have a little more insight into why patrick feels he has to help holly but maybe the reason is a simple as he explains to chris <UNK> character i won't explain it here go see the movie br br this is a good thought provoking film with obviously good intentions i hope it gets a wide enough release to reach a decent sized audience and gain more support for the k 11 project
<START> i hate those stories that begin with a funeral but i'm afraid this one begins the day we buried george not that we buried him in the interests of the environment we had him <UNK> so speaks elizabeth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> widow she's led a comfortable predictable life with george she has two grown children and a 12 year old <UNK> but when she was 15 and in school in the midst of world war ii she played the <UNK> at night in an all girl almost all girl band called the blonde <UNK> the <UNK> was because the drummer was patrick a charming rogue who had no desire to fight and possibly be killed with a yellow wig a long red dress and makeup patrick looked almost as good as the others br br one afternoon after the funeral elizabeth finds herself in the attic of her home playing the <UNK> she had put away she used to practice but only when george was out of the house on the golf course then two things happen her <UNK> amazed at how good elizabeth is starts talking about how the blonde <UNK> could be reunited and play at her school dance then elizabeth encounters patrick ian <UNK> now just as much an aging <UNK> as elizabeth and just as much attracted to her as he was more than 50 years ago he also was attracted to all the other members of the <UNK> the <UNK> that would appear on his bass drum had a special meaning that <UNK> to his affection well why not see if the other band members can be located and why not give it a shot for a reunion performance at her <UNK> school br br why not one member of the band is <UNK> one is dead one is in jail one has found salvation with the salvation army one they can find no trace of one is last known to be in the states one is a professional singer and has no intention of doing a school gig even for a reunion but one by one elizabeth and patrick bring together the surviving members of the <UNK> we don't know if enough of them can be found the <UNK> more often than not turn into off key <UNK> while they do this we share <UNK> flashbacks of what life was like when she and patrick were young in war time london playing in the band while the bombs were falling as terrible as it was it was the most exciting time of their lives when the night of <UNK> <UNK> dance arrives of course the blonde <UNK> filled with <UNK> and <UNK> friendship blow the youngsters away afterwards elizabeth informs us that the <UNK> are continuing to play at <UNK> and that she and patrick have no plans to get married but see nothing wrong with a little <UNK> around br br this is sentimental <UNK> expertly done and not bad at all what makes it work are the skill and charm of <UNK> <UNK> and ian <UNK> when i hear the term warm hearted comedy i usually cringe unless the actors are first rate <UNK> and <UNK> are wonders to watch as they take something as light weight and predictable as this script and turn it into something that charms us then there's the old broad <UNK> that's fun if you remember the old <UNK> among the blonde <UNK> are leslie caron joan <UNK> olympia dukakis <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sings three numbers and almost over <UNK> the production she is so strong and unique a jazz talent that while she's singing the program nearly becomes the <UNK> <UNK> show another attractive feature is the number of great wwii songs played in strong swing
<START> with a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high <UNK> 'the art of <UNK> fails to deliver the romantic sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as the two main characters have the potential to be interesting both male and female lead are swinging <UNK> or in the female <UNK> case engaged but 'the art of <UNK> doesn't even try <UNK> from a frank examination of these two characters' personalities 'the art of <UNK> <UNK> anything of substance for a basis of thin lean stereotype br br 'the art of <UNK> is insulting insulting to its characters insulting to men and women and insulting to its <UNK> expectations it takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to <UNK> them <UNK> wan is an immature spoiled manipulative bitch the viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she's pretty min <UNK> well he's exactly the same neither are nice people the humour in this film primarily <UNK> around <UNK> wan and min <UNK> outlandish attempts at <UNK> each other in the <UNK> art of lying and manipulation no character development occurs and we never learn why <UNK> wan and min <UNK> are like this we are simply expected to take them as they are and not ask questions they're cute and that's all that matters the <UNK> references to the celebrity of the main actors in <UNK> cinema <UNK> reviews may tip you off to <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> br br if you're still in high school you liked grease or you are a yellow fever victim you may like this movie br br despite its romance tag this is not a very good date movie
<START> i first didn't want to watch this film for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected film but as i recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising <UNK> et <UNK> et plus <UNK> <UNK> which was beautifully directed and written by <UNK> <UNK> screenwriter of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> main i changed my mind and decided to try it thinking that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> main would be as good as <UNK> and it is absolutely not the script is not bad but it is not as well directed as <UNK> the actors not as generous especially charlotte as boring as she usually is as <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> and too be honest i still don't understand how such crap can have such a success even with such a casting anyway the story could have been a <UNK> to create so many interesting plots but it is not as good as <UNK> <UNK> though it's also written by him easy <UNK> and lazy work totally <UNK>
<START> director alfred <UNK> melodrama baby face with barbara stanwyck ranks as one of the more notorious of the pre code movies these films were produced before the production code administration had the power to <UNK> its rules in 1934 inspiration <UNK> gene <UNK> and midnight mary <UNK> kathryn <UNK> penned the screenplay based on mark <UNK> story about the rise and fall of a girl who used her sexual charms to <UNK> wealth and position in society incidentally mark <UNK> was a <UNK> for producer <UNK> f <UNK> these pre code films today seem tame but they <UNK> controversy <UNK> and contained more <UNK> material than most movies until the late 1950s when the code began to <UNK> the themes that the filmmakers explore are women versus men women versus women and women versus society our <UNK> protagonist does enough <UNK> that all themes are about equal br br <UNK> worthless father nick powers robert <UNK> of distant drums <UNK> an illegal <UNK> bar during <UNK> when the thirteen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> his own booze in a still out back nick is such as an obnoxious fellow that he <UNK> out her beautiful but hard working daughter lily barbara stanwyck of night nurse but lily refuses to help her father out with a sleazy local politician the politician ed <UNK> arthur <UNK> of private detective <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> him later nick <UNK> his rebellious daughter out lily <UNK> him yeah i'm a tramp and who's to blame my father a <UNK> start you gave me nothing but men dirty rotten men and you're lower than any of them no sooner has she <UNK> off than nick dies when his still blows up and kills him lily and her african american maid <UNK> <UNK> harris of <UNK> pack their <UNK> and catch a ride of the first <UNK> leaving town br br no sooner have our <UNK> arrived in new york than lily uses her charm to get a job in a bank visually director green shows <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up the ladder with camera angles that move <UNK> until <UNK> sexuality threatens to destroy the bank at one point lily breaks up a marriage between one bank officer ned stevens donald cook of the public enemy and his fiancée anne carter margaret lindsay of <UNK> after stevens had almost fired her for <UNK> with her boss <UNK> douglas <UNK> of his women in the employee <UNK> lily is extremely <UNK> and manages to emerge from each <UNK> better off than before the board of <UNK> hires <UNK> <UNK> george bent of <UNK> to take over as president of the bank the first thing that <UNK> does is pay off lily instead of letting her <UNK> her diary entries about the higher ups at the bank moreover <UNK> ships lily off to their branch bank in paris where lily doesn't create any <UNK> until <UNK> arrives and they become <UNK> attached lily fights tooth and nail for everything that she has gotten and hates to throw it all away but she sacrifices everything at the end for her husband br br ironically lily winds up back in the same town that she started out in but <UNK> and she are happy now baby face qualifies as one of the five best pre code movies look for john wayne dressed up in a suit and tie in one scene
<START> i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had only <UNK> 000 and 7 weeks to write film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself although this film is not for the masses as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is <UNK> <UNK> involved in the story i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story the more sadness you feel more so towards <UNK> because of the love he feels but is not returned br br this is one of my favourite british films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again i think that it's a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all
<START> this is probably one of the most original love stories i have seen for ages especially for a war based briefly film basically it is a story based in two worlds one obviously real the other <UNK> but the filmmakers say at the beginning that it is only coincidence if it is a real place anyway peter carter the great david niven was going to crash in a plane he talked to june planet of the <UNK> kim hunter before he <UNK> out and said he loved her he was meant to die from jumping without a <UNK> but somehow he survived and now he is seeing and loving june in the flesh this other place like a heaven is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world so they send french conductor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> him to go but he is obviously in love peter suggests to him that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world's court he is granted this obviously love <UNK> when the two lovers <UNK> that they would die for each other june even offers to take his place also starring robert <UNK> as bob <UNK> kathleen byron as an angel a brief then unknown lord sir richard attenborough as an english pilot and abraham <UNK> as the judge the surgeon david niven was number <UNK> on the 50 greatest british actors the film was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest <UNK> for the happy ending it was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest war films it was number <UNK> on the 50 greatest british films and it was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest films outstanding
<START> guys you got to watch this awesome movie at the end of this movie you will have a strong passion and <UNK> <UNK> into yourselves the acting of the two characters billy sunday and carl brashear deeply touches the heart from inside this movie is about principles dignity <UNK> and honor you will hear chief carl brashear say the navy has greatest tradition of all honor <UNK> thoroughly by these two characters mere <UNK> of these characters during the movie fills you with enthusiasm dialogue delivery of this movie is perfect you can't find any flaws in the dialogues what the master chief billy says <UNK> in and out of your mind for a long time after watching the movie please watch this movie
<START> this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre told completely without dialogue it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school leaving the gold fish <UNK> and a window <UNK> open after a while a <UNK> orange <UNK> comes <UNK> around comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited as the cat comes very near to the bowl the fish jumps out the cat catches the fish drops him back in the bowl and <UNK> through the window he came in just as the boy not knowing what has happened gets back this was amazingly filmed with real animals how <UNK> got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable i only wish this film were available now for people to see i only saw it once in 1959 when it was originally released but it has remained unforgettable
<START> this movie is like the material s e <UNK> was writing in the 1970s and <UNK> was adapting to the screen in the early 80s and had <UNK> actually been a product of either the results <UNK> been much better especially in the acting department instead we get a rather so bad its funny piece of mediocrity br br jeff <UNK> plays ray <UNK> a former street <UNK> i suppose is the accurate description this was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and <UNK> and dressed them up in <UNK> threads or some kind of more <UNK> selection of gang <UNK> and they fought to lousy 80s music nonetheless ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother <UNK> <UNK> lowe in a part where he screams a lot who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when on the run from the cops he is <UNK> and forced to serve time in the marines flash forward to present day and ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs although in a gang that was <UNK> <UNK> and now old scores must be violently settled and again cops must be <UNK> and this time a <UNK> honor <UNK> in the action film sense before ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother <UNK> br br for the most part the film is quite ridiculous for me most of this has to do with far too much overacting although not by <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> who plays the waitress he befriends the guys in the gang and lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as new york street <UNK> although the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989
<START> chris an adopted son of a moral family a loser whom works at the school newspaper with kate christine <UNK> from of the awful <UNK> step by step show of the now thankfully <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> line up finds out that he's just inherited a porn empire from his <UNK> parents he loses sight of what true friendship and love is and blah blah some other nonsense he also has to <UNK> with an uncle who wants control of the family business and a <UNK> lawyer <UNK> they are a slightly below average teen comedy that steals from better teen comedies the opening alone is highly american pie esquire <UNK> you on the head with the moral every chance it gets and wastes the only star talent it has wayne <UNK> lin <UNK> and if i'm really <UNK> the star word martin <UNK> of freaks and <UNK> and justin <UNK> of malcolm in the middle it's not bad exactly but it's far from good br br eye candy a few extras get topless br br my grade c br br where i saw it <UNK> on demand available until september <UNK>
<START> is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor the answer is yes one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture the premise is not too bad a naive front man for an illegal business but this is a <UNK> with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work br br was this considered a good <UNK> in 1942 hard to imagine the only positive aspect of the picture is the cast which contains several well known faces from the <UNK> and <UNK> such as warren <UNK> vince <UNK> and robert armstrong i always dismiss richard <UNK> as the <UNK> who got gary cooper killed in lives of a <UNK> <UNK> so i wasn't counting him br br can't recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 if you have a choice get a root <UNK>
<START> the subject matter seems pretty dated today adapted for tv from <UNK> <UNK> book we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game <UNK> and dragons based on <UNK> and dragons one player a young tom hanks enters the fantasy world too deep his co players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm br br david wallace wendy <UNK> and chris <UNK> round out the <UNK> <UNK> support cast is made up of veteran actors like murray hamilton vera miles anne francis and susan <UNK> br br at this date it seems <UNK> and tame but the highlight of watching is seeing tom hanks between his <UNK> buddies <UNK> days and his big <UNK> in <UNK> on the silver screen the youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment
<START> spoilers ahead proceed at your own caution br br my main problem with this movie is that once harry learns the identities of the three <UNK> with relative ease he continues to cave into their demands and then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped he decides to wire his classic car up to explode with the money in it which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic br br okay so he wanted to keep his affair with <UNK> out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the da campaign this i can see but why not hire someone to slap these <UNK> around a bit or even kill them once he'd determined there was no actual blackmail evidence e g <UNK> body this was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2 3 of it after that it sort of falls apart
<START> this is definitely one of the greatest disney movies ever made it's a real <UNK> to anyone it'll make you laugh it'll make you cry and it'll put you into suspense br br basically what <UNK> bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation they don't know what is going on and desperately wanting to go home they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness br br this is one of the last movies that don <UNK> starred in he provided the voice of shadow the old wise and friendly golden <UNK> also starring in this movie was sally field providing the voice of sassy the <UNK> cat but seriously what this movie is all about is chance voiced by michael j fox my all time favorite actor chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog lovable playful energetic and goofy and every time i crack up when watching this movie it's because of chance it's like the comedy never ends br br this movie is also very sad at times it sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets br br one scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound i especially feel shocked at the part where chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it the movie had other suspenseful moments but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one br br overall it's a wonderful family movie if you enjoyed this movie you'll probably enjoy the sequel too i give this movie a solid 9 out of 10
<START> this movie even though it is over 70 years old is still a very moving strong film bette davis as the <UNK> vicious cockney waitress mildred is absolutely believable watching her performance is still <UNK> she makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time leslie <UNK> performance as the weak obsessed phillip carey is not as strong but i don't see how any actor could hold their own against ms <UNK> performance she <UNK> up the scenery in every scene she is in totally stealing the show this is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the academy award but lost it was shocking for it's day what with themes of <UNK> <UNK> multiple sex partners and <UNK> vicious language so it is somewhat dated but still an excellent movie just to see the scene where mildred tells phillip what she really thinks of him you <UNK> you dirty <UNK> is still some of the greatest acting i have ever seen on film
<START> i'll keep it short and brief the people who wrote the story lines for this show are genius the actors are just perfect for the roles they play <UNK> character is legendary and they have so much chemistry on screen which makes it what it is a very successful comedy br br when i saw first saw the new episodes which is probably going back just over 6 7 months i wondered what had happened to paul i was <UNK> to find out that he had died when i <UNK> <UNK> he was so funny and played his character to perfection an over protective dad who likes to keep his daughters out of the <UNK> and away from boys br br the comedy i think has gone from strength to strength even without paul in it br br plus i think most people would enjoy this watching it
<START> knowing <UNK> <UNK> comics for quite some time i had to see this movie i have thought this would be a good way for the artist as <UNK> to spread his art and ideas to wider audience i have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend and i thought i will enjoy watching it i was wrong the movie was a true torture to watch the idea has potential but movie leaves way too much to be desired and basically everyone who sees this movie is left with impression that he could do it better i will not make suggestion whether you should see this movie or not chances are if you're reading these pages that you have already seen it or that you're gonna see it but be prepared for very bad <UNK> minutes
<START> i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft core porn in this case the <UNK> plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial <UNK> with <UNK> perhaps for sex as well but not on indian tv anyway br br not being a fan of the genre i couldn't place jeff <UNK> and had no leads to search from only once <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in her futuristic nurse <UNK> so <UNK> for the high top fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on her br br this movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90's <UNK> or nod and <UNK> schlock <UNK> la paul verhoeven can we add a genre tag for so bad it's good
<START> three years ago rachel <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> at the lake with her friends when her brother falls out of a boat and <UNK> <UNK> friends think it is time for her to stop beating herself up and taking blame for something she had no control over so grab the <UNK> and something to chew and head back to the same lake that has been in <UNK> constant nightmares as expected a bloodbath has already started when two of the friends are <UNK> before even heading to the party this flick has the feel of a high school play where everyone forgot their lines and <UNK> <UNK> very badly writer <UNK> gabriel gave himself the <UNK> role as <UNK> boyfriend leo outside of <UNK> and gabriel there are some pretty lame acting and a few characters you would like to choke the crap out of before they get <UNK> giving attention to a few more players that had the nerve to appear <UNK> <UNK> andrew williams <UNK> <UNK> and derek <UNK> this is one <UNK> day you wouldn't mind missing
<START> first of all there is <UNK> theatre then there is bollywood both have their strengths and fan following director <UNK> shah should look elsewhere instead of <UNK> theatre when making a bollywood production first he made <UNK> adapted from a <UNK> play which had a unique plot but could not hold as a hindi film now he's adapted another <UNK> play and named it <UNK> a race against time in sum the emotions are alien the plot development is not for hindi films for example the role play between father and son is best left to <UNK> theatre don't bring it in a hindi film even the comedy track is best left for the <UNK> stage all performances are average nothing to shout about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shah who is fantastic
<START> what a good film made men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns james belushi is very good as an ex hood who has stolen 12 million from the boss who has to <UNK> of the gangsters <UNK> his wife and the local sheriff timothy dalton you wont be disappointed jump on board and enjoy the ride 8 out of 10
<START> thank god i didn't waste my money renting it but i <UNK> it this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life f g visual effects unnecessary gore and nudity far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie ok if you get time after reading this comment please check out the director's <UNK> <UNK> profile after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this i mean every movie directed by <UNK> <UNK> gets a rating between 1 and 2 and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie
<START> br br one of the best films i've ever seen robert <UNK> performance was excellent and outstanding he did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life his character was so convincing it made me almost think i were in the theater watching it live i give it 5 stars
<START> michael <UNK> directed this 1930 very stylish <UNK> from a script by robert <UNK> sr robert n lee and peter mine the original novel they adapted was the <UNK> murder case perhaps from a writer's standpoint the best of the philo vance mysteries by the strange s s van <UNK> vance was a long <UNK> and superior detective genius and his character being assigned to william powell probably meant the executives at warner brothers were aware of the possibility that in less engaging hands this detective might alienate viewers fortunately they assigned suave william powell first to the character later he was played by basil <UNK> warren william and paul lukas before being <UNK> to b picture status the other question as always with warner brothers executives is why they chose vance as a character their <UNK> was to choose men who <UNK> outside the law with no apparent <UNK> between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all <UNK> this film has a despicable villain who gets murdered and a <UNK> challenging locale inside an apartment complex the characters are <UNK> unusually well realized the direction rather good and unusually swift paced and except for a <UNK> b w look the film avoids the comedic <UNK> superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries jack <UNK> did the good art direction the music by <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> kelly did the costumes william reese provided the mostly <UNK> cinematography in the interesting cast powell is the philo vance of his time mostly sober minded with just a hint of <UNK> humor here and there eugene palette is better than usual playing very straight as an <UNK> police partner to vance with his very professional timing the other actor who comes off best is handsome paul <UNK> very effective as always in what was written as a red <UNK> part mary <UNK> is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved also in the cast were helen <UNK> as the <UNK> woman jack la <UNK> ralph morgan best known as frank <UNK> brother robert <UNK> as the villain everyone has cause to kill archer <UNK> and frank <UNK> as his likable brother with robert <UNK> as the d a quirky and funny <UNK> <UNK> has a delightfully witty part as the funny little <UNK> doctor who comes onto the crime scene james lee as the abused chinese servant is excellent and intelligent the story breaks into four parts first there is <UNK> <UNK> at a dog show where vance <UNK> and <UNK> are all showing west <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dog is killed by <UNK> to prevent him winning the title over his own entry the second portion of the scene involves a leave taking someone is confused enough by who has gone where after <UNK> parts from his girl friend <UNK> to murder his nice brother by mistake enter vance to find out who did in archer <UNK> in a locked room and how with the help of palette the romantic difficulties are <UNK> out the chinese servant is <UNK> we find out who broke the expensive <UNK> who will marry whom how archer <UNK> was done in and why the butler did not do it but someone else with a good excuse did this is a more than good little mystery which skilled hungarian born director <UNK> took quite seriously he used <UNK> swift cuts changes of camera angle and <UNK> between straightforward and daring camera work to achieve variety interest and a <UNK> pace many writers critics and experts myself included consider this to be the best of the vance projects although others are <UNK> as well
<START> this movie i saw some 10 years ago maybe more i took it in a rental and never found it to buy even in french sites the end is very surprising and intelligent i would like very much to watch it again because i think it's as <UNK> as the sixth sense <UNK> a completely different kind of movie

<START> the film is about a <UNK> on the lose at a amusement park where teens are on a <UNK> hunt since there are no rules they break into a building and start getting killed off the deaths are cheesy and are dumb but at least it had better effects then <UNK> i gave it a three because <UNK> was in it and i loved the movie <UNK> i thought it was okay but some deaths were off screen there was a dumb scene where the two teens kiss and the <UNK> head pops out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind leaving her to have her totally fake looking red guts out then the <UNK> gets up in the <UNK> and bites the kids head off the end death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics even that death was stupid because the <UNK> tooth went through his mouth and hangs there like that will support it and there is a scene when a <UNK> girl loses her contacts doesn't find them and seems like she doesn't need the the film is idiotic and a waste of time
