<START> i saw this movie on <UNK> with my younger brother a long time ago despite the fact i was a young boy who's hearing <UNK> i didn't have the closed <UNK> <UNK> at the time it was 1986 the year of the transformers the movie but i could follow the plot and understand what's going on it wasn't my fault i saw the animated movie intended for girls my father rented the video to show to my other younger sister br br a decade later and i rented the video for 50 cents to watch again with the closed <UNK> turned on my memories of this movie was utterly destroyed by none other than a wretched script i have seen plenty of poorly written movies like cool as ice and jason goes to hell the final friday but i have never seen or heard the dialogues this bad only with enough <UNK> to make your head spin from laughing in <UNK> and screaming from the pain of enduring the torture of sitting through this movie despite good plot and intriguing story concepts the script has to be one of the worst ever written for the screen bar none the incompetent howard r cohen should never be working as a screenwriter professional or otherwise i can not believe they would even allow the terrible script to produce a movie like this in the first place did the japanese producers read the script in broken english or translated before they know what they were into even crap like g i joe the movie and my little <UNK> the movie have redeeming values compared to this abomination br br if you're a big fan of 80s animation or just taking a nostalgia trip beware of <UNK> and the star <UNK> it does not matter whether you were <UNK> or traumatized by the <UNK> animated movie with an <UNK> written script or you have not seen the movie stay away from this movie the movie should be viewed with the to learn how not to write a bad script
<START> i have seen many of <UNK> movies and this is a very good role for him he has such <UNK> but he mainly stays in positive roles as <UNK> he is very dark and disturbing yet i found myself <UNK> with him much of the movie if for nothing else watch this movie for <UNK> he plays a very complex and real character very convincingly the story is very typical and has been done before but the character development is very strong and entertaining the opening is a little confusing but by the end it doesn't matter the songs i found very likable and give insight to what characters are thinking very clever i think this movie was very good and recommend it to all <UNK> khan fans it is a must see
<START> i learned little of significance from this film that i did not already know from <UNK> and the new york times and i did not follow the <UNK> case <UNK> as did some others the film did a very poor job of explaining what business <UNK> was in that might actually have been on the up and up before it started hiding its <UNK> in the <UNK> created by andy it also significantly <UNK> the role played by arthur <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> practices that were afterwards found to be illegal nor did it go as far as it might have in exploring what the <UNK> all those prominent <UNK> thought they were doing with the 24 hour a day cable networks the discovery channel and the history channel documentaries have i've seen many in the past year that were better than this one
<START> tiny <UNK> how i spent my vacation has always been my favourite animation movie and loved it since i first watched it when i was 7 or now i'm almost <UNK> and i still love this wonderful work of art br br i really like the idea how we track what each of them did in their vacation and there were really some funny quotes said that really made me laugh a lot br br in this movie <UNK> never get bored and once u see it <UNK> want 2 c it again and again because believe me it's really wonderful and it's suitable for all ages
<START> mr <UNK> <UNK> has a fairly straight forward plot when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison it's up to the even more mysterious mr <UNK> to solve the case br br i'm shocked at the number of positive reviews for mr <UNK> <UNK> on imdb because to me well i found it extremely disappointing i enjoy mr <UNK> and i enjoy charlie chan but i can't say i cared for this <UNK> mash of the two for those unfamiliar with the story behind mr <UNK> <UNK> it was originally intended to be a charlie chan film but when warner backed out some of the scenes and action were <UNK> for peter lorre and mr <UNK> as i <UNK> the end result left me <UNK> mr <UNK> is not chan he's more mysterious he's more athletic and he's more exotic so trying to put <UNK> in a chan film is like trying to fit a square <UNK> into a round hole it doesn't work and listening to lorre <UNK> try to deliver one of chan's trademark <UNK> just ends up sounding silly add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already brief <UNK> minute runtime is made up of boxing scenes something that i never seem to enjoy and you end up with a movie that i couldn't help but dislike if i have to say something positive i would point to the performance of <UNK> luke but even he's not near enough to save mr <UNK> <UNK> in my eyes br br sorry but a 4 10 is about the best i can give this one
<START> for those who loved wayne's world the blues brothers and hell even <UNK> of the lost <UNK> you will find much to like but probably not love in <UNK> d the pick of destiny a fictional epic about the <UNK> of the <UNK> jack black kyle <UNK> band two out of work losers with a love for rock <UNK> are met with a dilemma when long supportive mother stops sending him rent <UNK> <UNK> and make tracks for the rock and roll hall of fame after a <UNK> music store clerk an inspired ben stiller tells them about the titular pick a funny animated <UNK> sequence gives the <UNK> along the way our <UNK> encounter a <UNK> <UNK> stranger a game tim robbins sasquatch <UNK> security guards <UNK> chicks and satan himself an ironically cast dave in a climactic sequence that has to be seen to be believed and preferably played at high volume rarely do i see comedies in the theater but pick is an extremely nice change of pace it may not go up to 11 but it <UNK> a tune both crude and clever for a good 90 minutes and the songs are inspired low brow hilarity recommended br br 6 5 out of 10
<START> warning might contain spoilers br br i just sadly spent 5 bucks on this movie on amazon and i wish i never spent it i have never seen suck horrible special affects or acting i mean jack 0 is just a laughable monster and his costume looks like something u could buy at a halloween store or make yourself the acting is just horrible especially sean kelly i mean come on he is so pathetic with his little lines come get me low i laughed so hard on this its just stupid i mean the movie is so awful they had to put a few minutes of nudity in it just for people not to shut it off low i think the most laughable scene is when the woman sticks a <UNK> knife in the <UNK> and gets <UNK> i mean come on that looked so fake and the <UNK> i could buy that at any halloween store or make it myself well i recommend not watching this cheesy movie cause it will be time you will never get back
<START> this is a pretty clever well acted version of the modern 30s woman's fairytale romance in this case she helps the man she loves become head of the company while serving as his secretary and eventually wins his love from a scheming social <UNK> interestingly her business sense is shown as subtly parallel to her <UNK> and the ladies of the office are depicted as the powers behind the throne lifted way above the average by mrs intelligent performance
<START> <UNK> what has disney done lately most of their new shows really suck <UNK> life of <UNK> and cody are pretty good but other shows like <UNK> in the house <UNK> of <UNK> place suck and are unwatchable br br naturally <UNK> is just beyond stupid and dumb its about a teenager named <UNK> who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life there are her friends margaret and rain and her older annoying brother hal there all annoying and stupid especially margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's <UNK> pretty its just beyond awful i hate all the seasons of this show its just terrible in every way the first season was better though br br if you value your life you wouldn't watch this crap its painful and stupid
<START> i watched this movie knowing that it would be awful but damned if it didn't break new and revolutionary ground in the field of making <UNK> matter acceptable as entertainment the plot is deep rising with <UNK> effects and horrid acting the lines in this well wow there really is no way to put this movie down because i think the words have yet to be created in the english language the sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually making something good you won't believe your eyes when you see how many movies they ripped off without even trying to hide it there are scenes plot devices straight out of deep rising alien jurassic park predator <UNK> <UNK> and the list could go on forever however unlike any of those movies this one just falls short of celluloid <UNK> the most <UNK> thing about this film aside from the way it tries to be competent but fails is that <UNK> him <UNK> self is in it how the hell can they afford john rhys davies but not decent effects writing actors or sets really awful and not the type of bad that's good
<START> this has always been a favorite movie of mine i've owned a vhs copy and a couple of months ago i found a dvd release which is also part of my video collection i also happen to be a huge baseball fan and as part of my off season reading i picked up a copy of robert excellent book you gotta have <UNK> that <UNK> the ins and outs of japanese baseball and the challenges that foreign players have encountered playing in japan as i began to read yesterday it made me think of this movie because it appears the screenplay was based almost <UNK> on this book the parallels are uncanny the jack elliot character closely resembles bob <UNK> an aging <UNK> whose best days were behind him <UNK> <UNK> leon lee is also depicted in the character max hammer <UNK> a veteran in the japanese league who has made his peace with the <UNK> of the japanese game and helps keeps his <UNK> sane the elliot character goes through the same sequence of encounters as <UNK> from big <UNK> <UNK> early success that <UNK> an already <UNK> sports media and the ensuing <UNK> that <UNK> frustration alienation from <UNK> fans and media and the resulting <UNK> that <UNK> a desire to go back home to the us the only difference is that the movie adds such hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending br br speaking of love interests i'm sure many viewers have come to this site as i did to look up the actress who played the beautiful <UNK> and what other work she has done it only lists this movie it turns out based on an article i read that the brief love scene she has with tom <UNK> a <UNK> in this movie mild by our standards basically they kiss while he's in the bath and she's wearing a <UNK> caused such an outrage on the part of the japanese public males in particular that she has never been offered another role of any kind in movies or television essentially <UNK> by the japanese movie industry it's a real shame as she is was quite a talented actress in this movie br br if you like this movie as much for the baseball elements and cultural differences as i did go find a copy of you gotta have <UNK> by robert <UNK> a good read and a great companion book to this movie
<START> i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of <UNK> darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the made by the <UNK> the level of acting is utterly superb joan is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz <UNK> anna <UNK> and helen <UNK> all perform beautifully but it's my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret the closing scene between her and joan is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliant br br please let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well <UNK> version is watch and enjoy
<START> this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review unfortunately both times they have been for movies that can be described with several 4 words that can be defined as or <UNK> the other movie of such <UNK> was masked and anonymous br br onto the review there are several key things wrong with this movie which i will describe below br br 1 steven has lost the plot i e in all his other movies family friend gets killed steven gets angry steven kills people the end br br 2 steven has run out of money there was a good car chase scene at the start but i think he blew his budget on that and couldn't afford a decent script writer or editor br br 3 steven no longer appears to do his own action instead the from memory 2 fight scenes were shot neck down and from the back so you couldn't actually see his face most likely a stunt double i'm guessing chuck norris br br in summary worst seagal movie ever second worst movie i have seen in recent history and i've seen a lot of bad movies
<START> as a fan of c j 's earlier movie latter days i really wanted to like this film br br the <UNK> thing i can say however is that it's not an awful film there are some good performances and a few funny scenes in particular <UNK> spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her <UNK> ex boyfriend br br overall though it's pretty week the script falls back on weird <UNK> and clichéd movie moments way too often the main character went to <UNK> on a golf <UNK> and his high school buddy doesn't even know that he plays the game br br most of the time this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say there are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time and you could easily cut half the characters from the film without losing anything br br still for all it's faults i would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years which says a lot about how bad most gay films are br br i'm hoping c j 's next film will be better
<START> i've seen <UNK> <UNK> dead man's walk and the streets of and now the return to <UNK> <UNK> if you are hungry for more after watching <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fill <UNK> belly great cast great story most definitely a close second to <UNK> <UNK> i will be <UNK> this movie to add to my collection this is the best or at least my favorite performance by jon voight he is captain call lou <UNK> jr playing <UNK> is not somebody i'd mess with he is a bad ass with perspective william peterson does a great job as well rick <UNK> is back as <UNK> with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his <UNK> on <UNK> blue my only problem with this film and it's really picking <UNK> is that i had the impression that call wanted to be the first man to cattle in montana and it's obvious that had already been there a while a little inconsistent but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale i especially love the apparent character growth of <UNK> and july johnson i've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel
<START> <UNK> of the <UNK> booth play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment the cast of women is excellent most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together there is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a <UNK> granted the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and <UNK> by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common but at the same time its just as <UNK> as ever i just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really don't feel pulled along by the plot wait for cable
<START> i saw this movie on vhs some time ago 27 jan 2003 just because of the name of paul rudd on the cover i liked his performance in the object of my very much and i really expected a good work however i found this film a complete mess the story has a very confused screenplay and the characters are not well developed further the low budget special effects do not help much i do not know the previous generation of gen y cops but this next generation is not good i do not recall exactly why i gave this grade and i do not intent to see this movie again but my vote is four br br title brazil gen y cops a <UNK> gen y cops the next <UNK>
<START> this film is great i watched it with some friends and we thought it was proof that a film doesn't have to see commercial success to be a hit is what i would love to be able to say about this film in the words of the film itself you are very very bad i went to see an <UNK> once so generally agree with the moral of the film though br br i'd include a spoiler but the lack of plot makes this very <UNK> overall a cinematic disaster br br quotes <UNK> not a <UNK> at all ' <UNK> beautiful and i bet you're nice <UNK> <UNK> you ever seen a naked man's body ' <UNK> couldn't break a piece of straw ' br br cameos in dubbing micheal <UNK> harold bishop steve benjamin <UNK>
<START> this time the lovable <UNK> gets <UNK> for jury duty where a corrupt attorney notices that he looks like a <UNK> who wants to break out so the two get switched of course most of the movie is a series of gags in ernest goes to jail most of the gags relate to electricity i really liked the whole <UNK> <UNK> sequence early on overall the point of the movie is just to have fun and i'm sure that you will this is possibly the ultimate movie that you watch with a bud it's quite safe to say that jim <UNK> will truly be missed <UNK> the only other cast member whom i recognized was randall <UNK> <UNK> who played <UNK> you've surely seen him somewhere
<START> watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction this is what today's documentaries are all about it's refreshing to watch something so personal honest and real mr thoughts opinions and <UNK> are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here it's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation this film <UNK> very carefully and quite successfully br br one would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of <UNK> expectations would give birth to <UNK> but it doesn't quite the opposite it made me feel good i feel that i now know more about marriage about women br br definitely check this out it'll make you think exactly what a good documentary should be designed to do
<START> flight of the living dead sports production values that <UNK> the <UNK> script from director scott i'm a producer tell thomas and two <UNK> who shall remain <UNK> because i feel sorry for them having to <UNK> those no names to this turkey apparently actually shot on film this direct to dvd release has almost nothing going for it that you haven't seen or heard a hundred times already br br despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors like richard three <UNK> high <UNK> <UNK> stargate and raymond j little children barry and a slew of others not so recognizable <UNK> is <UNK> populated with cardboard most of which ends up <UNK> in unconvincing fake blood there are a few precious few gags that work the <UNK> and the zombie trapped in his seat both come to mind but most of the scripting is pedestrian and comic book stupid and i am here to assure you that we're talking pedestrian and stupid you'll never for a second believe that <UNK> is anything but a cheap cash in movie with <UNK> of cool god <UNK> it ever <UNK> the sequel its idiotic ending promises br br strictly <UNK> viewing depending on how <UNK> your local library is and otherwise suitable for <UNK> and the <UNK> only
<START> essentially <UNK> action film has two good guys <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> against two bad guys mitchell and pierce <UNK> is perhaps the most <UNK> action lead of the 80s small part is a far cry from his <UNK> days and cameron mitchell adds another shameful role to his career one to sit right next to his laughable turn in the <UNK> murders this man was a respected actor once now he has come down to wearing flowers in his hair and complaining about people bleeding on his carpet only stack pierce acts with some dignity as for the violence don't worry most of it is too badly done to offend anyone 1 2
<START> i have <UNK> with death it is the most <UNK> contest you can imagine it takes place in an <UNK> with nothing <UNK> with nothing around without <UNK> without <UNK> without glory without the great desire of victory without the great fear of defeat in a <UNK> atmosphere of tepid <UNK> without much belief in your own right and still less in that of your <UNK> if such is the form of ultimate wisdom then life is a greater <UNK> than some of us think it to be <UNK> in joseph <UNK> heart of darkness br br it's difficult to make lyrical the subject of death in any work of art yet movies have recently made bold attempts to <UNK> it to the extent that it is <UNK> as a part of the cycle of all living things and it can be chosen rather than chosen is the <UNK> word for <UNK> <UNK> sea inside based loosely on the true story of the sailor <UNK> it is a drama about <UNK> without prejudice <UNK> in love poetry and friendship if it sounds like barbarian <UNK> 2003 in which a <UNK> professor says farewell to <UNK> friends and loves before he takes his life then you are right in fact sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the protagonist before he goes a remarkable feat with not one of those moments in the least dull or uninteresting br br <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> has <UNK> eyes and commanding voice for the romantic a combination of tough <UNK> and poetic <UNK> <UNK> plays the disabled lawyer julia who becomes an imaginary lover for <UNK> increasing in <UNK> as her life <UNK> with disease added to the already almost soap opera <UNK> is lola as <UNK> a blue collar visitor who initially tries to <UNK> <UNK> from seeking death but quickly falls in love with him talk about <UNK> guy has unbelievable luck <UNK> substantial women and he can't move a finger but talk he can proving the ultimate argument about what women want love that speaks not just makes br br i will <UNK> from mentioning the major motion picture now up for an oscar that features <UNK> as its climax in order not to spoil the experience for first <UNK> sufficient it is just to say both films are successful in opening up both sides of a <UNK> subject without forcing a specific point of view the religious right has a right to complain that the former film and barbarian <UNK> celebrate suicide it has no right to <UNK> the beautifully balanced sea inside of the same br br a life in this condition has no dignity <UNK> says the irony is he <UNK> himself with supreme dignity that makes anyone question his determination to end his life the sea inside is a <UNK> entry in <UNK> oscar nominations for best foreign language film
<START> this movie is <UNK> bad that i've wasted way to much time already talking about it <UNK> bad really bad and i'm not even that critical i'm almost ashamed to admit to having seen it <UNK> few minutes show you how far she's really made it i mean really anything next to this is really oscar worthy for her i suppose the only way for her to look at it is there's no way but up after this one i suppose she had to start somewhere but really <UNK> bad awful really bad is too good a word for this s t but i don't want to get mean now but really how can u not after wasting 90 minutes 90 minutes of my life that i'll never get back 90 minutes i could have spent doing something better like sitting on my butt and staring into space that would have been time better spent walks away shaking head
<START> david comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything i feel about darling <UNK> this massive musical is so peculiar and over blown over produced and must have caused <UNK> at paramount in 1970 it cost 22 million dollars that is simply irresponsible darling <UNK> must have been <UNK> from a board meeting that said hey we got that pink <UNK> guy and that sound of music gal lets get this too and handed over a blank <UNK> the result is a hybrid of <UNK> <UNK> half a <UNK> some mgm 40s song and dance numbers of a style daisies and <UNK> so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the production is <UNK> lush breathtaking to view but the rest the ridiculous romance julie looking <UNK> hudson already dead the <UNK> comedy and the <UNK> boring songs this spectacular film into being irritating <UNK> is like a <UNK> 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up star released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is and andrews looks sublime mature especially in the last half hour but <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and i believe really killed off the mega musical <UNK> of the 60s and made andrews look like <UNK> again which i believe was not <UNK> intention paramount must have <UNK> <UNK> when they saw this and with another 20 million <UNK> in catch 22 and 12 million in on a clear day and 25 million in paint your <UNK> they had a financial <UNK> of <UNK> proportions with <UNK> million tied into 4 films with very uncertain <UNK> maybe they should have asked <UNK> daisy <UNK> from on a clear day <UNK> was very popular on immediate first release in australia and ran in <UNK> cinemas for months but it failed once out in the <UNK> and the sticks and only ever <UNK> after that on one night stands with on a clear day as a sunday night double thank god paramount had their simple <UNK> yes one million dollar film love story and that 4 million dollar gangster <UNK> the godfather also ready to recover all the <UNK> million in just the next two years for just incredible
<START> ed <UNK> the butcher of is set in the small american town of in <UNK> during 1957 where loner ed <UNK> kane <UNK> lives by himself on a farm after the death if his mother brother the local police have had a <UNK> of grave <UNK> to deal with when local <UNK> sue <UNK> <UNK> grow that something nasty is going on ed is a violent sexually <UNK> man who kidnaps girls murders them will the police figure the truth out in time to save <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> timothy daughter br br written produced directed by michael this was an attempt to base a horror film around the true events surrounding notorious serial killer ed <UNK> turns out to be pretty crap the real life ed <UNK> was only ever convicted of two murders died in 1984 but several films have been inspired by him including the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 deranged 1974 ed <UNK> 2000 with this fairly recent addition possibly being the worst <UNK> film ever even though ed <UNK> was real next to nothing in this film is based on fact <UNK> never had an <UNK> none of his victims were related to any of the investigating officers there was no car crash victim although <UNK> keeps his name other people have had name changes the kidnapping murder of the two women depicted here actually happened four years apart in reality but in this film it happens over the course of a couple of days while here <UNK> is shown as a large <UNK> muscular man in reality he was a <UNK> thin old quite short as a factual drama ed <UNK> the butcher of is worthless as pure entertainment it's no better with a deadly dull pace feel to it the character's are all boring when he isn't killing someone <UNK> is shown working or just walking around it's very dull there's no suspense because we know who the killer is it's just a tedious wait until he gets caught at the end there is no real attempt to get into mind with the makers giving him no more motivation than him occasionally having hallucinations of his <UNK> mother br br there isn't much gore here there's a scene with a woman hanging on a meat hook there's a really badly edited scene of <UNK> cutting a leg off there's the usual <UNK> of <UNK> organs <UNK> lying around as well as a bit of blood but there's really not much here to get excited about the film was obviously <UNK> to <UNK> a lot of the colour out of the picture as it's not far off black and white at times i personally think the lack of colour makes it even <UNK> to sit through br br with a supposed budget of about 1 500 000 i can't really see where the money went in a very forgettable production although set in <UNK> this was filmed in california kane <UNK> is all wrong for the role of ed <UNK> just from a physical point of view <UNK> doesn't look even remotely like <UNK> he gives a pretty poor performance to as he just stares at the camera a lot making silly faces br br ed <UNK> the butcher of is crap it's as simple straightforward as that as either a factual drama or pure exploitation entertainment this is total tripe from start to finish with nothing to recommend it
<START> i think this is the best norwegian movie i've ever seen it's about 40 year old <UNK> who gets hit by a subway train and suddenly finds himself in a strange city however everything here has been made ready for him he has got a job a house and clothes at first this city seems perfect no death no pain and no problems everywhere there are men in gray suits who <UNK> up and <UNK> everything that doesn't fit into their definition of perfect however <UNK> can't really seem to fit in and starts to long back to his old world and tries with all means to get back br br the thing that <UNK> my the most in this movie is how they way of making the city seem so <UNK> even though i have seen a lot of these places in real life they seem so distant another thing that contributes greatly to the is the performance from the actors is just the perfect guy to play the confused and <UNK> <UNK> and all the other characters are also doing a great job by playing <UNK> sounds like a hard job doesn't it the strong difference between <UNK> and the others leads to very amusing situations as well br br all in all this is a fabulous movie the plot may be a little confusing but the movie has such a great atmosphere i would recommend that everyone should go see it br br and i wouldn't recommend listening to as it seems he has seen too many commercial american movies and seems to have became too used to just getting served the moral on a silver plate the way i see it there is not much in this film that tries to tell us about suicide being right or wrong i consider it more of a warning of a direction our society seems to be taking but sure everyone can see a film in their own way
<START> fame had been one of my favorite movies for years it is not just an 80's musical movie of that high school in nyc it is legendary people no longer refer to the high school of performing arts but the fame school br br the characters are real they are not hollywood and their stories are real the film follows them through the four years of school starting with a powerful monologue by one student at <UNK> and finishing with a spectacular <UNK> show br br apparently some find the broadway show better however it is my opinion that you should definitely see this movie anyway and then have your own view for anyone who enjoys movie watching and would like to have the classics down this is surely one of them it is an example of one of those movies that was really great with actors that we loved for those 2 hours and then never saw them again they are classic fame students br br make fame live forever
<START> a fabulous film which i have now watched several times over since buying the video only four days ago yes i am a colin <UNK> fan and colin was his usual talented natural gorgeous self br br the interaction between colin matthew field and sammy 7 year old son was very special and so natural to watch they were hilariously funny together and also touched my heart strings the scenes which i loved the most was sammy and matt sitting on the wall <UNK> and matt then falling backwards off the wall in an hilarious fashion i won't reveal the content of their discussion so as not to spoil the plot also very hilarious was sammy matt about sex colin and were perfect in this scene and making what can be an awkward subject between adult and child just so natural words and face at the end of that scene were so delightful and said it all just brilliant credit of course must also go to roberts for his delightful portrayal of sammy he played such a lovable and <UNK> child character the two actors were just perfect together br br the interaction between colin matt and was perfectly balanced and i couldn't agree more that the chemistry between them was wonderful to watch displaying love tension and of course passion it was exciting to see how their delicate <UNK> romance gradually <UNK> also showing how their cultural and social <UNK> affected their relationship and was good to see how colin and <UNK> portrayed matt and discovering accepting and <UNK> these differences it kept me fixed to the tv and guessing right until the end of the film br br portrayal of <UNK> vulnerable and juvenile side was also perfectly portrayed so much so that i found it was difficult to watch when matt was so mean and childish towards sammy because he matt felt that sammy was getting in the way of his romance relationship with <UNK> mother one couldn't help feeling very disappointed angry and frustrated with matt for treating sammy this way and this in turn threatening to spoil <UNK> special relationship with sammy and special talent of <UNK> inside a character's <UNK> and displaying to the audience the different sides of a character was very much in evidence here and pure magic to watch i must also mention that colin also has such a good <UNK> with young actors see also <UNK> life so wonderful and not to be missed film br br i also loved the relationship between matthew and his wife jenny both were excellent in displaying to the audience the dark side and tensions within their marriage and that not all seemingly <UNK> are quite what they may seem from the outside br br i <UNK> forget to mention the <UNK> whom i thought was very funny in a serious sort of way also mother and family were hilarious as well as bringing across the importance of culture and her situation br br the downside i can't really find a downside but to be objective about the film and to give credibility to my review the only negative comment that i would make is that the script writers didn't explain in enough detail as to why matt <UNK> in the car there was only a vague suggestion from of something being wrong with his heart however this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film far from it i just needed to <UNK> the tape a little for a 2nd take br br i felt that this film had it all entertaining uplifting and i loved the rich colours and sunny scenery the film <UNK> up a cold winters day and made me smile all the essential elements were there laughter love tension sadness anger drama and a warm feel good factor with yes plenty of those delicious colin <UNK> moments including a very <UNK> colin in a shirt <UNK> not to be missed by any fan what more could a girl want br br i would strongly recommend this film specially to any colin <UNK> fans
<START> random hearts <UNK> up on me criticized for the <UNK> of a the premise and b the pairing of an <UNK> cop and a <UNK> as well as for its <UNK> the film felt just fine to me and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing i found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between ford's and <UNK> lives as they first found out about and dealt in very different ways in very different <UNK> with their deaths and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people it could happen two people's <UNK> <UNK> could be on the same plane the plane could go down the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath so what if it's improbable improbable is not the same as far fetched so what if it did happen why not <UNK> br br ford's and <UNK> performances are believable and nuanced instead of finding their <UNK> implausible opposite sides of the tracks give me a break i felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew how to deal with the script does not bring them together too soon or too easily and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship <UNK> either where i find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting <UNK> in or insights into the <UNK> of the situation personal and professional but never seems to pursue any of them very far and if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard harrison ford does seem about 10 years too old for the part br br for five and a half bucks at wal mart with full length director commentary and behind the scenes <UNK> the dvd is well worth <UNK> i don't think i would pay 20 for it on a bet but my wife might ok ten
<START> <UNK> for korean cinema last year i saw and nowhere to hide now i catch up with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> directorial debut christmas in august the variety of themes and level of achievement speak highly of a national cinema <UNK> for discovery this film's major themes are death and love the <UNK> and thoughtful way <UNK> won han <UNK> <UNK> with his impending death and the <UNK> of his desires toward <UNK> ha out of true love for her i was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions <UNK> from unnecessary pain without <UNK> her br br the success of this type of film is <UNK> on the skill of the actors han and <UNK> <UNK> being both quite <UNK> yet <UNK> a number of secondary characters <UNK> relatives friends and <UNK> are quickly <UNK> to <UNK> the story without <UNK> from its main focus to live is to love but all things must pass pain <UNK> life goes on
<START> i've taken another look at this film and still consider it pretty good chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who really can act she appears occasionally in soft core such as body of love and lady stories on showtime i thought nicole did ok too with her nice body and charming accent too bad she's not in more films
<START> the movie is not that bad <UNK> <UNK> sucks i hate when van damme has love in his movies van damme is good only when he doesn't have love in his movies
<START> this has got to be the worst show i have ever seen i always liked chuck norris in films but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as shirley temple in little miss <UNK> i also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting i know an african american who looks like this guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude br br chuck norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets i think this show started great but lost steam as time went on br br they should have dumped <UNK> side kick
<START> of all the actresses in film today <UNK> scott thomas would be my choice if i had to <UNK> one for on a desert island br br i could watch her simply say sitting in a chair for a couple of hours so it's difficult for me to be objective completely with respect to one of her films br br however i did enjoy this movie and its story per se more than that <UNK> by the average <UNK> among the many persons previously commenting on this site br br harrison ford is not one of the actors though whose performances i enjoy most but he's one of a handful who have reached the level of moving from 7 figures to 8 per film so who am i to argue br br ford though is often <UNK> in his acting style and sometimes seems to be in serious need of an and a shot of <UNK> and random hearts is in this <UNK> br br his obsession in <UNK> the <UNK> which both he and thomas have endured with regard to their linked <UNK> is understandable given his profession as a detective but not to the level presented here although not far it crossed the line into the annoying category br br however most of the scenes after he and thomas became involved were interesting and well played br br this film could have been a 9 but i'd lower it a couple of levels based upon ford's overall performance and and another because it contained a bit more of the <UNK> sub plot elements than seemed required
<START> this is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art this is an oblivious <UNK> of love by the <UNK> brothers about the life of <UNK> <UNK> that is full truly artistic elements the movie jumps from color to black and white past to present fictional works by <UNK> to him all without being confusing in the least bit the only thing that gets me is that the entire movie with the exception of the <UNK> spoken parts is in japanese still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn't found won <UNK> if you are reading this this is a film that should be released under your <UNK> with as much extras as possible this film <UNK> deserves more 10 10
<START> a complete zero out of four one worst sums up awful actually more words come to mind ridiculous third rate and terrible this is one of <UNK> worst movies ever he <UNK> around in a cheap leather jacket and equally cheap <UNK> foil zorro style mask with what appears to be wings on the sides br br the movie is set in ancient <UNK> or <UNK> and is <UNK> un historical for an indian movie as stated above a leather jacket from k mart with <UNK> did not exist 400 years ago unless all my history teachers were wrong br br <UNK> also does his <UNK> cross dressing in this movie far from being funny it is very <UNK> to watch what could possess the son of the legendary raj kapoor to <UNK> the memory of his house like this on screen br br on the plus side if you want a real laugh go ahead and watch this film the glaring inconsistencies in the plot and costumes are no match for the awful dialogues and shoddy acting
<START> this is about as good as gone with the wind was i love this movie i could watch it over and over again scarlett always gets what she wants no matter what the cost she tries real hard to forget <UNK> but she just can't do it she loves him so much this is a story of real true love it started in gone with the wind and ended up in this movie the only real way to end this movie for real true love was to have scarlett and <UNK> back together at the end and thats the way it ended with them back together with their daughter what more could you ask for there's not a better ending to this great love story than this what else can i say about this great movie
<START> i have just seen the movie 15 park <UNK> which was the first night presentation movie in the asia society human rights film festival in new york i was really moved by the subject matter of this movie and also the excellent portrayal of by the lead actor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i have just one word for everyone who is reading this comment run to get a copy of this gem and watch it my sincere thanks to director <UNK> who has done a excellent job again movie like this comes on once in a blue moon and i was lucky enough to see this movie on screen and also took part in a after movie discussion question and answer session with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a simple word a wonderful experience
<START> the <UNK> of the story is that the main character needs to win a public kung fu <UNK> with high stakes the flesh of the story consists of lots of fighting a love triangle <UNK> <UNK> and revenge br br there is a lot to this story the main character is very likeable as an even <UNK> mild mannered and very tough country boy a good versus bad movie is only as good as the villains and the main villains are tough and smart not to mention ugly <UNK> and <UNK> br br if there is one weakness it's the scene where the <UNK> of the main character is imagining her and the protagonist running towards each other in a <UNK> field and <UNK> when they meet i thought i was watching the sound of music for a second and nearly lost hope for the movie luckily the movie <UNK> quickly with a fight scene
<START> a montage prologue quite obviously <UNK> by the blessed <UNK> who actually chose to <UNK> this thing tries to convince us that the comic impact of this <UNK> incompetent bit of nothing is entirely deliberate don't you believe it this is to lloyd kaufman as andy <UNK> is to <UNK> gordon lewis it is so in its project of torturing its <UNK> audience that it seems like some kind of <UNK> art <UNK> only it can't be because it is so completely <UNK> of self consciousness as obnoxious and ugly as things or frozen scream this manages to up the <UNK> by <UNK> itself with a <UNK> bald <UNK> that has to be seen to be believed a hitchcock style shot by shot analysis of say the attack on the girls might <UNK> twenty edits and perhaps three minutes of footage only the sequence is ten minutes long you want to believe that this started life as a slightly more bearable short subject except if you took away the <UNK> what's left would be far less fascinating <UNK> when the does enter the room he only <UNK> extended highly <UNK> utterly blank stares from his <UNK> <UNK> victims repeat this scenario about four times in <UNK> varied settings bridge these with perhaps thirty lines of dialogue total offer up actors even more hateful and <UNK> than those in the above mentioned classics and grace us with a monster <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and one yellow spock ear and you've got a movie too mind <UNK> to refuse a working definition of bad i'm proud to own it
<START> when i say worse i mean less entertaining todd sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera tricks since the last zombie bloodbath which makes the movie even less tolerable in the last movie there were no special camera effects where in this one we are treated to shaky <UNK> and constant switching to black and white also this is called zombie bloodbath despite the fact that the zombies are barely in this one the movie starts in 1945 where some <UNK> kill a violent <UNK> and put him up as a scarecrow back in modern time some kids have a car problem and go to a house the same house in which the <UNK> murder happened some mean people try to rape the kids or something and they bring the scarecrow <UNK> back to life who comes back with some zombies and now talks like darth vader mr sheets <UNK> up the language and <UNK> the violence if you want to see what a bad movie is check this out br br my rating bomb <UNK> mins not rated contains violence and language
<START> as i sit back after watching wong <UNK> <UNK> 1994 movie <UNK> of time  more specifically the 2008 re edit and re release with the word slapped on the end of the title  i wonder what went wrong i wonder why the film just didn't work out at all i wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book in particular what was it about the film which dragged it down and made it the director's worst film of his career br br well it's not too hard to figure out really let me just say that it truly is a shame that <UNK> <UNK> so abruptly went down this hell hole of mediocrity and <UNK> in <UNK> especially considering the fact that in the same year he released <UNK> express one of his enduring and an absolutely sublime film so  what went wrong it would be suitable to consider <UNK> of time as somewhat of an experimental film our director essentially places his own <UNK> style of film making and places it in an entirely different setting mood and atmosphere what results is a <UNK> film which is all over the place and simply does not work out hence it would be even <UNK> to call <UNK> of time a failed experiment bold <UNK> and innovative but a failure nonetheless br br let me elaborate those who have seen the films of mr <UNK> <UNK> a hong kong born film auteur who's made his mark on the art house world since his debut in the late 80's will know that there is an <UNK> aesthetic which <UNK> all of his movies together essentially and frankly speaking they're all colourful thought provoking <UNK> subtly humorous and meaningful of life love and loss the same formula is <UNK> into <UNK> of time however the regular setting of hong kong is ridden of and in its <UNK> we're placed into the setting of ancient china and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and <UNK> br br <UNK> into this quasi adventure historical caper is the typical <UNK> <UNK> love story this time involving an <UNK> hit man who has moved to the middle of the desert and is carrying out contract killings however i must stop myself there description of characters is a useless thing to do why because not a single character in <UNK> of time is worth mentioning or nothing what a bland cast and what a waste of talent the case of <UNK> of time contains nearly all regular <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br not only that but the film is essentially endless <UNK> rambling in a horrendous almost non existent narrative structure one of the main reasons why <UNK> of <UNK> of time <UNK> it is because it seems to possess no plot whatsoever let alone a semblance or an indication of one you can definitely see what they're getting at even from the first two three minutes maybe less of the film perhaps it's just the <UNK> setting of ancient china which is <UNK> and inappropriate for <UNK> <UNK> typical film making style i like to think however unfortunate it may be that mr <UNK> <UNK> just stuffed up big time here br br one thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in <UNK> of time albeit said compliment being <UNK> isolated is another director trademark  wonderful colourful and <UNK> <UNK> what <UNK> colour is composed on screen what glorious <UNK> are painted for us and what breathtaking landscapes and imagery are captured for us throughout the entire movie we can at least take this as a sign that wong <UNK> <UNK> is still there at heart and it's just the film which is so <UNK> and <UNK> his usually commendable nuance although the visuals aren't enough for us to fully <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for this disastrous venture they're enough to make the film worthwhile  and at least we don't walk out of the movie in a completely and totally <UNK> mood now that there's something we can think of nicely br br the film is essentially a <UNK> film following in the style of say legendary japanese filmmaker <UNK> kurosawa however one thing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> film from <UNK> best and that's that in the japanese director's films everything <UNK> together and simply works in <UNK> of time nothing seems to work <UNK> <UNK> attempt to make a genuinely profound <UNK> film let alone an intellectual and provocative movie in general terms is a <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> claims that making <UNK> of time exhausted him and that he needed time to clear his head it must've certainly been a effort on his behalf as his are <UNK> in the film and transferred to us directly  i mean just watching the film is an <UNK> effort and now i need time to clear my head of this unpleasant movie going experience
<START> earth final conflict began like a new world a new vision from the creator of star trek something fresh and unique full of great elements a very good cast with an extremely credible kevin <UNK> as william <UNK> an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of <UNK> of a mysterious alien race after the dead of his wife in strange circumstances but soon the character of <UNK> joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race soon this resistance group begin to discover the sinister plans of the using the humans in they own problems to survive they own destruction as i said before the show began great all was almost perfect including characters like the original was a big mystery because he seems to be a nice creature but at the same time he has his own evil plans <UNK> some people in earth soon came who wasn't bad but mark the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first big enemy of humans the incarnation of evil killing what could be something greater in the first seasons ends in a great way with the dead of <UNK> and the second shows a new lead character liam an hybrid being of human and another alien race with some very interesting powers he replace <UNK> character in a good way so another <UNK> make it better including the conflict with the and the but as i said lines before the <UNK> of begin to take more importance so the new conflicts were less realistic as the same with time the whole great storyline of the alien roots of liam where almost totally <UNK> the same with other things of the previous seasons so when the final season began the original earth final conflict was just an almost forgotten dreams all the magic was missing just to let some vain <UNK> to keep alive the show including the return of <UNK> and liam for a few episodes the final episode was just the evidence of how bad was the show with so many bad changes to think the writers of some episodes didn't know anything about the first stories it was one of the worst end i have ever seen in a tv show a real shame because earth final conflict began like something unique fresh the stories the cast after watch so many show from usa something from canada from the mind of the creator of star trek was wonderful but in the end all change to worse i hope someday someone make a remake of this show of course using nothing from season fourth and fifth except the cast everyone were perfect in his work i still can dream in a better things
<START> i just came back from seeing this awesome movie i can relate to it so much it reminded me when my sister had to go to college we had to move from place to place and my mom acts like adele august boys might not like this movie since it brings tears to your eyes one of the best real life movies i've ever seen and natalie portman rules 10 10
<START> yeah i watched this mini series with my mom and dad as a kid it was one of the few mini series that my 9 year old mind actually could follow i recall it was very well done and didn't necessarily have the feel of the typical crap mini series it was more or less an original concept that really grabbed your attention i would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and plot twists although most twists in this movie are either spelled out or predictable it is still worth the time i haven't checked to see if you can get it through netflix yet however i would imagine not they should play it on the history channel or something
<START> describing this film is a difficult task on the one hand it's an over the top vampire <UNK> complete with <UNK> eerie music a hypnotic <UNK> and of course a coffin with a <UNK> <UNK> br br on the other hand this is one of the <UNK> scripts this side of edward d wood jr produced by the same people who gave us the bloody vampire invasion of the vampires and this film's predecessor the <UNK> titled the vampire the movie sticks close to the lack of logic that <UNK> the other films br br as i mentioned this film is a sequel to the vampire which i have not seen but no matter it's real easy to imagine what happened dr <UNK> played by <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> when the well <UNK> but misguided dr marion brings back the <UNK> body of his <UNK> enemy count de i suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires must be counts of some sort dr marion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some sort of grave robbing in order to advance their medical studies and he hopes to use the <UNK> corpse to study such <UNK> as the <UNK> lack of a normal reflection at which point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection we see the <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> is not pleased and seems determined to pass off the events of the first film as mere fantasy and <UNK> this man was no vampire i'll admit that he liked to drink a little blood but that's all he states also confusing matters is the fragile martha a part time nurse and part time <UNK> who happens to be object of affection martha <UNK> escaped de <UNK> in the first film and apparently <UNK> has spent a great deal of time healing her mind and getting her to think that everything that she experienced was not real br br ok so if you were the scriptwriter for this film you would need a way to get someone dumb enough to pull the stake out of the vampire right well how about the greedy con man who helped marion steal the coffin after getting a glimpse de body he sets his sights on the expensive looking <UNK> that the count is wearing and he conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors aren't looking but darn it he can't remove the <UNK> because of the stake so you guessed it de is on the loose again this time with the shady con as his human henchman br br ok so of course the vampire is after martha again and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe at first they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire then by the end of the film they are trying to get the police to put an all points <UNK> out for a man who is dead but still alive br br you can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here but the filmmakers do throw in a few pleasing twists one of the sets for the movie is a spooky wax museum is there any other kind in these types of films complete with a fully <UNK> torture chamber with real torture and execution equipment the movie has a very keen sense of style and not just in the campy <UNK> one effectively creepy sequence has de chasing a victim down a seemingly endless series of streets and <UNK> following their progress alongside vague buildings with no doors while lighting the scene like a german <UNK> nightmare the <UNK> of dr <UNK> seems to be an influence br br but the rest of the film is juvenile particularly in the film's climax the special effects are quite crude even for the year that this was made and the climactic fight with de in bat form is laughable enough but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that martha would faint and collapse directly over top of a <UNK> <UNK> so that her head was in the perfect location to be chopped off by the blade which is in danger of falling because the <UNK> rope has suddenly begun to <UNK> right at that very minute what an unfortunate coincidence to make matters worse he cuts away from the rope to scenes of <UNK> trying to dodge the <UNK> rubber bat basically standing still and waving his arms around it's definitely an ed wood moment if ever there was one especially when martha seems to revive on her own and rises to her feet just as the blade <UNK> down <UNK> what a relief in terms of <UNK> the <UNK> coffin does not have the <UNK> factor of the bloody vampire or invasion of the vampires but fans of these types of old horror films will appreciate the atmospheric photography and the fact that the director manages to <UNK> some real chills from this material has to count for something <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is just as bad as it gets if you like logic or the lack of it la national treasure and bad acting as well then it could be a movie for you br br otherwise spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer br br actually it looks like a bad produced <UNK> or <UNK> picture to promote the people involved ie actors special effects and so on they produce really bad exposing of their lack of talent br br in a case like this the film company should be ordered to pay back money to the <UNK> that are not satisfied with the product br br it is really lousy
<START> terry and june was one of the classic british sitcoms in my opinion you knew what to expect and ain't that just so typical unlike modern sitcoms with utterly contrived plots this show is still a breath of fresh air how lovely not see or hear remarks about <UNK> functions or not to see a family <UNK> late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers and <UNK> is the secret terry june was based on a middle class couple living in relative harmony in <UNK> of today's strained plots with the <UNK> dysfunctional family made to look hip br br personally i vote the bridge to far episode as one of the best in a way <UNK> antics reminds me of basil <UNK> both sometimes getting almost <UNK> embarrassing br br terry june comes highly recommended have your tea and <UNK> ready
<START> i really really liked this one i know it's rampant with what are now cliché plot lines and plenty of overacting but it was hell of a lot of fun br br in our quest for 70's and 80's horror cheese we come across many flicks that are so bad they're good we also have some that are so <UNK> they suck and then we have some that are so bad they are just bad this is definitely so bad it's good br br some teens traveling come across an in the middle of nowhere a forgotten slice of <UNK> america and they decide to <UNK> it out ' they cross every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it they pay <UNK> br br i would not normally give a movie like this a 9 but the girls in this one are the type that we miss from the 1970's <UNK> scantily clad and fit these aren't the <UNK> <UNK> from today's horrible horror they look awesome in <UNK> shorts br br i give it a 9 out of 10 kids
<START> i originally seen the flash gordon serial on <UNK> and thought it was fun and awesome i overlooked the special effects of the rocket ships with <UNK> and the big dragon monster with <UNK> <UNK> who cares this is 1936 and it was a serial so each week they would show a new chapter buster <UNK> played flash gordon 3 times in all 3 serials then in 1939 he played buck rogers in 1933 he played tarzan the <UNK> he was a very busy actor beautiful jean rogers played sexy <UNK> <UNK> frank shannon as professor and charles <UNK> played the evil <UNK> the <UNK> he makes darth vader look like a <UNK> the serials were very close to the alex raymond comic strip space travel was just a <UNK> dream at the time not to mention ray guns and television this one stands out as the best serial ever the sequel flash <UNK> trip to mars is 2 chapters longer the next flash gordon <UNK> the universe is only 12 chapters and then there's the natives of <UNK> men lion men shark men the feature version leaves out the shark men scenes for the full effect you must see the complete serial i heard george lucas was inspired by flash gordon when he did star wars flash gordon was from universal studios and the music on the soundtrack is from many universal movies like bride of frankenstein werewolf of london <UNK> daughter etc even today flash gordon continues to delight people young and old 10 out of 10
<START> i'm watching this film as i write this it's about 45 minutes into the film and there's been so much back and forth and empty drama i don't quite see where it's going no facts just enough to leave you making <UNK> the acting of main daughter is painful how did this ever get made not the best of lifetime films
<START> <UNK> the is the best film i have seen in years the acting was fantastic especially <UNK> <UNK> who was truly remarkable in the role of peggy lester she brought peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my own next door neighbor i also enjoyed robertson dean in the role of the father he is a true professional and managed to pull off even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace the performances by the entire cast were very good excellent in fact but <UNK> role as played by <UNK> made the movie the cinematography was beautifully done throughout and was most impressive the only criticism i have to offer is a slight weakness of the ending scenes which were overly drawn out repetitive and a bit too focused on the wrong character i would have liked to see it end on a note of forgiveness but spite of that slight flaw it is very much worth the watching and applause for all involved in the making of it
<START> the monster will look very familiar to you so will the rest of the film if you've seen a half dozen of these teenagers trapped in the woods movies okay so they're not teenagers this time but they may as well be three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly abandoned ghost town in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a <UNK> century and a half before you'd think that with a title like <UNK> massacre some interesting things might happen they don't in fact only about 1 10 of the film actually takes place in the mine i had <UNK> teams of terrified <UNK> <UNK> for their lives in the <UNK> confines of their <UNK> praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim <UNK> <UNK> his grisly revenge but instead i got <UNK> twenty somethings <UNK> and in one case <UNK> in the woods a gang of morons with a collective i q that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker <UNK> much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine no suspense no scares and plenty of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity
<START> the <UNK> is for now the last of the high drama high camp airport series at first glance in the tv guide or dvd cover you would simply think that the film your about to view is as thrilling as the previous think again what your treated to is 2 hours and 3 minutes worth of unintentional laughs courtesy of the worst script ever writing it was even penned by eric roth who brought the world <UNK> well one things for sure the script is not oscar worthy it's <UNK> worthy the executives at universal in <UNK> done the right thing by marketing this as a <UNK> apart from <UNK> the film does have an impressive cast list it's certainly watchable to say the least
<START> most movies i can sit through easily even if i do not particularly like the movie i am the type of person who <UNK> great films even if i do not like the genre this is the first movie i could not stand to watch cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen a lot of movies the acting is okay myers is good as the cat it's just that he is really annoying the silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous even for the children in the audience the plot drags on and on and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue the witty <UNK> remarks are disgusting not funny i remember some awful comment about a garden <UNK> being compared to well a type of person people call a ho even though the movie is really short it seemed to last forever do not waste your time i know small kids who hated this movie if children can't stand it i do not know how any adults can i would like to <UNK> more about this film but i do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it i hated it so in summary do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this see a good movie br br 1 10 stars the lowest review i have ever given a movie
<START> this is a film by the director of the notorious in the realm of the senses a film so sexually and <UNK> controversial it was banned for a while this film takes place initially in <UNK> in japan and stars the very pretty <UNK> as the wife of a <UNK> driver who falls for a much younger man who <UNK> her in kind that man comes to her as she was sleeping and <UNK> her though she soon is rather willing to be <UNK> soon they are having an affair and plot to kill husband to be together forever they do and throw him down a well however they didn't count on the ghost of the dead husband haunting and others in the village this film is visually very stunning the use of shadows <UNK> this tale of murder for passion ms <UNK> who is still active as an actress is especially very good in her role its sexual at times but not like in the realm of the senses some of what ensues is up to our imagination i found this film to have a <UNK> of mood that makes it very watchable a little creepy but that goes with the territory i'd recommend this
<START> watching showtime i got the impression that the producers got the idea to put robert deniro and eddie murphy just for the sake of having a film that co starred the two of them other than that i can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence not that it isn't amusing in spots it certainly is but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted br br the thing that really got me was eddie murphy's character i can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job when i was working person at new york state crime victims board i had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs but i can't think of one who thought that this was just something i do until i get my career going in an area far <UNK> i mean can you really see eddie murphy or anyone else going through the <UNK> of the real police academy not the screen version just to get a day job br br anyway deniro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer he's undercover and murphy is part of his <UNK> so what does the <UNK> murphy do he calls a reality based tv series like cops to film the action br br so <UNK> bust gets blown sky high but the producer of the show gets some good footage of murphy and deniro and decides on a new reality based television series so these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working <UNK> case with all the tv cameras around br br eddie murphy's a funny guy i loved him in beverly hills cop and in the doctor <UNK> movies but he's done better things than showtime and robert deniro certainly has br br i guess murphy wanted a chance to work with deniro and deniro must have gotten one <UNK> paycheck to do this film
<START> great job was very exciting and had great stunts a show that really <UNK> was a great job by all who worked on this one and especially the acting on <UNK> <UNK> part this would have been great on the big screen would like to see more of these movies of the week or perhaps a weekly series this was great entertainment and am glad i watched by far the best of the three keep up the good work <UNK> and <UNK> phillips i'll be looking for the next one
<START> this bravo special is one of the most purely entertaining things i've ever seen on tv unlike me first the <UNK> the worlds foremost punk cover band the dan band really must be seen to be appreciated br br on paper the dan band is just a one joke act guy sings <UNK> songs and <UNK> gratuitous profanity into the lyrics if you listen to their dan band live cd that's all you'll get and it'll get old quick i only bought it because it had some songs that weren't on the tv special but what's made dan <UNK> a hollywood cult hero is his amazing stage presence this guy owns his audience for every second he's <UNK> and the <UNK> singers are a large part of the visual punchline as well as for the actual band they stay out of sight for the most part but are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical <UNK> act backing band hopefully a dvd version will be released soon there were almost certainly some songs cut and although the heavy <UNK> adds a bit of unintentional humor it also <UNK> the intentional humor br br if there is any sense in the world the vegas casino owners will soon be fighting over who can build dan his own <UNK> faster br br re member my name fame
<START> where do i begin let me say that after having watched the entire film and the special features on the dvd my wife and i watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running i can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film it's worth hearing br br i'm not a southern boy but i spent some time around <UNK> a long time ago and have a feel for the area this film almost <UNK> of the south it's so real samuel jackson one of my all time favorite actors is magnificent as the emotionally bent <UNK> and christina <UNK> gives the performance of a lifetime as <UNK> a woman who's been wounded severely during her brief life i've always liked ms <UNK> work but in this performance she's giving <UNK> of herself every second she's on the screen awards and little <UNK> are not enough to reward her for what she lays before the audience in this film br br there are other places where you can read the essence of the story so i'm just commenting on the work i'd heard the name justin timberlake before seeing <UNK> but had no idea what he looked like or even why he's famous <UNK> my head on 60 years old i'm outside his target <UNK> to say the least after seeing this film i will recognize him he can act he gives a substantial believable performance as the loving <UNK> of the county slut br br the director is from <UNK> and shows <UNK> for his home region he is also a fine story <UNK> br br and i must mention the music i love blues and the soundtrack for black snake <UNK> is a <UNK> feast for a blues fan br br i'm writing less <UNK> than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie is <UNK> my sentence structure see this film and i mean now
<START> i know when you buy a used <UNK> excuse me previously viewed dvd for 5 99 you shouldn't have very high expectations but even that was a <UNK> price for this poor <UNK> disc br br i will give the producers credit for providing a complex challenge for the viewer to determine which is worst the acting the scripting the camera work the special effects they all pretty much tie for just plain terrible oh it has the absolutely worst <UNK> car crash ever used in a motion picture anywhere br br now all this is pretty serious <UNK> for a movie fan who proudly features <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> loaded weapon and a host of other campy <UNK> in his collection but at least those folks know that ones tongue should be planted firmly in ones cheek the cast of unfortunately use their <UNK> in an attempt to deliver inane dialogue and although it is almost beyond my belief the movies characters seem to think they might actually be doing something of value a back room <UNK> would be ashamed to release this mess br br oh lucky me bought the worst video ever made at the same time <UNK> demon maybe the name should have given me a hint
<START> ok let's see a handsome young stranger is new in town and walks around on the local <UNK> he meets a pretty girl meets up with the obnoxious leader of the local hip young vampires club is <UNK> by them to follow them into this cave gets into a conflict over the pretty girl an epic fight ensues br br no it's not lost boys although you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference since i think even some of the carnival music is the same do you have to pay <UNK> for <UNK> a movie even the ending of this <UNK> is ripped off from lost boys the make up is below par even for a low budget thriller the characters are one dimensional and just exactly how many oh i had this horrible experience scenes of teen angst does one movie need the humor is flat and stupid and everything else is sadly predictable yawn br br the only scary thing about this turkey is the promise threat of a sequel an idea that hopefully every <UNK> in the country will drive a stake through
<START> i saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie the way michael oliver who now turn even worse in the sequel is the biggest <UNK> i cannot bare junior upset his father because he would not go to school which got his father ben <UNK> insane also the crazy dance ride <UNK> is not fair to junior for not letting him go on the ride and that is as horrible as a serial killer to junior because she made threatening insults to junior which is why i cannot tolerate this movie even if the movie is re released back into theatres in the extended version i still would not see this movie because this movie is not something i can even tolerate in fact it stinks
<START> the two new <UNK> <UNK> movies has a kind of humor which is both intelligent and <UNK> down at the same time which i find extremely amusing it really reminds me of the classic pink <UNK> movies with an almost as good leading man as peter sellers in jean and unlike steve martin completely ruining <UNK> is quite brilliant br br the comments regarding the <UNK> being anti <UNK> are obviously a case of a complete lack of humor and <UNK> understanding br br whether you will enjoy or hate this movie really comes down to what kind of humor you have i can't wait for the sequel
<START> i was really looking forward to watching this film it had all the ingredients of a great tongue in but it just didn't come together at all kevin <UNK> accent was tolerable except that sometimes he forgot to use it and i would rather not have had to listen to linda <UNK> pale attempt she and helen were totally lacking in charm and personality thankfully their screen kids had loads so you could find at least some members of his 2 families endearing you could have strained spaghetti with the plot and i'm sure that the script was written by some adolescent <UNK> in a high school english competition that said when i wasn't cringing i was <UNK> so it wasn't a totally wasted 90 minutes i did find the of <UNK> face on the painting very clever and quite funny maybe i'm being a bit harsh but i was expecting a bit of quality viewing and it just never came
<START> i watched this movie as a child and still enjoy viewing it every once in a while for the nostalgia factor when i was younger i loved the movie because of the entertaining storyline and interesting characters today i still love the characters additionally i think of the plot with higher regard because i now see the morals and symbolism <UNK> is far from the worst film ever and though out dated i'm sure i will show it to my children in the future when i have children
<START> one of the last surviving horror screen <UNK> conrad dies and has his body placed in a <UNK> with <UNK> before death snippets of the great conrad <UNK> you as you visit unfortunately for him and his <UNK> <UNK> body is borrowed by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge <UNK> where they drink with him <UNK> him dance with him laugh with and at him and then put him to bed in a <UNK> which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs news of the missing body reaches widow and her friend who happens to be <UNK> in the black arts and she holds some kind of ceremony that brings conrad back to life so he can in his own words get an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth well is an interesting bad film sure it is cheap the sets look like they were borrowed which i am sure they were the special effects and blood and guts are done <UNK> and with little credibility the acting is average to below average with a few exceptions jeffrey combs of re animator fame is in <UNK> but really he does little in this rather <UNK> role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead man's body for kicks none of the kids except the pretty girl playing meg is any good <UNK> plays the friend of the with <UNK> interest also look for the big i mean big guy that plays the policeman that is <UNK> himself of <UNK> fame but thankfully for all of us one performance does rise above the material <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> overlooked actor from germany who had christopher lee features and did star as a vampire in the <UNK> vampire killers does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life conrad in a bad human being in life living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even dead obviously none of the swinging teens at that point <UNK> is able to look very regal speak very <UNK> and convey menace with ease if for no other reason one should see for his performance i do however believe that when they showed black and white clips of that they used christopher lee footage anyone have any thoughts anyway one can guess what happens and it does indeed goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace again the formula is trite and <UNK> the acting for the most part is <UNK> and the direction oh so ridiculous but <UNK> gives a good performance in a sea of <UNK> definitely worth a little <UNK> watching <UNK> keep popping up on screens in his <UNK> brought a <UNK> smile to my lips each time
<START> they prove that the cops when they can't find the real <UNK> always blame the parents and <UNK> them of sexual abuse of their kids these movies always depict the press as a bunch of animals and have the parents coming out of court to feed the <UNK> to <UNK> the grief stricken hasn't anybody ever heard of a <UNK> back door in these movies here you have a psychic who tells them exactly what happened and where the body can be found but the police are not told and nobody <UNK> his <UNK> br br the police are portrayed as <UNK> who don't know what they are doing and there's always an outside detective like ed <UNK> who comes in late on the case believes in the parents and <UNK> the mystery br br also after the parents are <UNK> they don't spit in the faces of the dumb cops who put them in jail took their kid away and accused them of killing their own child br br it looked as if i've see this film many times before
<START> this movie twists the facts of anne and <UNK> lives into something <UNK> to make mary <UNK> who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature and make her the good sister is just silly it is anne who was in fact the far more interesting character and that is why it is her life and not <UNK> that has been told so often br br in response to an earlier review i fail to see how <UNK> life was so criminal to me it's henry who was the real criminal whatever <UNK> motives for winning the king and <UNK> her affections in order to gain a crown and husband has to be taken into context of the time in which these real life events took place anne in comparison to the majority of most of the <UNK> in her time was a relatively innocent figure most modern historians <UNK> or have <UNK> most of the <UNK> and that this movie <UNK> about her and i have never heard of anyone who actually believes the <UNK> than she slept with her brother this movie is so sensational and false that it is <UNK> to think that someone without knowing anything about this period in history could walk away believing anything this movie has presented as fact br br i won't even get into the weird filming of the movie but i'm pretty sure that cameras weren't invented in the <UNK> century so i don't understand why anne and mary are talking to one throughout the movie it's a really bad plot <UNK> and is jarring and annoying to put it mildly br br anne of the thousand days is not accurate either but is infinitely more entertaining and at least comes closer to telling the story of one of the most intriguing women of history don't even think about renting this it's two hours you'll never get back
<START> this flick is worse than awful it took a good story plot and turned it into <UNK> cinema the photography is extremely amateurish looks like a <UNK> <UNK> home movie project filmed with <UNK> kiddie cameras the editing appears to have been done by somebody having psychotic flashbacks while on drugs and booze with scenes cut short followed by other unrelated scenes then chopped segments of scenes <UNK> in totally unnecessary and gratuitous nudity missing scenes daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night time scenes then suddenly back to daytime obviously no continuity tom <UNK> wendy hughes and james <UNK> good acting skills are wasted as are the talents of the key supporting cast forget the villain and the anderson women very amateurish acting this movie is a good candidate for a remake even with <UNK> and hughes just have it <UNK> done this time
<START> in this <UNK> noir thriller from columbia which is a combination of panic in the streets and the naked city evelyn <UNK> is <UNK> the killer that stalked new york evelyn who <UNK> some stolen <UNK> into the country from cuba also <UNK> in <UNK> it gets by doctor william bishop and when they do find out what it is the hunt is on for her br br for most of the film the <UNK> department is also hunting <UNK> but for the <UNK> <UNK> it's not until nearly the end of the film that the health department and law <UNK> realize they're looking for the same woman br br <UNK> on a mission also her husband charles has left her flat the cut of all being that he was <UNK> around with her sister while she was in cuba collecting the gems and <UNK> <UNK> when lola <UNK> as her sister commits suicide over the whole affair <UNK> on a mission get or die trying and that's not an <UNK> threat given the situation br br the film was mostly shot in new york like the naked city and its cast is <UNK> <UNK> with a lot of familiar names and faces keep an eye out for good performances by connie <UNK> as <UNK> unsympathetic <UNK> jim <UNK> as a <UNK> club owner and art smith as fence br br a real sleeper in the noir category don't miss it if broadcast
<START> <UNK> is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong she needs to be the center of attention and she'll act stupid to make it so with her attitude she gets sent to charm school br br there she meets the typical characters in today's cinema the nerd the clumsy one the <UNK> housewife and the sexual minority things happen and in the end <UNK> learns her lesson so to speak the plot tries to carry a deeper meaning to the state <UNK> is in but utterly fails to deliver at least i didn't buy it so what you are left with is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you've seen in a million movies before plus the director seems to have a breast <UNK> <UNK> flashes her <UNK> a few times too many at least i can't see that they are relevant to the story br br so the film is ok but if you are like me and don't like to watch a teenager <UNK> people off and making a <UNK> u turn in an instant which i found very unbelievable think twice before watching
<START> this is one of my favorite james bond in games because the missions are fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be hard that makes them fun to do the weapons you use are good the way james bond look in this james bond games is pretty you can see pierce brosnan in him which is cool and all the other characters in this game look like the actors that played them in the movie there is no way that you can't have a good time playing this game i loved it also the game follows the movie pretty much maybe a few added thing but it pretty much follows the movie also the this james bond game has pretty good graphics for <UNK> 64 and to bad there was no voice over actors in this game but who care as long as the game is fun to play br br overall score out of
<START> carlito's angels is a spoof of charlie's angels that is not afraid to spoof even itself at times however that does not mean that the film is above criticism by the viewers as well it is amateurish and juvenile i think fast motion stopped being funny around <UNK> the <UNK> rap music often <UNK> out the dialogue and the film feels longer than it is even though it runs barely over an hour the girls themselves are hot adorable with wonderful lean bodies and even though they never get naked their outfits leave little to the imagination by checking out their imdb pages i found out that one of them <UNK> <UNK> is actually going through with a film career i wish her luck because although this film is bad she as well as the other girls gave it whatever energy it has and i wouldn't mind at all seeing her again on the screen
<START> i cant see how some people cant find this film funny i saw the end of it on sky movies in 2001 thought i would by the dvd since then i have laughed my balls of with lines like laugh and hello night porter when they never get any phone calls overall i think this film is very very funny
<START> the only reason i rated this film as 2 is because <UNK> beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch usually i adore a good romance but this was just a waste of time i didn't shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just wasn't acted very well at all i'm no film critic but i just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason you're watching it is to see <UNK> <UNK> lol the rest of the film is rubbish and if he wasn't in it not that his acting was any good i would have stopped watching much <UNK> it's a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this film it could have had the potential to be a real tear <UNK> if you're looking for a good cry or a film for a <UNK> night in give this one a miss
<START> <UNK> chuck norris decided to put one final nail in the coffin br br containing his film career before going to the safe world of cbs br br saturday night carnage with this hysterically bad supernatural br br <UNK> br br for such a dumb movie this thing sure is <UNK> norris is chicago br br cop frank <UNK> first off what kind of last name is <UNK> br br have you ever met any <UNK> com has no listing for br br the last name <UNK> which opens up any half clever viewer to br br replace the a in <UNK> with an i he and his partner <UNK> br br jackson do the same old buddy cop routine you have seen br br before make funny with the <UNK> and make their captain mad br br jackson looking like the <UNK> love child of whoopi goldberg br br and rick james quickly wears on the nerves with his constant br br complaining and eddie murphy <UNK> facial expressions br br <UNK> and <UNK> become involved with an <UNK> of satan br br whom we are introduced to in the too long opening scenes br br is a demon who is locked in a crypt by king richard the br br the <UNK> <UNK> from which he gets his power br br is <UNK> into nine pieces and <UNK> in nine different parts of the br br world by holy men in 1951 some grave robbers accidentally let br br out and he begins collecting the nine pieces he br br <UNK> himself as an <UNK> professor named <UNK> and br br always happens to be giving a lecture where a holy man is killed br br and a piece of the <UNK> is taken br br norris brings in his walker texas <UNK> <UNK> wilson br br who plays assistant she helps norris with his br br investigation they make goo goo eyes at each other and our br br <UNK> <UNK> travel to israel after a <UNK> is killed in br br chicago while in israel <UNK> is given even more to complain br br about the heat the lack of restaurant the lousy br br drivers and the fact that he is missing the chicago <UNK> br br games norris even manages to work a cute israeli kid into this br br nightmare steals <UNK> <UNK> and hangs around the men br br leading them around israel and not <UNK> any sort of br br appropriate suspicion br br eventually <UNK> <UNK> all of the <UNK> br br pieces but needs the blood of <UNK> to complete the ceremony br br and call up the devil where to find royal blood well br br father is a duke she has an american accent but she is the br br convenient method of forcing this monstrosity br br toward its inevitable conclusion sure this <UNK> of satan may br br have killed countless hundreds over the years but how is he br br gonna do against a good old fashioned american butt <UNK> br br after has been <UNK> killed by his own <UNK> i br br <UNK> him he did not have to watch steal <UNK> <UNK> br br again we are treated to an awful <UNK> involving a <UNK> man br br who has been watching <UNK> i mean <UNK> and <UNK> on br br their quest you see it was <UNK> somewhere that two br br warriors from the west would defeat the silent br br <UNK> man who watched over the couple was none other than br br jesus i kid you not he is listed as prophet in the end credits br br but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle christian br br reference the film makers are trying to exhibit here br br like in i use a walker texas ranger norris is aging and cannot br br get into his fight scenes too much anymore he kicks a lot and br br people fly over furniture in slow motion and then norris gives all of br br his line <UNK> in that <UNK> voice of his oh what a real br br director might be able to fashion out of him his brother aaron br br who has directed him in other films as well has no sense of story br br or momentum scenes are thrown in for sake not to br br entertain the scenes when the dynamic duo first meet drag br br on and on and then is not all that important to the rest of the br br film br br the film was shot on location in israel which means the br br americans could insult the <UNK> in person there is not one br br likeable israeli character here the israeli police captain is a jerk br br the <UNK> driver does not know english and <UNK> convinces him br br that the word sh <UNK> is a compliment nothing funnier than br br mocking those stupid <UNK> on their home <UNK> especially br br when all this racist humor is coming from an american minority br br who would have been more than offended if the tables were turned br br and the israeli cop was mocking the african american cop in br br chicago br br this film is badly written badly acted and badly directed it does br br not work as action cop drama or even horror it just shows that br br the now <UNK> cannon studios was willing to throw their money br br into anything no matter how badly it was planned <UNK> is br br surely a most adequate title i disliked this movie intensely br br this is rated r for physical violence gun violence strong br br profanity some sexual references and some adult situations br br
<START> <UNK> is was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way i ever could imagine this movie has lost its story if you can call it a story after half an hour all the next scenes are totally out of <UNK> the driver is some kind of superman because he survives every attack with gun knife etc even after stabbed in his leg he was able to put her in the box but what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage i really felt sick and <UNK> when the movie ended it could have been such a great one if the story was far more better in my opinion even a kid would make a better story and why <UNK> the girl with water and food i quit with counting the plot holes about halfway through and when the movie reached its almost admirably sick over the top final twist i had completely given up better say throw up the worst thing about <UNK> is actually that it can not be even more worse that worse maybe writer director anderson will learn from this lesson and provide us with a decent thriller next time think the better he'll move to a different genre i keep my fingers crossed but from now on i will read the comment on his future movies first before looking a waste of time
<START> four friends is one of those films that you go to without any expectations only to find yourself knocked for a loop you sort of file it away but then you hear the song georgia on my mind by ray charles and images and vague feelings begin to <UNK> on the edge of your consciousness and then you remember this crazy film which made you laugh and cry almost at the same time br br why is this film so memorable first at least for people who lived through it all because it captures so well the <UNK> of the times its <UNK> hopes its <UNK> its sincerity and above all the emotional roller coaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia and then the acting is just so amazing all angst and passion georgia as difficult to grasp as a will <UNK> the <UNK> but enchanting nevertheless and louis the handicapped room mate with charm to spare who attacks life with gusto and takes each moment with a <UNK> smile because he knows only too well that it just might be his last br br how long has it been since you saw a film that made you really care about the people in the story even if they were far from perfect the film presents you with people whose choices are not necessarily commendable but the film never it just allows us to appreciate the human condition in all its variety even the minor characters have a well defined personality and a history which is why this film seems so real even when some of the actions and reactions might seem over the top because that's the way life is when you think about it and why this film <UNK> you with a complexity that is defined by character truly an amazing and satisfying experience
<START> that's what i kept asking myself during the many fights screaming matches swearing and general mayhem that <UNK> the <UNK> minutes the comparisons also stand up when you think of the one dimensional characters who have so little depth that it is virtually impossible to care what happens to them they are just badly written <UNK> for the director to hang his <UNK> beliefs on a topic that has been done much better in other dramas both on tv and the cinema br br i must confess i'm not really one for <UNK> bad performances during a film but it must be said that as the <UNK> <UNK> best friend and <UNK> as the nasty bullying brother were absolutely terrible i don't know what acting school they <UNK> from but if i was them i'd apply for a full <UNK> post <UNK> only in the lead role manages to impress in a cast of so called british talent that we'll probably never hear from again at least that's the hope next time hire a different <UNK> br br another intriguing thought is the <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack featuring the likes of snow <UNK> ian brown and <UNK> now i'm a bit of a music fan and i'm familiar with most of these artists <UNK> but i didn't <UNK> any of the tracks during this movie apart from the <UNK> run b sides anyone we get many many musical montages which <UNK> how we're suppose to feel these are accompanied by such <UNK> original images as couples kissing by a <UNK> lake and <UNK> in <UNK> this is a problem as none of the songs convey the mood <UNK> and we realise the director lacks the ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through storytelling and dialogue alone br br the ending is presumably meant to be just <UNK> as everybody gets their <UNK> and there is at least one big shock in store but i remained <UNK> <UNK> because the script had given me no one to root for it's not enough to tackle a hot button issue you have to actually give us a plot that hasn't already been done to death and individuals who are more than window dressing as it stands this film is a noble failure with only the promising lead actress and a few mildly <UNK> punch ups to save it from the bin 4 10 must try harder
<START> this is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on this movie is practically navy for the 90s or police academy at sea proves he can play roles other than <UNK> as he <UNK> and the navy in order to get his own sub rob schneider is as <UNK> as usual the same in every role he plays and lauren holly is the local <UNK> albeit with a brain ken hudson campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase the movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non predictable script that still surprises me every time i watch it many of the navy phrases and terms go over my head though but it's a small <UNK> for the sheer accuracy and realism of the movie and its characters
<START> two college buddies one an uptight nerd the other a rude <UNK> <UNK> on a road trip through the country on the way they encounter a vicious vehicle that looks like an army tank combined with a monster truck that tries to run their car over they escape it but only <UNK> the mysterious and dangerous driver more when one of them takes a <UNK> in the top <UNK> while at a rest stop later on they pick up a sexy <UNK> who ends up getting involved in their life threatening situation monster man is an extremely entertaining horror comedy that has some good suspenseful moments as well as some good gory ones the two lead characters and their constant <UNK> is fun to watch all on its own and the end takes a tcm like turn which was very well done absolutely worth checking out
<START> this film is a <UNK> in non mainstream cinema history the use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple <UNK> of strike <UNK> 1st film take the scene on the steps and note the repeated shot of the soldiers <UNK> to <UNK> the point of the horrors that actually did happen a highly intelligent monumental film a must see for all film students
<START> it was funny because the whole thing was so unrealistic i mean come on like a pop star would just show up at a public high school and fall in love with the girl who happens to be obsessed with him come on people br br everyone but the lead girl were completely horrendous at acting the dialog was cheesy the premise was stupid and the camera work was poorly done i felt like i was watching a badly made home video br br i feel as if i've wasted almost 2 hours of my life that i will never get back br br i don't have anything else to say except that i'd rather punch myself in the face multiple times than watch this movie again
<START> what a travesty of movie ratings injustice a 2 1 on the imdb scale as i write this folks this is a lot closer to a 3 0 i'll even go out on a <UNK> and say 4 0 where i've put it come on how can you have a movie about a net of static electricity surrounding the earth and alien cell <UNK> and not give it at least a 4 0 for creativity then you've got all that great dialog like dave look at the composition of this mud you know i don't think they ever got back to that mud no matter this is the kind of flick that <UNK> movie <UNK> live for and i can now rest easy actually i saw this quite a few years ago without the proper appreciation for it along with corman titles like attack of the giant <UNK> and the <UNK> woman i don't know what the fascination might be but to quote a character from the film whatever it is it works fast br br back to that alien cell structure i liked the idea of a third element competing against your standard red and white blood cells when astronaut john <UNK> michael returned from the dead i had visions of a scene that might have been a <UNK> to <UNK> alien but that was not to be instead budget <UNK> limit the picture to a de <UNK> big bird knock off even though that concept was still almost a decade away who knows where one idea leaves off and picks up with another br br look this is not that bad not that good but not that bad anytime you can hook up crash landing <UNK> with alien beings committed to taking over the earth you've got a winning combination throw in the cheesy monster factor and you're on your way just remember a wounded animal that large isn't good
<START> makes invasion usa look like apocalypse now this one can only be recommended to us <UNK> john <UNK> supporters or <UNK> members the message is very simple let's shoot them all <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> everything that isn't american br br besides this is badly acted badly scripted badly interpreted incredibly stupid but no fun at all this movie could be used as a device by cia <UNK> <UNK> sorry there can't be any us <UNK> because they are the good
<START> the greatest movie ever br br <UNK> that for a <UNK> however if we look at it through purely cinematic terms it is clear that three colours red is a masterpiece it is not enough to merely say this three colours red is the masterpiece of world cinema if you accept that citizen kane is not human enough if you accept that star wars is not actually very good if you accept that <UNK> and both have to take a step back then three colours red is the foremost masterpiece of all time as a discussion into human morality three colours red works on an intensely <UNK> level with a depth that none can match blue went almost as far into the human psyche but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat white forced us to reflect on the humanity of <UNK> this in retrospect was better still but still not quite there red however is the real thing what he expresses in this movie is an expression of what it is to be human in fact what he expresses is how it is to feel human it forces us to examine up to the <UNK> detail the very nature of our souls of our <UNK> <UNK> in red one may find meaning on one of its several levels on the first level red achieves a high level of <UNK> we could have no trouble in calling red an exceptionally entertaining story however the <UNK> inherent in the film and its <UNK> force us to examine the movie as a movie it is as if <UNK> is saying <UNK> la in effect in pursuing a <UNK> goal <UNK> can also challenge reality it is a trick that <UNK> has been attempting since le double <UNK> de but not until this his final film did he finally manage to reach this divine <UNK> of fate philosophy and <UNK> the actors and actresses too appear to be at the mercy of a greater power valentine <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> name for she seems to represent an almost pure love meanwhile the idea of first impressions is challenged by jean louis judge <UNK> a <UNK> man who by the end becomes an almost all knowing <UNK> of events a character who <UNK> seems to possess the power to bring characters together a power to make people happy a power which he could only achieve through valentine br br we have a <UNK> to see films as more than just a series of pictures in fact films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature it won't happen of course but at least we have the power to view this film knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can't define but all possess a synopsis of this film read a film about a woman who runs over a dog well it is br br isn't it br br simon br br
<START> what makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies not kidding i was watching it already 10 times or so and did not get tired is it the tender <UNK> throughout the whole thing is it the similarity to classics like <UNK> i was thinking a long time about that and figured it out i guess it is there is no hero there are only people some try to be good some gave up trying to be good some are hopeless cases but carry still the <UNK> of being human inside it is the story of a <UNK> night in a motel at the end of the world one way the catastrophe is nothing but the end of a chain of <UNK> the other way this night reveals the logical of this peoples lives because they are in a certain <UNK> cut off the rest of the world it has something of a tale
<START> czech cinematography is traveling through dark times this movie is a <UNK> evidence obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about <UNK> people characteristic of their stupidity a young and healthy boy who doesn't want to work and prefer to live in a <UNK> shack with a <UNK> alcoholic aunt because of the idiocy of who's just able to <UNK> dad i'll not work in the factory i'd really like to know why i understand the condition of his house but i'm really not able to <UNK> the horrible mess around <UNK> sentimentality everywhere why didn't <UNK> <UNK> her boy to work abroad young czech couples do it very often and take someone else's children to live in a <UNK> <UNK> that's too much br br irresponsible mother badly acted by naive stupid boy silly and confused girl <UNK> yes somebody has already told it badly directed and acted soap opera actors like martin <UNK> and did their best but unfortunately it couldn't save the whole piece
<START> this <UNK> and sloppy spy melodrama featuring two <UNK> one idealistic one drug <UNK> california kids dealing secrets to the <UNK> never seems to get enough steam up to sustain any tension and suspense before it dies a very slow death over two hours later john <UNK> finished product gives the impression that he was asleep in his director's chair most of the time as the film <UNK> and the actors sleep walk save for the highly annoying over the top performance of sean penn br br childhood <UNK> boys and friends chris tim <UNK> and penn <UNK> a plan to sell secrets to the <UNK> when chris lands a job that allows him access to top secret government <UNK> <UNK> by what he sees as us <UNK> in foreign affairs the idealistic chris and the drug hungry make contact with the russians and begin to <UNK> them classified <UNK> when chris decides he wants out things begin to unravel at a <UNK> pace br br the eighties were not kind to distinguished director john <UNK> in the 60s and 70s he had a series of <UNK> acclaimed films in both england and america but then came <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in 1981 and it marked the beginning of the end the <UNK> and the snowman more or less put a <UNK> on it lacking the suspense of marathon man and the quality performances hoffman voight christie jackson <UNK> olivier he had <UNK> from leads in the past <UNK> goes in circles most of the way br br sean penn <UNK> scenery from start to finish in such an obnoxious fashion you find yourself <UNK> his <UNK> to do more to him tim <UNK> is <UNK> by his limited acting chops and most of his scenes show a need for more rehearsal time <UNK> singer as <UNK> girlfriend plays it mute most of the way with <UNK> content to film her vapid expressions when she does <UNK> you understand why only david <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> eyed <UNK> presence and restraint <UNK> himself well
<START> cultural <UNK> is the new hallmark production of <UNK> travels an act of cultural <UNK> not literally after all not a single copy of the book is burned but if this is the only <UNK> people are exposed to many it will people will not get anything like what jonathan swift intended were jonathan swift alive hallmark could be <UNK> for moral rights <UNK> and they'd lose that's a good way to think before starting a project using someone else's ideas br br <UNK> masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity through his hero <UNK> he travels to places that make him feel big small <UNK> on <UNK> human the little people in are small in every way petty and stupid they fight the big <UNK> and little <UNK> interminable wars of <UNK> over which end of their soft boiled eggs are opened at the breakfast table sounds a bit like us br br i forget most of the rest it's been years since i read it the tv show reminded me of a few things and on the bright side it made me want to read it again br br this gift to mankind has been <UNK> on like under the beneath the vulgar <UNK> and <UNK> and especially two great actors peter o'toole and edward fox ought to be thoroughly ashamed some creative person got the bright idea to put the focus on the star <UNK> played by ted <UNK> whose acting is just plain bad he portrays <UNK> as insane all his travels were made up of course swift made up <UNK> naturally the lands he visited were imaginary that's called fiction his purpose was to talk about <UNK> and our often awful relations with each other the travels of his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method but these people treat imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment that hallmark couldn't turn into one of its <UNK> cards is suspect br br i can sure see why hallmark would produce this crap it's so bad that o'toole always profound seems as little as his character he's in character of course while commenting on the character simultaneously as many if not all great actors do <UNK> the character <UNK> light on it our light <UNK> the character it becomes three dimensional through this act of psychic most actors do this very subtly like hopkins in the remains of the day others like nicholson in most things in the last twenty years play the two parts pretty <UNK> apart nicholson actually plays on the relationship of his two points and with us too with him it's all <UNK> cradle and he <UNK> away holds all the strings great fun as is o'toole but something here is lacking he is shouting into a <UNK> as great as ever and all one senses is a hollow shell standing under him br br that's because it is look up <UNK> and there ought to be the word hallmark as a <UNK> harmless bland <UNK> hallmark is the doll who can't pee because she has no <UNK> it is the norm the average the person of no distinction hallmark is to have no hallmark i never suspected that such people despise those who have imagination quite so much suddenly disney against the <UNK> stands out in bold type or <UNK> men of genius always will be violently opposed by mediocre minds indeed anyone to this mediocre type who has an answer to any question other than a or b is suspect who more distinctive then that a man who <UNK> to the darker places of the human soul and shines his little <UNK> to <UNK> what can be found there hence the act of <UNK> the <UNK> destroyed the <UNK> in afghanistan the <UNK> the oldest <UNK> in the world at <UNK> the <UNK> the great <UNK> of the classical age and these things are obviously <UNK> hallmark <UNK> to protect us from foreign <UNK> by <UNK> our own culture the one that <UNK> and <UNK> them and us br br please buy a copy of <UNK> travels wherever you live and read it or order it online i like to use <UNK> books
<START> a truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict the movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being or being around a heroin addict really is good movie which will never truly be outdated excellent performances by all involved and the <UNK> set is <UNK> way of showing how bleak a world can become worth a look an education of sorts the golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a <UNK> lives in
<START> this is probably the most <UNK> film i've ever seen i watched it because i have a soft spot for leon everything else has done has been just awful in my opinion with the exception of the script for <UNK> and jean reno it's a testament to just how bad this film is that reno one of the most charismatic and effortlessly <UNK> actors admittedly he's just starting out here can't make this film or the moments in which he is on screen watchable br br it's all very film black and white no dialogue people doing things for no apparent reason people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera and predictably none of it is entertaining br br it's not a french mad max as some people have claimed actually i think they mean mad max 2 that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post apocalyptic setting and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about mad max 2 was <UNK> mad max 2 was exciting mad max 2 was worth your time le <UNK> combat is none of these br br i know it's supposed to be cool to like arty black and white french films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not or you managed to sit through it without feeling <UNK> which is why i wouldn't trust anyone who claims to like le <UNK> combat because i see nothing of worth in it whatsoever it asks for so much and gives nothing back i found myself <UNK> from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention anyone who can sit through it isn't human or at the very most is psychotic actually they're probably just trying to seem cool
<START> this movie is awful i can't even be bothered to write a review on this garbage all i will say it is one of the most boring films i've ever seen br br and the acting is very bad the boy who plays the main character really <UNK> me he's got the same expression on his face through out the movie i just want to slap him basically 80 of the movie is slow motion shots of weird music and utter sh t br br apparently i've got to write at least 10 lines of text to submit this comment so i'll use up a few more lines by saying the lead character has got one of those faces you just want to slap br br <UNK> i give up this movie sucks
<START> isn't it strange how crap movies always tend to be a little better when you start watching them with an attitude like boy this is going to suck harder than few things have ever sucked before it's pretty much impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high  or even remotely positive expectations as house of the dead 2 is a sequel to something that is generally considered to be one of the absolute worst genre disasters ever to be released the abysmal reputation of the original actually turned out to be a great advantage for director michael <UNK> as it was really easy to <UNK> the quality level of its predecessor and exactly how embarrassing must this be for uwe boll huh having to acknowledge that a straight to video sequel without star power or <UNK> <UNK> is much better than his own pretentious video game interpretation in case anyone still doubts no house of the dead 2 dead aim isn't a good horror movie at all but yes it's definitely better than the first and even worth renting in case you're looking for an <UNK> splatter film with loads of gory <UNK> sleaze and stupid humor there's no real connection with the events in the first film another advantage and this part two opens like a typically <UNK> sex comedy set in a college campus the male <UNK> club plans to attack a <UNK> house inhabited exclusively by blond <UNK> with enormous breasts but the party gets interrupted when an insane professor sid <UNK> who runs his car over a girl and takes her back to his lab to turn her into a zombie this is the beginning of a quickly <UNK> and deadly <UNK> but no <UNK> as the government is prepared and sends their best scientists soldiers to the campus to search for survivors and to bring back blood <UNK> for an <UNK> hunting down zombies seems like the most common thing in the world for this <UNK> they even named them hyper <UNK> but their constantly increasing amount eventually the lives of the most hardened soldiers director <UNK> thankfully found his inspiration in the more <UNK> classics of the genre like james <UNK> aliens and  of course george a romero's dead trilogy particularly day of the dead he luckily also didn't made the same mistakes as uwe boll who inserted footage of the actual video game in his movie why and slightly exaggerated with the use of cgi techniques <UNK> 2 contains heavy images of violence like chopped up female corpses and detailed but it never really becomes nauseating or shocking naturally there's isn't the slightest bit of suspense to enjoy and every dreadful horror cliché features here as well the film is very enjoyable as long as story writer mark altman doesn't try to explain the origins of the zombie <UNK> they're walking corpses with their brains hanging out of their <UNK> so we really don't need to know what caused their deaths especially not when the explanations are given by a blond <UNK> slut who clearly hasn't got a clue what all the medical terms mean just avoid getting bitten sweetheart
<START> i watched part of the first part of this movie and tiny little bits of other parts maybe i'm mistaken but i don't think this movie is really worth watching the odd characters and happenings does catch your attention and is rather interesting but there are bad things in it as well and some gross things the magic and mythical side of it turned me off and for most christians this movie would not be very suitable or worthwhile to watch
<START> one of <UNK> better attempts just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance it is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the <UNK> the main difference between <UNK> and <UNK> really is that the story from <UNK> wasn't the games strong point whereas <UNK> had a strong story and thus boll had more chance to mess it up br br the action in this movie is actually fairly good occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that br br acting wise it was pretty decent most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances but the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps br br while i think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference especially given the plot of the game was hardly oscar winning just a vehicle for <UNK> carnage would have liked it set in the jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but canada doesn't have a great deal of jungle and it is at least set in a kind of <UNK> br br why boll feels the need to change already <UNK> scripted and directed game plots i don't know but he does and until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder
<START> i'm not bothered by the sleazy <UNK> nor am i bothered by the cynical self righteous stance the makers of this crap take br br what i am bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake i wouldn't even be surprised if all of the episodes were staged hence this isn't a reality show but something far worse even than oprah garbage television with zero <UNK> zero appeal like daily tv soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot br br the premise would have turned out great if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer if only this idea were free of all the legal complications <UNK> that would most certainly ensue due to what would happen with real people and what is eventually aired hence the only way to create this reality show was to get some rather desperate actors and make them <UNK> and what pitiful and unconvincing <UNK> it is most of the time shouldn't this be obvious to anyone who finished grade school most reviews i read here don't even mention that any of this is fake let alone that all of it might be <UNK> thinking or just <UNK> <UNK> br br the actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of bottom of the barrel unemployed actors who are miserably waiting on tables waiting eagerly for a call from a talk show or this crap which is when they finally get a chance to make several hundred bucks i even recognized one actress in the role of <UNK> that i saw years earlier in the jerry springer show and i only saw 6 7 episodes of <UNK> how many more of these loser actors are there that appeared in springer and <UNK> that i don't even know about br br however to compare <UNK> with springer isn't fair to the latter the springer show is not all fake a bulk of the episodes are hence often highly entertaining there is no value to be found in <UNK> unless you're a struggling actor and want to get <UNK> on how not to act in front of the camera br br the producers use various very cheap transparent tricks to create the illusion of <UNK> to give their footage that <UNK> documentary feel but it's all in vein in the end the more intelligent train wreck seeking viewer is left with absolutely <UNK> professional wrestling has more credibility than this
<START> i too remember seeing this film as a <UNK> at a local small theater that presented foreign films each week it was the daring adventure of it all that stayed in my memory ever since br br especially <UNK> was the scene with <UNK> <UNK> as the old <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> too much saw or heard <UNK> and died of fright in a cave i always kept track of career even decades later due to my seeing him then there's also a <UNK> <UNK> cusack as the <UNK> james with designs on the lovely jean simmons shown as grown up br br would very much like to own a video of this haunting film and <UNK> my memory of it where do i send my request
<START> writer director dean bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film his dialogue was snappy and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the film's narrative structure br br at the heart of the film is the character of alice who is running away from her new england past in a desperate effort to get to florida along the way she travels with a pair of <UNK> bill and sandra who incredibly make the attempt to <UNK> alice as a prostitute <UNK> money at truck stops br br as a newcomer performing in her first screen role emily grace as alice is sensational there is not a false note in her character choices but the film is worth watching above all for the <UNK> yet sensitive character of sandra as masterfully created by <UNK> there is an especially sly subtext to virtually every moment in which is on camera as a viewer i found myself stopping the tape hitting <UNK> and reviewing her scenes in order to attempt to <UNK> the psychological subtleties br br the film raises the following question about the characters are bill and sandra good or are they an evil pair of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> upon the youthful alice one of the strengths of the film is that it never quite fully answers that question alice seems more self confident than she started out as a result of her experiences with bill and sandra but is she really a better person br br part comedy part road picture and part coming of age drama this carefully crafted film succeeds in involving us on many levels
<START> i watched this on sky tv late one night as i am a vampire fan i must admit i half expected it to be a b movie disaster but i was pleasantly wrong br br <UNK> is about a family of vampires when a vampire lord dies his two sons the handsome and noble <UNK> and his brother the evil hideous start a war with each other over their birth right the the is a holy grail of sorts for vampires and it <UNK> the blood of saints which give the vampire who drinks it an ultimate high br br the fight for the takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students turn up in the <UNK> territory on a school trip and <UNK> has to protect them from his brothers <UNK> br br like i said i went into this film not expecting much at all but it was one of the best low budget movies i have ever seen the sets and locations romania i think been a while since i've seen it are very nice and the music score did the film justice br br most of the acting was adequate but its <UNK> as the evil that steals the movie and all the subsequent sequels performance as the twisted <UNK> is truly breathtaking and <UNK> the film simply from okay to pretty d <UNK> good
<START> this is one of nine shorts on the anime <UNK> the <UNK> it is my favorite the artwork is amazing the black and white somewhat grainy <UNK> perfectly captures the mood that the segment is trying to portray the story is tight and the ending is true to film noir br br overall i gave the <UNK> a 7 but this particular segment deserves a 10
<START> the trailer is so <UNK> i thought this will be a good film what was the point in bringing the women in hong kong for being killed they could have done it in paris and the fist half hour br br you love me br br no i don't you love me br br no i don't you love me br br no i don't repeat for 100 times then well i don't love you so i shoot you d so here is the reason why movie <UNK> is a good thing imagine if i would have even give money for this torture i'm sorry for the time i lost watching it the film makers should pay me br br for the <UNK> worst film ever seen
<START> tv news producer jane craig hunter meets tom hurt an up and coming news <UNK> at a <UNK> and their mutual attraction takes them back to her room romance however is cut short when it emerges that tom is in his own words no good at what i'm being a success at and jane realises he <UNK> everything she hates about where tv news is going the rub comes when tom reveals he is about to join her news <UNK> in washington br br jane and <UNK> initial attraction is therefore given a second chance but will jane be able to put aside her professional opinion of the man she finds herself attracted to and should she aaron altman brooks is jane's highly intelligent reporter colleague and <UNK> despite his obvious talent <UNK> career is <UNK> as he lacks the confidence and people skills and the classic good looks to be the success that his new less <UNK> and less intelligent colleague tom is becoming he is also concerned that his good friend jane maybe falling in love with tom despite her better judgement as it becomes increasingly clear that aaron has his own romantic feelings for her br br this central romantic plot is set within the trials and <UNK> of a tv news network office where moral <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> with quickly and where appearances and dramatic effect are becoming more prevalent and important br br this is where most of the bite comes from with well observed comment and scenes one of many moments is a scene where tom meets the <UNK> top anchorman bill a cameo role for jack nicholson for the first time and the camera focuses on their <UNK> in a film full of great lines and dialogue long and short you realise a lot about these two men's character from this one quick shot of two hands br br the dialogue between characters is amongst the most intelligent and witty you are ever likely to find anywhere on film and in such abundance brooks gets the best portion of them in line with his character but even the <UNK> conversations that are incidental and perhaps over heard by one or more of the characters as they move through a crowded room should be listened to br br hunter is a tour de force in this role for which she was rightly and not alone nominated for an oscar and for which she probably would have got if it was for a role in a film that didn't mock part of what had become a closely related industry and against a strong performance from another actress in a more traditional feel good <UNK> com br br brooks is also excellent as the constantly frustrated and occasionally too smug for his own good aaron altman br br hurt whilst <UNK> the looks and providing the personality required of his character does not always convince that he is quite as dim witted the character says he is or is supposed to be he displays a <UNK> intelligence that <UNK> him to make the most of his apparent limitations which may be plausible but i don't think hurt quite pulls it off apart from when he tells us he stinks or doesn't get it hurt comes across as a bit smarter than that otherwise it is an effective performance in a role where his character is <UNK> by its intellectual limitations but brooks and hunter slightly <UNK> <UNK> performance it is the only negative thing i can say about the whole film and who is to say that anyone else would have done it better or come off any better when next to hunter and brooks and their performances in this movie br br support is <UNK> provided by amongst others robert lois <UNK> and joan cusack and there is also a bit part role for christian of subsequent boston legal fame and the <UNK> of bit parts for <UNK> brother john cusack whose face you don't even see br br james l brooks has provided us with many great tv shows and movies and this film should rank up there with the very best of them it may not have won any oscars despite seven nominations but it did win plenty of other awards and turned holly hunter into a star
<START> i saw this movie for the first time just a short while ago if you ask me it does not get the credit it deserves it is a little like american pie meets fast times at <UNK> high but with more depth it handles the same issues as both movies but in a way that holds with it some grain of truth the ending is sad but that is how life is i think everyone should see it i have it on dvd form and it took such a long time to find it too that should say something <UNK> and another thing i will add is that it is quite difficult finding the soundtrack i believe they stopped it but the soundtrack to this movie is amazing it has songs by artists like the <UNK> <UNK> the cars <UNK> and the sunshine band and many more
<START> the only reason i rented this movie was that val kilmer rarely stars in a bad movie there is of course a first time for everything in many ways this movie proves that <UNK> aren't as easy to make as we think especially by foreign directors the only one who got by with it was probably sergio <UNK> but even his movies lacked that something <UNK> to our american psyche and <UNK> american actors in clint eastwood and henry fonda did help i can see now why they changed the original title from summer love to dead man's bounty that itself tells me the producers and director didn't have any core understanding about a western other than those standard <UNK> up scenes and violent themes i suppose we can say the same about american directors attempting to make a polish movie while failing miserably in the process
<START> in crystal city a group of <UNK> hire the horse <UNK> travis ben johnson and sandy harry carey jr as <UNK> masters to lead their <UNK> to san juan river along the journey they meet first the broken <UNK> without water of the <UNK> dr a hall alan <UNK> and the prostitutes denver <UNK> <UNK> and ruth <UNK> then the sadistic <UNK> <UNK> boys decide to join the mormon <UNK> to disguise the <UNK> <UNK> by the sheriff of crystal city that is chasing them when the <UNK> cross their path they are invited to visit their hamlet for a dancing party when the <UNK> train is near to their destination the <UNK> boys <UNK> the <UNK> forcing sandy and travis to take an attitude br br <UNK> master is another great western of john ford the sequences with the <UNK> train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive the adventure of the group of <UNK> is funny and very entertaining and the songs fit well to the plot despite being dated my vote is eight br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK>
<START> i will not even make any more comments about this movie instead i will make a recommendation for all you euro horror fans if you want to see an enjoyable low budget vampire flick check out <UNK> 1998 it has everything razor blade smile lacks acting nice locations terrific score and less <UNK> vampires
<START> everything about this movie is bad everything ridiculous 80's <UNK> ridiculous <UNK> ridiculous action and fight scenes where you can actually see that the <UNK> do not even hit each other bad bad bad 80's music repeated scenes of people running through woods a bad guy with a silver plastic hand and silly hair stupid dialogue the acting is everything looks extremely cheap this movie even surpasses plan 9 from outer space in its utter badness br br it's not funny bad it's just bad
<START> this spaghetti western uses three american lead actors which takes away a little of the typical spaghetti aura the plot is about an <UNK> that the <UNK> of new mexico gives to all willing criminals to provide them a chance to start a new life usually this kind of opportunity is limited to past events but in this film it seems more like a <UNK> to kill because even new crimes like e g threatening the <UNK> are forgiven the story is an endless chain of killings where nearly every character has only the purpose to deliver more <UNK> only the few leads have <UNK> clay <UNK> is haunted by nightmares related to a childhood event where <UNK> he killed a lot of people in the middle of the <UNK> mayhem this kind of <UNK> lack credibility compared with similar films like e g none of the characters in this film was likable for me br br apart of the weak content which targets certain customers this film is well shot sets are somewhat detailed and the acting is average br br 4 10
<START> george and mildred is a truly unfunny film this attempt to translate the successful tv series to the big screen was a dismal failure as is so often the case br br the wit and clever one liners from the tv shows have gone missing the plot is a typical english farce of confused characters and mistaken identities which is neither funny enough nor weird enough to <UNK> many decent laughs br br die hard george and mildred fans might want to see this final episode of the <UNK> <UNK> mildred died of <UNK> before the film was released but others should <UNK> their time more wisely
<START> i'll say one thing for herman usa it will probably always play well to <UNK> audiences i can't imagine that there's another place in the world where a reference to the fast life of or a line like i knew there was something wrong with <UNK> guys would bring down the house i actually quite enjoyed the first hour or so basically a bunch of lonely country boys take out a <UNK> ad and find their town <UNK> with willing female <UNK> is <UNK> a gender specific word it ain't <UNK> to be sure but it's sorta charming in its own right pity that the filmmakers felt the need to <UNK> on a contrived subplot about a conniving <UNK> and her violent husband overall it's just too <UNK> for its own good but you've got to give some props to a film with the guts to give a guy with kevin build a nude love scene i will always applaud the depiction of people who don't meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual caring human beings but that's not enough to redeem herman usa to <UNK> <UNK> it's nostalgia for an age that never existed
<START> this film was released in the uk under the name blood <UNK> it was banned outright and never <UNK> again for release br br as the ghastly ones it was supposedly a hit with the horror hungry <UNK> of new york city's famed <UNK> street <UNK> circuit if you are looking for some bloody horror then you will find it in this film br br unfortunately to see the disabled colin hal <UNK> down on a live rabbit you have to put up with shaky <UNK> camera work that makes ed wood look positively marvelous br br three sisters are to spend three days in the family <UNK> with their husbands before the old man's money is naturally in such a situation people start dropping dead family secrets are exposed and lots of blood is <UNK> especially during a gruesome <UNK> br br maybe it was the bunny bit that the brits <UNK> to i know i did
<START> while not truly terrible this movie is still largely a waste of time and paints an incredibly inaccurate and <UNK> picture of beach boys history br br basically this movie would have you believe that mike love was the brains behind the band and brian wilson was just a pathetic psycho in fact none of the characters is developed beyond a one dimensional parody but this is a tv movie so what do you expect mike <UNK> foul <UNK> is all over this turkey as he attempts to re write history with himself in the role of band <UNK> and resident genius yeah as if br br on the plus side the music is excellent unlike the previous beach boys made for tv bio <UNK> summer dreams this movie actually features real beach boys music rather than <UNK> cover versions also it features a surprising number of beach boys related <UNK> and seldom heard tracks the i live for the sun being but one example br br this movie was originally shown in two parts on american network tv part one is the superior of the two and documents the boys early days and rise to the top by the time part two rolls around the brian wilson character has become a mere cartoon and the actor seems to be playing for laughs but how could anyone take this crap seriously if you're not a beach boys fan you probably won't get much out of this movie except an extremely <UNK> and one sided view of the <UNK> history but then again why would you watch this if you weren't a fan
<START> masters horror sounds like is set in seattle where larry <UNK> works as the manager of a computer <UNK> call center having lost his 6 year old son michael nicholas <UNK> to a rare heart condition he finds that he has ultra sensitive hearing larry hears everything in ten <UNK> from people <UNK> on computer <UNK> people <UNK> across the room people <UNK> their foot on the floor dripping <UNK> eventually even people breathing become unbearable for larry as he is constantly <UNK> with mind <UNK> noise eventually larry decides he's had enough if he can't stop the noises themselves then maybe he can stop himself hearing them with the help of a large meat clever br br this canadian american co production was episode 4 from season 2 of the generally hit and miss masters of horror tv series written directed by brad anderson i thought sounds like was a definite miss the script was based on a short story by mike i am genuinely surprised by the amount of very positive comments it has here on the imdb at the present time for a start i would be very hard pressed to even describe this as a horror film it feels more like some bizarre sentimental drama until the last 5 minutes when howard <UNK> gregory <UNK> the boys at <UNK> effects actually get to do some work larry has this strange unexplained ability to <UNK> sound noises from the start so this episode ends up like <UNK> minutes of exactly the same sort of repetitive build up which leads up to a gory ending although it comes to late to save the episode this is pretty slow going while it's well written isn't this meant to be horror themed i'm slightly confused as to who this is meant to appeal to br br director anderson does ok but he just keeps repeating the same things over over again until the last 5 minutes there isn't a single drop of blood in the entire thing there's no horror there's no scares or tension absolutely no atmosphere br br technically this is very well made has good production values doesn't look like a cheap made for tv program the acting is very good actually it's shame the story is somewhat limited br br sounds like is one of the very worst masters of horror episodes a lot of people seem to like it that's fine but it's definitely not for me another masters of horror another disappointment
<START> give h g lewis points he managed to <UNK> <UNK> exotic dancers <UNK> of his notorious fake blood and <UNK> <UNK> all in one movie the gore gore girls was <UNK> horror film <UNK> song and ends with a head being <UNK> by an <UNK> oh <UNK> plays a <UNK> night club owner whose girls are falling prey to <UNK> standard <UNK>
<START> i'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of <UNK> <UNK> i've seen only 4 films so far and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions not a single non lonely female character out of 12 and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings br br this film is probably the only one out of four where this impact is for good br br the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for films so it doesn't grab the accent although the looks of the characters might watch for the feelings not for their objects br br very nice and fleeting truly like a summer romance and while being a <UNK> to thought and mind it gives some food for the soul
<START> the acting was bad and the plot well i don't think there was one br br some fat blonde <UNK> who is always dressed in a dinner suit kidnaps a sort from a nightclub i think he then kills a <UNK> pointless fights then happen kidnapped girl is put in cage on a boat why tough <UNK> martial arts trained cop turns up speaks bad english and does stuff that does not make sense its utter tripe but he does have a nice car christ on a bike this film was a waste of 90 minutes
<START> sam lion jean paul <UNK> discovers he needs to take some time off as everybody around him relies to much on him and stages his own death when he discovers those he loved <UNK> still loves are in need he gets albert <UNK> richard to help them in search of his own past of his own desires this fabulous film by claude <UNK> is a man's quest for himself at a <UNK> age br br built like all <UNK> films the film's beginning with constant flashbacks may be puzzling especially scenes where paul <UNK> who looks a huge lot like his father is playing a young sam lion while sam lion stands in the same room a flashback sequence which takes a second to grasp br br one of <UNK> most elaborate works <UNK> <UNK> gate is a must see tale of self <UNK>
<START> god that sucked you can't end a horror movie with a happily ever after family setting i was kind of <UNK> going in to the final act but my god he didn't have to kill the girl she didn't die the ghost father appears with a cure which makes no sense because his spirit would have been <UNK> after the <UNK> kid killed all the bad werewolves what a hunk of junk this is the worst horror movie i've seen in a long time and i've watched a lot of horror movies this is a slap in the face for <UNK> and everyone else involved in american werewolf in london i hope that this ruined the career of every one in it bar julie <UNK> and cgi kind of new and <UNK> back in 1997 but today it just looks drab compared to the <UNK> <UNK> makeup work of london anyway i'm done i hope i've scared a few people of get the original instead or failing that the howling or failing that watch american idol reruns just don't watch this mess
<START> this film did a wonderful job of capturing nyc stereotypes at there best if you want a simple cute story however you won't find it here the related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close <UNK> yet <UNK> anonymous lifestyle that is manhattan a perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at new york life in its most natural state
<START> what a cast of actors and actresses in this columbo episode beside peter falk you have julie <UNK> <UNK> nolan martin <UNK> as twins anyway the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the <UNK> discovered by his fiancé julie <UNK> who plays the role so deliciously <UNK> nolan plays the other woman of the house the <UNK> who <UNK> herself on her talents and <UNK> <UNK> sloppy and often typical behavior with his <UNK> martin <UNK> plays identical twins in this one each who <UNK> the other of murdering their uncle for money well you'll just have to watch and see the outcome but i can assure you that it's always worth watching this one for the cast and the crew
<START> history and experience over the past couple of decades has shown us that <UNK> talking about sex is about the and thing anyone can do but this wasn't quite as obvious back in 1986 basically the idea in this film is that these characters <UNK> drive to find comfort security and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the <UNK> motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves which they hide from themselves with more sex this drive is linked to the decline of the american empire as expressed in an early interview within the movie br br so the idea is that relatively <UNK> people talk about sex and that that talk is supposed to reveal how <UNK> they are as people <UNK> at least keeps giving it drive and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera such as <UNK> most of the characters in single frames revealing their ultimate loneliness and cutting rapidly between them showing how they are more at war with each other than they are at <UNK> and to give <UNK> credit this is pretty much what intellectual life is a constant struggle with other <UNK> to stand out even when everyone knows that standing out means standing alone br br but yeah the characters and action are <UNK> and kind of pathetic i think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is something meant to last which makes it kind of dated it's also the exact type of mental <UNK> in dialog and references to people like susan that makes art house films so <UNK> around the <UNK> entertainment <UNK> in all i'll take it anyway it has its place basically among the exact type of people the characters are it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't those characters br br <UNK>
<START> this is probably the best movie from director hector it shows a brazilian reality unknown by <UNK> which is the same reality that <UNK> all of the latin american countries poverty and a survival instinct the most affected in this reality is the children usually left <UNK> or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a dog eat dog society many times falling into the gap of <UNK> prostitution and crime very well acted and with a no <UNK> approach this movie will get to you great story plot a must have movie on <UNK> collection the starring role went to <UNK> <UNK> da <UNK> a young boy who fell into the crime wave killed some years later during a robbery i would suggest people to watch the movie who killed <UNK> so you can have a more in depth idea of the lives of these characters some other characters from the movie had a similar fate some died and others are in jail none the less this movie will last for a long time in your memory
<START> well acted drama based on a novel by arthur miller something as simple as a pair of glasses becomes life <UNK> lawrence newman william h macy is a man that has chosen to be satisfied with his mundane life the same job for twenty years and still living with his mother he is told by his boss to correct his vision with a pair of glasses <UNK> life drastically changes and <UNK> him into hell the glasses he chose makes him look jewish he <UNK> his job and becomes the object of heavy <UNK> by his brooklyn neighborhood searching for a job he encounters the attractive and <UNK> <UNK> laura dern herself living with conflict because of her jewish appearance soon the <UNK> new life together becomes a nightmare filled with <UNK> and <UNK> driven attacks a very apt cast that features joseph <UNK> peter kay <UNK> and of musical fame meat <UNK>
<START> definitely a must see for all fans of film noir br br thanks to a fine script and crisp razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well <UNK> clock to produce a <UNK> psychological thriller br br wonderful characterizations <UNK> the movie's powerful message of racial and religious tolerance it's difficult and almost <UNK> to single out any one particular performance because there isn't a weak link in the entire company but robert ryan as the hateful and violent white <UNK> is truly spine chilling br br making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage now all these years later at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language bare breasts crummy acting and <UNK> <UNK> it's refreshing to get back to the <UNK> of quality film making with a viewing treat like <UNK> br br another low budget gem from the hollywood <UNK>
<START> br br this movie really has nothing going for it with the <UNK> played by phillip seymour hoffman complaining about his <UNK> and other toilet humor in a 2 5 hour movie you know that they made no cuts at all and left the crap in literally it's a waste of good talent and a total embarrassment dreadful br br
<START> after a decade of <UNK> <UNK> american movies began to switch <UNK> and turn their cameras away from war torn <UNK> political corruption and general social <UNK> to the more intimate world of family <UNK> the <UNK> the selfish baby <UNK> began to take on the american family as they grew up and had kids of their own was making itself felt br br kramer vs kramer is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would continue to be so popular throughout the 1980s and it's one of the best it gets a rather bum rap now because it's known as the film that beat apocalypse now for the 1979 best picture academy award but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a <UNK> chicken breast they're not remotely the same but can't we enjoy them both director writer robert <UNK> doesn't try to do anything fancy with his movie its strength lies in its performances those of dustin hoffman and meryl streep particularly playing a divorced couple fighting <UNK> and <UNK> over their son the courtroom scene in which they duke it out for custody and in which each is forced to hurt the other in terrible ways is devastating and feels authentic the movie doesn't present <UNK> solid dad as a hero or <UNK> <UNK> mom as a villain they're neither good or bad as people they're simply bad at being married br br the film is tear jerky at the finale but not in a manipulative way it earns its right to <UNK> <UNK> br br grade a
<START> the first thing you see in this film is a static angle one which will be repeated later in the film depicting the chaos going on unseen to the audience in a studio that <UNK> news soon after <UNK> character's typical story is shown in that same angle don't let this <UNK> you the film is not about a female reporter a woman struggling to succeed in a male dominated profession that is merely a lead in a way of starting the film though it's used later the actual point to this production is revealed gradually and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene early on the entire film has that pace not slow or drawn out but deliberate it's never really fast even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be so this pacing especially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed as the disturbing unsettling nature of the film is <UNK> is strong almost painful to the viewer it <UNK> you to if it had been possible jump into the screen grab the people responsible by the collar and yell at them to do something about it to <UNK> the situation never once did i feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment the subject is extremely important to be aware of and it's handled perfectly here no over <UNK> well very little anyway just an accurate presentation of the issue the direction is astounding the empathy felt for <UNK> character is profound the editing is masterful one scene near the very end illustrates that perfectly the editor judging from his filmography is vastly underrated the writing was excellent the acting was great in particular by lemmon fonda and douglas who also produced it the lack of a score is perfect no music is needed to enhance the ending is sublime and effective the movie does have a few negative points among them some of the dialog is obviously and undeniably mainly exposition one particular part of the film whilst dramatic doesn't seem to <UNK> with something that follows it not everyone will watch the film because of two features of it which are <UNK> and rightfully so attributed to bad movies the pacing which can be mistaken as being slow and the lack of score one could argue that to be a negative thing as everyone ought to consider the points it presents but maybe it's better this way handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respect for the topic as well as the viewer something like this maybe it shouldn't be <UNK> fed i was <UNK> with the film and left very taken <UNK> i recommend this to anyone who believe themselves strong enough to handle it 9 10
<START> there are a <UNK> few cartoon films where animals or something not human is portraying human beings and i think that this film is one of them apart from a few points of the plot and the characters this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals although it's good someone did not i feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans br br this film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues which is rather odd for a disney film it mentions alcohol shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack humans and it shows a male cat called abraham thomas <UNK> <UNK> a female cat in a surprisingly human and adult way br br as a cartoon film or just a film in general i feel this is pretty good quality the storyline and characters are especially good the film in general is set in france and you meet a family of cats the mother <UNK> and her <UNK> marie <UNK> and you also meet the kind rich old woman who <UNK> the cats the butler edgar and an old man who has clearly lost his <UNK> called george the kind old woman <UNK> her will with george and edgar <UNK> that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it he is incredibly cross with this and has an evil scheme in mind br br a very cute film for every age enjoy <UNK> br br not including basil the great mouse detective and a few others maybe which i cannot think of at the moment
<START> the atmosphere in this show is great there's plenty of excellent <UNK> but thats where this show fails there's way to much build up for nothing you will constantly see a creepy set up that makes it feel likes something really freaky is coming right out of the corner and then nothing over and over again nothing you hear plenty of stories of people talking about freaky events but you see none they show up at these peoples doors talk about their deep and emotional <UNK> set up lame equipment and find nothing there is nothing on this show thats leads me to believe in anything <UNK> i laugh every time they need to exercise a horrible spirit that we as an audience have seen nothing of they get rid of the spirit that never was and everything is put in a neat little package a show that looked so freaky and had such great potential leads up to one thing nothing
<START> could contain spoilers read only after seeing last episode season 2 think about it the guys on the north pole center of the earth looking for <UNK> <UNK> behavior they also said something about did we miss it again so there was another <UNK> of course that was when the plain crashed i think this whole island is a setup set up by her daddy she found out about it and is looking for her <UNK> how else can she know what to look for br br so basically it's an island in a <UNK> shield all of it is fake all the signs are there fake <UNK> fake doors fake medicine fake observations stations with fake air <UNK> that lead to nothing it's a project indeed and because of the final scene in the season 2 finale i know it has to do something with <UNK> his chick and her dad and probably <UNK> she's weird maybe she actually has something to do with the plane crashing ok now i'm <UNK> off br br also in this episode henry <UNK> tells michael to go to some <UNK> and he'll find rescue their this is probably some sort of door in the <UNK> shield once you're gone there is no way back br br i think it's pretty obvious despite of the numerous questions i still have and hope to get answers for in the next season if you think back on what we've learned in season 1 and 2 i'm sure we'll get loads of answers in season 3 br br can't wait br br can anyone agree on this theory hope to hear from you
<START> this is a very dull film with poorly developed characters subplots that go nowhere and barely tolerable acting it comes across as a poorly conceived rip off of 2001 br br the only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects but even that wasn't enough to keep me from <UNK> off i would like to get the soundtrack especially the music during the space flight sequence for nights when i have trouble falling asleep
<START> i actually saw the movie before i read the book when i saw the movie i was upset because i wondered why dean <UNK> had made such a bad book movie the movie was confusing and didn't have a flow at all it was choppy and made me want to throw a rock at the tv i couldn't connect with the characters at all so i didn't care about what happened to them normally i love the characters because i can relate to their personality or problems then i read the book and loved it i often re read the book and the movie is collecting dust i wish someone would make a <UNK> movie that follows the plot of his books then the movies wouldn't suck so much do not watch this movie unless you need to waste money
<START> was unlucky enough to see this while travelling by coach across africa it was far and away the worst film i have ever come across deserves to be the 1 all time worst no acting no plot very little speaking lots of ape like <UNK> though in this hopelessly unlikely film an <UNK> self satire you'll either laugh at it or cry
<START> for all its wonderful images for all of its good intentions this just comes off as yet another <UNK> one sided over <UNK> self promoting propaganda br br the message is simple all japanese fighting on the track were sadistic <UNK> f sticks who enjoyed <UNK> every last aussie <UNK> cutting their throats before <UNK> them not only does pick up on <UNK> 's only flaw that the enemy are <UNK> <UNK> and apparently <UNK> but manages to prove quite the opposite to <UNK> masterpiece instead of giving us a perfect film with one flaw we have a horrible mess with one redeeming feature br br let's start off with this we're without any comfortable adapting to the characters introduced to these apparently quite laid back two dimensional people who we never ever get to sympathize with we're kept at such a distance that even when we could so easily relate to the characters they find a way to keep us away that alone is a sickening feature as it drives us from the very plot helps the horrible pacing to leave us with a lasting impression and makes it so much easier to see the contrast between an overtly sentimental ending and an otherwise lackluster body of a film br br in other words it drags us through a painful journey not just for us but apparently for them and just as it should end we're thrown into another eye roller of a <UNK> that ends faster than it began so for the as yet still <UNK> when it should end it starts up again only to end when we expect more s it's just a confusing and <UNK> pace br br which brings me to the ultimatum this is meant to <UNK> us on the events of the track it doesn't come close not only does it detail a very small insignificant part of the campaign <UNK> a little on top in an attempt to make it relevant but it succeeds in doing the one thing a film as important as this should be does it makes us not care br br honestly my eyes were constantly glued to my watch the entire time the audience around me all proudly australian <UNK> as they came in about how great the film is going to be <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in disappointment as every one of the painful ninety five minutes <UNK> on for a short running time it felt like apocalypse now difference being that apocalypse now was a good film and deserved the three hours it got and on to the point where suicide could <UNK> be an alternative should it be mandatory for this film to be watched br br though considering how much the tv has been advertising this trash i'd say it is mandatory in a <UNK> sense of the word br br watch if you like pretty images though you'd do better watching the constant <UNK> or <UNK> anyway since they have superior cinematography and actual plots br br overall
<START> i loved this show i used to actually leave the pub ten minutes before closing and run down the road to catch it i remember daniel sketch about gandhi in the as a masterpiece the set design and lighting were out of this world creating an atmosphere that you felt you were actually living in v unusual for a comedy br br unfortunately i have only encountered one other person apart from the other reviewer here who ever knew that this programme existed in fact i have to thank the imdb for coming into existence and proving to me that i hadn't in fact imagined the whole series in a drunken <UNK> which i was seriously starting to believe
<START> oh my god i am lost now i know everything this guy does is pointless r j a wrote at august 13th 2006 <UNK> no what an awful experience it looked like a bunch of 3rd <UNK> stole a video camera borrowed some old editing <UNK> from 1995 and played a joke on each other trash wrote at august 1st 2006 <UNK> no <UNK> this movie is a piece of it sucks calling this a movie would be misleading this was a group of friends having a good time and <UNK> one another the storyline was very hard to follow the attempted artistic camera angles <UNK> from the story and in to themselves made the entire time a <UNK> experience the acting although comical was very amateurish the concept is ok i guess perhaps next time the producers should raise some capital and hire actual professionals and try again i must say that i'm sick and tired of so many thinking that making a good movie is easy it is not easy this fact seems to be lost or ignored by many that believe that without any training experience and talent that they can make a good product i guess in the end they will learn just how difficult it is i am so disgusted i have no comment wrote at august <UNK> 2006 <UNK> no
<START> i love this movie br br yes the main character lies but that's why it's called big fat liar even though this kid runs away to hollywood it doesn't give kids the idea that they can besides he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything he does it to regain trust br br i don't think it was just one big ad for universal studios because i liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie making is br br it has good music and fun characters this family comedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike it has humour excitement and real life difficulties like lying br br in the end big fat liar sends out a moral don't expect lying to be easy
<START> i'm not going to <UNK> on about it but i'm just going to make it brief basically for those who don't know how actually died the first time round the demonic assassin comes hit <UNK> and with an energy ball they fly through the wall blood everywhere <UNK> the third sister comes down the stairs says the spell which send him away but not <UNK> needs the power of three leo comes <UNK> them both and so on they get exposed along the line and the only way the can be saved is for a demon named to turn back time the only way he can do that is is <UNK> stays in the underworld she agrees turns back time it now around 7 00 in the morning again demon comes <UNK> and with energy ball they fly through wall again but this time <UNK> isn't there to say the spell to <UNK> demon off demon kills doctor doctor flies through window he is dead demon goes in a <UNK> wing type thing and glass on the doors <UNK> which is a great effect bye the way and there is and <UNK> sound thats where it ends now what the whole world doesn't know if they didn't pay attention to the next episode although what i'm about to say wasn't shown its what happens trust me because this time there was no <UNK> to call for leo this time he arrives later <UNK> survives because her <UNK> <UNK> as fatal as and leo <UNK> her first before so by that time is already dead there mystery solved ps calling for with a spell should have worked and she should have made a surprise appearance in the last ever episode ok i did <UNK> on
<START> i have never really been interested in cannibal movies before and up until a couple of months ago i had avoided this genre of movie br br i recently had to <UNK> <UNK> surgery and found i had a lot of time on my hands as i was unable to work so i decided after seeing almost every horror movie our local video shop had to offer i would take a chance on this br br christ was it a mistake i have never seen a movie this bad in all my years of being a movie addict this is just a pile of s t <UNK> to a d v d disc and sold as a horror movie br br i have a lot of respect to other horror fans who can switch their brains off long enough to enjoy this crap they are more brain dead than i ever will be and that is some achievement 0 10 and thats generous
<START> when the first trailer for this film was viewed by myself i was curious as to what angle the storyline would take after all the plot of having one's childhood self return to the present leaves open many <UNK> bruce willis however does a superb job in the role he was given i was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part this is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it i now agree this film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be and coming to the realization that you aren't the adult you planned to be this is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think usually we <UNK> at what if movies for example <UNK> attempted to answer the question what if the world were to be covered with water and but <UNK> nobody cared this movie however effects everyone in the theatre true young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams <UNK> away but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children this movie is definitely worth seeing although it will be better the second time around because you won't be thinking so much about how the kid got there and why and all that stuff just relax and have fun and take something with you when you leave that cinema take that piece of your childhood you've forgotten and enjoy it
<START> i've only seen about a half dozen films starring <UNK> <UNK> but this one seems very much like the others he plays a <UNK> criminal one who is short on words and subdued yet occasionally explosive given his quiet persona in such films as army of shadows and second breath i've noticed that his <UNK> style of acting is extremely effective in other words because he is so quiet and mannered when he does bad things you tend to notice and like these other films he also has a very strong though twisted moral code br br <UNK> <UNK> and his partner are both living in italy and are career criminals both grew up in france and eventually had to flea due to their criminal activities now in italy as the film begins they continue to live the life of thugs and the heat is on to catch them oddly instead of running to yet a third country they decide to go back to france even though has been tried and convicted in and if he's caught it could mean a life in prison or the death penalty much of the first third of the film concerns their <UNK> return br br unfortunately for the return doesn't go perfectly and now it seems as if every cop in france is looking for him additionally the reaction of his old <UNK> in crime is not at all what he'd expect in fact their tepid response to his return ends up <UNK> a series of terrible events towards the end of the film br br along the way meets and is taken in my a stranger eric stark jean paul <UNK> despite seemingly having no friends stark and his lady friend try their best to make his return successful what throws another monkey <UNK> into this though is two very young sons what is to do with them keep them with him in his hiding place br br overall this is a very good crime film sort of like french film noir unlike american noir the many french versions i have seen have a more realistic as well as bleak <UNK> to them <UNK> <UNK> supreme that's for sure the acting is first rate especially from <UNK> and <UNK> the direction very sure and the writing very nice though i am sure many won't like the ending it just seems to be tacked on like an <UNK> i understood why they did it this way but can also see how it might leave many <UNK> as for me it did leave me a tad flat otherwise an exceptional film
<START> this film brought back a lot of good memories and really works to give a good buzz there was no pc message and the film is all about having a good time which is all there really is to it when people go out <UNK>
<START> terribly disappointed with city of men after being swept away by city of god lost is the exciting and unpredictable storyline and instead in its place is bland predictability with the obvious attempts at audience manipulation by a superficial pretentious production and distribution team this story ended up feeling like a sappy soap opera rather than a gritty indie feature which is what is should have been this is what happens when <UNK> try to seek a wider audience ridiculous sweeping shots of the <UNK> <UNK> etc at the expense of a gripping story and characters i really couldn't care what happened to any of the characters in this film they were all so 2 dimensional in short sad waste of potential that should have been a slam <UNK> following the exceptionally inspired city of god boo
<START> skilled professionals live it up in an exotic and dangerous location they get drunk every night they <UNK> <UNK> they drop pigs in they fly under <UNK> <UNK> conditions they dress weird and act <UNK> they're <UNK> outrageous they <UNK> every rule of command and have contempt for their <UNK> at the cia they're <UNK> br br nope it's not only angels have wings and it's not m a s h it's an uneasy mixture of the two that unfortunately comes across as more silly than funny br br it aims at shock amusement and education but doesn't really achieve its goals br br as far as its shock value is concerned well we're by now aren't we does it really shock anyone that a bunch of hard living pilots flew secret missions in in the 1970s no it's not shocking it's not even educational now under our current circumstances when it would be interesting to learn that some <UNK> <UNK> was not buried in a file labeled national interest defense de that's okay so we've been <UNK> up a little and are no longer neither so nor so dumb br br the problem in this case is that the film depends on those very qualities for its power to <UNK> without that the film <UNK> a group of shaggy drunken cia pilots are sitting around in a cat house the girls shooting out the lights with a <UNK> pistol killing <UNK> with same asks <UNK> pilot robert downey jr when you guys act like this does it mean there's something to celebrate replies another <UNK> no it means it's night time that might be funny if we expected <UNK> pilots to be as <UNK> as the rest of us if we don't the gag like the movie falls flat br br there are action scenes naturally everything that can possibly happen in or to an airplane in flight happens in or to an airplane in flight people fall out of them <UNK> is thrown <UNK> out of their <UNK> <UNK> fail they sustain damage from <UNK> the are torn apart during crash <UNK> but we've seen most of this elsewhere often done better br br some might find this funnier than i did and the acting is pretty good robert downey jr is especially effective as the straight man check out the other comments and if they describe a film that you might find appealing then by all means watch it there might be some laughs in it that escaped me
<START> i'm sorry but i cannot understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought ethan <UNK> was i have seen better acting character and plot development in <UNK> warning i am going to give away a key element to the plot after holding his family hostage overnight ethan lets his vile evil hated step mom go to the bank alone to retrieve the piece of his late mom's <UNK> which he so desperately wants guess what she calls the cops wow what a twist i couldn't see that coming at all br br the only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes br br pure <UNK> rubbish
<START> to have to actually own up to making such a horrible movie actually i'm more embarrassed that i sat through the whole thing it looks like an old 80's sci fi movie complete with super fake looking special effects <UNK> imagery and very cheesy dialogue maybe that's the way they wanted it to look maybe they think it's cool to do movies in 80's fashion like it will come back in style who knows br br if you think the promised eye candy will save the film you're in for a disappointment the so called babes are <UNK> and downright ugly they can't act at all i don't understand why they couldn't at least get good looking chicks if they want babes with no talent but i guess when you're making a film this stupid you don't get very good choices hot chicks aren't just <UNK> up to do this kind of pitiful crap
<START> the story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place he started out as an officer in <UNK> army fighting in egypt but became separated from his unit after nearly starving and or dying of <UNK> he came upon a <UNK> which somehow became his <UNK> buddy it brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so <UNK> was his bonding with the animal all things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the <UNK> a very strange film well written and portrayed beautiful scenery from jordan and <UNK> which didn't always blend perfectly but who cares
<START> the <UNK> hammer is a clever idea wasted as the execution is weak as if often the case with <UNK> humor it relies overly on outrage to generate laughs which simply isn't enough poor taste humor has two elements poor taste and humor and both are needed here but the humor is pretty <UNK> as a result it is often painful to watch all the more so because of good attempts on the part of the performers particularly adam goldberg as the himself the <UNK> references are funny though but only to those who know those movies and they certainly don't carry the <UNK> hammer br br another problem is that many of the jokes rely on knowledge of american jewish culture and many in the audience will simply not understand the jokes
<START> i would like to know who <UNK> the producers of this movie to pay for its production that is a genius of sorts this movie somehow held my attention for about two thirds of it until i realized that it was going nowhere fast i think the music managed to make it seem like something was going on but nothing really was it was not scary the dialog was poorly written the first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes this would have been a moderately acceptable twilight zone or outer limits episode br br at this point i'm just mad that i wasted all that time that's a couple hours that i will never get back br br i hope these comments save someone from wasting their evening take a <UNK> or hit the gym instead or if you want to be scared turn on a cable news channel
<START> a pretentious but to varying degrees watchable collection of mostly pointless stories br br but let's start from the top br br if one ever wondered what <UNK> love romance was like perhaps this dull little <UNK> is some indication subdued feelings non emotions <UNK> faces and a very depressing <UNK> of moving from <UNK> to <UNK> i guess the sequel to this story will be for our honeymoon we move from <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> obviously had no clue what to write for this little movie so he just made up some half <UNK> non story <UNK> around a band he particularly likes or maybe they're his friends because we get to watch them and listen to their music more than the two principal characters br br first off i've never heard of this guy before  and now i know why nice black white photography and pretty much nothing else unless being bored silly can be considered an asset but you'd be surprised how many movie critics and film students love boredom in movies so i <UNK> recommend 10 minute <UNK> fest to those two groups of <UNK> br br <UNK> not a movie but probably a slice out of his documentaries about <UNK> in south america this isn't a short film but a report but considering how dull the first two entries were <UNK> bit is almost refreshing and does have some interesting moments and if nothing else fits into the movie's pretentious time concept very neatly br br <UNK> as was to be almost expected this once interesting film maker with the brain of a <UNK> a talented idiot <UNK> serves us yet another <UNK> of <UNK> he has become lazy and can't be bothered to write anything interesting either for his own movies or a collection such as the only bright side in watching how a dumb <UNK> actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the lovely chloe <UNK> otherwise skip this nonsense oh and btw i don't believe that any young actress <UNK> to classical music was <UNK> trying to be surreal by making chloe listen to that kind of music does lindsey <UNK> perhaps listen to opera maybe drew barrymore is a jazz fan who am i to say they aren't br br jim <UNK> is a moron oh right i already mentioned that br br <UNK> here is the actual shock of the whole movie <UNK> can actually make something good everything else i've seen from this overrated <UNK> has so far been dull and pointless however this short little story is done with style  <UNK> and is the best part of the movie it leaves one wanting to see more of it even though the story has a resolution br br spike lee oh dear what can i say here lee makes anyone seem talented by comparison like <UNK> he chooses not a story but <UNK> a report  and a left wing political propaganda report at that <UNK> but in black and white and one sided of course naturally we robbed the retarded title of this little sleep is about how the poor <UNK> and infinitely idealistic <UNK> robbed by bush and his evil evil team of thieves this is by far the dumbest and <UNK> entry in this movie and i had to <UNK> the fast forward button so as not to <UNK> off spike lee truly is a product of <UNK> action god knows how many really talented black directors never had a chance to make movies because this pretentious and talentless little <UNK> keeps getting opportunity after opportunity to make them and he gets it wrong every time now that does take some kind of talent right br br <UNK> the chinese story has a solid premise it's okay nothing more br br all in all there are many and far better movies to spend your time on but if your time isn't that valuable as is apparently the case with my own you can check this little film out br br ten minutes sure can be an eternity in the hands of anti masters of cinema time is precious waste it on better movies
<START> this movie really starts strong we know that roberts is an <UNK> <UNK> sent to australia to fix marketing problems we also know he is an eccentric genius <UNK> fine acting convinces us of this rather quickly br br unfortunately the plot is so flimsy that whatever fine character development has been achieved it is by <UNK> inconsistencies and downright boring film sequences br br usually i am a sucker for bold and far out plots examples which i am fond of include dark star o c <UNK> and <UNK> coupled with the fact that i must admit that this film was well acted it surprises even myself that i cannot recommend this film br br the utter breakdown in this movie occurs about <UNK> through the film all comedy is instantly lost and the film turns dark afterwards the film <UNK> along the film's attempt to get the comedy rolling again is not successful more surprises <UNK> the viewer and they are darker still br br to be sure mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success however with this movie the result is about as successful as new coke
<START> i wanted to watch this to get a inside look at the show it told the story more of robin williams then <UNK> <UNK> still thought it was great we got to see robin always being <UNK> no matter what the performance of was awesome br br the <UNK> of the main players seem so real to me <UNK> as <UNK> marshall was wonderful he was so charming in this which helped me get through all the williams energy the little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows happy days and <UNK> shirley was <UNK> i also thought <UNK> <UNK> harvey was also a nice rock in the pond this is a good thing br br this movie told the age old story of hollywood folks going through the ups and downs of stardom it kept me glued to my tv and i learned to love robin well hell mostly everybody seem to be the super people i sometimes think hollywood is go figure br br i sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots we never saw the head of abc just heard him like charlie from charlie angels i wonder if this way <UNK> it seems so sad that a show at number 1 could be so destroy by their own network br br i think this story could be told about anyone's life as they climb the ladder of any job movie and tv stars are always loved or hated by so many people that you grew up with you just want to reach back in their past to remember your own past i remember watching the show and always wondering what does happen in their personal lives br br <UNK> and <UNK> will always be part of me and i got to see part of them it may not all be the truth it's also all not a lie but in the end it told me a wonderful sad happy story
<START> like all of the very earliest films this movie is very very short lasting about one minute so because of its <UNK> it's not really possible to compare it to more modern films but for its time it's actually a very remarkable film much of this is because the <UNK> were hand painted making <UNK> appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance i've actually seen two different versions one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout i think the red one depicted on the dvd the great train robbery and other primary works is the best of them the dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a piece of amazing performance art and unlike other one minute or less films of the day this one is one i could see repeatedly it's just that visually compelling and odd br br if you want to see it online there is a <UNK> second version on <UNK> video type in <UNK> dance
<START> this was laurel and <UNK> last silent film for roach studios however since the public had a real <UNK> for <UNK> this same short was re made by the team just a few years later with only a few small plot changes laughing <UNK> was essentially the same plot except that stan and ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their <UNK> <UNK> not a goat like in <UNK> love this whole goat angle is the worst part of the film while you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog after all it is snowy outside why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless according to the plot the goat followed them home and so they got tired of it away and kept it huh this just doesn't make any sense if it had been a <UNK> or a cow would they have done the same thing apart from being an unconvincing plot the movie itself is pure laurel and hardy with a familiar plot and familiar roles for the comedians this film features quite a few laughs but unfortunately isn't one of their better films to wrap up their silent careers this aspect of their careers just seems to have ended with a <UNK>
<START> reading the other user comments the review by has <UNK> most of what i was feeling throughout this film predictable storyline cliché versions of lesbians <UNK> i e straight woman becomes a lesbian while <UNK> that her husband is abusive and aggressive br br also the score was severely disappointing it was bland soft sentimental elevator music another common cliché in movies about lesbians the movie would have had a few interesting dramatic moments if they had not been destroyed by the music br br a few scenes concerning sex and <UNK> also struck me as attempts to <UNK> and raise shock value including parts of the final performance scene the conventional hot and steamy moments were as boring as the overly sentimental score for example during the pool scene the women are kissing and then the camera pans along the abandoned wine glass the flowing water the sound of their heavy breathing over the soft crashing of waves br br the only elements i liked were the <UNK> and they are well choreographed and the development of attraction between the two characters felt very natural during the training scenes i genuinely <UNK> during those and during the last scene with the police officer but they were not enough to balance out the <UNK> or make me enjoy this film
<START> seriously i don't get why people are all like oh my god step up is the best movie ever it's a bunch of junk the acting first of all is ridiculous and let's not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terrible movies are supposed to be entertaining and this let me be the first to say was not entertainment i was actually laughing because i was so embarrassed watching it the music and dancing didn't do anything for me as well and what's with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that all the girls talk about whatever the movie was pathetic don't waste your time or your money unless you're a dancing movie freak but movies like that are not movies they're jokes
<START> the one of the best films of all times and everybody must realize this movie i m a turkish boy and a big cinema fun and in this days our cinema industry is up and is the best turkish film of last ten years and maybe one of the best films of all times director <UNK> is quite amazing telling story characters atmosphere is wonderful he is a <UNK> director and tells about routine event family dreams expects life tells about you tells about me tells about us i promise you will find a piece of your body in this movie cinema life <UNK> a new director he is waiting to realize i promise <UNK> you will love this movie please watch it
<START> love jones cleverly portrays young african american men and women in a clear positive realistic sense i feel that all of the actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job at capturing the mood long and <UNK> <UNK> worked well together and i hope to see more work from the two of them as a matter of fact all of the actors actresses did such a fine job it would be great to see another romantic comedy from them this movie can be compared to most any well written romantic comedy if you have not seen this movie already i strongly recommend that you do it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love
<START> i've liked <UNK> <UNK> movies since i saw one flew over the <UNK> nest and <UNK> two big masterpieces but when i saw hair i kept wondering if this was the same <UNK> <UNK> this movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least ok the music is pretty good but on screen it only seems like a bunch of drugged people dancing around wait a minute that's what it really is in fact the only interesting part and the only part where talent shows up are the last 15 minutes or so spoiler since when <UNK> takes <UNK> place as a soldier set to the vietnam war that 15 minutes are moving and well directed but it's a shame that we have to endure so much awful material before that br br well maybe this is one of those movies you need to be on the subject to enjoy the subject being marijuana acid and other drugs the film <UNK> i'm not so
<START> well this movie wasn't as horrible as i thought it would be i was expecting to give it one star i chose to give it three why well for a cheesy horror sci fi movie it's not all that bad sure the characters are tacky as is their acting including a young <UNK> <UNK> the effects cheap looking and the monsters well let's just say that i've seen some more effective halloween costumes in <UNK> schools but there was something about this movie that made me watch it till the end a little bit of humor helped out a bit i guess and if you ever wanted to see an alien pass gas this movie will let you live your dream 3 10
<START> this was truly horrible bad acting bad writing bad effects bad scripting bad camera shots bad filming bad characters bad music bad editing bad casting bad storyline bad well you get the idea it was just just what's the word oh yeah bad
<START> fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick <UNK> who can <UNK> this pretentious <UNK> trap for signs of his still to come greatness kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video he considered it embarrassing and amateurish and he was correct in his <UNK> this is a weak and tedious film at <UNK> minutes it still seems longer than barry <UNK> it nevertheless is of historical interest and has its genuine absorbing moments it's a difficult film to find only <UNK> copies are in <UNK> though perhaps this may change if kubrick's estate <UNK> and has it released on video recommended only for kubrick <UNK>
<START> first off <UNK> a horror fan but this tobe hooper production come on the man from the original texas chainsaw and <UNK> was below standards even for a fan the acting was not bad at all some characters were unbelievable but the leading ladies were ok the story was something we've seen a hundred times already without any surprising twist or whatever never exciting or intense and do not count on any special effects besides blood <UNK> up the scary zombie kids are white <UNK> faces with dark eyes and that is it that might have worked in the early 70's but not now director j s <UNK> didn't do a good job in keeping the suspense half way thru there is a risk you will fall asleep my vote is based primarily on the leading acting but this could have easily have been called children of the corn 8 from the corn fields to the mines enough said
<START> i knew this would be one of the worst movies i could have imagined but in just 20 short minutes it actually <UNK> my low by being possibly the worst movie i have ever seen br br i have already wasted too much time <UNK> about it trust me it sucks
<START> oh boy oh boy on the cover of worn out vhs has a picture of sandra <UNK> and her name written on top i think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties was because of sandra <UNK> name <UNK> fans don't have to disappoint sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting rest of the <UNK> it's fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because it's bad but after that it's going worse much worse directing is awful acting is awful script is awful dialog is awful action is awful music is quite good actually typical score for eighties action movies this movie is so bad that it goes close to anything andy <UNK> has ever produced it's so bad that there isn't proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie but still there was sandra <UNK> and super cool sarcasm jake who tried to be marlon brando br br i think they can now bring the film out on dvd it could be cool and they should write on the cover academy award winner sandra <UNK> in br br 1 out of 10
<START> the second in director <UNK> trilogy of second world war comedies the others being death do us and <UNK> hitler my part in his is a film version of the <UNK> long running and much loved situation comedy like most <UNK> of television shows this movie suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches some of which work better than others for example the scene where a high <UNK> army officer <UNK> down a river is a memorable surreal moment br br the joy of this movie is it's representation of a past that probably never existed and an england which is defined by <UNK> countryside and the chance it offers to see veteran scene <UNK> such as john le <UNK> given their biggest film roles arthur lowe is superb as captain a who when the <UNK> are down displays great courage and saves the day the climax is probably the character's greatest moment br br episodes of the television series are of course funnier but as an introduction to a british legend you cannot find anything better
<START> minor spoilers br br in chicago grace <UNK> kathy bates is a housewife having a twenty five years marriage with the lawyer max <UNK> dan <UNK> and a hysterical and psychotic dwarf daughter in law meredith <UNK> grace <UNK> the singer victor fox jonathan price who will present a tv show in chicago and will give five spots on the first row in a tv promotion kate calls the show and wins a ticket when max simultaneously asks for the divorce claiming that their lives are too monotonous grace becomes depressed and when she goes to the show the audience is informed that a chicago serial killer who uses a <UNK> killed victor fox with a broken heart she decides to fly to england to victor <UNK> funeral there she realizes that he was gay and becomes friend of his former mate <UNK> simpson rupert everett they fly back to chicago trying to find the killer this movie is a delightful original and weird dramatic comedy having bizarre characters it has a huge potential to be a cult movie with the <UNK> of julie andrews and barry <UNK> themselves and a joke with nicolas <UNK> masterpiece <UNK> look <UNK> when wears a red <UNK> in <UNK> underground part of the city the beginning of the movie with jonathan price singing is wonderful i have repeated it four <UNK> times the cast has a magnificent performance <UNK> kathy bates jonathan price rupert everett and the unknown meredith <UNK> indeed this movie is an excellent entertainment my vote is eight br br title brazil a <UNK> to the <UNK>
<START> 1959 was a landmark in the world of film several great directors of the classic era were releasing career <UNK> classics that <UNK> among their best just a look at the titles is <UNK> hitchcock's north by <UNK> billy <UNK> some like it hot howard <UNK> <UNK> bravo douglas <UNK> imitation of life add a couple from the previous year orson welles' touch of evil <UNK> vertigo and nick <UNK> wind across the <UNK> and you've got a pretty good <UNK> up of what was possible within the classic hollywood style br br at the same time two films appeared that hinted at a whole new way of making films one was jean luc <UNK> breathless the other was john cassavetes shadows the two films had certain things in common largely improvised acting by non stars <UNK> cameras low budgets and a certain youthful <UNK> <UNK> in certain ways though they couldn't be <UNK> apart godard was still a believer in the director as <UNK> of style he knew more about film than most hollywood producers and breathless was filled with the <UNK> of the classic crime film cassavetes on the other hand was an actor and a <UNK> from new <UNK> underground theater scene his first film shows him little impressed with the cinema and a big believer in actors <UNK> film constantly references it's own <UNK> whereas shadows aims for a certain kind of <UNK> br br it doesn't reach it mainly because <UNK> is a myth particularly in cinema but it feels powerful <UNK> but <UNK> like the cool jazz on the score certainly the main inspiration for the filmmaking style on display here it ultimately doesn't hold together mainly because <UNK> actors here are amateurish <UNK> where cassavetes style requires strong imaginative actors his later work with gena rowlands ben <UNK> and peter falk blows this out of the water due to the director's technical <UNK> some bits of dialogue had to be <UNK> later which <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> still it's fascinating to watch both for the great moments like the scene where <UNK> <UNK> talks about her <UNK> with losing her virginity and to watch a groundbreaking artist finding his way
<START> this is possibly the worst thing i've ever seen on television first i'm pretty sure it takes itself entirely seriously and i tend to be pretty good at <UNK> satire second it displays <UNK> levels of <UNK> in one of the ads for it one of the describes women in terms of quality third every contestant i've seen on it six i think was a dim witted <UNK> of the variety likely to possess a <UNK> with <UNK> u or women entered under here for to <UNK> roger ebert this doesn't <UNK> the bottom of the barrel nor deserve mention in the same sentence as <UNK> the closest thing to a redeeming feature i've experienced with regards to key to the <UNK> was having a female friend <UNK> me that the male cast were indeed the opposite of attractive in both physical and mental terms
<START> a group of young <UNK> that just ran out of gas go into a weird wax museum called lost <UNK> owned by a strange man named chuck as the <UNK> are controlled by some mysterious force and a madman with special powers wants them dead br br one of the most under appreciated horror movies of the late 70's this charles band producer of re animator production has became one of the scariest and most unique low budget horror productions of it's day combining some psychological themes along without having to result some gore like the usual slasher movie the movie keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats with tension and some scares the movie has became a cult diamond in the rough for the genre since then and this is well worth watching br br also recommended pin the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 the hills have eyes 1977 maniac 1980 magic 1978 dolls may just before dawn house of 1000 corpses the devil's rejects <UNK> camp mother's day a nightmare on elm street friday the 13th halloween 1 2 puppet master house of wax 1953 and 2005 <UNK> <UNK> high tension evil dead ii from <UNK> till dawn <UNK> nothing but trouble and psycho 1960
<START> this film is a nightmare the sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same i got when i finished watching this movie it ended what a relief i felt pain watching this movie so bad it was it's a b series low cost movie that's for sure but i think it not an excuse to be so bad i've watched brilliant low cost movies with nice plots nice production nice acting and most of all some substance this one got nothing of it the plot is hilarious it almost seems like an american guide about how to <UNK> ancient chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie with some kids playing with the occult  i don't know if the chinese tale present in this movie is real or not but if it is the damage is even worse the production is just horrible a plain zero what special effects are those there's no suspense the supposed tension scenes are a complete failure the acting is not better and what about the dialogs oh my god a movie which has for several times dialogs just like i will pass there later ok is that alright  ok alright ok  ok alright bye then  i'm sure it doesn't deserve more than a 1 10 score br br too bad to be true
<START> it seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for the sopranos as its main character martin blank john cusack is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he's in therapy trying to deal with it all everything finally comes to a head at his 10 year high school reunion the problem was that by the time blank got to the reunion i had stopped caring frankly i found this movie a drag from start to finish br br it had potential there was a reasonably good cast headed by cusack and dan <UNK> playing <UNK> his arch rival in the hit man business along with <UNK> driver as <UNK> high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night and a limited role for alan arkin as dr psychologist that fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together though the drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour what i thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was <UNK> <UNK> for a hit man's union but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke the idea never really got developed as for the romance one wondered why <UNK> would even think of letting this guy back into her life br br there were a handful of chuckles but nothing really caught me and held me and i spent most of the movie wondering whether this thing was ever going to start to click it never did not for me at least 2 10

<START> <UNK> i love these stranger within thrillers some good examples are fatal attraction single white female and audition done well they can be a lot of fun and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and scares of course the opposite can be true done poorly they can be tedious and stupid the hand that rocks the cradle is one of the latter br br the claire <UNK> <UNK> and michael matt mccoy are <UNK> another member to their family but busy claire is <UNK> by michael to hire a <UNK> one day a woman named <UNK> <UNK> rebecca shows up and because she seems perfect the hire her of course once she shows up their <UNK> life is slowly <UNK> br br this film suffers from a <UNK> of problems but the biggest one is the handling of the villain <UNK> is never believable part of this has to do with how she's written and how she's acted the things that she does that are supposed to put us on edge are so contrived that they're laughable de doesn't help much she portrays <UNK> as two different people while it's true she's supposed to be the perfect <UNK> while hiding her psychotic <UNK> de performance creates a <UNK> between the two <UNK> of her character br br the other actors are good however <UNK> is terrific as the <UNK> claire <UNK> is very natural in the role but unfortunately the script lets her down matt mccoy is almost invisible however <UNK> moore is delightful as <UNK> friend marlene moore is a <UNK> but unfortunately she's only on screen for a total of five minutes br br curtis <UNK> is a good director but you wouldn't know it from watching this dud the film has a few decent shocks but it's poorly paced and the climax while <UNK> some tension is actually kind of laughable that being said he's working with a script that at best could <UNK> be called pathetic br br trust me when it comes to stick with <UNK> this one should have gone to the direct to video bin
<START> i would purchase this and thirty seconds over <UNK> today if available i also saw this movie after seeing large <UNK> of jack <UNK> in his dress blues on the highway at the age of 12 always admired jack as a john wayne type and american all the way almost became a marine just because of this movie but served instead in the air force air force <UNK> and army <UNK> for <UNK> years have not seen this movie on tv at all and would love to own it on dvd at least if it was on tv i would copy it to vhs and use it until available on dvd i also have a large collection of wwii and korean war movies and always look for new releases on dvd
<START> one of the biggest french success of the year 2002 was also very well <UNK> abroad which is quite extraordinary for a french film it is not difficult to define the reasons of this success this movie made by one of the most interesting french film makers of these last years <UNK> presents students coming from all over europe and gathered all together under the same roof in <UNK> these students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life either <UNK> either serious or with a sense of humor i guess that if the movie worked so well it is because a lot of students must have recognized themselves in the main characters' <UNK> and especially br br we follow the movie and so his experience abroad as an <UNK> student through his eyes <UNK> is really an ordinary student with his qualities his faults an intelligent making with quite a lot of ingenious ideas perfectly expresses his lost mind and his anxiety about the world and being an <UNK> student on that subject the best examples can be found in two sequences the first one is when <UNK> asks a woman at university for the papers he has to send to prepare his <UNK> when the same woman informs him about the different necessary <UNK> all the papers appear on the screen when she is <UNK> them in the next sequence voice over <UNK> to the <UNK> his vision of the modern world now where to find the second example well the scene where <UNK> has a <UNK> medical examination during which films his visions is widely sufficient to speak of itself br br moreover the director wasn't really interested by his main character's studies he left this point low key he rather put a lot of effort into private life of course in his love affair with anne sophie but also and especially in his relations with his fellow <UNK> it is a real friendship story that shows us with its moments of happiness but also its arguments and its tensions through adventure and at the end of his stay he will have been <UNK> into life which will make him more mature the message that the author wanted to <UNK> isn't difficult to guess you <UNK> believe that you live in an <UNK> and complicated world you <UNK> give up but search to get what you want even if it is difficult br br apart from this we could also fear that with the topic <UNK> wouldn't avoid a trap the clichés let's be frank about it they are included in the screenplay but the director does his best not to spread them too much in his movie then the screenplay contains convenient and predictable moments at the airport and before <UNK> we see <UNK> <UNK> a tear after he left his family but fortunately the shortcomings of the script stop here quite funny dialogs and cool young actors perfectly at ease in their roles make up the whole br br in spite of its weaknesses is to be taken for a success in the movie of young people besides the whole atmosphere it brings out lets us think that this movie is directed primarily to a young audience ultimately the end of the movie and its big success let us suggest that <UNK> to a fashion that goes right for american cinema the <UNK> of sequels and indeed the film maker currently works on a sequel entitled les let's hope that it will be as good as
<START> i saw this video at a friends house and it was the <UNK> thing i have seen ever i lost a lot of the little respect i had for <UNK> very boring and the music is as equally interesting dont waste your time unless you are a hardcore <UNK> fan
<START> fox is pretty lame they <UNK> the wrong shows it's bizarre that they would <UNK> a well written program like arrested development and yet they keep this show and war at home i feel that fox loved that they broke <UNK> with the then edgy married with children but now it's just getting ridiculous the loop is a pointless and boring watch and their edgy jokes just fall flat in order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming family guy and the <UNK> work because there is a constant flow of jokes fox needs to pull their heads out of their <UNK> <UNK> and quit letting their relatives write this mediocre tripe i mean if you're going to <UNK> money into making something entertaining make it entertaining also stop using no named actors it's great to have up and <UNK> but you need to anchor a show with a noted celebrity duh fox
<START> i saw the greek <UNK> when it first came out in 1978 i found it extremely boring i thought it was no better than a <UNK> except for one thing for the first time in my life i realized why it would be good to be rich seeing the scenery off <UNK> <UNK> and getting my first real <UNK> into the lifestyle of the rich and famous opened my eyes to <UNK> martha stewart it was a good thing funny i don't remember the sex scene i hadn't seen the movie since it was on the big screen and found the <UNK> session with the mistress memorable this time maybe because i was younger and single back then it was no big deal
<START> this film may be great but it is a complete ripoff of bill <UNK> comfort and joy c j is one of the <UNK> films i've ever seen without becoming <UNK> br br it's ok if you do like it but realize that everything in this film is a direct rip off br br the original is http us imdb com title i can recommend almost anything by forsythe local hero <UNK> girl that sinking feeling i better go rent some tonight local has a young peter <UNK> and an old burt <UNK> br br unfortunately he's given up film making after some really crappy hollywood treatment sad
<START> this movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is it is a movie both for children and parents and it is timeless i saw this movie before <UNK> eleven and must admit that the actors in <UNK> has class in advance but the play of is much more down to earth and moving why i say <UNK> eleven is the fact that these 2 movies has many things in common and is that good that it can bear comparison with <UNK> the 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe compared to what we are used to in <UNK> the different cases of impossible acts is handled in a way that you wouldn't <UNK> from many young actors and sometimes not even from the old boys the story again it has things in common with <UNK> eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in they need to climb up to the the part in which the young people has to take care of younger brother gives a fine element in the movie try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a <UNK> on your arm br br this movie can bear comparison with most grown up movie like and <UNK> eleven yes i do believe it is that good it is best to see it in a theater as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever br br regards
<START> this is the best work i have ever seen on television the story is compelling all the more so because it is true the writers did their <UNK> the accuracy of events is well documented the acting is great this has to be the best role sam <UNK> has ever had and the black and white cinematography was exceptional my only regret is that it is not available to buy a few years ago i <UNK> someone involved with the production either with <UNK> or in england and was told they had no plans to release it on vhs at the time this was a bbc production and ran in the u s on american <UNK> there is such an interest in seeing this just hard to believe no one can make it available
<START> great movie in a <UNK> style being billed as the <UNK> <UNK> but then so was twin town although this is streets ahead br br takes in a weekend in the life of <UNK> <UNK> good debut movie from <UNK> and some great performances in the cast br br go see then go <UNK>
<START> albert <UNK> presents his vision of the lost city of atlantis and it's a vision so <UNK> up with claustrophobic settings weird costumes and <UNK> quirky minor characters that one thing is for sure you want to get the hell outta there as soon as possible unfortunately it will take you about 80 minutes the alice in wonderland like story is meandering and uninteresting and there was probably no actress in the world who could have turned this into a good movie though kathy ireland makes an appealing annoying voice and all attempt 1 2
<START> this super creepy southern gothic melodrama stars clint eastwood as a wounded <UNK> officer in the civil war who's taken in by a rural girls' school and <UNK> back to health a weird clash of <UNK> ensues with the supposedly dangerous male falling prey to a <UNK> of seemingly harmless women who prove themselves to be every bit as brutal as the men <UNK> war on one another at the battle <UNK> this is a classic spider and the fly story but here there's one lone fly and a whole bunch of <UNK> br br <UNK> page plays the head mistress of the school and she gives a <UNK> sensational performance page was trained as a theater actress and it shows in all of her performances no matter what role she played she always committed herself 100 to it and never once let herself drop out of character so it is here with this lethal <UNK> who takes her sexual <UNK> out on this helpless man each of the other girls responds to him in her own particular way as well the two most prominent are the <UNK> girl who can't wait to throw throw herself at him and the <UNK> one played by who else but the mannered elizabeth <UNK> who acts like she would fall over in a dead faint if someone so much as said the word penis to her the <UNK> madonna and the whore storyline would seem heavy handed if the movie didn't keep you so off <UNK> and so completely unsure of what was going to happen next br br the most memorable scene in the film for me occurred when the group of women perform an <UNK> of eastwood's leg which has become infected with <UNK> again the spider fly <UNK> is clear they <UNK> him so that it's that much harder for him to escape their web br br a classic <UNK> not a great film but a <UNK> entertaining one br br grade a
<START> don't kill me fans but i have something to say about this br br pros well the most mildly interesting season that i've watched out of all the seasons that are out there of <UNK> just has tobe the arc unlike the rest of the seasons i personally think that this one has more of a real plot line and those <UNK> good god they're such likable characters shame they were killed off of course i would write a 15 page <UNK> one why i like the so much but that would be boring for some of you so this series actually does have some likable characters i'll miss poor poor psycho little boy br br cons outside of arc the series was overall boring repetitive and some of the characters are extremely irritating for example she <UNK> too much to my taste she acts like from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he's a loud mouth dog demon with a huge sword what's so unique about him he has adorable dog ears <UNK> is all talk no action and very cocky has just got to be the <UNK> villain that ever existed in the anime world and they have some color but they just seem to stand on the <UNK> too much but what bugs me the most if the fact that they have absolutely no common sense at all <UNK> <UNK> has done a lot better then this i've seen it before br br if you like series with a lot of action no annoying love triangle no over <UNK> this is not for you then
<START> this remake is entitled that darn cat but d c the cat is more of a <UNK> than the major character <UNK> randall was not likable at all in this remake either she reminded me of one of those high school <UNK> <UNK> you read about who have been angry since the day they were born so they end up opening fire on the rest of the school one day the federal cop <UNK> was okay but not as good as the one in the original i guess disney was trying to make christina <UNK> and doug doug or whatever goofy name he has into stars but they don't hold a candle to <UNK> mills and dean jones in the original i'm an animal lover and a cat lover and i don't blame d c for the remake being so much more inferior to the original movie after all they nearly cut him out of the whole movie all in all a very poor remake
<START> aliens let lose a giant monster named then send down a <UNK> that looks your average stupid teenage girl to tell <UNK> tommy ward rhys <UNK> in the only movie you ever see him in that has been chosen to fight also if he loses the plant goes doom so he goes off to fight the <UNK> this movie is bad very bad so bad it you need negative numbers just to gave it a <UNK> written bad directing way below power rangers over the top wooden acting that you're just <UNK> for a <UNK> of to come out of no where and cut them down and don't get me started on the theme song at the end the people who made this <UNK> <UNK> of s should not be <UNK> near a camera or any thing to do with films is a cool looking monster that should have been in a movie a million times better than this one do your self a favour and don't see this movie it's 80 or so minute of life the actors that are in this never worked again by way br br 3 10
<START> a <UNK> classic this movie was terribly influential in rap music for the <UNK> that <UNK> ray moore performs <UNK> are long <UNK> stories that are funny and deliver a point and you can see how they would naturally <UNK> into rap for more on <UNK> <UNK> ray moore and why this movie is important go to <UNK> com br br which leaves us just to talk about the movie itself this movie packs in a great deal of laugh at the funny outfits and <UNK> bang for the buck as nearly every shot has some sort of outrageous element or dialogue it starts as <UNK> is being released from prison in order to find out who framed him and bring him to justice i was unaware that <UNK> release people so they can prove their own innocence but that's me i'm a <UNK> in the prison scene he is helped in this by queen <UNK> who is <UNK> lead prostitute and has been running his <UNK> while he's been gone she has also put all of his prostitutes through karate school so now he has an army of female karate fighters br br i watched this movie in two parts which is usually a mistake but in this case it provided an interesting contrast the first part i watched on my lunch break while <UNK> and wasn't enjoying it much at all it struck me as particularly poorly made <UNK> with a ludicrous story shoddy i guess that makes it sound like it had some tons of outrageous locales outfits and dialogue but i wasn't enjoying fact it kind of made me feel dirty let's face it a white guy watching something like this to laugh at the outfits and the things the characters say is essentially getting an enjoyment out of it that is racist how ridiculously those black people dress what silly things they say i wasn't really enjoying it wasn't laughing and wasn't looking forward to watching the rest br br later that night when i was in a much more relaxed state i watched the <UNK> loved it like disco godfather which i had watched a few days previously this has a warmth and <UNK> at its core that makes it likable even when it's silly or violent the character of <UNK> has an element of self parody about him that makes the whole thing fun and the appearance of several actors who were also in disco godfather implies that we're watching the group effort of a bunch of friends who just want to make something fun together even the poor dubbing karate fights and everything else just makes it that much more charming br br what i find interesting about the <UNK> films is that they have some moral ambiguity i don't see in other <UNK> films and certainly in very few mainstream films in this one there is an african american woman who gives a speech about the white mayor saying he has done more for the black community than anyone we later find out that the mayor is surprise corrupt but i like that the movie would present this woman as essentially misguided and not try to redeem her in some other way there's also the figure of the <UNK> <UNK> who is presented as a useless <UNK> and no one makes an effort to find some redeeming socially positive angle to what he is he just is in disco godfather the religious character lady reed plays is presented as just nuts for wanting to pray for her child hopelessly lost to angel dust i like that the films would present such <UNK> critical portrayals of people in their own community without sugar <UNK> or trying to redeem them to make them more <UNK> br br there are a lot of elements such as when <UNK> says move over and let me pass or i'm gonna be pulling these <UNK> <UNK> out your a there is queen <UNK> reaching over and answering the phone <UNK> total experience and you will not be able to miss though you may wish to cover your eyes the extended nude scene by the repulsive mayor i am all for <UNK> <UNK> older men but even i have and my limits are usually a few miles past most people's so be warned the dvd i had is clearly edited which is noticeable in certain of the dialogue scenes and at the end when <UNK> killing of a major character with his bare hands obviously <UNK> the main event br br if you do get the dvd however be sure to watch all three trailers for the <UNK> films as they are a hoot i wasn't going to watch the human <UNK> but after seeing that trailer you'd better believe that i am also there is a scene in the <UNK> trailer that i don't remember from the movie when <UNK> <UNK> at a mexican looking thug obviously misses and the guy <UNK> himself into a nearby car <UNK> br br after watching the first half i was going to say to skip this and watch disco godfather as the film making and story has <UNK> improved but after really enjoying the second half i would advise watching this one over disco godfather as this one is even more fun outrageous and good has those <UNK> which even if one doesn't understand the roots and nuances of the form are still something to see br br check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies cinema de <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> as if the world hadn't already got enough cheap jaws <UNK> writer <UNK> <UNK> decided to make the sequel to his <UNK> but reasonably enjoyable creature feature <UNK> a complete rip off of spielberg's classic right down to having a concerned cop who no one believes and a mayor more worried about his 4th july <UNK> than people's lives br br even in the hands of an extremely skilled director it is unlikely that this derivative rubbish could have been anything other than hokey b movie garbage but with <UNK> yes the <UNK> calling the shots behind the camera a man with a <UNK> of mr spielberg's talent i <UNK> about 1 <UNK> 2 is guaranteed to be every bit as bad as one might imagine br br the predictable and extremely clichéd plot isn't worth describing in much detail substitute island with new york and bruce the shark with a giant rubber <UNK> and you'll get the <UNK> although several points about the film are definitely worth mentioning simply because they are so funny all of the <UNK> attacks involve the actors struggling to make incredibly fake looking giant <UNK> look real which is hilarious to behold capital <UNK> <UNK> stands in for new york and <UNK> of stock footage makes the illusion even less convincing best of all a silly dream sequence that sees the rubber <UNK> attacking our hero <UNK> the statue of liberty is not only gut stupid but also features some truly dreadful special effects br br <UNK> script also doesn't know when to quit there are several points in this film at which it could've and probably should've ended but the action goes on and on with the <UNK> surviving several explosions and causing a tunnel to collapse <UNK> the film's love interest and a bunch of kids before finally being blown to <UNK> by the hero br br sometimes very silly always awful technically but never actually scary this <UNK> stinker may find fans amongst those who <UNK> seek out cinematic trash most normal people however would be advised to steer well clear
<START> as an ex <UNK> <UNK> i was really interested in this movie i personally have been involved in a <UNK> search on leaving where one person was found we managed to get him <UNK> though as we were in <UNK> limits on another ship i was on the <UNK> was found and we could not land him anywhere due to <UNK> <UNK> issues in fact he stayed on for a year as an almost <UNK> crew member and worked for his keep africa is notorious for <UNK> <UNK> there is a great scene in the beginning of the film when the bulk <UNK> enters the african <UNK> her size <UNK> all the crew pop <UNK> for a little <UNK> and <UNK> so far normal the drama starts when the enter the vast <UNK> holds of the ship <UNK> <UNK> is brilliant as the captain with a drink problem being <UNK> by his nemesis <UNK> right on form as the <UNK> representative on board the <UNK> search is classic but we did not have guns i question the use of guns in this film this ship seemed to have a vast <UNK> in my experience guns at sea are severely <UNK> due to customs <UNK> also having a dog on board was odd anti <UNK> laws especially in europe <UNK> carrying of animal severely anyway pertwee is brilliant as the <UNK> mate the horror which follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable the grim <UNK> background of the ships holds and a feeling that there is no where to hide adds to the drama some of the crew are not into the murder and those who get involved are gradually sucked in to a world of violence from which there is no escape the chase through the ship especially the engine room scenes are edge on the seat the feeling of extreme <UNK> <UNK> the feeling of metal <UNK> in and death being only a gun barrel away the film is brutal my girlfriend had to give up watching it during the shooting and beating scenes while this goes on <UNK> in the comfort of his well <UNK> cabin gets drunk unaware of the mayhem 3 <UNK> below its a tense film flawed in parts but the real message is that we can all get sucked into violence like this slowly and surely think of the train drivers who took jews to <UNK> the <UNK> who worked out those train <UNK> i always remember someone who had visited <UNK> concentration camp at the end of the war and he said that one of the s s guards had put a bird table outside the camp <UNK> this film is like that ordinary people suddenly finding themselves in a world of <UNK> violence
<START> this movie was good relatively during the first parts of it br br we have a story from 3 points of view so let's find some clues and complete the story br br oh wait none of that stuff matters because the fbi guys are the bad guys though that was a great twist it was almost a terrible twist i immediately <UNK> the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10 15 minutes of it br br does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad yes it's a good shock but it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the <UNK> hour and twenty minutes there's no connection to the killers br br the killers are in about all of 5 minutes of this movie as killers and the two fbi agents are only in 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty br br we get it <UNK> oh the killers are <UNK> which makes no sense because they were only described in limited terms as just being <UNK> and the hour and twenty minutes of <UNK> we are watching of the 3 stories goes out the window as everyone is dead in 5 minutes br br all of this makes the ending even more ridiculous oh they killed a bunch of fbi agents in the beginning what fbi agents sleep together all in the same room to be found and murdered by amateurs and then <UNK> by people who know nothing about being fbi agents a cop 3 feet away apparently can't hit either one with a standard police issue pistol that can shoot several shots i hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd leaps they think we will believe br br the other thing is the movie ends about 10 15 minutes after they are revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere
<START> breaking dawn starts in a <UNK> college as professor simon associate producer joe <UNK> tells his students that they have to perform an <UNK> six week study of a mental patient in cape state hospital as a crucial part of their education fail they will never become <UNK> doctors a bright young attractive intelligent student named eve kelly is given a particularly difficult patient to study his name is don wake james <UNK> is a convicted killer he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman diane <UNK> her young daughter <UNK> at first don won't even look at eve much less talk to her but like the <UNK> she is eve <UNK> in trying to figure him out eventually don begins to talk but what he says <UNK> eve he says that someone is watching her mentions the name eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn as don <UNK> out the conspiracy theories bizarre statements eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy reality becomes more more <UNK> is there something more to the supposed nonsense that don talks other than being the insane <UNK> of a psychiatric patient br br written directed by mark <UNK> robinson i have nothing but negative feelings towards breaking dawn now we all like a good twist ending the sort of ending which catches us <UNK> surprises us works well with the rest of the film stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to the sixth sense 1999 fight club 1999 to name just two good examples to a lesser extent the endings to films such as scream 1996 where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise isn't that obvious then of course there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before as an example lets take oh i don't know lets say breaking dawn because i have never seen such an awful ending to a film never breaking dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to eve it's not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest it's not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable it's not that bad a film until the twist ending i have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point which was ok to be fair to it suddenly becomes irrelevant i am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail all i can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me as far as i'm concerned it doesn't make a bit of sense never will breaking dawn is crap it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the <UNK> ending in film history it's as simple straight forward as that br br director robinson doesn't half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller maybe he thought what he had shot would play out ok or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but i'd imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the <UNK> together within the space of a few muddled minutes give us all a happier than happy final shot he builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it's all for <UNK> at the end of the day br br technically breaking dawn is fine it is generally well made throughout the acting is pretty good is nice easy on the eyes puts in a decent performance was it just me or did the guy who played don look like john star of such italian sleaze classics as cannibal apocalypse 1980 city of the living dead 1980 the house on the edge of the park 1980 cannibal <UNK> 1981 1987 the church 1989 ok maybe it was just me br br breaking dawn is rubbish i hated it all because of the final few minutes don't get me wrong it wasn't exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was ok definitely one to avoid as far as i'm concerned although it seems to have it's fair share of positive comments on the imdb
<START> i collect films on super 8 and managed to <UNK> a full length print of this one last week on e bay it looks like at least for the moment this is the only way to see this film in a country having <UNK> video i have seen it available on region 2 dvd many times but never region 1 br br i just finished watching it a few minutes ago and i am amazed by it it's a powerful testament to freedom and finding your own place in the world the photography and music were wonderful and i really felt empathy for some of the characters br br i kind of like the idea that i was probably the only one in the usa watching when the north wind blows tonight br br long live
<START> this movie is really sick and funny i have made my friends cringe describing it to them i saw it about 8 months ago and i still have the song <UNK> we gather at the <UNK> <UNK> through my head br br so basically it is a romeo and juliet but it goes beyond what you would expect let's just say incest references to child <UNK> gore of course but unfortunately has a sort of happy ending sort of it's more weird than happy <UNK> <UNK> was brilliant he has this sort of intellectual <UNK> tone he's abusive but <UNK> he quotes more shakespeare than anyone else in the film all while engaging in his sadistic role as a husband and father br br the meat guy was pretty cool too he was fiancé deeply <UNK> with her and soon to be <UNK> because of <UNK> and <UNK> a true romantic he's a handsome really sweet guy desperate to find true love <UNK> <UNK> make <UNK> to burn <UNK> ' unfortunately troma just had to resort to that awful fake green vomit and their other antics they really get carried away with that stuff sometimes but hey this film made a great impression on me how often do i refer to it in real life situations wow that's pathetic br br anyway enjoy
<START> it is disappointing to see as talented an actor as amitabh bachchan in such a weak role especially when he was beyond sensational in black which i highly recommend one line in the film states is not a mere man he is a thought and a philosophy director ram <UNK> <UNK> credits the godfather as an inspiration for this movie and perhaps that is the problem it seems like a badly <UNK> american movie set in india the left <UNK> <UNK> considers seven elements of film making acting continuity plot character development dialogue artistry and production sets on a scale from a high of 10 to a low of 1 with 5 given as a average score the film continuity seems high an 8 by maintaining a violent tone <UNK> with drama in places and using justice outside the legal system as motivation however there seems to be a lack of emotion connected with the evil of organized crime the acting rates a 4 it appears too weak even when someone is being beaten or murdered it seems for example when one character is shot in the <UNK> i found myself wondering if or when he was going to fall he does not and ala ronald reagan he is placed in an <UNK> with his bleeding face <UNK> ala john f kennedy the plot rates a 5 as an example of american style <UNK> with a family oriented at its head character development appears static and the characters seem like chess pieces on an abandoned chess board thereby <UNK> a rank of 3 the dialogue seems stilted and appears to be forced to fit some <UNK> pattern of speech a 4 for dialogue production sets look to be below average a 4 and artistry is puzzling with far too many close ups too rapid <UNK> and too many group scenes where the actors seem over <UNK> a 3 to me too much camera movement is <UNK> the average of the left <UNK> <UNK> is 4 4 and with a slight <UNK> based on poor it moves down to a 4 two questions continually <UNK> in the film one why are so many people eating so often and two does not india have its own brand of organized crime do films like this have to be so <UNK> on western cultural examples as much as i like amitabh bachchan i cannot recommend this film
<START> i loved so much last movie the masterpiece <UNK> it had a great screenplay great actors well have to say <UNK> is so much greater than others a <UNK> use of lights for a great cinematography br br well <UNK> is a different story ridiculous screenplay <UNK> tons of morals and we could speak weeks about politics you know we are italians poor cinematography it's too simple representing '70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights do some efforts more peoples bad use of music what's the point of using <UNK> to represent the tragic <UNK> of br br and to all the people who claimed the main prize in <UNK> i answer are you nuts maybe the russian film was bad but not as bad as this br br i'm down with the p e don't believe the hype
<START> hey there army sgt i'm sorry dude but being a sgt in the army and being in the army national guard does not make you <UNK> to comment on a marine movie you are not a marine and just because you wear a uniform doesn't mean you can relate to being a marine we simply are the best we have the hardest training yes we have big heads about ourselves but hey when you are the best you like to <UNK> your stuff i was in the iraq invasion and in i fought next to soldiers you are not <UNK> to say anything about my marine <UNK> i hate to be the one that starts the whole which branch is better but you have no right to say you are <UNK> to judge a marine movie oh yeah we are <UNK> <UNK> not <UNK> that's the biggest clue you have no idea about what you are talking about yeah we do not curse at <UNK> anymore tell me how is <UNK> at someone going to make them a better marine how will me hitting someone make a marine a better marine yes it is a <UNK> boot camp from what i went through but we are dealing with different times and people we are training people who are over all smarter than our generations <UNK> we want smarter <UNK> not <UNK> and anyone who signs up to be a marine in the first place has a dedication to be the best his country has to offer we don't have to <UNK> that in marines come to wanting to be killers we don't need to teach them that by them by swearing at them and beating them at least that is how i feel and yes i am <UNK> to say that i have been on the battlefield numerous times and i have trained marines and <UNK> who eventually ended up on the battlefield but then again what do i know i was just there done that got the t shirt sgt of the army get a clue
<START> some would argue that <UNK> director <UNK> la is an exercise in <UNK> <UNK> that while the silent films to which pays homage were at the cutting edge of cinema when they were made they are outdated today leaving la a meaningless <UNK> br br i would disagree <UNK> la <UNK> the conventions of the silent film with 21st century technology making it the ultimate exercise in post modern film making br br the film is set in the timeless the city without a voice so called because the citizens have been rendered speechless by mr tv a dictator media <UNK> with his hair painted on the city resembles the titular one in fritz <UNK> <UNK> metropolis <UNK> perhaps 100 years before that film it is all <UNK> <UNK> tv and animated <UNK> br br the citizens of the city are <UNK> by la the voice the only person with the gift of speech her face <UNK> <UNK> by a hood kept on even when she is naked la is forced to sing on mr tv's television network but when mr tv <UNK> a plan to steal the written word as well la and her <UNK> son join forces with a <UNK> family in an attempt to return the freedom of speech to the people br br la is nothing but pure cinema <UNK> himself with the conventions of the silent film has to rely upon images to tell his story there is sound most notably in the almost continuous score by leo it evokes the best of silent movie music as well as working itself into the film's such as the <UNK> of car <UNK> or the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and underlying the whole film is a familiar as if it were being shown on an ancient <UNK> br br there is a fair amount of dialogue as well but instead of using <UNK> has the characters' words appear in the frame they are larger or smaller filling the screen or <UNK> <UNK> in the air depending on what is being said think a more imaginative version of the subtitles in night watch 2004 br br thankfully the words don't distract from the images which is very fortunate indeed because la boasts some of the most creative and original images we've seen in a long time all captured by <UNK> <UNK> black and white photography there are the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> singer and her <UNK> son there is the city's abandoned <UNK> which looks like the <UNK> remains of some <UNK> spider and there's the sinister dr y whose <UNK> mouth is displayed on a television screen attached to his face br br la has been <UNK> for relying too much on its imagery while <UNK> on the <UNK> depth but again i would disagree it is true that the sudden appearance of a mind control machine shaped like a <UNK> or the <UNK> boy seemingly <UNK> on a star of david feels out of place a tad over the top in what is otherwise merely a well crafted fairy tale br br but the lack of overt symbols the two previous examples aside works in the film's favour it allows us to make up our own minds to decide whether to <UNK> political meaning to see la as an allegory for <UNK> the danger of <UNK> <UNK> and the power and responsibility of the media or to just take the film at face value as a visually stunning adventure through a world simultaneously unique and familiar br br the sacrifice of explicit depth in favour of unique imagery may seem like a compromise but really when a film looks as good as this it's hard to care there is more imagination and artistry in every frame of la than hollywood can shake a derivative stick at <UNK> films almost 100 years old might be <UNK> but in doing so may be showing us what is lacking in the films of today he may be telling us that it is time for another artistic revolution and he may be right
<START> my take steven seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller even a totally dull one br br remember steven seagal you don't don't worry there's not much to catch up on after starring in admittedly enjoyable crowd pleasing films like under siege and executive decision seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie <UNK> now he stars in low budgeted b level action vehicles some of which are made for tv movie of the week entries that lost their way to the big screen half past dead is among these shall we say dead action movies a loud and lousy action film <UNK> directed and <UNK> written and worse badly acted this is one of those bad movies that i don't need to watch until the ending to know it's bad i didn't have the guts to have all my <UNK> die while wasting my time with this it it this kind of bad films in which you realize those other films you hate are not bad after all br br the plot and the locale is completely lifted from a similar picture michael <UNK> the rock although similar may not be the word to describe it both movies are summer movies and not meant to be taken so seriously but in comparison even the rock which isn't much in the writing department as much as the lights and sounds has better characters a more compelling plot better action sequences and overall a more entertaining atmosphere although there are action scenes in half past dead none of them are exciting all of which are sometimes tedious and predictable br br although predictability seemed to be a welcome asset in summer action films predictability has never <UNK> more sour in ones that aren't fun and half past dead is never really fun a lot of times it's just a pain in the head hearing the bad rap music repeat over and over again throughout this film makes me <UNK> for an <UNK> every second i hear them the acting is <UNK> mediocre the plot is derivative with no compelling or appealing characters whatsoever <UNK> character an undercover agent sent to <UNK> to stop a criminal mastermind morris <UNK> a very boring villain is nothing to get excited about <UNK> character is also provided with a sidekick played by rap star <UNK> rule and a bunch of <UNK> inmates and there's no chemistry going on here br br if starring in a series of other forgotten action vehicles what were those films again killed of <UNK> career for good half past dead is <UNK> and audiences be warned you're invited to feel the pain advice avoid it at all costs br br rating 0 out of 5
<START> american movie is a wonderful documentary it follows the trials and <UNK> of a very determined independent filmmaker as he struggles to finish his first film br br the raw footage and insightful content of this film is an excellent example of how documentaries should be produced i also feel that the film can very inspirational to those of us that want to be filmmakers ourselves
<START> wow there's a lot of <UNK> directed at this movie and a lot of it is deserved but it's not the worst movie of all time that's probably <UNK> br br anyway if you're high on something really drunk or just in the mood for a b minus minus movie that you can make fun of this may be your cup of tea br br yes as others said the first part of the movie makes you think you're watching an <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> novel two of the main characters are named van <UNK> and <UNK> the ship is the and they're in the <UNK> galaxy you later find that van <UNK> is a <UNK> of the original and he just happens to be on a ship in the <UNK> century with dracula br br oh yeah and to add to the originality this spooky ghost ship movie has another character named ash sound familiar br br there's paper thin character development and <UNK> like the aforementioned <UNK> wheelchair and <UNK> and tom <UNK> talking 20th century black <UNK> but what really makes the movie ridiculous is the ending if that's what happens to the characters then the previous two hours have been a waste br br like i said it you want a dumb movie to play mystery science theater with and your mind is in approximately the same mode required for viewing the great <UNK> rebellion episode of lost in space then you may find this <UNK> otherwise put a stake in it it's done
<START> this film is a great comedy drama christopher walken is tremendous in his supporting role as manager and his commentary will keep you laughing robin williams plays a great role as a quick wit jon stewart and will <UNK> you if you are fans of comedy central the show is good because if the viewer has half a brain they will see it as a very needed sub cultural attack on the <UNK> of the current <UNK> government and a criticism on the american <UNK> process not to mention the means by which most politicians get elected br br i was amused at the sub plots and found the film to be very fast paced and entertaining without any of the usual oh brother's i would agree the film is less comedy than <UNK> however without question better than 90 of the garbage in theatres at present just my thoughts don
<START> oz is the tv show which is <UNK> non stop <UNK> its a show which is not aimed at a large audience but a specific one as its themes are very adult <UNK> it obviously did not achieve mainstream success as this was an <UNK> but had much fame with its audience and many famous actors either guest starred or became part of the show br br oz is a series of fictional stories based on a prison located somewhere in the new york state there are many different ethnic groups which play a somewhat equal role in being represented these groups are the muslims <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> italians <UNK> irish christians gays and others some have some form of <UNK> with each other such as the <UNK> and <UNK> whilst the <UNK> are the <UNK> of numerous groups such as the muslims and the <UNK> br br in <UNK> its official name there is a policy that not too many members from any one ethnic group may be allowed it is the maximum security prison and the regular prison where sometimes prisoners are sent to or from in the show is called general population or gen pop the main character of the show is <UNK> hill who also <UNK> the story before and after the main segments crossed between a documentary type and a <UNK> one hill is bound to wheelchair usage as a consequence of his unknown past he is part of the others group which features individuals which don't fit into the other prison gangs br br of the many groups it is the smaller ones which are able to keep themselves avoided by trouble most of the times as the larger ones are busy in conflict with one another are few of the most noteworthy characters are as follows 1 ryan <UNK> is in charge of his fellow <UNK> and somehow always <UNK> gets himself involved in lethal activity for the weakest link 2 <UNK> <UNK> is the watched latino who has constant struggles with <UNK> with his popularity within his own gang and with others 3 simon is the who was the former leader of the <UNK> gang hes also very physically quite large and solid these two reasons are why he is one of the most powerful inmates inside of oz 4 said is the muslim and black <UNK> who is a very defined in his opinions and desires he fights for the rights of his people on many levels through the show from his own muslim group to his wider black group and even fighting for all the groups against the <UNK> rules of authority he character seems in some ways identical to <UNK> x the famous black rights fighter who was also muslim br br all in all for its genre oz is possibly the greatest fictional prison show or show based on ethnic relations if it doesn't sound as if your own type of series it probably shouldn't be tried out but if it does interest then it is definitely worth viewing the biggest problem with the show is how it is <UNK> some may feel wrong viewing a lot of this kind of material <UNK> argue on whether it is <UNK> or not but in the end it is just a reflection of the society of the world we live in today this means that it is as an <UNK> and an <UNK> of the world than an <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> r r <UNK> is one of the best <UNK> and <UNK> cartoons unlike the many repetitive cartoons in the series which simply transplant the same tired gags to a new setting <UNK> r r <UNK> makes the most of its concept <UNK> and <UNK> are domestic pets who are being sent <UNK> across country by train with both a <UNK> official and a vicious <UNK> to deal with <UNK> has his work cut out the <UNK> and <UNK> cartoons always <UNK> from some extra participants and <UNK> r r <UNK> is a good example of how much these additional characters help although they are not especially memorable creations they throw some more obstacles in <UNK> path and make for a more interesting battle this early <UNK> and <UNK> short <UNK> many of the right buttons and while <UNK> is often particularly irritating with his forced <UNK> there's some deliciously violent antics between <UNK> and the dog culminating in a surprisingly brutal climax which is unfortunately marred by a final unfunny non <UNK> by <UNK>
<START> normally i don't bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that i forget almost as soon as i see it but since i saw this movie just yesterday on one of the <UNK> showtime channels i think i decided to make an exception br br besides the fact that i enjoyed watching carol <UNK> i can't give any rational reason why i watched this movie through to the end i'm always amazed that good looking women are willing to appear in awful movies like this but i suppose she thought this movie would lead to something better i hope she was right for her sake br br otherwise this is an all too typical straight to video laugh riot or just a piece of garbage depending on your point of view while there are a few decent moments of action in this movie they don't really connect well with the story such as it is br br the setup as i recall involved carol <UNK> as a depressed housewife who believes her husband a cop is cheating on her there was also something about their child dying in an accident and she <UNK> him for it but before that storyline went anywhere she shot and killed him br br on the same <UNK> night a wounded stranger comes to her door and she tends to him and almost immediately her house is under siege by government stooges and <UNK> intent on capturing the stranger who appears to have almost <UNK> fighting skills br br this same kind of material has <UNK> decent entertainment plenty of times before most notably in matt <UNK> the bourne identity and could have done so this time as well but this particular movie was let down by poor production values and a lousy script br br this movie really falls apart at the end when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg who was <UNK> to be a policeman and after discovering that carol <UNK> killed her husband he tries to kill her the movie wasn't particularly good up until this point but the ending really ruins it by trying to turn a modest action thriller into a <UNK> terminator <UNK> wannabe br br i also thought that the violence in the movie was a bit excessive at the end with the demented cyborg <UNK> out poor carol eye before it finally bit the dust what was the point of that for that matter what was the point of anything in this movie it held my attention and entertained me for about an hour until the end when it reminded me that i wasn't watching a first rate movie it wasn't even really a second rate movie for that matter br br the final scenes seem to hint at a sequel which i don't think ever happened although i haven't carefully checked the web for it needless to say that i'm not in any hurry to see any sequel to this movie
<START> in <UNK> we see b actress <UNK> <UNK> at her very best she's all wrapped in horror suspense here a type of role that suits her very well br br this mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from paul verhoeven's <UNK> <UNK> 1992 by the way however there are differences between the main female characters of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and that of sharon stone <UNK> for instance in <UNK> <UNK> adds some tiny elements from her porn past we also shouldn't forget mentioning three main actors by putting down a convincing performance each of them greatly contributes to the overall quality of this movie br br all this makes <UNK> into a very enjoyable b movie its storyline shows a good build up its tense being well spread from start to finish this movie keeps you at the edge of your seat until its unexpected end
<START> two movies the fifth element <UNK> the same subject to save the world the same main actor bruce willis one difference <UNK> is very inferior to luc <UNK> film some spectacular special effects don't succeed in hiding a <UNK> and <UNK> conventional screenplay several parts of the movie are showing it i think about the <UNK> speech and especially <UNK> relationship with his daughter grace at the beginning of the movie he tends to neglect and her and this makes her weary then at the end of the movie it's true love and understanding that shine in him on another hand the movie falls in the following trap michael bay takes his subject too seriously of course the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn't work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low level whereas in the fifth element the humor was zany <UNK> and <UNK> to overlook the serious side of the action the movie suffers from two other <UNK> it often falls into the ridiculous the russian astronaut and almost all the actors are bad used bruce willis is all the contrary of his fifth element 's character he plays the he man he <UNK> it up and sometimes he's unbearable the other actors are barely credible in their own roles particularly <UNK> sinking crew it seems that this crew is here just for having fun one of them is taken for being very <UNK> but he looks like a fool and poor <UNK> tyler she's at the <UNK> just to be <UNK> br br when the movie was released in france in august 1998 bruce willis expressed is <UNK> of saving the world his <UNK> was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie
<START> hollywood has <UNK> out yet another garbage that's wildly <UNK> and <UNK> on a first time viewing basis <UNK> is bad terrible inept lame <UNK> idiotic contrived laughable and utterly atrocious no pun intended minor spoilers follow br br this movie has huge logic holes more than any bruckheimer bay movie or for that matter any movie that <UNK> the <UNK> of hollywood exaggeration it's a slick hollywood production designed to cash in on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> directed by so somber he takes this way too seriously hack director <UNK> scott and produced by a hack italian producer with an <UNK> ego whose <UNK> is doesn't matter whether film is s t money is good br br i can't get over the fact that acclaimed screenwriters david mamet and steven wrote this tripe adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good novelist turned hack author thomas harris david and steven well known and immensely talented screenwriters wasted their effort on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat <UNK> another factor in the disappointment of this film br br there are too many ludicrous scenes to list that are laughable in clunky execution and poor logic e g <UNK> cell phone in the midst of <UNK> pursuit that turns up inspector as the victim not to mention laughably bad dialogues delivered by tony hopkins with a <UNK> and <UNK> moore ray liotta and others who cannot act with the straight face hopkins gives the true meaning of scenery chewing along with hammy acting by gary <UNK> as a <UNK> psychopath bent on <UNK> revenge against <UNK> br br the gore effect is good but only serves to <UNK> rather than provide suspense which is notably absent from <UNK> the predecessor silence of the <UNK> is more believable with tension and suspense suspense is what made silence of the <UNK> work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller not to mention superbly written and <UNK> directed the brain dinner sequence is so laughably fake it borders on self parody br br the ending is kinda blatant and idiotic are we supposed to believe that <UNK> is still a menace to society with the last shot establishing his <UNK> eye glaring at you <UNK> scary br br
<START> i went to see this movie tonight trying to keep an open mind i had hoped to enjoy a movie that i expected to be different from the book there were considerable differences from the book much like the changes made in the code i went to see the code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film in spite of the changes from the book it was still enjoyable filled with action and the process of <UNK> the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating unfortunately angels and demons disappointed on almost every level throughout the movie symbols are found and figured out quickly without any interest for the viewer they blow past the various symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work the final symbol which was the most interesting and creative one in the book was replaced with the crossed keys symbol in my opinion that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols which is what the <UNK> character is all about overall this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book and fails at the attempt to be an action movie thriller 4 out of 10
<START> well as the <UNK> suggests this is not the particularly good movie i was hoping it would be i thought it would be great with mr fully monty man himself but <UNK> not from the beginning i literally lost interest immediately when 2 women are just making tea and then suddenly she points out there is random water coming from under the door then <UNK> a full on <UNK> through the route of the house its hard to believe they didn't notice the rising water level outside or at least heard it sorry for this to sound like a rant but it really <UNK> my <UNK> and has affected me most acting was poor and the story tried to copy nearly every cliché to each disaster movie ever but just failed in that sense cgi was poor i could do a better job using ms paint directing poor too and at the end i didn't care about 1 character at all don't waste your time people no wonder it was released straight to dvd well thanks for reading <UNK>
<START> this depiction of <UNK> japanese forces in the is a tour de force in the utter <UNK> of war it is an effective representation of japanese <UNK> views after <UNK> ii in the movie japanese soldiers have been left to <UNK> for themselves in the <UNK> of the faced with impending <UNK> they resort to <UNK> and gradually lose what little humanity they have left to call this film depressing would be something of an understatement the viewer is left with an utterly <UNK> sense of life's lost value in modern combat the final scene is almost too <UNK> but the film is a worthy statement none the less highly recommended
<START> directed by albert <UNK> in his awful but strangely hypnotic style crazy six is yet another jewel in the crown for this <UNK> <UNK> hugo <UNK> jess franco stylish <UNK> incoherent plotting time outs in the middle of action sequences for torch song performances all these seem to be <UNK> traits for our man <UNK> most interesting is how he always gets top notch b movie casts compared to <UNK> or some of the other video directors ice t rob lowe mario van <UNK> the very strange burt reynolds ain't a bad cast though they often look a bit confused check out <UNK> mean guns <UNK> doom for more top notch <UNK> mayhem
<START> james <UNK> arguably could write some of the best sentences in the english language and his short story the dead which ends his collection the <UNK> its the most perfect paragraph in the english language it's fitting that john huston who held back in attempting to film this story ended his career with it as with the red <UNK> of courage and the man who would be king huston <UNK> the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic and with the dead which was completed after <UNK> death by his son tony huston we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema br br <UNK> all that cinema can do as one of the <UNK> points out this isn't the african queen nor does it need to be this is the kind of movie that is <UNK> for an audience all of us through portrait of an artist in school and one needs to bring the maturity of <UNK> how words and images in and of themselves can touch us as with silent films huston seeks something pure here and he works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world a masterpiece that equals <UNK> original br br many veterans of the irish theater world are <UNK> to bring the story of a man filled with self importance and mock self doubt that's <UNK> by the <UNK> of an <UNK> party on the eve of the feast of the <UNK> what's in store for gabriel <UNK> is an evening of celebration song dance poetry where he's asked to give the <UNK> <UNK> to the two sisters and their niece who host the party he's distracted by the task wanting to rise to the occasion and this distraction leaves him vulnerable for an earth shattering experience handed to him by his wife while his ego is <UNK> when he hears a story from his wife's past it's also a gift where all that seems to have <UNK> throughout the evening is swept away by the realization of impending <UNK> for all who are living br br and rather than trying to make the last famous paragraph of the story cinematic huston brings in a voice over and we hear those incredible words <UNK> as we watch the snow falling <UNK> through the universe and <UNK> falling it's the perfect solution to a <UNK> adaptation br br the cast is all we would hope since this is basically a testament to the power of the written word and how it brings us together through common experience each performer seems <UNK> by their role <UNK> huston as <UNK> <UNK> has a wide range to play and her account of a young boy who once loved her <UNK> not only gabriel <UNK> but the audience as well br br when i think of <UNK> huston it's the transformation she makes in this film and when i think of her father it's this film i remember first
<START> maybe i saw a <UNK> up version but other than a few flashes of breasts i'm not sure what over the top nudity these other <UNK> are referring to br br all in all not as bad as i was expecting by the previous comments although the end leaves you wondering wtf it was dark but not so much that you couldn't make out the scenes and i think it just added to the creepiness and the terror of the situation br br film quality could have been better but the acting was pretty decent br br all in all a <UNK> creepy and yes brutal movie with a disappointing ending
<START> would you be surprised if i told you this movie deals with a conspiracy no how about if i told you the <UNK> was a shadow puppet what you don't believe me ok yes i made that up it's too bad this movie could have used a sense of humor i understand charlie sheen doing this at the time another movie <UNK> more money as for donald sutherland and linda hamilton why don't even get me started on stephen lang he was so much fun as the party <UNK> in 'the hard <UNK> and now this junk br br ah no matter everyone involved should feel ashamed if you aim to make a bad movie and succeed it's twisted but i seriously doubt that was what they were aiming for here flat out the story stinks and we're actually supposed to take this <UNK> seriously makes you wonder if this movie even had a <UNK> of hope seriously i doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me maybe even more scary is how this dog pile made it's way to theaters br br oh sam <UNK> how great you are in law order why are you here yourself to the role of the president of the united states who might i add gets to be shot at by a remote control <UNK> controlled by the <UNK> assassin then again this is a masterpiece of work from george p <UNK> who's directing credits include rambo first blood part ii amongst other gems hmm case in point
<START> not as bad as some people say this is a <UNK> bond movie and a remake of <UNK> written by kevin co producer in <UNK> well the cast is very very interesting maria <UNK> is a great bond villain kim basinger and barbara <UNK> are just like the original bond girls plus <UNK> <UNK> and a truly great edward fox who looks really refreshing in the m role in fact the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new <UNK> sean connery does it once more confident and charming except that he looks a little bit too old but alright he is the original bond and it was great to see him once more in this role the locations are also typical <UNK> france etc the only thing that really fails is the music score the song never say never again is o k but the theme song is just missing all in one a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly roger moore movies like <UNK> only if there was another story <UNK> was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake
<START> from the weeks and weeks of promotion for this <UNK> the one was supposed to be the real world meets american idol we were to watch these singers perform compete and see how they lived together in a house as well the drama the tension br br where does one begin with this atrocity let's start with the judges who were known as music experts on this program experts implies they have expertise andre at least had a <UNK> he was in charge of <UNK> records for a time the other two eh kate <UNK> uncle who could have been labeled mr weird beard he <UNK> his facial hair three distinctly different <UNK> colors i wonder how scary he would have been with a black light and the paula <UNK> wannabe who did something i didn't think could happen she was even more <UNK> and <UNK> than paula she then over <UNK> and became <UNK> critical after the first episode the farce of <UNK> that these three offered was a true joke and an insult not only to the process of finding the best singer but to the audience that is now quite <UNK> already having done this numerous times on fox br br there was the host george was no ryan in fact he was as lackluster as can be he actually sucked what little energy there was in the program dry how he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show br br the first was how did they pick the 11 <UNK> for this program this was literally a talent free talent show ok perhaps that's an exaggeration and granted the performers all have to be relatively close in ability because if they were not there wouldn't be a contest if only one person was good there would be no suspense so i get that they all needed to be comparable but they all should have had some chops additionally the judges were running a singing academy so the program was part fame as well clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons but you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented and that definitely wasn't what was happening here br br it seemed in casting the show the <UNK> was on the <UNK> elements as all of the players were very attractive to look at in equal parts to how badly they but the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and <UNK> you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen so the show didn't capture the events there either br br as badly <UNK> as all of that was the one had an incredible unbelievable fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable br br the audience <UNK> in their votes for who they liked the best just like on <UNK> but then after the audience vote was revealed the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song the music experts based on that performance chose one person from the three to save for the following week and then the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two sending the remaining contestant home br br the design flaw was that the contestants had the final say i mean if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could would you vote to keep the better singer or would you try to get rid of your <UNK> rival any first season viewer of <UNK> survivor could answer that one and that's exactly what happened on the program the person who had the better potential was lost and the contestants voted back the one who had no talent at all on top of that the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the experts was also allowed to vote against the remaining two it was a complete farce br br maybe if they let the contestants vote first at least the experts would save the better of two <UNK> to finish but this just <UNK> how not ready this show was for broadcast how unsatisfying the whole process was to view and how misguided the producers were in attempting it
<START> i have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except <UNK> me completely it's <UNK> with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over 40 years old the story never really seems to make much sense especially when played by tommy lee jones starts having his conversations with <UNK> general john bell hood i never really did figure that out jones was ok in his role although i thought he was really starting to show his age here horribly miscast was john goodman as julie baby feet who i guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure i simply didn't think goodman worked in this role although i'll admit that just could be because i'm not much of a john goodman fan somewhere in the mix appeared <UNK> as an fbi agent although i never really did understand what the fbi was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen if it was explained though i missed it completely fortunately this is a fairly short movie so you won't waste too much of your life on it 2 10
<START> for those who remember this <UNK> initial impact it will never be forgotten and a viewing of thriller is all that's needed to feel twelve years old again but while it's a great video it's not perfect even though it seemed like it at the time when this video first came out nobody had ever seen anything like it before now the music video medium has grown by leaps and <UNK> and a fresh viewing of thriller will reveal its faults why was it necessary to <UNK> the song when michael jackson is walking beside the girl after they leave the movie theatre he sings all the <UNK> of the song skipping the after he becomes a zombie when it comes time for him to sing again his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears and he sings the chorus again and again and again as if to make up for its previous absence this may have been the first time a song had ever been <UNK> to fit the visuals in a music video but it certainly wasn't the last time it has continued to be a problem in the age of mtv the best videos like jackson's <UNK> jean and beat it have used visuals to serve the music not the other way around still thriller is great fun and an absolute must on halloween
<START> having sat and watched this film i can only wonder at the reasons for creating the film this was without a doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen and had no redeeming features br br if it was supposed to be funny then it might have managed to be a very weak comedy but as an action thriller it was dire br br slow no plot no real action nothing approaching good dialogue and i've no idea about the characters what else can i say avoid
<START> i'm giving it a three instead of the lower number it deserves because of its history a full length movie made by high school students it shows too but that's part of the charm and appeal get <UNK> of some of the stuff george lucas did at <UNK> this is better maybe due to being a group effort br br a monster made of toxic waste and too much garbage these kids were way ahead of their time starts <UNK> the town of during a high school dance the monster destroys randomly leaving garbage and <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie has local tv and radio people the mayor the samuel high school principal and a whole bunch of the high school students and their parents not to mention the <UNK> daughter as the <UNK> br br dumb yeah fun yeah great screen writing c'mon they're <UNK> high copy that comment for the acting cinematography directing et <UNK> br br is right next to san jose in the heart of <UNK> valley maybe one of the graphics geniuses there will update the video somehow now there's a challenge
<START> this was a great anime true the animation is old but its still worth watching and has a better plot than ninja <UNK> the problem that it was kinda long br br japanese movie star <UNK> <UNK> who played from last samurai played the main character and it was directed by <UNK> who did galaxy express <UNK> and metropolis br br the anime has some good animation for an old anime interesting characters like the main villain and <UNK> and of course lets not forget the beautiful musical scores in the film br br all in all this movie is worth watching for fans of anime animation in general action and samurai ninja flicks despite the <UNK> in the film that didn't the film from being a great film to watch br br don't miss this film
<START> i was looking forward to this movie as everyone was talking about it as being a good horror movie and finally an european one so maybe my expectations were to high br br it begins with a good quiet horror shock sequence but it lets you down right away in the following scenes where the plot begin being introduced as the acting and the motivation life of the characters reveals itself no better than any <UNK> for <UNK> drama it keeps that way right into the end br br about the horror part of the movie it is certainly a good idea and a different one but all the scenes are of the it <UNK> kind br br overall my idea of this movie was that it had a good concept which was inserted into a mediocre story bad acting and less than tolerable plot holes br br
<START> i really liked this film not so much for the story which was okay but was a bit slow moving in spots but <UNK> for the incredibly beautiful scenery of <UNK> and the greek <UNK> susan sarandon is utterly engaging as the <UNK> love interest of john cassavetes a man on the edge but the scenery oh oh oh
<START> most people attending this film will have no idea of the great novel by arthur miller that is the basis of it it's a novel that should be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and <UNK> peoples lives br br at the beginning lawrence newman is an ordinary man the <UNK> his boss makes him get change everything he has worked for and his whole world <UNK> around him little by little there couldn't have been an actor better suited to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than william h macy not only is he a talented stage and screen actor but he projects honesty behind every character he plays he is an everyday man caught in his own <UNK> his anxiety <UNK> when he takes a stand and walks out of his job suddenly he has to confront the issues he has tried to avoid all his middle class existence in the brooklyn of the 40s is he jewish is he not the cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film directed with sure hand by neil kept reminding me of some edward <UNK> paintings especially a sequence at the beginning of the film when newman steps outside a building and the night shot when he and his wife are being followed with long black shadows behind the couple menacing and <UNK> the confrontation with the bullies laura dern david <UNK> and especially meat <UNK> who <UNK> incredible depth to the bully next door are excellent but they all pale in comparison with the stellar turn of william h macy h must stand for honest if you haven't read the book i would sincerely recommend it because no one has written more truly and convincingly than arthur miller has
<START> just finished watching the trailers intrigued me so much i actually went to see it on opening weekend something i never do needless to say i was very disappointed the story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up i really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and matthew <UNK> first off i am not a <UNK> <UNK> i thought he was awesome in both reign of fire and lone star i enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3 4 times yes we all get it that he a good looking guy with a nice body but i think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in a time to kill showing him with his shirt off <UNK> iron like a <UNK> madman 3 4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary i think one time would have been sufficient it wouldn't surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling unless enough about that let's get into his role i feel his acting was very forced and he didn't seem very comfortable i know his character was supposed to be this charming <UNK> but his lines were corny and cheesy it was almost like he was <UNK> days and confused lines a few times in short i didn't like his character even though i was supposed to the accent his shirt off corny pick up lines weak sales <UNK> his character was just too much of a tool as brandon or jonathan pacino and <UNK> were great but <UNK> no surprise <UNK> is fun to watch as <UNK> i mean jerry i just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly it's insulting that they could take a great story and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success 1 cool story that appeals to the male man 2 hunky hollywood actor for female women make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off <UNK> <UNK> 3 al pacino with 4 great speech scenes and 25 great one liners 3 every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars <UNK> and have an extremely dark <UNK> 4 jeremy <UNK> to play the same character he did in <UNK> and old school 4 throw in <UNK> <UNK> to seal the deal 5 plot good writing character development and intelligent casting are unnecessary br br this will be good enough for most people but not me anybody who <UNK> with me ask your self this would this movie be much better if a directed by <UNK> b <UNK> or ed norton as brandon instead of <UNK> br br i will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks i realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of pacino <UNK> a fake tear while <UNK> russo the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing the movie going public gets what the movie going public wants big budget <UNK>
<START> an intelligent and well <UNK> film worth to <UNK> br br in this <UNK> and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in you can feel the total meaning of the word <UNK> although is a <UNK> film the title is in presented in english br br the story is about nicolas <UNK> a photographer who find his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> having an affair with his boss <UNK> victor owner of a magazine after this nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job nicolas revenge to consists in following him and <UNK> photographs of him with his new affair alexandra <UNK> <UNK> to blackmail in order to obtain money in change for not showing the photographs to <UNK> br br the story is really intelligent and well related to the point that you'll understand fully the meaning of the title the movie shows a thriller with a lot of a comic scenes and characters resulting in a real pleasure to someone that enjoy the movies focused on a good script br br i stand out here that this film is different from the typical <UNK> movies that show's some dark and violent image of our beautiful country which is something really refreshing some critics say that this story don't show <UNK> typical way of living so it could be held in any part of the world i disagree with this 1 the movie is totally filmed in so you can see streets and images of the real <UNK> capital i hope that some american people and movie producers watch this so they stop showing jungle or mexican little towns in <UNK> as on some hollywood movies 2 the characters dialogs accent with exception from nicolas that is from <UNK> are totally from here <UNK> <UNK> has an accent typical from <UNK> 3 you can also see social and cultural differences from the common people in i hope that all this plus an english title move people from other countries to watch this masterpiece of <UNK> br br excellent acting of <UNK> luis <UNK> detective wilson <UNK> outstanding as detective <UNK> <UNK> and good acting of <UNK> and <UNK> br br a movie worth to <UNK> that people from around the globe will surely understand and enjoy don't miss this movie 9 10
<START> <UNK> by the 7 0 points in imdb which is pretty good i decided to watch this movie however i found this movie quiet boring about 2 hours and full of clichés a little girl getting multiple personalities after a childhood trauma etc <UNK> <UNK> is quiet funny in this movie dialogs motions etc you will have to see it he is kinda the tough cop you see on american movies perhaps copied too much i would describe this movie as ordinary american thriller with a little bit of turkish touch unfortunately yet again i'm convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in turkish cinema anyways i gave this movie a 4 its too boring and full of clichés
<START> the movie was very good i'm an avid mystery fan and i usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing while i did figure out who was going to be killed i didn't figure out who did it i wasn't happy with the portrayal of the <UNK> character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that please know that while these <UNK> movies are good they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have <UNK> ms <UNK> and especially <UNK> david <UNK> is definitely <UNK> i have seen every actor who's played him the worst was peter ustinov
<START> this movie rips off of every mobster gangster film ever made <UNK> da last don has a reference to every movie the acting was by far the worst i have every seen who the hell is john mario anyway his acting was by far the worst i have ever seen he makes bad actors look good as far as master p goes he's selling out <UNK> than an n sync concert i really wish i was there to tell the whole production company what the hell were you thinking when <UNK> the script obviously these people are so <UNK> on the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and live out their gangster lives for real in their minds one thing i do know is that there wasn't anyone who wanted to <UNK> this film so it seems and how predictable that the guys at no limit had to start no limit films i've said enough this movie is terrible and it does not deserve to be called a movie
<START> critics love this movie i personally found it senseless and tasteless this is the <UNK> time i've fallen into the critics love it trap and came out wishing someone would throw <UNK> hot water on my <UNK> because it was less painful than watching the movie there are many scenes that are completely unnecessary a warning to animal lovers don't see this movie if you don't want to see sheep killed and <UNK> br br if you want to see a good asian film see <UNK> if you want to see a film about escaped <UNK> see the gene wilder richard <UNK> classic stir crazy avoid 9 souls like the plague
<START> i bought this out of curiosity how did john carradine who died in 1988 and cameron mitchell who died in 1994 make appearances in a film made in 1995 thanks to the miracle of <UNK> film can footage that's probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years that's how you can tell because the film stock used to shoot their scenes doesn't match the film used for shooting jack o the curse of ed wood lives on the good thing for both carradine and mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you'd expect to find on both of their <UNK> same goes for scream queens <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stevens and dawn <UNK> br br the setting is crossing on halloween and some kind of curse is released when dumb beer <UNK> teens <UNK> a grave the result a <UNK> killer with a <UNK> and a big plastic <UNK> on his head he it goes after the wholesome kelly family for revenge and kills others who get in his way the father opens a haunted garage for the neighborhood <UNK> the son ryan son of the director has one continuous <UNK> facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously badly acted dramatic scene lying in a grave at least he's a kid the mother's eyes about pop out of her head while she <UNK> to read her dialogue there is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to <UNK> <UNK> all of her dialogue br br so what about the name actors you see stevens <UNK> and mitchell briefly on a tv screen they're used to pad out the time <UNK> has a bigger role as a babysitter and she does exactly what she can with it her enthusiastic performance helps a little bit there's also one out of nowhere laugh when an ultra conservative couple who watch a rush <UNK> clone on tv bite it the woman slips on a <UNK> and stabs a <UNK> with a knife she's <UNK> and the end result looks like a flame <UNK> muppet br br all and all pretty entertaining stuff i wasn't bored
<START> barbara <UNK> is the suppose to be <UNK> sexy young hot wife of the <UNK> plantation owner somewhere in a back lot set at a cheap studio in hollywood raymond <UNK> wears his working shirt with the top button <UNK> as the hunky <UNK> plantation <UNK> who mrs <UNK> is <UNK> to blow the joint with there is another girl some sort of <UNK> slave thing that <UNK> used to fool around with but he's given her the old <UNK> ho so the obligatory old doo <UNK> is <UNK> up a good spell to cast on him and the <UNK> tramp i watched this only part way through because its really awful so didn't even get to see the star of the show which i guess is a gorilla that the doo <UNK> turned someone into or whatever who cares i give this one half star out of a possible ten it's not even campy just really bad
<START> a space ship <UNK> through the galaxy encounters a mysterious <UNK> ship apparently <UNK> in space the crew <UNK> hoping to lay claim to its <UNK> and <UNK> the ship however once aboard the ominous <UNK> their own ship mysteriously leaving them to <UNK> for themselves and battle none other then count dracula or <UNK> as this creature calls himself br br not a bad start i mean it follows any number of typical sci fi horror plots the genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably <UNK> comparison to some other film but when you start with a fairly typical horror convention the legend of dracula and vampires in general and combine it with a fairly typical sci fi convention a crew happening upon something and becoming <UNK> to battle whatever they're forced to confront the filmmakers better have some clever up their <UNK> to <UNK> their own mark on the familiar genre <UNK> br br director <UNK> <UNK> who also wrote dracula 3000 with <UNK> is primarily responsible for this utter failure so no <UNK> and have nothing up their <UNK> but their arms br br this film begins <UNK> enough with a very poorly delivered voice over by <UNK> van <UNK> essentially providing enough exposition to explain who the crew on his ship are i should also point out that van character is named van <UNK> and oh so very cleverly this <UNK> character is from planet <UNK> in the <UNK> system no kidding i mean come on guys we get it and again don't be goofy and use such names unless you got something special in store br br so after van <UNK> introduction of the crew we have essentially a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking about br br i'm a very <UNK> viewer when it comes to low budget films occasionally they can be brilliant see <UNK> first two evil dead films dracula 3000 had a decent budget enough for some decent special effects and for the <UNK> of 3rd like van <UNK> erika <UNK> <UNK> etc however unlike the evil dead flicks there is no talent behind the camera in front of the camera the talent is <UNK> but i'm going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt it really seems like they don't know what to do the best actor of the bunch alexandra <UNK> gets killed off quickly and the ever enjoyable <UNK> <UNK> is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video <UNK> grant is also okay as the professor but it's hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair and yes it's a wheel chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it as for the rest of the actors i'm sure <UNK> really tried to be scary after getting turned into a vampire but well i don't think irritating qualifies as scary in most people's book tiny <UNK> and erika <UNK> don't really provide much either <UNK> is never really more then the <UNK> big <UNK> black stereotype <UNK> actually appears unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard <UNK> is a pretty girl even in her mid thirties but looks a little worn out and <UNK> for the movie's duration br br this brings us to count dracula <UNK> played by <UNK> to be honest i can't recall who exactly the vampire is supposed to be he introduces himself as <UNK> but at some point he <UNK> himself as count dracula as well go figure in any case you will be absolutely <UNK> by just how lame this vampire is have you ever scene those cheesy horror show <UNK> local networks would have on their creature feature time <UNK> yes it's that bad <UNK> the actor playing must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit i'm sure he's still getting <UNK> by his friends br br there isn't much to the plot the vampire is the last of it's kind and wants to go to earth for some reason and also there is some lip service about wanting to defeat <UNK> van character van <UNK> most of the crew get turned into vampires including van <UNK> and the crew use conventional machine guns and <UNK> to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine yeah that's right bullets and yes the year 3000 keeping in that <UNK> vein one of the main areas the crew hole themselves up in while battling the vampires or vampire since there is really never more then one threatening them is filled with old soviet posters and <UNK> and such what the there are also references to god religion being <UNK> systems but these references only confused me did the soviet union make a comeback is there some point <UNK> and want to make with this it never really goes anywhere seems dumb and the posters etc just look cheap br br on the positive side the film is competently shot and edited the cinematography is nothing spectacular but it's clearly done by professionals and i had no problem with the special effects the ships look like ships in outer space although as i write this i recall how god awful the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him what were they thinking why didn't someone say something see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without falling back on the <UNK> i guess ultimately that's the thing whatever <UNK> you try and grant this sci fi horror <UNK> you become overwhelmed by it's lack of quality br br poor <UNK> <UNK>
<START> brilliant work marvelous actors <UNK> as brave and courageous characters all unforgettable parts in a more than intriguing and capturing action the casting is perfect both from the side of the stars like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but as well for new faces i was very impressed by the young actor who plays the boy gang member <UNK> you trust each one from the turkish gang very convincing is michael and all white power followers i admire the music beat of the main theme of children of wax this sound track is a charming mixture of turkish hard rock and <UNK> and in the same time children of wax a tale focusing on racial conflicts the <UNK> and brutality between the <UNK> and the <UNK>
<START> alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be <UNK> compared to him br br the main subject of this <UNK> vehicle all the ideas almost everything was already in hitchcock's classic rope the two students who commit a gratuitous crime <UNK> philosophy and the clues that the boys <UNK> the master was the first to transfer them to the screen and with an <UNK> minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force br br murder by numbers does not take place in a single room like the rope mind you and what a supreme originality it <UNK> two cops against the evil youngsters and you would never guess it these two cops are very different actually <UNK> plays the part of woman living like a man and her partner chaplin is as shy as a clueless <UNK> the two <UNK> performances are not really mind <UNK> not as good as say that of edward norton in primal fear br br well you know rope was so good
<START> james cagney <UNK> and political ward get to become a deputy <UNK> of <UNK> and visits a boys <UNK> school the catch is that cagney is not in it for the <UNK> he genuinely wants to make a difference in the lives of the kids there because he comes from a background like <UNK> br br the villain of the piece is dudley <UNK> who is a <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> to boot one of the <UNK> of the plot of the mayor of hell is that these kids are mostly immigrants and those that judge them and are in positions of power are those who are here a few generations note in the mess hall scene as <UNK> offers a <UNK> of thanks for the food they are about to receive <UNK> is eating well but the kids are getting quality you wouldn't feed to your pet br br cagney has his own troubles back in the city with some of his henchmen and he has to take it on the <UNK> that puts <UNK> back in charge and setting up the film for it's climax br br the mayor of hell was a typical product from the working class studio and because it was pre code it gets pretty gruesome at times a later version of this crime school with <UNK> bogart and the dead end kids was a more <UNK> remake br br although cagney is fine in the lead role as is <UNK> evans the school nurse the acting <UNK> go to dudley <UNK> hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunken but kindly one <UNK> <UNK> surgeon in <UNK> on the bounty but <UNK> is a fine player and a joy to watch in every film he's in br br this film is not shown to often because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays a whole lot of <UNK> would be offended today still it's a fine film br br interestingly enough a few years ago the film <UNK> came out and it touched on some of the same issues i guess films about <UNK> schools don't change in any time
<START> this movie was supposedly based on a non fiction book i'm not sure what book the script writer s read to write their adaptation but it has absolutely nothing to do with the true life adventures of frances in italy instead it is an uninteresting tale that takes liberties at every <UNK> to bash men note the following examples br br br br spoiler details br br br br bash number one <UNK> husband <UNK> on her and her marriage ends in a divorce br br bash number two lane <UNK> into a local italian town and is promptly <UNK> by every male on the street br br bash number three lane is saved from the horny town folk men by a charming gentlemen she falls for him after an afternoon of love making she later finds out that he's already attached and cheating with her br br bash number four you have to <UNK> your horizon for this one because the reference is definitely is in the movie her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by <UNK> <UNK> i am told that in most lesbian relationships you have one person assuming the female role and another assuming the male role in the movie after the female has been made pregnant the male lesbian decides to run out on the relationship because she can not handle it br br in conclusion this movie has nothing to do with the book that it was supposedly based on
<START> peter lorre turns in one of his finest performances as a hungarian coming to the united to make a new life for himself and someday bring his girl across the big pond to be with him <UNK> <UNK> optimism and bright <UNK> come off very effectively which makes the performance all the better when he has his face <UNK> burned in a hotel fire and when no one will give him a chance to work turns reluctantly to a life of crime <UNK> range as an actor is seldom as apparent as in this movie with his <UNK> good natured immigrant to his depressing <UNK> <UNK> self searching for the truth behind what he believed america <UNK> him to his suave intelligent better than your average hood to his sympathetic <UNK> with a blind woman with whom he falls in love the story is well paced has some interesting twists and gives lorre many opportunities to shine director robert <UNK> does a quality job behind the lens and all of the supporting cast help aid the film with evelyn <UNK> giving a particularly good turn as the blind girl i loved the ending and the truth that was <UNK> to exist in <UNK> character despite all the negative things society had done toward him for a little b picture the man behind the mask is good movie making for its time
<START> hoot is a nice plain movie with a simple message it seemed like that this film was for young children but i know that adults will like this film the storyline is pretty simple a kid who moved to florida must help a soccer jock and an <UNK> save <UNK> <UNK> from construction of a <UNK> house the message in this film is big especially for animal <UNK> and lovers the message is about doing all you can to save <UNK> animals the acting in this film is decent all the three kids looked like they had good chemistry the music is not too <UNK> i liked jimmy songs in this film overall this is a good family film i rate this film a 9 10
<START> a lot of comedy in britain in the 1980s was <UNK> misguided overly political and unfunny and the worst of the comic strip presents stuff fell into this category br br but this is at the other end a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels br br is dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying br br is he telling the truth <UNK> double <UNK> counter <UNK> <UNK> br br i've probably watched 20 or 30 times and i still can't decide 100 that's the wonderful thing br br as well as there are big roles for other early comic strip <UNK> french <UNK> pete richardson <UNK> keith allen <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> though curiously enough not br br all of the comic strip cast however much i disliked the hidden agenda of some of their members are convincing actors and turn in superb performances in this big screen outing while the richardson writing <UNK> work is so often pure genius with nice little touches of detail throughout br br ultimately this is a study of crime <UNK> and human nature in all it's wondrous complexity and very funny with it you will not be disappointed
<START> i read the book in a summer book club and all of us there loved it my friends from that club agreed not to watch the movie <UNK> the book be ruined i didn't agree and watched it recently with my younger brother and my parents br br i was pleasantly surprised the movie was very true to the book without losing it's own spirit the <UNK> <UNK> theme was shown just enough so that we get a feel of it but that's not what the story's about br br the acting wasn't the best i've ever seen but it was still good and the kids especially had a lot of energy the characters were interesting and the plot was cute and not too <UNK> it was a kids movie that works just fine for adults or teenagers too br br i wish there had been a bit more tough girl attitude from <UNK> but she was still a great character <UNK> fingers was quite a bit like i had imagined him except his hair was a little obviously <UNK> with blonde hair and dark <UNK> roy worked very well as the little guy and the new kid especially interactions with his parents and friends br br the message and the ending which i won't discuss other than i liked it teamed up to make a great cheer up movie for a rainy day all in all this was a great film that you can watch again and again whenever you need reminding that the world isn't a horrible place after all
<START> lucille ball cannot sing or act or dance this makes the quality of her performance in <UNK> all the more dreadful she's not allowed to do the low brow slapstick that made her a hit on tv so she has to rely on building a character unfortunately ms ball never learned that skill as none of the tender moments have any warmth how does she really feel about patrick or beau we never really believe the words she says that <UNK> stare of ms ball is suppose to convince us she is <UNK> but there is no chemistry between her and bruce <UNK> robert preston or <UNK> arthur at all for this reason every scene she's in is flat br br moreover when ms ball opens her mouth to sing we are immediately made aware of the reason why the studios dubbed her voice for every other musical she starred in earlier in her career it was stated that she <UNK> her voice be used so this is a mistake of ego as well as <UNK> it is made worse when she is singing in voice over and she has to act the moment without words whoever thought that would work forgot who was playing <UNK> br br i understand that <UNK> russell did the role on stage and in the film <UNK> <UNK> also i am aware that angela lansbury won a tony for her performance in the original 1966 broadway musical neither of these women were known for their singing voices but both could have pulled this off better than lucille ball why they went with her is the worst in blatant <UNK> br br the only person that gets out <UNK> is <UNK> arthur she's big and wonderful <UNK> and common in all the right amounts unfortunately you keep waiting for this movie to take off and invite you to join in on the fun but the film never does and you can't no one besides <UNK> arthur appears to be having any fun br br an additional bad review goes to director gene <UNK> <UNK> is known as an award winning director of musicals and comedies for stage and screen including the broadway musical this film is based on none of that skill and expertise is of aid here the poor editing and storytelling in this movie is beneath a director of his caliber that glaring error in the execution of the movie is not the fault of ms ball
<START> what you bring to the movie influences your view of it i brought 30 years in the air force to this and every time i see it i am moved by the ending would a <UNK> of 15 who's spent their life flying in <UNK> feel the same way yet i can only just its impact on me br br jimmy stewart gives a wonderful turn as jimmy stewart considering he was a pilot and an air force <UNK> general he probably comes as close to being an expert on how a pilot would act as any man alive one can't fault his delivery or his acting he is a pilot being a pilot that's enough br br spoilers br br it's the final minutes of the film that continue to grip my heart <UNK> has been flying without radio communication and has no idea if anyone is even expecting him when he flies into the paris airport the <UNK> of the landing field draws you in what is it below those shifting circles that look like <UNK> or a field of corn must make you wonder is he in the right place they go on and on <UNK> past his vision until he gets low enough and see that in the paris night what he was seeing was the light of the city <UNK> off the faces of the thousands of people waiting for him to land
<START> misguided miscast murky interminable <UNK> given the high <UNK> mgm a budget treatment kate hepburn plays a bride who comes to suspect her rich handsome husband robert taylor is not the <UNK> she married but a psychotic killer <UNK> attempt at a <UNK> thriller is doomed from the start by a turgid muddled ludicrous script and the idiotic casting of hepburn as a <UNK> woman <UNK> for her life who could ever imagine hepburn afraid of anything louis b <UNK> forgot to tell vincent minnelli he was directing a thriller not a musical taylor is embarrassing only robert mitchum also cast against type as a good guy <UNK> his dignity in a quiet low <UNK> performance karl <UNK> ravishing cinematography creates images of eerie beauty and was wasted on the wrong film end result <UNK> of the 1940s
<START> this show is my absolute favorite this show is intelligent entertaining and always full of surprises lauren graham is perfect as <UNK> a single mother who is best friend <UNK> shines as the beautiful and intelligent <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> is one of a kind as best friend lane kim i love the witty dialog it's what makes it unique about the show kelly bishop is wicked great as emily <UNK> and edward is terrific as richard <UNK> scott <UNK> is a joy as luke danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch the community miss patty <UNK> mrs kim taylor kirk and other's are always laugh out loud funny quirky and interesting that always makes the snappy one liners stand out this show has changed so much over the years that it won't ever get old <UNK> girls is an original and clever show that keeps you watching that is how good it is i give this show a 10 10 rating
<START> after watching this movie on a boring saturday afternoon i couldn't quite figure out why so many people liked it it wasn't heartwarming or clever it was merely an <UNK> of every other <UNK> people coming together during a holiday and despite their <UNK> differences learning something about each other movie ever made br br the characters are a stereotype we have the blacks the <UNK> the jews the <UNK> and the <UNK> and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this to do the black mother declares that it's all right then when it's mentioned that another black character is at church instead of helping prepare dinner because all blacks love church the <UNK> seem only capable of speaking spanish when the <UNK> each other or make <UNK> the lesbians do nothing but <UNK> and kiss and one of them wears a because all lesbians dress like <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> family owns a video store in l a imagine that br br oh and the movie is called what's cooking because each ethnic family <UNK> a different version of what they think <UNK> dinner should be the black mother wants and <UNK> and cheese the <UNK> are shown rolling the <UNK> family is deep <UNK> spring rolls i'm surprised there wasn't a bottle of on the jewish table this is all shown via the time <UNK> tradition of the musical montage where they play the rapidly switching the <UNK> used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures isn't that cute anyway once the director is finished establishing how different everyone is he attempts to show the inner humanity that we as all people of every race religion and culture share by <UNK> implausible and overly dramatic conflicts for each of the families to deal with it would be a plot killer to mention what each of these conflicts are but rest assured that they are indeed surprises that is if you have been sleeping for the first half of the movie the theme of <UNK> the family runs pretty strong throughout br br all in all if you're the type of person who enjoys those new <UNK> movies that <UNK> around the stories of unlikely characters <UNK> well you still won't like this movie if you like extended montages of food being passed around a table then you need to put this in your netflix <UNK> but if stereotypes and clichés are endearing to you then make sure you ask for this for christmas or or
<START> the movie is simply horrible 2 10 although actors are trying their best well sometimes that isn't much special effects are let me put it this way it would be better if there weren't any br br the script is based on <UNK> so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie sadly it's the opposite there is nothing left of the original atmosphere and it's all very chaotic maybe they just had too much material to show in <UNK> time br br anyway if you would like to see this film i would recommend you to look for the tv series same title same actors even the plot stays the same that was made in the same time the movie did it is so much better 9 10 and the story there actually make sense
<START> in a tv movie 70's kind of way it's one of those movies that show up in the wee hours but rarely because more modern late hour schlock movies <UNK> it off it has likeable performances by graves and <UNK> generally it's just a harmless little piece of nothing that doesn't offend too badly nothing good a lot that's mediocre
<START> this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life they said this was the man's answer to waiting to <UNK> all i'm going to say is that we really didn't respond at all i couldn't believe that it was actually made the director should choose another profession because he can't make a movie the script wasn't good it made no sense and was very messy bet movies are much better than this was and i was horribly disappointed to see the talented actor <UNK> in this bad excuse of a movie if i could turn back the hands of time i wouldn't go back to media play to never buy the movie i would just keep it wrapped sitting on the shelf instead of wasting my time watching it
<START> i was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story the majority of the scenes looked fake to me for instance when the one girl was eating her <UNK> and there was a roach in it while she was eating the <UNK> the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it it's funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the <UNK> when the girl was eating it another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should i say it was thrown out to give it effect this movie was not realistic at all it's highly <UNK> that the events that happened were true that evening when the st experiment took place i believe that the house may be haunted but not on the night this movie was filmed the ending was amusing when tim and and other girl were <UNK> down in the some sort of basement paul and madison found them and rescued them i would rather watch the blair witch project again then have to sit through the st experiment movie again as i said if the makers of the movie did not state that this was a true story with true events i may have like it more your better off getting more entertainment from the blair witch project even though this is not a true story either
<START> it has very little to do with the books half of the characters have been eliminated the plot has been greatly altered people's parents are changed for different characters br br however if you watch it as an independent piece try and forget you ever read the books the movie is very well put together everyone is very good looking and there is even a sweet ending
<START> i think the problem with some reactions to this film is that with few exceptions they don't focus on the main <UNK> hence the main split in the audience br br on the one side there are those who are taken by the visual design pretty costumes and variety of elements going into the film some children's movie fans love the colour and animation and all the un scary effects <UNK> animals and so on some culture <UNK> like the complicated references the of different <UNK> elements and the fact that they can watch zhang <UNK> singing and quasi <UNK> in two different languages in what really was intended to be a children's comedy br br on the other side there are those who say that a children's movie should still have a point that a blend of is not a tale at all and that it's easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone into the technical aspects to make it seem real br br in other words the ideas could be lovely but when you put them <UNK> they have to deliver here they don't br br a good from any country has a clear story a point and characters who interact strongly with each other this lacks them all a few over sophisticated gestures to opera western and japanese are no replacement for a solid theme br br as a fantasy fan i must say that i've sat through some <UNK> and loved a few but this one really tries to do too many things cheaply putting in zhang <UNK> to try to add a little <UNK> <UNK> of exotic flower syndrome the other problem isn't that there's no plot there's half a plot which means that you keep getting pulled in then dropped again as another none too <UNK> executed dance number kicks off br br the characters all seem to know that they're starring in a movie unless you really like watching other <UNK> amateur video this ain't good i'd like to test this on real children i think they'd drop it for <UNK> in heaven after about 20 minutes
<START> this movie is essentially a how to on how to be a well connected <UNK> i'm amazed that so many people especially other gay men have seen this movie and read the book and no one has brought up the fact that if <UNK> was not an influential photographer he would be in jail doing time for child abuse poor peter johnson <UNK> took this poor naive although incredibly handsome teenager whom he found at a training camp for high school <UNK> in the <UNK> brought him to live in his home and took thousands of <UNK> photos of him many of them full frontal <UNK> all through <UNK> teenage years that ain't art it's child abuse and what's worse <UNK> made lots of money off of it and poor johnson is going to have serious issues the rest of his life <UNK> <UNK> love of the boy is downright creepy as are his <UNK> about famous and not so famous people he's known as he tries to complete <UNK> education creepy and then just plain boring the only redeeming thing i can say about the movie is that it is a fascinating study of self deception but i can't help but wonder why no one ever considered the effect this was having on chop <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for johnson himself
<START> this is actually great fun i really enjoyed it even though it wasn't that original at all robert de niro and eddie murphy were great together all the characters are cool and the story is pretty good plus robert de niro and eddie murphy are simply amazing in this <UNK> russo is excellent in her role and there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout especially when deniro spoofs clint eastwood and danny <UNK> lines plus the finale is just great yes it's just another run of the <UNK> buddy buddy cop film but it works due to the fantastic chemistry between de niro and murphy plus it had some great car chase scenes as well it's nothing that great really however i found it to be great fun and a perfect way to pass the time however the main villain was very weak and wasn't very good at all this is far from being the best buddy buddy cop film however it's still a very entertaining one and i thought it was pretty well made and written as well plus the ending was quite funny this is actually great fun i really enjoyed it even though it wasn't that original at all de niro and eddie murphy were great together i highly recommend this one the direction is very good tom <UNK> does a very good job here with great camera work cool angles and keeping the film at a fast pace the acting is a lot of fun robert deniro is amazing as always and is amazing here he is hilarious very likable had fantastic chemistry with eddie did his usual awesome stuff pulled some really funny faces seemed to be enjoying himself had some funny lines and had a really cool character de niro rules eddie murphy is also amazing here he is hilarious like de niro did his usual funny stuff obviously loved being in front of the camera and while he can do this stuff in his sleep he was still a lot of fun to watch murphy rules <UNK> russo is fantastic here she had a cool character and while she didn't have much to do she added a lot of screen presence and made her character interesting always she was just great russo rules william shatner is funny here surprisingly and didn't <UNK> it and brought some good laughs into the film the main villain is ok but kind of weak and rather bland still he did what he had to do adequately rest of the cast do fine overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
<START> i really like this series its funny and unique style of off the wall sometimes controversial comedy is a fresh take on the genre whilst it is a sitcom it stands out due to the what could be awkward subjects br br every aspect has a comedy turn and the show really is very good my favourite part of the program is the rather odd comments of the father dave his <UNK> break the program up and allow a really good flow not perfect because sometimes the comedy isn't laugh out loud funny and the actors sometimes seem to be waiting for an audience response but otherwise this program is good br br i strongly recommend this program and am very sad that it has been cancelled please make another series and finish it properly
<START> okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a <UNK> through but how well was the emotional stuff handled it would have been so easy to <UNK> into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off the image of the ex female making crying noises as she it saw her reflection after <UNK> her emotions is one that will stay with me forever that's twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented <UNK> <UNK> the previous being the last <UNK> from series one but by <UNK> it's worked add to that the other ex female who had been <UNK> on the eve of her wedding and jackie tyler <UNK> her husband after she had become <UNK> and you have a permanent throat <UNK> keep it up
<START> this was a great movie and the sequel should know our <UNK> off the action will be <UNK> and i just bought the special edition dvd with the animated background story similar to the <UNK> this will put <UNK> <UNK> back in the spotlight and hopefully get him the <UNK> role in spider man 3 as <UNK> he would be the most logical choice for the role back to <UNK> this movie even though it is a indie thriller it has a great story and characters with backgrounds that scream for you to want to learn more if they were to do books or comics it would be a great read there was one thing that i felt was a little under done the ending it needed a little work but not every movie will have the best ending
<START> this movie features <UNK> as super flesh eating killers this may have been the first movie where <UNK> were the primary killers though not the first movie where <UNK> are killers <UNK> alley featured a scene with killer <UNK> and <UNK> had a story that had them in this one they are the star not as good as it could have been this one doesn't have all that many kills in them i could be wrong on that point however because i have not seen this one in quite some time the <UNK> have gone killer and this very strange research lady is in town to study them yes she is quite strange as at one point she has her hand in a box on the killer <UNK> and she is like they are biting my hand and she says this in almost a state of ecstasy there is also one super big roach near the end of this one like in so many <UNK> films not a great movie but worth checking out on a night you are bored out of your mind
<START> in a really neat spin on hitchcock larry billy crystal and owen danny <UNK> lead unpleasant lives <UNK> ex wife has gotten rich by <UNK> a book that he wrote and owen has the most overbearing mother imaginable when larry tells owen to calm down by watching strangers on a train owen gets the idea that they should do <UNK> cross murders like in the movie and just like in the movie larry thinks that it's a joke but <UNK> serious br br how they came up with the idea for throw <UNK> from the train i'll never know but it's a hilarious movie there isn't a dull moment in it and that ending was a hoot crystal and <UNK> are at their best and anne <UNK> is as much of a <UNK> here as she was in the <UNK> a modern classic
<START> am an <UNK> <UNK> fan i have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this br br it has all the regular clichés that one can expect from a commercial entertainer a hero who is bad in studies but a star in his <UNK> i e his friends to fill in the comedy <UNK> a heroine in a life and death situation a villain which i say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist high <UNK> chase and action sequences music that can make one dance and above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle perfect br br the director doesn't give any chance for the audience to <UNK> up he just goes on from one nail on the head to the next and one can see the lighter side of <UNK> in this film which he rarely <UNK> br br all said this movie was and will be perfect for many years to come
<START> i had the <UNK> of attending a <UNK> premiere for this this is one of the funniest british movies ever the plot is fantastic focusing around a young girl who <UNK> changes into her ideal man at a computer fair whilst also creating a copy of herself who falls in love with him the film is full of jokes both visual and <UNK> and has a bright and fresh feel to it and the acting is of great quality released in u k on july 2nd this film is a must go see it
<START> i don't <UNK> because i think it's gay but this game is really great it's smooth fast easy to play and just fun even if you don't do so well it can be just really fun to make the <UNK> just crash and burn easily one of the best video games ever
<START> i recently saw blind spot in where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion i really admired the story and visual approach the action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing there is much beauty in the melancholy that <UNK> these three <UNK> heroes not just in the desert but in the city too my best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his <UNK> through all the remarkable lights of the city you really feel for this guy i never heard of the actors before but i liked all three very much i think they did a terrific job on their journey to self discovery all in all this is an amazingly cool and suspenseful suspenseful film i still carry many of the images in my mind
<START> this film is a great disappointment director <UNK> has provided many interesting films throughout his long career some of them were <UNK> by strong and powerful performances by spanish actress victoria <UNK> in la he relies on a gifted actress as well newcomer <UNK> lopez de but this is barely the sole positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie while lopez de tries hard to portray as a romantic and passionate young woman completely obsessed by love to her handsome husband it seems as if she weren't able to develop her character over this one dimensional feature was an important figure in spanish history and politics of that time were essential in her storyline but here she's introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera this is a real pity and the film a missing opportunity to show the way personal lives can influence history and vice versa worst of all italian actors <UNK> and turn out in real bad performances which in the case of is a real problem as he portrays el a pivotal role in this story it seems a clear choice to attract young audiences as both of them look like top models of this era on the other hand talented actors such as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are completely wasted in supporting roles clearly underdeveloped even if this was a big budgeted film little care was taken in bringing a good screenplay or creating period pieces on the screen costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes as if they were taken from stock material without regarding of a real <UNK> all in all the main problem with la and this is what makes the difference with far superior historical films as la <UNK> <UNK> or elizabeth is the lack of a director's point of view this a strange turn in career as he was able to develop it in other works and come to my mind creating very personal and interesting movies while this really is no more than a routine academic historical piece and a not very good one at that
<START> even the maria <UNK> jon hall <UNK> of the <UNK> are <UNK> by princess of the <UNK> <UNK> entry in hollywood's mid <UNK> obsession with things egyptian see land of the valley of the kings etc pure <UNK> mindless <UNK> <UNK> produced low budgeted actually but using sets and costumes left over from the <UNK> this spectacle looks like it cost millions <UNK> minutes of eye candy the plot having something to do with <UNK> do in ancient egypt is beside the point offers the cinematographer and audiences the <UNK> sight of debra <UNK> wearing an assortment of see thru <UNK> most of which hit the ground when she shakes and thru a slave girl production number <UNK> in film history female <UNK> were not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> young contract player jeffrey hunter is as <UNK> as ms <UNK> while michael <UNK> <UNK> around in the background stirring up evil <UNK> in the land of the <UNK> for those who might think <UNK> hunter can't act and were only hired for their physical attributes check out their subtle overlooked heartbreaking work together a few years later in white <UNK> another fox production that has sadly <UNK> into the realm of lost films princess of the <UNK> still stands in a class by itself as a <UNK> mindless <UNK> fast paced dazzling testament to the <UNK> of 3 strip technicolor and the seductive charms of ms <UNK> all of 20 at the time put this one of a kind <UNK> classic at the top of your guilty pleasures list and enjoy satisfaction guaranteed
<START> police officer michael <UNK> the church has his hands full while investigating a serial killer who's been leaving parts of the bodies of the people that he's been murdering at the house of one recently widowed tracy joanna <UNK> mike has to find a way to stop the bodies from <UNK> up while perhaps finding love in the process br br a feeling of the <UNK> films of <UNK> <UNK> this film even though we know who the killer is from the get go and the film contains a few good set pieces a scene later in the film set in a school for the blind being particularly memorable but it doesn't make all that much sense when all is said and done either all in all not nearly as good as <UNK> earlier macabre nor his first two demons films but enjoyable enough if you can forgive the rather outrageous plot twists towards the end of the film a pity the image entertainment dvd lacked extras of any kind as i would have been interested in some br br my grade c
<START> i know jesse franco is responsible for a wide variety of films and i mainly go for his horror films as lousy as they are at times i guess it was morbid <UNK> that drew me to this and i wasn't even curious enough to finish it maybe it got better towards the end but unless you're into lesbian sex scenes of which there's plenty then you may want to take a pass so what exactly can you say about a movie that features a woman that <UNK> in a bowl on the kitchen counter while standing up just never you mind what that's used for later you probably don't want to know if this sounds intriguing to you then that's your problem but then again you might just like this movie i myself am no <UNK> i've seen plenty of disgusting movies in my day but at least they were done well and this isn't sometimes too much is just too much <UNK>
<START> its the best movie i have seen in 2000 it has the beautiful and talented natalie portman in it it has a great storyline cast and soundtrack i enjoyed it very much 10 out of 10
<START> when you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here then again maybe i read the summary for the other movie called instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common however reading stuff about that movie here i know i saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about i will be honest i expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree however there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the <UNK> at the beginning of the film will <UNK> to the movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party in this case it is in fact a <UNK> the other movie i do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and i see the score for this one is higher too still it was just not the movie i was expecting
<START> recently released on british dvd this is a good movie as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly not as depressing as it could have been this is kitchen sink at its most dirty <UNK> <UNK> is great in it the music is sweet carol white is very <UNK> as the single mum <UNK> who can't stop loving criminals br br my favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her the one with the enormous <UNK> <UNK> which comes down over one eye sit and <UNK> about all the men who walk past br br the only thing that marred this was the <UNK> acting of <UNK> first husband but if you can get past that you're ok and <UNK> provides some of the most <UNK> <UNK> bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s
<START> like almost everyone else i became aware of this turkey on mystery science theater 3000 it easily ranks as one of my favorite mst3k episodes of all time i really couldn't imagine attempting to watch this film on it's own though it's really really really really really really really really really really bad br br miles <UNK> stars as <UNK> a muscle bound <UNK> wannabe who lives during the time of cave men we the viewer are asked to suspend our disbelief in that he knows <UNK> and chemistry and can manage to build a complete hang <UNK> in about 5 minutes yeah right there's also a fairly attractive actress can't remember her name who wears a <UNK> cap as a chest shield oh and i can't forget that wacky asian side kick <UNK> he had the <UNK> role in the movie since he doesn't utter one word of dialogue throughout the entire movie he had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking and he failed miserably br br the film isn't watchable in any way and should be only viewed in it's proper mst3k format if you watch that version you'll laugh yourself silly br br i'm huge br br rating 1
<START> robin williams is a genius one of the best comedians in the world he really shows off in this one cracking jokes left and right as the talk show comedian tom <UNK> from the previous this looked like it would be a side splitting laugh fest and it was funny but there were a lot of serious parts in the movie that i was not expecting i would describe it as a drama comedy but it's still worth the money to see and i still found it to be almost everything that i expected robin williams is at his best along with the famous christopher walken they play a very good team in this movie and i was actually shocked to see how well the two were able to work together i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a light hearted movie
<START> spoilers shocking yet true story of the horror that <UNK> the <UNK> georgia border town of when it was taken over by a gang of organized <UNK> who turn it into the sin city of the south br br with crime and no one to turn to a group of concerned citizens get well respected lawyer albert <UNK> john mcintire to run for the office of state district attorney with the criminal element of doing everything from <UNK> to outright murder to keep the voters form getting <UNK> the nomination he still wins with the other <UNK> of the state not including russell county giving him the nod by just over 1 000 votes br br terrified in what <UNK> would do when he takes office head of the mob <UNK> edward andrews has a hit put out on him <UNK> is <UNK> down while driving to his office but his killers are spotted by <UNK> <UNK> kathryn grant who soon becomes through an informer in office next person in line to be targeted for murder what <UNK> co didn't expect is that the late albert son john richard <UNK> got the news from <UNK> about his <UNK> murder before his boys could shut her up that major <UNK> on part will end up putting an end to both his criminal organization as well as his freedom br br powerful documentary style crime movie with the actual persons involved in the events given some 15 minutes at the start of the film to tell their stories this despite the fact that they were still in danger of being murdered by the <UNK> mob that was still at large at the time their interviews were filmed br br finishing what his brave dad started john <UNK> single <UNK> brought the story of city to the front pages of both the state and national <UNK> giving <UNK> the very negative publicity that he tried so hard to avoid with the now <UNK> national guard <UNK> into city the blood <UNK> and <UNK> in not willing to stand up to people with guns in their hands <UNK> mob <UNK> from sight like a morning <UNK> after the <UNK> hits it and with john <UNK> now taking the place of his murdered dad as the state of <UNK> new attorney general you can be sure that the <UNK> mob has seen its last days of pushing people around as well as murdering them the only thing that they'll see now in the future is the gray prison walls and bars that will be their home sweet home for the rest of their rotten and miserable lives br br very probably the most <UNK> violent movie to come out of hollywood up to that time the city story didn't pull any punches in showing how a group of <UNK> and powerful criminals can turn a quite american city into living hell for everyone in it no one was <UNK> from these ruthless gangsters who didn't even think twice when it came to murdering even women and children if that's what it took to keep them in power as for the city police they had better thing to do then <UNK> the law that they were <UNK> and paid to <UNK> they were out having coffee and while their city was being burned to the ground by the gangsters like <UNK> who had them in their hip pocket
<START> it's difficult to find anything worth of praise with this movie it's not the worst picture ever made but that's not saying a whole lot the plot is quite incoherent and unbelievable it seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie but decided to make it underwater to cash in at the success of the <UNK> in some scenes it seems as if the story indeed was set to outer space initially the sub has a landing gear the <UNK> are worried of a rip in a rubber diving suit at the depths of several <UNK> where the pressure would crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer can br br the movie starts out okay with planning of a <UNK> of a lost naval sub after that the movie takes a <UNK> along with the <UNK> 2 br br effects are so so the screens are all done on <UNK> 64 remember this is 1990 not 1983 the sub is controlled like no other sub ever instead of control <UNK> the officers have <UNK> with which they enter long number sequences to control various functions of the ship the interior of the ship isn't too convincing either br br the final scenes leap from awkward to absurd welcome to the fifties you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door br br i fail to see enjoyment factor here the movie is neither good nor hilariously bad mst3k style until you get to the final scene it's like eating a slightly bad apple
<START> i normally love jackie chan movies but this one was terrible there are only 2 or 3 fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less the bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasing racing the car chase isn't so bad though not as exciting as fighting but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring basically it takes all of things that make a jackie chan film a jackie chan film and leaves out everything except jackie chan even the traditional <UNK> at the end lack their usual humour br br i suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact i saw one of those horrible dubbed versions i usually try to see the subtitled version i wish i could understand chinese br br i've only seen one jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early <UNK> into hollywood films that didn't turn out so well br br avoid unless really curious or a lover of <UNK> sports
<START> bad bad bad br br this is another stupid movie still don't know what is the language of this movie is or french or german you have to be speaking all 3 languages at least italian too to understand it poor quality translation with very hard to read <UNK> showing a very stupid way of ending this movie in the mid of the movie you will lose interest in this movie and start to think why am i watching this brad pitt is proving that his acting talent is going down br br maybe this is the movie number <UNK> that talks about nazis is there any other subjects that hollywood can produce i think this movie is another american propaganda to show super <UNK> american i expect next hollywood movie is american hero will save jesus
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> was one of the funniest films of the 1999 melbourne film festival from the uk it is about a young crowd of <UNK> and their various relationship <UNK> much of the humour is <UNK> around a new <UNK> men's self help group where they pass around various <UNK> like the <UNK> of <UNK> they also go on a weekend with hilarious results trust me you'll laugh your teeth out
<START> is it only now that you notice the <UNK> between all the characters of course it's <UNK> and for the guy in the <UNK> with <UNK> any <UNK> <UNK> yeah he was the same guy that gave money to <UNK> after he's killed or tortured the other soldier in the episode <UNK> of the 2nd season one of them well actually it's not completely the same guy he's named joe in the <UNK> episode and <UNK> in the last 2 episodes twins who knows <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i'm not even sure of that there are hundreds of <UNK> like this one between all the characters br br but that was just in response to the <UNK> comment br br i found those 2 episodes far more interesting than the whole season 2 during all that season i felt that there was lots of things i've missed and very few things i've learned especially at the very beginning the 1st episode of the 2nd season is excellent and then the 2nd one is a kind of flash back of the 1st one i found that disappointing even if i'm pretty sure that everything in lost tend to have a meaning that was just an example of how i was frustrated watching those episodes br br let's go back to the last 2 episodes i think we've learned more new things in those 2 episodes than in the entire season but all we learn are little pieces for the next puzzle like the involvement of relatives sorry if i spoil too much believe me or not i'm trying not to for example so lots of things <UNK> in the past 2 seasons are still unclear or have been developed once then nothing and still there's new material as if all the holes in the picture were not enough we all want to see the big picture of all of it of course but i think we'll have to be very very patient i hope there will be only 3 seasons i'm not sure i will watch more than 3 seasons anyway there was also lots of actions in the very last episode and a good cliffhanger at the very end br br so basically yes i loved that last episode and yes i want to see the third season
<START> throw <UNK> hasn't dated at all it's as funny now as when it was released a genuinely eccentric comedy that doesn't try too hard to be liked and is all the better for it full of memorable laugh out loud lines even small characters are well written and beautifully played like billy <UNK> best friend's girlfriend and a lovely cameo from rob <UNK> as <UNK> agent a little bit insane and a lot funny
<START> i fear you speak upon the rack where men <UNK> do speak anything this shakespearean line from the <UNK> of <UNK> is <UNK> again in the new film rendition which introduces the viewer to the enhanced methods of <UNK> <UNK> which began in the <UNK> administration and have become more <UNK> since the terror attacks of september 11 2001 br br the film features an all star cast with oscar winners meryl streep alan arkin and reese <UNK> as well as peter <UNK> jake <UNK> and omar supporting roles filled by unfamiliar actors deliver as well sucking the audience into the plot and showing how many people can be affected by overseas terror attacks and our means of investigating them br br rendition follows an egyptian born terrorism suspect who is taken by u s officials following his flight from south africa to washington <UNK> to an <UNK> prison overseas his pregnant wife <UNK> <UNK> to washington <UNK> to find out about his disappearance through a family friend and <UNK> employee <UNK> <UNK> plays a young cia <UNK> at the overseas <UNK> facility who <UNK> the violent <UNK> br br this film follows the emotional <UNK> of the torture victim and those involved in <UNK> the supposed information from him some like the cia <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> and horrified by the methods <UNK> while others the stern senator streep and foreign <UNK> see it as necessary and effective br br the film may be described by some as a political piece but is ultimately an emotional one performance as the tortured prisoner is oscar worthy the film does not intend to <UNK> but rather to question and inform the audience on a topic that does not often have a human face put on it <UNK> have been known to work but have also been known to produce false information from innocent prisoners the film simply depicts the emotional struggles of those involved in such grave business and does so in a way that will affect every viewer differently the film will keep your interest and have you engaged in each of the character's <UNK>
<START> in the <UNK> of kirk and his crew encounter a powerful super being who keeps the captain bones and a few captive for no apparent reason i could be wrong but i think this is the first star trek episode i ever saw and the program that made me hungry for more it is not one of the best episodes but the rock solid premise of an alien being who putting the crew in a corner is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch in a way the super <UNK> <UNK> one of star <UNK> most famous characters next <UNK> enigmatic q this episode is also memorable for creating a unique situation it is the first time <UNK> is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what an endearing character can be when the story allows her too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure
<START> this good guy vs the evil <UNK> story set in 19th century russia may have been an attempt to <UNK> steve <UNK> career beyond those <UNK> movies however despite the different costumes it's still a <UNK> movie with the usual stilted dialog <UNK> dubbing and cardboard characters on the other hand there's lots of action the pace rarely <UNK> and reeves gets to do yet another one of those scenes where he's stripped to the <UNK> bound with <UNK> and given a <UNK> <UNK> which needless to say has little effect on his <UNK> character
<START> this is a poor poor movie full of clichés unrealistic moments <UNK> the air in celebration after putting a fire out never mind that someone's lost their home and <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason the stereotypical <UNK> and strained relationships the very dodgy cheesy music at the end the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment did they have a couple of <UNK> tanks in the attic or something anyone with an ounce of wit can see that this movie was a joke it's a pity because <UNK> do an awesome job and they deserve to have a good movie made about what they do but not at the expense of common sense
<START> this is another of robert altman's underrated films let's be honest the only movie he's made that really didn't work was ready to wear and sandy dennis gives a <UNK> performance in it she is far better here than she was in the out of <UNK> the material i will admit is beneath the great director altman and the extraordinary actress dennis but that hardly matters anyway as long as there allowed to do their thing and do it well just about any story will do
<START> have i seen a worse movie no i can't say that i have this was pathetic if the director is still alive 1 he shouldn't be 2 he should be ashamed 3 god how i would like to take out my 2 completely wasted hours of time on his a br br to give you guys a few <UNK> of the film br br 1 i'm a male and i would rather give myself a on the opening of my before viewing this again seriously br br 2 it does have a few known names in it casper van <UNK> erika <UNK> <UNK> they don't help and their careers in cinema after this film are officially over by the way br br 3 the dialog is the worst i've ever heard i want to <UNK> on your what kind of writer did they have on this film was he still using hooked on and just got his letters mixed up to make these horrible sentences or was he trying to get the director killed by the few people who saw this br br 4 watch this film backwards because i promise you that you do not want to watch it <UNK> br br 5 this film would make helen <UNK> get up and walk out of the theater br br 6 the set of the movie looks like an adult sized <UNK> i was just waiting for this so called dracula to fall in the ball pit at some time in the movie br br 7 also i like that in the year 3000 they still have <UNK> with <UNK> that go to their mouth no <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> placed in the brain but they use <UNK> borrowed from a agency that went out of business in 1983 nice job set director on this one real professional i hope you're currently unemployed and reading this br br 8 i don't know who was in charge of special effects but i could have done better in my backyard with my vhs camcorder that doesn't have a <UNK> br br 9 i was a <UNK> catholic before this film but since viewing it i know there is not a god because if there was he wouldn't have let this film be produced i am now an <UNK> br br 10 i'll be honest i can't talk about the ending last time i tried to explain it i fell into a coma br br folks however bored you get however curious or brave you are however many laughs you think you will get out of this movie please do not watch this it has literally ruined my life avoid at all costs br br comment to the director i hate you you have ruined my life after viewing this i feel empty inside my wife and kids have left me and hate me because i couldn't speak or hardly move after seeing this i lost my job my dignity and above all my pride i will never forgive you in this life or the next which is not looking good from my <UNK> beliefs
<START> i am a regular reader of kathy brennan novels as such i am extremely surprised she even <UNK> on this show br br it is horrible by comparison to the books the brennan character is in the books a down to earth recovering alcoholic and divorced mom of a college aged daughter in she is an arrogant <UNK> with rich who in typical p c fashion is not a mother the emphasis on her <UNK> staff complete with lurid details of who has had how many sexual exploits is totally in contrast with the books br br in total <UNK> to the p c movement she portrays the enemies of the u s as peace lovers some of the information isn't even correct for example having a character from afghanistan as an active member of an arab american friendship group since when is an <UNK> an arab i'm sure if negative references were made to <UNK> or women or the show's producers writers directors would have to issue an <UNK> however in typical far left fashion all of the racial <UNK> go to the highest achieving minority group <UNK> as david agent booth continually refers to angela <UNK> as a br br forget that stuff and forget this show after 'the man in the episode i thought i'd try a second episode to see if it got any better it only got worse i don't even care if the teenager in question was murdered or committed suicide and i won't be watching the show ever again
<START> personally i don't like a lot of b w movies but there's something magical about this movie br br the movie starts with elizabeth lane barbara stanwyck liz writes a magazine <UNK> about how she's the of <UNK> of course she's lying this becomes a problem when her <UNK> mr <UNK> asks her to play host to a navy sailor over christmas in addition mr <UNK> who's going to be alone for christmas invites himself up to the farm for the christmas party from there things just go crazy br br since the movie is set on a new england farm the movie has a warm holiday feeling plus the characters are hilarious mr <UNK> is always shouting orders and <UNK> friend felix is always yelling ' when things go wrong finally the movie ends the way a christmas movie should end a jolly fat man laughs and shouts what a christmas br br in short no matter what age you are you will love this movie
<START> there have been many movies on living the american dream and this is one of them br br first of all on the technical side there is a lot wrong the audio is bad i had trouble understanding the dialogs here and there and the camera positions could have been better br br they really tried to come up with a good movie but for example the part where they show how jonathan is <UNK> himself in the dream with girls drugs and alcohol is done very badly the acting is very poor as well from all the characters in the movie br br i had a hard time watching it from the beginning till end and couldn't wait for the movie to be over br br if your expectations are low and you're bored on a sunday with bad weather watch it if you in for a deep story with action then this is not your movie br br normally i would not have give a score of 1 but of 4 5 for this movie but the reason i gave it a 1 is because of the bad audio and camera uses not to mention the bad cut scenes with cheesy effects
<START> in checking out peter falk plays an elderly new <UNK> who <UNK> his children home so that they can be with him before he plans to commit suicide as the movie progresses we get to see everyone's flaws and other problems while some people may interpret this as a heartwarming movie i mostly enjoyed it for peter <UNK> character not letting anything get him down and even engaging in a little <UNK> now and then br br so it might not be the best movie ever but still worth seeing i've long thought that peter falk has the perfect look to play this sort of role what with his glass eye and all also starring laura san <UNK> david <UNK> judge <UNK> and <UNK> real life wife
<START> this movie while it could be considered an alright attempt at comedy is not what the previews made it out to be the first half is comprised of typical robin williams stand up material though he really didn't do many voices he was always great at the one liners and hitting the <UNK> somewhere during the election there is a problem with the computer program that is used in the election here is where the net 3 comes in a woman who helped with this program wants the truth to be told and the evil corporation wants to shut her up spoilers her boyfriend even helps them though this isn't even fleshed out this movie could have been one of political brilliance perhaps with at the <UNK> but it falls short in a <UNK> made by too many <UNK>
<START> this is what happens when you try to adapt a play from the theater look at the end of the picture totally theatrical br br with a reminiscent of les <UNK> the final steam less speech try to make us think that the whole and deep theme of this matter was the <UNK> who cares by this point it was about manipulation and so the audience feels after this movie has ended br br young directors a play is told with the words more than actions a film is the opposite most of the times br br and i'm not talking about the gay theme overly exploited without a point 'cause there's no explanation of this topic considering the so called <UNK> or <UNK> basis to the level that this film should have been called grand gay
<START> i watched this episode a lot of times because i didn't get how died this is what happened <UNK> and <UNK> try and save their innocent a doctor because wants to kill him <UNK> goes upstairs to look in the book of shadows while and <UNK> are protecting their innocent appears while <UNK> is still upstairs so throw an energy ball at the doctor but pushes him out of the way and get hit in the chest with it and <UNK> against the wall same with <UNK> so <UNK> comes <UNK> and says the spell since it was only <UNK> who said it and not the power of three only got wounded calls leo to <UNK> <UNK> and so leo <UNK> them <UNK> went into the underworld to find cole meanwhile and <UNK> are looking for in the streets <UNK> and see and <UNK> uses her power to blow up meanwhile a new reporter got it all on tape so its all over the new about the three powerful <UNK> sisters meanwhile <UNK> doesn't know anything because she is still in the underworld there's and people all over the <UNK> house then a maniac comes in the house and says can i be part of your <UNK> and says no this is our house get out of here and uses her powers to throw her out as the maniac come out of the house crying saying there mean witches the maniac gets so mad that she shoots <UNK> right through the stomach get in her car and <UNK> to go to the hospital but people won't let her through so uses her powers to move people out of the way making people wanna kill her more they got to the hospital but <UNK> didn't make it meanwhile <UNK> is in the underworld <UNK> finds out that they have been exposed so <UNK> asks cole to ask the source if he can reverse time the source says he will only reverse time if <UNK> promises to stay here in the underworld so cole told <UNK> what the source told him <UNK> says what would make him think i would make a deal like that and then cole says so you can save one of your sisters lives leo goes to the hospital to find out the <UNK> really is dead so he tells <UNK> that its true then <UNK> agrees to stay only if cole will go back to warn <UNK> and about the <UNK> and death of <UNK> back at the hospital <UNK> is about the shoot but the second before they do time is <UNK> back when they were at the <UNK> with the doctor but this time <UNK> wasn't there to call leo to <UNK> and <UNK> so the doctor get throw in the wall too the doctor died and so did but this is what i didn't get if <UNK> was throw against the wall too how come only died why did they not show leo come and <UNK> <UNK> and leo trying to <UNK> if you know the answer please e mail me at <UNK> com ps i miss but i like <UNK> too and i'm glad the show continued
<START> this screened at sundance last night to a <UNK> if mute crowd clearly the story is worth relating it's powerful and true but did the director have to cast every single role with a recognizable face i mean really you spend have your time saying oh look it's the guy from or hey it's easy rider and you lose sight of the story perhaps it's the only way this guy could get his movie made but it's a little distracting sort of like 'the love boat or those old <UNK> <UNK> movies that were <UNK> block with stars ' i wish he's just told the story simply with less famous faces also the camera work seems kind of lazy like there wasn't any thought about where to put the camera to best tell the story all in all i thought it was okay but could have been really good
<START> the <UNK> of four seasons isn't what i would call a happy movie at all or even one that impressed me to the point of <UNK> it to the sky there are other fassbinder flicks for that like <UNK> <UNK> and the underrated <UNK> <UNK> but it's certainly no less than a fascinating experiment in taking a look at those in a society that you and me and others we know might possibly know or not really want to know i imagine in the early 70s in germany a generation coming out of ww2 had a <UNK> to live with but tried their best just to get by this is a <UNK> that <UNK> all over this film and in many instances in <UNK> work in general but especially because with four seasons he takes his eye on the middle class and a particular married couple the <UNK> depressed angry hans the fruit <UNK> and his long suffered wife that is nothing short than trying for realism in the <UNK> of melodrama if cassavetes were a crazy german he might make this film maybe even as just a <UNK> br br the story sounds simple enough where drinking gets out of control he beats his wife this scene is one of the <UNK> to take maybe in just any movie the way <UNK> camera <UNK> without a cut as his wife is left helpless and their daughter trying to stop him in his frenzy and then she's ready to leave him as he stands in the room her family holding him back she makes the call for divorce and he gets a heart attack right there he <UNK> his business suddenly starts <UNK> again with some help from some good or not so good employees and yet this only continues his longing for another woman and his despair in general br br and yet it's in this simplicity that fassbinder tries and succeeds for the most part in <UNK> a mood of dread of a tense vibe in a kitchen or in the bedroom or out on the street that you can cut with a knife and bleed out the weakest part of this all may be the acting at least that was my initial impression hans played by can be a stilted presence with only the slightest movements in his face and eyes and for a while it doesn't look like he's much of a good actor the actress playing his wife <UNK> and her sister fassbinder <UNK> <UNK> fare better but only cause they're given more to do <UNK> like cry or look concerned it takes some time to <UNK> to what is essentially a void in his guy hans of something from his own psychological self torment or self pity that <UNK> himself and those around him who just want to get on with some sense of <UNK> especially once hans gets successful br br not everything <UNK> together in the <UNK> of four seasons but enough did to make me recommend it to those looking for a different slice of life than you might be used to with more modern american movies <UNK> world here is a combat between the melodrama he loves in cinema and the harsh <UNK> sense of <UNK> that he feels personally and puts into characters that for better or worse we somehow identify with are the <UNK> a family you know of or could you even be them who's to say it's a <UNK> study of tragic <UNK> in the human spirit and its goals are all <UNK>
<START> this is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever it really does not qualify for movie status it is very cheap apparently shot on <UNK> horribly acted and just plain rotten i could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was it looked like a home video i mean i believe a guy i know a few houses down must have <UNK> out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours it is that bad i noticed the name from <UNK> this i will never rent anything with that name on it again when you rent a flick check to see if it is from this company one thing is true though if you like horribly acted amateur movies then you might like this loser it is absolutely boring and terrible you have been warned
<START> i love musicals all of them from <UNK> <UNK> to poignant and <UNK> to the touching romantic damn <UNK> and i know most of the songs sometimes singing them <UNK> with a crowd or <UNK> them alone br br in a real musical as <UNK> from this vaudeville show every song is <UNK> crafted to fit the exact moment it is an expression of sadness regret love joy or <UNK> a natural <UNK> where mere words fail so in guys and dolls my time of day describes the adventurous life of sky masterson as it is about to be <UNK> by the most unlikely woman every song in this brilliant <UNK> of the genre sets a mood or develops a character creating a of place turned absolutely believable by the self <UNK> of song br br for this lover of the broadway musical and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century mama <UNK> is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house <UNK> of the genre there the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate often delightful plot lines while here the songs simply picked up from a collection only <UNK> with the shaky premise of the film br br perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century musicals they have no idea of the magic performed by writer and <UNK> that can turn a dance hall <UNK> into someone whom we know and love as achieved in sweet charity br br let me offer an <UNK> for the arrogance of this review perhaps another day another mood i could have gotten into it and not have been so critical in this review br br but i can't help but imagining what richard roger oscar <UNK> cole porter irving berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise i think about it while the memories of seeing this film is fresh and i can not help but to <UNK> the great loss
<START> if you have plenty of time to kill and the dvd was given to you by your friend for free but still it may require lot of courage to watch this film which does not have good script or humor for that matter br br on the acting front is frozen in time acting <UNK> kapoor was slightly better than in this movie <UNK> <UNK> was good at comedy was usual br br the story revolves around a college campus where is a bad boy n <UNK> is the good one they pretend to be the opposite of respective nature and so the story goes on br br watch it only if you don't have any thing to do and the film is running on your local cable tv
<START> i had to watch this one for my canadian cinema course and i was told that it was considered to be the best canadian film when i watched this i really did not agree considering i've seen a lot better ones i understand that there were canadian themes and messages but the fact that the characters and the plot were so <UNK> with me as a <UNK> it made me not really care what the film was trying to tell me the plot was too dry the characters did not have many positive personality traits but this is to emphasize the messages not to <UNK> off <UNK> this film shows a little about the history of <UNK> not a very interesting film it definitely does not deserve to be put on such a high <UNK>
<START> i actually went into this film with some expectations not because i thought the film sounded particularly good but because i'm a fan of italian exploitation flicks and with a cast that sees franco <UNK> and telly <UNK> starring alongside oliver twist i figured it had to be interesting at least well redneck does have one or two positive things going on but for the most part it's a dull lifeless film that is as ridiculous as it is pointless the plot simply focuses on two criminals <UNK> and <UNK> who kidnap a young kid oliver the twist in the tale is that the kid realises that he'd have more fun if he gets accepted into the <UNK> telly <UNK> and franco <UNK> are two actors that have proved they can carry a film on their own on numerous occasions and they do have some memorable moments in this film although really for all the wrong reasons <UNK> in particular gives a silly portrayal of the <UNK> criminal the plot doesn't flow badly but since nothing interesting happens that's not really a positive point and doesn't save from the film from being mediocre overall i can't recommend this film it may appeal to some for its cult value but it didn't do anything for me
<START> i challenge you to watch this film and deny the above statement that is if you can stop looking at her practically flawless face she also does a bit of fighting and a bit of shooting but not nearly as much as i was hoping for the film is extremely slow moving and low budgeted though at least they tried to find an excuse for the spaceship being so <UNK> nearly the entire crew is on suspended animation and the ship moves on auto pilot and the heroine doesn't rescue any of them or bring anything useful back home it seems that <UNK> that evil lady into traveling through space was the only part of her mission that couldn't be more easily accomplished by the <UNK> that blow up the ship at the end there are also some long but rather tame soft core scenes and a couple of alien rip off monsters that kill about 2 people 1 2 out of 4
<START> i saw this film without knowing much about it at all the split screen device was immediately irritating and things didn't improve for me after the title sequence had finished the plot characters and dialogue were all extremely cliched poor guy from abusive family gets thrown out of home wants to get out of his <UNK> himself changes his voice dresses in <UNK> clothes is adopted by a gay man who he proceeds to on his way up to becoming part of an international set of drug taking british <UNK> br br the estate of patricia <UNK> talented mr <UNK> should be <UNK> the makers of this film the triple screen to me together with the over <UNK> min duration <UNK> the almost non existent editing can't decide which image works and is the most powerful why not show three and hope you get it right with one of them this gimmick removed any connection or interest i had with any of the characters important dialogue was repeated 3 times across each screen as if to say <UNK> is an important moving deep moment ok ' br br don't waste your time br br
<START> the real plot br br a group of post civil war prostitutes seek alternative <UNK> in <UNK> boom <UNK> everett and a close <UNK> family of call girls have been eating date <UNK> <UNK> for days and plan to move into the former <UNK> <UNK> locals warn the women of eating more of the dated <UNK> because there is a vicious <UNK> loose in the area and he refuse to <UNK> them out to the property when they finally arrive at their destination they discover their stomach is full of <UNK> after all the bad <UNK> it is not long before they learn why their new home is called <UNK> boom
<START> i have seen many movies over the years and i am a big fan of comedies br br but this so called comedy almost reduced me to tears it is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever witnessed the worst br br i remember hearing about this movie from a friend and decided to view it if i could i could turn back time i would i will regret for as long as i live the time i wasted watching this rubbish br br the storyline is so insane it just makes no sense at all and leaves you confused there is a scottish mob and a german who are after vargas john <UNK> the scottish mob after 50 000 dollars and the germans after his head br br in trying to escape the <UNK> takes the form of many <UNK> but in doing this we witness some of the most annoying worst mind numbing acting dialogue and sounds in cinema history this movie annoyed me so much by the end i was full of <UNK> i was so angry that i had wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely drive depressed people to almost certain suicide i mean how can there be hope when a movie like this can be given <UNK> to be made br br i know people have their own opinions but the most shocking thing about the <UNK> is that people actually like it why what is funny about a man that is annoying from the very first second to the last a man who cannot act who has an annoying voice and confusing face br br i sat through it thinking the movie would get better surely it would it did not usually you want the good guy to survive but i wanted the germans or the scottish mob to find and kill the <UNK> anything to put me out of my misery there is nothing funny interesting or normal that happens in this movie its just plain annoying and confusing the jokes are dead even before they are told i feel sorry for the <UNK> who have no say in how the movie is made but actually have to film this drivel i wouldn't be surprised if they are receiving <UNK> br br if you want to remain sane and part of society my advice is to never watch this movie i'd rather lock myself in my room for 5 weeks and go without food and water than watch this movie again br br i don't think i'll ever hate anything more than this
<START> not since 8 heads in a <UNK> bag and the how high previews br br have i laughed so little at something that the film makers thought br br would be hysterical br br jerry lewis is the <UNK> man in the world he is rejected as 4 f br br by the army and decides to use his money to raise his own army br br of about half a dozen he then <UNK> a nazi commander in br br italy and eventually tries to kill hitler that is the description of the br br flimsy plot br br this film is as funny as a heart attack this film makes <UNK> br br heroes look like shakespeare if the money men of the br br producers had really wanted to lose their cash they should have br br shown this film i cannot stress how bad this thing is br br <UNK> direction consists of two different cameras shooting the br br action from two different angles then being edited together this br br sitcom type of direction works on television but here it is an br br obvious attempt to cheat the audience he ends most of his br br scenes with a still shot as if giving the viewer a chance to double br br over in <UNK> before going to the next tired set up i spent most of br br the movie <UNK> over in <UNK> agony accompanied with br br severe <UNK> over this thing br br lewis the director and producer sets the film in 1943 but makes br br no attempt to use period costumes or sets everyone wears the br br latest style and has the latest interior design for 1970 the br br supporting cast is lost as lewis goes off on his <UNK> <UNK> br br which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful to br br watch when lewis becomes the nazi commander he spends the br br last half of the film screaming at the top of his <UNK> in a br br performance so <UNK> as to stink up any good will you try to bring br br in at the beginning br br the final <UNK> shot has lewis and his <UNK> trying to br br put one over on the japanese they wear buck teeth <UNK> their br br eyes and talk in a funny accent it may be one of the most br br blatantly racist <UNK> since the camps i was br br slack <UNK> at what lewis did through this whole thing but that put br br me over the edge watch for <UNK> <UNK> very tasteless scene br br where she tries to attempt suicide over and over again br br star trek 's george <UNK> has two small scenes then wisely br br drops out of the picture this has less laughs than mel <UNK> last br br three films combined there is nothing <UNK> than watching a br br <UNK> respected comedian screw up a project so horribly you br br actually feel ashamed for them jim carrey learned that with the br br <UNK> but jerry lewis still shows up on television once in a br br while pulling the same unfunny <UNK> i feel sorry for him br br which way to the front is cheap unfunny offensive and stupid br br i feel bad for everyone involved and anyone who must endure this br br i do not recommend it br br though rated g this contains some physical violence some gun br br violence and some adult situations if your child shows interest in br br seeing this please <UNK> professional help br br
<START> this movie has more on its plate than a <UNK> wrestler and the result for the viewer is <UNK> there are some good performances but the subplots are <UNK> and largely <UNK> br br in addition i found all the characters unlikeable and if you can't identify with at least one character there isn't much to get excited about all in all this is a classic example of trying to do too much with too little
<START> i watch a lot of movies a lot of movies getting a graduate degree in film forces one to watch 2 3 flicks a day for years it all gets very <UNK> mostly because i feel i have seen it all so rare is it when i get surprised by something mostly i hope to see something as good as i expect it to be br br death bed is so unlike anything i have ever experienced i actually had to stop the dvd in order to rant about its genius br br the rhythm of the piece is psychotic it's structured in a way that forces the viewer to stay outside of the frame it's not like something like halloween with all its snappy editing and <UNK> shots death bed actually comes across as kind of dreamy the most pretentious way i can phrase it is this is samuel <UNK> making a haunted house movie i mean it's a manic <UNK> bed that eats people and fried chicken out in the middle of nowhere and there's bone hands i can barely <UNK> my feelings about this film and yeah <UNK> to liking this will open you up to <UNK> but things get real same y after awhile its hard to be a <UNK> and consistently stay engaged i can honestly say this is a fully unique film up and down from what it is to how its put together we need films like that movies that shake us out of our <UNK> consider it like existential camp it's fun and it's stupid but also brilliant in its weird little way the worst horror villain of all time maybe but at least it isn't a guy in a mask
<START> this is a poor film it certainly belongs in the how not to make a feature film category story direction acting and style are all flat as a <UNK> story consists of five  yes five  football matches spread out over the film's duration each one more <UNK> filmed than the last as a dysfunctional amateur football team go from strength to strength that's it that's the plot it's hard to know who this film is aimed at it's too banal for football fans and there's nothing in it for teens nor grown ups there's nothing in it for women either there isn't even a single female character it's <UNK> wears you down as the team play game after game after game after game after game the story such as it is dialogue and mannerisms seem lifted from a <UNK> ireland with all the actors <UNK> <UNK> theatrical <UNK> accents it doesn't have to be seen to be believed avoid at all costs can someone give me back my 90 minutes high point the credits at the end low point too numerous to mention brendan <UNK> is in this film
<START> this film should never have been made it stinks it's awful it's no good it's bad it's terrible starting to see a pattern here jackie mason is certainly no rodney <UNK> gone were ted knight and bill murray who along with <UNK> were essential to the first film it seems that the three of them the stars all knew a stinker of a script when they saw one the one who didn't have the good sense to bow out of this was chevy chase who stuck around but was <UNK> to both films in my opinion this film is quite simply not funny nor does it have any other endearing qualities this thing relies heavily on anti <UNK> to work and it works to it's <UNK> i hated this thing a waste of everybody's time
<START> operation <UNK> <UNK> king doesn't slip into top gear until the last 25 minutes or so but when the action does hit top speed it delivers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that demand the viewer's attention that is not to say that the first hour is just that compared to the final fight fest it seems a bit <UNK> br br the plot revolves around <UNK> <UNK> a talented comic artist who dreams of being a like those he depicts in his drawings when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a young maid <UNK> <UNK> who is being sold into prostitution he <UNK> the wrath of her evil boss <UNK> led by sonny master of <UNK> style kung fu henchmen give chase to <UNK> <UNK> and the maid <UNK> father <UNK> but he is injured after being rescued by some friendly <UNK> the three eventually hide out at a <UNK> restaurant owned by their friend master <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> learns to <UNK> <UNK> but also regularly <UNK> out in order to secretly build his strength and learn kung fu under the <UNK> of jean the teacher of the <UNK> who rescued them when master <UNK> must leave on business <UNK> <UNK> is left in charge of the kitchen however he pops out to <UNK> his skills with jean leaving <UNK> <UNK> to serve the customers sonny and his men visit the restaurant and disgusted by the <UNK> they are served trash the restaurant br br when master <UNK> learns that <UNK> <UNK> has been <UNK> out he tells him that he should have <UNK> kung fu from him it <UNK> that master <UNK> used to be a top <UNK> assassin until he decided to try and change his ways under the <UNK> of master <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his skills even learning the art of the <UNK> kick <UNK> <UNK> eventually gets a chance to try and become a real hero when his friend <UNK> <UNK> that his maid has also been sold into prostitution with jean they visit <UNK> posing as french <UNK> <UNK> looking for new women when <UNK> maid is presented to them she accidentally blows their <UNK> and at last the action kicks off big style despite his best efforts jean is badly beaten by sonny and he and <UNK> <UNK> are forced to flee on returning to the restaurant <UNK> <UNK> finds it <UNK> and worst of all the bad guys have found <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> accompanied by master <UNK> returns to place to try and rescue <UNK> <UNK> br br despite some fairly entertaining training scenes the slow build up to the final action at house is rather too drawn out and devoid of any serious fight scenes it is a shame that the tedium wasn't broken up by a decent <UNK> <UNK> rather than saving all of the <UNK> stuff until the end br br the last fight however is worth the wait in the end won <UNK> gives a jaw dropping performance as the high kicking sonny who <UNK> and <UNK> with amazing skill and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gives a solid performance as <UNK> <UNK> the artist turned fighter also particularly good is old school kung fu star <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aka liu <UNK> <UNK> as master <UNK> proving that this old <UNK> has still got what it takes to kick ass although not a perfect film operation <UNK> has enough standout action in its finale to definitely warrant a viewing br br <UNK> i may have got some of the names wrong my dvd calls characters by different names than those listed on imdb
<START> peter <UNK> by nature of appearing in mini series and made for tv films often gets an unfairly high <UNK> of bad reviews usually from casual <UNK> who saw ten minutes of the film having channel <UNK> into it half way through well i've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about the <UNK> mile that should be enough to have you <UNK> out to buy this film br br peter <UNK> won an emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much br br looking to be objective i attempted to <UNK> this film instead i found myself arguing down every one of my possible <UNK> picks this is what true realistic film making is about this is not your typical hollywood <UNK> where everything is <UNK> it's so realistic and true to life that people have thought it's based on a real event
<START> major spoilers watchable only for the action sequences not the story or acting in it nature unleashed fire has one of the longest and excruciating endings in modern motion picture history we have the <UNK> ranger jake bryan leading this trio of hysterical <UNK> to safety in of all <UNK> an explosive <UNK> mine <UNK> this during a raging forest fire it seems that ranger jake with all his knowledge of the great <UNK> didn't realize that a mine <UNK> that's <UNK> with dangerous and explosive <UNK> gas is the last place to go when all the woods around it is on fire br br spoilers from this point on all this started some time ago when ranger jake in an effort to save the not that on the ball <UNK> tiny chris aka the let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine <UNK> or did he even though we were kept in suspense to who's setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie it wasn't a surprise at all the tiny was the <UNK> as you would expect in movies like these tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel in that nothing that ever happened to him fires explosions as well as <UNK> could stop the crazed <UNK> br br before <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> ranger jake got involved in <UNK> <UNK> chris mel sharon marcus josh cohen <UNK> lewis <UNK> griffith ross <UNK> who were trapped in the woods with fires breaking all around them having the usual know it all marcus among the <UNK> things don't go as smoothly as ranger jake wanted them to go marcus not only eggs on the meek chris to do something stupid jump with his bike over a 10 foot pile of <UNK> but has the guy break his leg this makes it almost impossible for ranger jake to have chris air lifted out before the fires <UNK> him as well as his fellow <UNK> br br for the remainder of the movie ranger jake who put himself in charge makes <UNK> after <UNK> in his attempt to save himself and the trapped and lost in the woods <UNK> all this ends with <UNK> brilliant idea to hide in a dangerous and abandoned mine <UNK> with the rescue party just <UNK> away from <UNK> them if they only stayed put and in the open where the rescue team could find them br br even though he was supposed to be the life of the party or movie tiny for all his efforts in being another <UNK> super villain came across as a man who spent too much time out in the sun the make up job on tiny was so outrageous that he looked like he dumped a jar of spaghetti <UNK> over his head instead of having it burned to a crisp br br ranger jake came across as either somewhat very naive or retarded in his being so taken in by the dangerous tiny in always trying to save the <UNK> psycho who never <UNK> his feelings about what he had in mind for the play by the rules forest ranger in fact ranger jake actually encouraged tiny to do both him and the <UNK> in by showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them the fact that ranger jake was successful wasn't because he was so smart but because tiny despite his <UNK> was so brainless
<START> i don't really know when it was that tv stations began <UNK> to have handsome men as their <UNK> regardless of the <UNK> <UNK> but it was clearly a problem by the time that broadcast news came out and the movie does a really good job looking at it portraying a love triangle between pretty boy air head reporter tom william hurt intelligent but nervous reporter aaron altman albert brooks and producer jane craig holly hunter the movie pulls no punches probably the best line in the movie is when tom says something like i don't really understand any of what i'm <UNK> and in the era of fox news and such things a movie like this becomes even more important br br all in all definitely a movie that i recommend also starring robert lois <UNK> joan cusack and jack nicholson in a supporting role as the anchorman
<START> the previews were so funny that i couldn't wait to see this movie i just got home and i have to say i couldn't have been more embarrassed at this movie yes there were times where the jokes were funny but the stereotypical roles were painful joan <UNK> is a fine actress but the scene with the <UNK> spiritual was just in poor taste needless to say the laughs were few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd i was one of a very small handful of blacks
<START> ms <UNK> is sensational in this power drama about a secret policeman who <UNK> a children's author because he believes she is trying to plant ideas in her <UNK> that are contrary to the <UNK> this is an incredibly powerful film both performances are worthy of more recognition as is the message of this movie put this on your must see list if you can locate it
<START> for all of us american <UNK> fans this little gem is a little tough to get <UNK> of fortunately i found myself so wrapped up in the short bits that i saw <UNK> on youtube com that i was willing to go to any <UNK> i found it on ebay com ordered it directly from france and changed my <UNK> so it would play region 2 dvds let me tell you that it was well worth it be warned there are no subtitles <UNK> shouldn't have released this on dvd <UNK> should've they're good about the subtitles i don't speak a word of french i can utter a <UNK> here and there order a drink and <UNK> that having been said this film was a treat anyway i couldn't fully appreciate the supposed <UNK> humor or the witty dialogue watching <UNK> and her <UNK> was enough for me i understood what was going on without need of the dialogue it really says something about a film when those who can't speak the language enjoy it br br the cinematography is wonderful london is adorable as the smitten son on law loved the lesbian mom and of course what can i possibly say about our dear <UNK> she is one of a kind those eyes that smile i could watch her films all day she really goes beyond beauty people always say she's gorgeous well yes she is but she is also very talented i believed her every second of the way her conversation about chocolate and vanilla with london is too sweet her character even gets arrested for smoking <UNK> with some 15 year old in the street not to be missed fly to france and buy this if you have to great 10
<START> an enjoyable movie without a doubt and very <UNK> of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's of but i have to say that having read the very positive comments here i was a bit disappointed the period was captured but the plot was desperately thin the whole thing revolves around the most <UNK> bit of <UNK> in the history of school plays the idea that <UNK> <UNK> would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns but a <UNK> is <UNK> and without that <UNK> the sub plots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story which surely suggests a fundamental flaw when all your sub plots look like padding you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits nevertheless it's a <UNK> movie with its heart in the right place there are some fine performances and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt <UNK> at the final <UNK> ' that good feeling <UNK> the film and that has to count for something a flawed really quite good movie 7 out of 10
<START> enormous suspension of disbelief is required where <UNK> genius is concerned not just in <UNK> he is also very well read in economic history able to out shrink several <UNK> etc etc no no no i don't buy it while they're at it they might as well have him wearing a big s on his chest flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets br br among other problems real genius <UNK> for the moment the problem of what it really is and whether it deserves such mindless homage doesn't simply appear ex it isn't ever so multi <UNK> and it is very rarely appreciated by <UNK> br br better to have made will a basketball <UNK> except that <UNK> too short
<START> the decline series is amazing and director ps can't get enough credit for making these movies i'm slightly surprised to see that not very many people have seen this one or the other two but their worth <UNK> if you want the picture of punk in the <UNK> <UNK> years between the late seventies and early eighties the film starts out with a <UNK> collection of clips played over music from the band x many interviews with bands and that offer an <UNK> perspective as to what surviving was like on the low <UNK> of the mainstream rock ladder no internet crappy jobs and all out <UNK> <UNK> in this genre for new kids who haven't heard of these bands or are just starting one themselves this movie is a true lesson in how to rock all the band performances and there are many are awesome especially fear who never <UNK> to <UNK> me this and the second installment are amazing time <UNK> offering those who care a rare glimpse into the lives of these crazy people it's true punk like in the interview with <UNK> girlfriend when their <UNK> a painter who mysteriously suddenly died outside their house and it took a week or so for them to figure it out they take pictures next to the guy and everyone including the had a chuckle on this one and in true form the <UNK> asks the girlfriend if she was sad or upset that this guy had died while painting their house the response no i hate <UNK> how about black flag renting their apartment rehearsal space for 16 dollars a month my jaw almost fell off at that moment seeing as i'm renting a ten by ten closet to practice in for 400 between watching this and <UNK> i feel like i was born in the wrong time period just missing those cowboy days and nights of the old way the people and bands associated with the movie <UNK> the way for what harder music today is and they did it in their own unique way brilliant film ten stars see part 2 as well its equally awesome part 3 though i don't know what to say about
<START> i had heard about <UNK> and <UNK> and dragons before but i had know idea it could be like what i saw in the <UNK> <UNK> rising these guys are so funny and fun to watch especially the guy who plays the <UNK> or <UNK> or whatever he has a gift for physical comedy and timing there is so much background humor and energy in some of the scenes that make you really think that at least some of it was improvised there on set the special effects needed to be worked on a bit but i saw it at a convention last year and thats one of the things they said they were going to <UNK> and make better so it's probably wicked now
<START> tired <UNK> dreck the chemistry between <UNK> and madsen was as exciting as a wet <UNK> their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting the storyline was a mess the acting forced the cinematography <UNK> on the uninspired lazy and pointless kim gordon and her character had no reason to be there nor did anyone else for that matter i couldn't have given two <UNK> for any of the <UNK> their emotions <UNK> and jumped like a <UNK> who hates his heroin empty and dull why do i have to write ten lines of text on here to make my point i think i summed it up in the first three words but obviously it's not enough i think this is the last time i'll bother to waste my time <UNK> a film anyway i saw <UNK> and thought that was quite <UNK> as well again i cared not for the characters whether they lived or died
<START> this whole movie is just so terrible it is a complete mess the story is just so stupid i can't believe somebody actually sat down and wrote about this and thought it would make a good movie the acting is quite possibly the very worst out of any b movie ever made i've seen a lot of sci fi type b movies before and some of them are actually pretty good some of them however like from <UNK> should never have been made br br some movie makers think that just because they put something together and somehow got it on the shelves of a movie store that they have accomplished something that it is good and should be watched by people this is not always true and it is definitely not true of from <UNK> this film loses on all accounts horrible acting stupid plot very weak special effects <UNK> costumes ever non realistic dialogue bad direction etc you can just tell this film only took about 20 to make and i may be giving it too much credit there i urge you to stay away from this train wreck of a film for your own good
<START> combine good casting bad writing good <UNK> <UNK> bad dialogue and good story idea with lots of potential but is never realized then you have <UNK> br br just bought the movie for a buck it is worth it but not much more br br good to see mark <UNK> act again br br there should be a decent sequel made to <UNK> the damage from the original or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place br br score gave <UNK> your attention from the opening credits however the long shots of <UNK> planes and the even longer revealing of interesting plot points <UNK> his attention getting score br br it is really easy to dog a movie like this after all it is by the producer of and the director of <UNK> and a tremendous cast but it is what it is and that ain't much br br favorite line we're going to make it ha ha boom
<START> in <UNK> to state of confusion the dogs <UNK> do seem to disappear rather abruptly but that may have only been an error in continuity but as for the kids trying to build a plane out of junk it's just a simple matter of imagination these are two very young kids who have extremely active <UNK> and they must rely on those <UNK> to keep themselves from being exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that goes on in their home from their <UNK> as for the <UNK> it's very interesting that the director chose to no show his face that makes him seem more monstrous if you show his face then that character becomes a person and not just this monster who is <UNK> the childhood of these two innocent children by showing only the of his abuse and not focusing scenes on the abuse itself the children then become the main focus of the movie this film has no loose ends but runs just as a father's tale to his children would it has this is a fine american classic
<START> r <UNK> brilliant very entertaining show with spectacular effects any fan of these <UNK> <UNK> has to see this the cgi <UNK> in extremely well with the environment and it's just plain fun to watch these giants walk about their daily business as casually as on discovery channel this show was a stroke of genius and it blows its followers walking with <UNK> and the future is wild out of the water br br the greatest episode was definitely the last where we got to watch the final days of the <UNK> rex and the meteor strike that became their doom this stuff is almost too awesome for television how about a theatrical release i would pay anything to see these <UNK> in the cinema br br if you're in the mood for a show that manages to be spectacular engaging and educational at the same time this is for you dinosaurs have never been <UNK>
<START> the plot in this movie is very thin and there is not much acting val kilmer i don't know why he agreed to do this movie plays a minor role as a gang leader in short the movie is tedious to watch br br one guy who sort of resembles an <UNK> religion professor is exploring a <UNK> area of <UNK> that has some history connected to <UNK> construction and the <UNK> revolution a church tragedy in that history makes the exploration spiritual and spirits of a <UNK> intent haunt the underground ruins a friend of the professor decides to find his friend in the underground and hires a couple of russian <UNK> the entire movie is based on this plot and contains much repeated footage of the underground and some camera effects much like those seen in day watch night watch etc
<START> this film is simply appalling how the talent involved made this is beyond human belief they must have been <UNK> when they thought of this idea i feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken from me harvey will try and distance himself from this rubbish it should have been a great crime movie but it develops into a gory mess of vampires i would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies you wont miss a thing the humour is set to appeal to the lowest common dominate movies can <UNK> us and remind us that life is worth living this film just <UNK> you as deniro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is wasted talent this film is a perfect example of this statement
<START> i remember seeing a clip of this movie on hbo when i was a kid and it scared the ever living crap out of me when i found it i watched it i wish i hadn't the movie wasn't scary br br the plot revolves around an old woman running the castle she <UNK> this horribly <UNK> person in the <UNK> of a 12 century castle she continuously beats the poor guy every day and <UNK> him well that day she dies then a few months later a family moves in a father a mother and their blind daughter the father was involved in a horrific car accident that got their son killed and left their daughter blind br br later through the film the daughter hears sounds things break etc and everybody is not concerned about anything at all that is until a few people turn up dead apparently the creature in the <UNK> has broken free and is killing people how this thing survived for the past few months without food or water is impossible every time i saw the creature it gave me the creeps the creature goes on a gory killing spree and the police blame the father for the deaths br br it was a pretty bad film br br i give this film 3 stars out of 10 creepy not scary
<START> i really refused to see this movie i refused to go with the school and i refused to go with my parents just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid to me anyway one of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices the dukes of hazzard or wallace and <UNK> the curse of the were rabbit it took me 17 minutes to decide time was running out i had to choose it came up on the screen few as in a few tickets left by the time we had to line up and get our ticket only one of us could go in i desperately wanted nicholas to go in to see it but he forced me i crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that i was going in to see this <UNK> i walked in sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie must say i was very surprised that i sat through that masterpiece it was amazing i don't know what i was complaining about the clay animation was by far the most best i've ever seen in my life the story was brilliant about a rabbit <UNK> and crashing a carnival that had been planned for over 500 years basically anti <UNK> control are protecting the people who are competing in the <UNK> competition anti known as wallace and <UNK> who are in charge of this business try to keep all the <UNK> away from the <UNK> carnival i wont say anymore it's just too good to tell i'll admit that the whole idea of a were rabbit is <UNK> it unbelievable and <UNK> it childish but nick park adds substance to it which what makes everyone love it i mean there wont be a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely wont be 8 foot werewolves as said in dog soldiers then again were <UNK> and werewolves aren't actual creatures but either way it worked out very well br br the jokes also were more grown up the kids wont get some of the jokes it goes way above their heads it had a lot of british jokes in there if you love british humor this is the movie for you br br i also loved the cast and the voices everything about the movie is so incredibly well done the direction and pacing was absolutely fantastic i recommend this to fans of the old wallace and <UNK> shorts and no i haven't seen them yet and i recommend it to fans who liked shrek and shrek 2 and most importantly i recommend it to the people who love clay animation cracking good movie 10 10
<START> saw the film at the hollywood film festival in <UNK> <UNK> mark robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult part for his first film and it paid off big in his casting of kelly i had a strong feeling she came from the theater so i looked her up here and surprise i'm right more hollywood actors should follow her lead give up the expensive acting classes and get back to theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this for all the great things i can say about the film and the director and there are many i just can't stop talking to people about kelly masterful performance we'll be seeing a lot more of her work no doubt br br <UNK> to mark and kelly on a daring film get it out in the theaters so i can bring all the people i made want to see the film <UNK>
<START> i see that c thomas <UNK> has appeared in many movies since his <UNK> in the 80s as an accomplished young actor br br i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet related plot and to see how much older c thomas <UNK> is i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s br br in just a few words what a very big disappointment i give some low budget movies a chance but this one started out lame within the first 15 minutes of the movie this <UNK> woman is <UNK> with an asian guy in a they basically <UNK> themselves to their own chat she then insists on meeting the <UNK> in person she meets him has sex ties him up and then murders him in cold blood the plot then <UNK> further br br the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff do not bother renting it much less <UNK> it even if it is in the 1 dvd bin i plan to take my copy of the dvd to <UNK> i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating
<START> i remember seeing this years ago it had a reasonably promising start with an interesting premise but then it <UNK> into nonsense quite quickly uninteresting characters failed attempts to add drama and tension and a bit of simplistic philosophy thrown in too all culminating in a terrible ending br br simply it's trash br br before i saw this tv film i didn't think i would ever have any film that i thought was the worst i had seen but after i finished watching this i knew that from then on if anyone asked me what the worst film i had ever seen was i could say without <UNK> the second coming br br avoid
<START> while there is a lot to recommend about <UNK> legend both in concept and finished product it's ultimately a poor film plot wise it's a retelling of <UNK> early life which is usually unclear at the same time the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the machine empire and since <UNK> <UNK> has trouble not including his other work we get a starting point for <UNK> her sister her mother the queen of la and a bit of galaxy express <UNK> to flesh out the film br br in short <UNK> is a princess on the planet la a planet with an <UNK> <UNK> thus meaning its cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and it's artificial sun is dying the planet grows increasingly <UNK> throughout the story thus increasing the sense of doom in order to protect her subjects and family the queen decides that <UNK> is the only way to ensure survival of la people enter lord a robot cyborg who provides the means for the job through the film the characters are left to question <UNK> will they still be human can be trusted do souls and hearts remain so for a fan of <UNK> work there's lots to enjoy questions to be answered themes continued except it's obvious that the film is meant to be an introduction as well as a fan curiosity the <UNK> foremost the animation while galaxy express <UNK> a tv series from over 20 years ago has shoddy mouth animation and at times <UNK> character design <UNK> legend has all the worst traits of modern animation and thus earns an air of <UNK> to galaxy express <UNK> the design is well detailed but unfortunately the animation has suffered leaving well drawn characters that as in the backgrounds move or the camera <UNK> a quick way of <UNK> however the few yes few well animated scenes are re used over and over in dream sequences <UNK> and in extra scenes anyone who's seem the film will wonder how many times lord can drink the same glass of wine br br next the story while in concept everything sounds great the finished product is in fact a series of conversations of plot which are repeated over and over to little effect the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and the characters which are seemingly much more <UNK> in former <UNK> add to all of that some terrible character design that seem lifeless over exaggerated and the audience is left with a movie so miss handled it might as well have been <UNK> as a different film at least the <UNK> wouldn't be left <UNK> br br and yet it really has its moments the ending at least is surprising the plight of the citizens of la was quite affecting and rightly disturbing i guess i find that whole man machine theme <UNK> it's hard know who to recommend <UNK> legend to since it's not well animated written or executed plus confusing once <UNK> <UNK> mandatory cross <UNK> is introduced however i can't help but <UNK> up when the magnificent entrance of three nine occurs now that's good cinema br br 1 5 stars out of 5 2 if you're a fan
<START> orson welles' 1974 documentary f for fake <UNK> <UNK> and fraud mainly focusing on two men who have been exposed as <UNK> themselves <UNK> irving is a <UNK> who wrote the allegedly <UNK> howard hughes autobiography yet at least it seems <UNK> his innocence the other main subject of the film is artist de a man who has spent his life painting <UNK> of famous masterpieces sometimes selling them to <UNK> as real works by the original artists interspersed among these stories are bits where welles does magic tricks to illustrate points etc and he also <UNK> the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first <UNK> on his resume and then created a radio sensation with war of the worlds br br i really wanted to love this film and find it profound since i am such a welles <UNK> but i couldn't bring myself to do it part of the problem <UNK> with the fact that it was not just non linear it was completely scattered while i appreciate stylish editing and quick jumps and <UNK> particularly when used in an unusual format such as a documentary there was simply too much of it going on in f for fake they created a distraction as opposed to <UNK> style if the story had been more clear and <UNK> i think that the editing probably would not have been as annoying the scattered storytelling was made all the more obnoxious by the fact that these were truly interesting subjects particularly de his artistic <UNK> brings up the topic of fraud in the art world and who is truly able to determine the authenticity of certain works and if the works are not authentic what does it say about those who admire the pieces in <UNK> this is one documentary that i would say to at least give a shot but don't be afraid to turn it off if you're not enjoying it it is certainly the most <UNK> documentary i have ever seen it is a cross between a documentary an art film and experimental film none of which is properly represented or isolated i don't have any lesser opinion of welles after seeing it but it certainly in my opinion doesn't stand out as a glowing <UNK> in his <UNK> 4 10 <UNK>
<START> warning this review may contain spoilers the back of the box is misleading it says all this crap about kids telling ghost stories which they do but then it implies that they will all be killed by some killer in the woods this doesn't happen the stories they tell are a little interesting specifically the one with the dog and all that <UNK> but most are rather boring monsters in the woods some mute girl and the main one the whole movie
<START> i only saw this film once a quarter of a century ago yet it's impact has never left me and i can still remember even now my reactions to it i was <UNK> by the <UNK> and the sheer beauty of so much of the photography i was <UNK> that an american studio could produce such a european film with it's slow pace and its <UNK> plot the lack of any strong characters felt like a flaw but i <UNK> at the completely unnecessary ending on the <UNK> which seemed as though it was <UNK> on to give some kind of plot <UNK> and which was entirely at odds with the style of the rest of the picture it was also refreshing to see a western which made no <UNK> about the brutality and exploitation that so often was the unfortunate <UNK> of the american dream the western scenes and sets also had an authenticity which was entirely new to me and which the recent <UNK> series the film was <UNK> cut for the american audience and its my very real wish that in these days of director's cuts that michael <UNK> is given the opportunity of a fresh edit in the light of reflection a cut which could turn this ill <UNK> movie into the masterpiece it had the potential to become i have now seen the original first cut and the network of relationships makes so much more sense although christopher walken is responsible mainly for carrying this off if only de niro and not kris kristofferson had played the main lead there was still a massive <UNK> with creating the reality and atmosphere to the <UNK> of a good script nevertheless the camera work was so cleverly handled that at times you could almost believe you were inside the action yourself and there were many special moments everybody arguing in the hall in different languages trying to overcome their national differences and seek some <UNK> of action in face of the impending disaster gave a real insight into the difficulties facing the <UNK> together of the usa especially when the threat came from a combination of the old elite and money <UNK> approach to ella when she first visited his cabin stood in stark contrast to the violence that was to follow and was another one i had a special showing with a large group of mates to see the new cut and we all enjoyed it whilst having varying <UNK> this <UNK> and much closer to the truth version of events was probably too much for americans to take when the film was first released but we all felt it had enormous merit and that its place in cinema history was also due for major <UNK>
<START> george mildred the movie lacks the talents of its tv writer john <UNK> who brings the close quarter cut and thrust of <UNK> class war with the alive br br the plot is cut from standard spin off cloth hit man mistaken identity and has as little tension as there are laughs the producers should have taken a <UNK> from rising <UNK> also 1980 which was also bought to the big screen after the tv series demise and kept much of the story in familiar setting br br <UNK> <UNK> died in 1980 but she should not be remembered for this <UNK> piece of work <UNK> as she was by her illness mildred lacks the <UNK> of her tv incarnation cutting <UNK> and <UNK> looks largely directed at georges lack of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also gets lost in the more <UNK> sets this is not to say that they were much to shout about the budget for this movies looks <UNK> small a restaurant they go to is clearly a new semi <UNK> house with some christmas lights <UNK> the front door br br for fans of 70's british comedy or those who just want to <UNK> an old tv companion from their youth this film can add nothing to the experience and they should just stick to the first four tv series out now on dvd
<START> this film was really terrible br br however it's worth seeing as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever i mean this thing went on for about 7 8 minutes repeating the same over and over thats almost 10 of the whole film i haven't laughed as hard as i laughed at that for a long time br br there were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film but the one that i found funniest was when for no reason whatsoever a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end 2 minutes later they run out again what the hell was that for also the tiny white <UNK> that magically changed into a huge yellow <UNK> was pretty classic i'm led to <UNK> that this is because they used footage from the trilogy to <UNK> up this absolute <UNK> i'm gonna have to see those now br br the film is worth watching for a laugh or two but if you dont find bad movies funny stay away
<START> set in <UNK> hometown of <UNK> <UNK> is a semi true story about the life of ryan <UNK> and his buddies <UNK> and br br <UNK> has been dumped by his girlfriend of 2 years who is now seeing a beer <UNK> long haired metal head named and this is driving <UNK> insane with jealousy br br in a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what is going on between and <UNK> <UNK> pays his friends and <UNK> to break into her house and produce evidence of the affair with somewhat disastrous results for all concerned i found this movie very funny maybe partly because i am a total jackass and fan and it has to be said that a lot of the humour will probably be lost on those that do not have prior knowledge of insane brand of <UNK> br br the movie contains much that will be of interest to <UNK> not least the cameo appearance of <UNK> legend tony <UNK> as a police officer there are also <UNK> from brandon novak jason <UNK> and long suffering parents april and phil br br the dvd <UNK> include music <UNK> from featuring brother jess on drums and favourite band him character in the movie takes his name from him <UNK> <UNK> there is also a documentary and a too hot for jackass skit br br in summary as i said before this movie will mainly be of interest to <UNK> and jackass fans but i do feel that and co have made a great effort with and i for one thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> i saw this movie on it's opening night and enjoyed it i probably would have enjoyed it more if i hadn't been sitting by my father my father saw the original unfortunately i have not seen it yet and kept talking through the whole thing he kept saying that the movie sucked and that it was stupid the thing is he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film in every horror movie there is always a certain character depicted if they weren't in the movie well you might not really like it too much the trademark characters are br br the lead character <UNK> elisha <UNK> the lead character's boyfriend <UNK> jared the lead character's sibling soon to be <UNK> jerk nick <UNK> michael murray the annoying <UNK> character <UNK> paris hilton characters who are just around to look pretty dalton jon <UNK> blake robert <UNK> br br with those characters it makes it slightly predictable who will die and who will live obviously you know who will with what i just <UNK> the movie may be predictable in fact i had a pretty good idea who would die just by watching the trailer but it was still enjoyable it may seem stupid why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a deserted camp site that wasn't there in the beginning at times but it is very easy to watch the comedy and gore were the perfect amount for weak <UNK> movie goers it does get gory don't get me wrong less than final destination 2 but it works very well so in conclusion this movie wasn't as hot as the fire the set went up in but the <UNK> could still burn the wax
<START> i waited long to watch this movie also because i like bruce willis the plot was quite different from what i had expected but still quite good its a good mix of emotions humor and drama br br left me thinking over and again
<START> i found this movie to be mostly a p o s it was low budget but that isn't the problem the problem is the movie is just lame it doesn't really make a lot of sense yes it does explain why things happened but that's not what i mean there was just no reason for it all the movie also moved very slow the last ice age was <UNK> than this also i think they went overboard a bit in the kills i don't mean they were too gross but the killer just seemed to spend too much time <UNK> his victim over the head or stabbing his victim maybe i'm being petty but i just didn't like the movie the whole thing seemed like a lower rate version of when a stranger calls and maybe that was the whole point but so what for me when a stranger kills is a 4 10
<START> this film was <UNK> from my friends mum who worked in a charity shop she gave it to us along with a load of other unknown <UNK> tapes the film itself is a bit rubbish there are a few notable bits to laugh at like the bit when his girlfriend gets her head <UNK> into but in general the film is bland when i saw the trailer for the island i couldn't help <UNK> the similarities may have been the inspiration for that film all in all don't bother watching this film as it is dull and boring we enjoyed it so much when we were 16 that we named our band after it another sign this film is a bit crappy is the shots on the back of the video case don't actually appear in the film weird
<START> the midnight hour aka tell me no lies as found in some video stores can be judged in two different ways one by it's <UNK> as a movie complete with a plot no holes good story and believable conclusion and the other is by the skin flick it is trying to be this is certainly no more than a b movie skin flick whose sole purpose is to show every girl in the movie in an overly long sex scene at least once br br if you try to rate this as a regular movie then this is bottom of the line drivel huge plot holes ruin whatever storyline it has going for it for instance if a co worker is killed would you call the police or head home and hit the hot <UNK> judging this movie by it's skin content it's watchable barely the girls for the most part are all beautiful but quite obviously enhanced the sex scenes were all long and overdone though and that made it's only redeeming quality a little boring br br <UNK> smith could probably be a decent actress if she wanted she was not as horrible as you could imagine or maybe next to the rest of the cast she seemed a lot better than she was br br <UNK> anderson who played detective should not even be watching a movie much less acting in one she looked good though so we know why she was there br br overall i would not really recommend this to anyone even if you're looking for a good skin flick there are much better one's out there i rate this 4 out of 10
<START> it's as if this town has the power to suck your brain right out of your head ' <UNK> br br <UNK> christina <UNK> is a sarcastic <UNK> girl bored with her all too average little town bored that is until a woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes to be clues to the poor <UNK> <UNK> now with the help of her precious cat d c ' and an inept fbi agent doug e doug she must find her br br that darn cat is a bad movie it is quite foolish and it has humor that often falls quite flat there are however a few <UNK> of talent in it doug e doug was good in cool his performance as was really funny here he is wasted as the bumbling fbi agent he does have a good scene when he <UNK> the cat though micheal plays <UNK> father his character must be the most understanding parent to ever live this poor guy has his expensive <UNK> crushed gets arrested for picking up his own cat and gets <UNK> at by his <UNK> wife and still doesn't get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles i wish my old man was like that the only real good performance is christina <UNK> she entertaining as the ever annoyed <UNK> but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down you might also recognize peter boyle young frankenstein everybody loves raymond the old lady from wings and cliff from cheers in this movie this is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget even the cat isn't very good i really can't recommend <UNK> that darn cat some young children under 8 might enjoy it a bit but every one else should look elsewhere if you're looking for a good christina <UNK> movie i suggest <UNK> family values the opposite of sex or sleepy hollow if a fun family film is what you're after try snow day instead br br
<START> one thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun exciting for the cast and crew i could sense that they were going up against the budget <UNK> with enthusiasm dedication because they apparently liked the people involved br br i tend to like b movies that are original and have heart and i think this is one such work the actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress director and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent watchable piece of art br br the <UNK> of this film that more or less say why not just rent a hardcore porn movie make the point as to why they didn't like the film going to this film hoping for a lot of t a without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so <UNK> for them one could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a <UNK> porn movie even though i take it the star has done her share of soft porn i think she <UNK> br br in terms of the writing the dialog is not a huge part of the movie like in a <UNK> film but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure with the <UNK> heroine and the leading man learning from their complex web of feelings br br i understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this hats off for proving a few <UNK> of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride br br <UNK> and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot not just <UNK> <UNK> so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art even with the limits of b movie land not disappointing
<START> earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust well parts of the earth because somewhere in italy a band of survivors those without <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with <UNK> blood the final <UNK> is the story of one of their would be victims alan william who looks not surprisingly a lot like kurt russell and his efforts to take down the <UNK> <UNK> hunters who are led by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> harrison <UNK> jr alan has been trained to kill by former <UNK> cop sam woody <UNK> who mostly hangs around giving his <UNK> moral support and <UNK> for <UNK> meat <UNK> is by far the best thing about the film though he doesn't look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time as for the story it's a <UNK> of elements from better films and stories including ten little indians the most dangerous game and escape from new york the final <UNK> moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less <UNK> action fans
<START> i found the movie very interesting i really enjoyed the film the actors were great it was entertainment benny the uncle was wonderful he was real at his character the ending took a wonderful twist i would recommend you seeing it eddie <UNK> girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra <UNK> she was sharp as a nail i also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in brooklyn i loved the scene where he <UNK> the <UNK> in the pot because thats how most people cook lol i actually watched the movie 2 times and learned more the second time
<START> i can't believe i actually spent almost three hours of my life watching this this must be one of the most unbelievable predictable and cheesy television movies i have seen in a long time i was hoping for some good special effects and action instead i spent the entire time rolling my eyes and yelling oh come on at the screen the dialog is shallow and obvious the acting strained at times and as the story moves along isn't it just funny how everything happens at the same time not to mention the obvious and nauseating ending now i've seen more than my share of disaster movies i am a big fan actually and think that often they can pull off completely unrealistic stuff as long as it's done in a fun way but this is definitely not it this is just an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere what were they thinking when they made this movie
<START> <UNK> a classic film with cult status amongst the silent movies directed by victor who also plays the male main role is based on a story by swedish novelist <UNK> the film tells the story of brutal <UNK> david <UNK> who beats up his wife <UNK> his children <UNK> his brother to drinking and is blind for the love of nurse edit <UNK> <UNK> david sits toward the end of the year together with his <UNK> buddies in the city park and tells the story of the phantom <UNK> who dies in the new year's eve night as the last one before dawn has to serve one year long as driver of death and release the dying souls from their bodies but david gets into a fight with his buddies suffers a <UNK> and sinks dead on the <UNK> meanwhile the phantom <UNK> is approaching the driver is nobody else than david's late friend georges who <UNK> him into alcohol and died one year before since david refuses to get on the <UNK> georges forces him together they drive to the stations where people live who suffered from david they visit the nurse edit whose love to david he was unable to recognize and whom he infected with <UNK> so that she is dying now but her love to david will save his soul <UNK> with her spirit they get to david's wife and children david is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children because she does not see a way out of the misery in which david has thrown her they also visit david's brother who has committed a murder after having been <UNK> into drinking by david david asks georges to go back into his body because he finally sees that his way was wrong since it was georges who had <UNK> him once into drinking david's wish is granted he gets a second chance and georges has to be one more year the driver of the phantom <UNK> in order to pay for his own sins this movie belongs probably to the strongest and most impressive films ever made <UNK> it is still not available on international dvd
<START> a delightful and wonderful film which has entered my <UNK> of great romantic comedies in many ways it's even better than when harry met sally it wears well on viewing and re viewing the cast is excellent and both david duchovny and <UNK> driver give us really believable characters
<START> i watched this movie only because i didn't want to leave my 9 <UNK> and her friend in the theater by themselves honestly i went in expecting to enjoy a good <UNK> but found myself <UNK> by the movie i'd recommend it to anyone who asks <UNK> mom was on one of my all time favorite tv shows years ago playing a mermaid maximum bob she was really cute in this movie the three main characters were all excellent young actors also enjoyed seeing and hearing jimmy <UNK> the movie itself was quite beautiful <UNK> some of what makes florida so great i'm glad i ended up going to this movie and to think i was disappointed that i couldn't take them to see stick it i think this was much better
<START> i can't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic i'm a million miles from being an expert and i'm never going to climb a mountain but even the very basic knowledge <UNK> from reading into thin air and watching <UNK> beyond the limit and a few other <UNK> <UNK> meant that this film just got more and more ridiculous as it went on there is some good climbing footage at the start and when the <UNK> mission leader asks early in the film how much experience above <UNK> <UNK> do you have i was encouraged to hope that this might be a gritty and accurate man vs nature odyssey instead you have a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> up a mountain with no climbing with <UNK> off in full sun and they are barely ever out of breath performing <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> only near the <UNK> is a little <UNK> suggested to dramatically <UNK> the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak almost as an <UNK> if you have no knowledge of <UNK> give it a look be prepared for some clichéd <UNK> although no more clichéd than a hundred other <UNK> <UNK> flicks and a clichéd outcome i've been developing a minor fascination with high mountains and was looking forward to watching but other than some amazingly beautiful scenery it was a let down because it was so far removed from reality i can imagine some experts being employed in the making of this movie but then being conveniently ignored in the pursuit of the heroic and sadly <UNK> storyline also you would sound like a bit of a <UNK> if you said welcome to the death zone at feet
<START> truly i love lucy as well comedic genius yes <UNK> never she was as ridiculous as <UNK> as was the film adaptation of divine secrets of the ya ya <UNK> both just completely missed the point russell was is and always will be the first and only <UNK> perhaps as a young <UNK> ball could have pulled off a role like this where her inherent beauty and youth could have carried her through but this seemed a desperate attempt from an aged star to show that she was still <UNK> in the field the reason there are <UNK> many more supporters of <UNK> version aside from the fact that you cant improve upon the original is that russell had presence she <UNK> every scene whereas lucille ball might as well be a pattern on the <UNK> in <UNK> for all the attention she <UNK> in the role
<START> i saw this movie a while ago and i was looking forward to it my biggest problem was having seen the trailer i was expecting a very stylish <UNK> arts movie with plenty of action and maybe a bit of plot to think about along the way i was sorely disappointed as it would seem that once you have seen the trailer there is nothing else worth watching if what you are expecting is as described above my girlfriend at the time gave up half way through and whilst i continued to watch in the hope that something interesting might happen nothing did i found no <UNK> or real interest in any of the characters i would say just don't bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you don't really care about losing
<START> jack frost 2 is probably the most <UNK> movie i have ever seen in my life the complete title of the film is jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines will be delighted to watch this this film was straight to video and for good reasons here's why the acting was so atrocious and so terrible that it could cause one to cry the main character had no personality and the actor's bad acting made it all worse the screenplay was was also atrocious each character always says a cheesy line and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography then you have something bad second the story line isn't really all that impressive but since this movie was straight to video it is forgiven the director and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman into something cool but they didn't they story has lots of plot holes in it in the beginning a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank with the <UNK> jack frost scientists try to <UNK> his life but they couldn't once the cup of coffee fell into the tank jack frost was completely restored now he is <UNK> to anti freeze in jack frost part 1 the main character's <UNK> got mixed up with the anti freeze that was used to kill jack frost since the main character is <UNK> to <UNK> jack frost is too hence here's my point they say that <UNK> <UNK> combined with jack <UNK> but one of the scientists had some <UNK> on the cup so when it fell into the tank the scientists <UNK> would have been combined with jack another thing the special effects weren't very good either here's the good points jack frost 2 has lots of blood that looks pretty realistic even though this movie is flawed to hell it is still entertaining overall jack frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie the first one was better though 7 out of 10
<START> while watching <UNK> valley <UNK> i encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that i was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy a few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh i ate a rabbit i told you she was possessed are you telling me the devil is in my daughter br br there are many many more but you must discover these for yourself if you dare br br the story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't and everyone seems to be a <UNK> or psycho of some sort even the priest and i haven't even gotten to the bad acting most notable in this area is the fellow playing <UNK> father the director must have just told him to act like he's got a stick up his because that's the general impression one gets br br i don't really want to steer anyone away from <UNK> valley <UNK> because there is entertainment value to be had for all the wrong reasons but if you're looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is actually scary well run don't walk
<START> the plot of this movie is set against the most terrible war in history of mankind the violent clash between <UNK> hitler's germany and soviet russia from 1941 <UNK> br br with the western areas of their country thoroughly <UNK> and 20 to 30 million russian people killed the <UNK> of this conflict can be felt in russia up to the present day let alone back in 1957 when memories were still very fresh and painful br br this very black setting strongly <UNK> with the fine and coherent style of beautiful shots its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war bravery love <UNK> weakness <UNK> and corruption all beautifully tied together by a toy <UNK> br br add to this the truly magnificent acting and it's easy to understand why this movie is so famous really one of the very best ever made br br
<START> was released in 1987 by the now <UNK> american animation company <UNK> on the back of he man masters of the universe and she <UNK> princess of power in 1983 and respectively the plot of the cartoon was about a native american cowboy named marshall who possesses the strength of the bear ears of the wolf speed of the <UNK> and eyes of a <UNK> and his <UNK> sidekick a talking horse named thirty thirty who carried with him a gun <UNK> titled <UNK> and with the help of deputy <UNK> and judge j b serve to protect new texas from the evil <UNK> <UNK> and his band of <UNK> br br set in futuristic texas this was and still is to this day one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city in the us hence in the south thousands of light years ahead in the future considering this was made in the 80s the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a sci fi based <UNK> didn't just evoke morality and good <UNK> bad as well as teaching children lessons about life but it also <UNK> themes of culture and community and that we shouldn't take things and life for granted and despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon many of the story lines themes and issues it addressed <UNK> with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them in addition marshall was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a ethnic minority background to make an impact on tv br br the sound effects were amazing the music was great the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful the characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught kids morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong something of which the same cannot be said about today's cartoons sadly br br whilst was overshadowed by the success of he man it is still a personal favourite for many 80s cartoon fanatics suffice to say i preferred over he man because of the diversity of the story lines characters and that the depth of the situations and problems that the characters faced themselves were more what i would say realistic and <UNK> in contrast for some reason they <UNK> more with people because like for instance in 'the where a kid dies from a drug <UNK> the fact that there wasn't a happy ending was important in the sense that when kids watch that episode well in fact anyone who watches that episode will realise for themselves the devastating consequences of drug usage and that no one should <UNK> the dangers of drugs br br bold brave and at times thought provoking is definitely that bold brave and thought provoking a cult cartoon classic for many years to come it <UNK> to take some risks but it had well and truly paid off in the end it will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting as well as best 80s cartoons ever and rightly so br br 8 and a half out of ten
<START> first i must confess that a separate peace is my favorite book so of course i have some bias against any attempt at adapting it for a feature film or television movie but as i began to watch this film i was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt the original version from the early 1970s though shot at phillips <UNK> academy where the <UNK> author attended school and though it stayed as faithful as it could to the book lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the essence of the characters the original seemed to simply go through the motions reading the trivia about the movie you discover that it was cast mostly with non actors thus the original has an amateurish feel to it and it ultimately fails br br this new version though i will grant that it captures the look of the period better than the original seems to have thrown the book out all together scenes are <UNK> characters <UNK> where they don't belong characters created that were not in the book and no attempt was made to delve into the deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling and the <UNK> sin of all the tree is not treated as the vital almost central character it is in the book this is an <UNK> <UNK> on the part of the film makers how could they <UNK> the role of the tree why was it not introduced immediately why the dead poet <UNK> beginning and what in god's name was up with <UNK> accent this film is to be blunt garbage a separate peace should not be a difficult book to adapt for the stage or screen john <UNK> wrote it in a perfectly fine linear style the film makers should have trusted the story as it was already written make changes sure <UNK> here and there sure take some mild dramatic license sure but destroy one of the <UNK> of american literature in the process what were they thinking in their corruption of the story line they cut any possibility of suspense or drama the whole movie falls flat and fails miserably br br if you are a high school or college student assigned to read this book and you are thinking of <UNK> and just watching the movie don't even think about it this film will be of no help to you br br alas we shall have to wait even longer before a version of this story comes to the screen that truly does it justice
<START> i started watching this one very <UNK> because i heard so many different things about it somewhere i read it was a drama about child abuse and rated pg 13 for violence another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of kids and i thought it was also for kids to watch well now i've seen it so many times and still don't know in which category to put it it is extremely funny at times but terribly sad and depressing the next moment because of the nice relationship and the adventures i would like to recommend this film to all the youngsters i know but i fear the somber atmosphere is not suitable for children because of the perfect performances and the magic of the film i must say this nevertheless watch it especially the kids the last thing i have to say is that i hate the scriptwriter for letting poor bobby never see his family again after having <UNK> from the king who didn't even return to <UNK> the remained mary and <UNK> it is very good for this film not to have a perfect happy ending with everybody being happy and i didn't expect it to but this solution left me very very sad
<START> the satirical movie website <UNK> hollywood <UNK> that son of the mask was all a practical joke star jamie kennedy played on new line cinema for his show the jamie kennedy experiment if only and if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piece br br the mask was the ideal vehicle for the face pulling jim carrey that so many viewers <UNK> on it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing cameron diaz so having a <UNK> minus both of them was not a good idea plus you'd have thought new line would have learned their lesson after dumb and <UNK> when harry met lloyd but no though to be fair having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic in which the mask went from owner to owner as written by lance and directed by lawrence however there's nothing there in return except a steady stream of admittedly decent fx by the usual <UNK> of houses industrial light and magic <UNK> on the ally <UNK> dancing baby and their own <UNK> day out with the studio giant killer robots digital dimension and so on in support and an even greater <UNK> to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company responsible for such gems as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his character after <UNK> <UNK> and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clips br br the trouble is that last approach doesn't really work partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon <UNK> to live action fall flat especially the cars getting in the party mood and mostly because the <UNK> to the <UNK> woody <UNK> duck <UNK> and especially one evening show up how weak this movie is in comparison plus the movie fits in <UNK> slapstick alongside strained sentiment the underlying theme of the story is family our hero isn't ready to have a son and his nemesis alan <UNK> as the <UNK> god <UNK> is far from the apple of <UNK> eye and what bob <UNK> is doing here as <UNK> even after super mario bros is beyond me and kennedy just isn't in the same league as carrey in the zany stakes though it's not like he gets any help from the script also note that unlike diaz the very cute howard as the mother of the son of the mask doesn't get much to do giving her the mask might have helped the movie br br further points are lost for throwing away <UNK> <UNK> steven wright and <UNK> <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> running time which would account for some <UNK> plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the green guy as an animated tv series the mask did become an animated tv series in real life and was a far better follow up than this sequel the fact that this actually opened in britain before the us should tell you everything what with this and blade <UNK> new line seems intent on <UNK> the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from two guys and a girl what next the <UNK> effect 2 with nathan <UNK> br br somebody stop this
<START> the first film is somewhat good to me i enjoyed it for the most part but i thought it was really nothing all that special however when compared to this mess it looks a whole heck of a lot better why they felt the need to make the movie is beyond me but they should have known it could not match the acting of the first movie when they only could get ruth gordon back to <UNK> her role the story kind of follows rosemary's baby around and stuff but in reality it is kind of a mess it does not help that the movie is a television movie and the television look shines through very well it has more of a comedy tone to it as well which <UNK> it greatly if they really felt the need to make a sequel they should have made it an r rated movie that had some nudity and gore in it i am sure it would have still been quite bad but at least it would have been more watchable and fun which this movie is not despite its trying to be funny i saw this one on <UNK> and joe bob had nothing really good to say about it in the intro and i do not have to much to say either i do have to say it was a sequel that should have never seen the light of day
<START> may be spoilers no doubt one of the best dramas if not the best in the genre i've ever seen is an alien or just a crazy <UNK> this is the question you'll be asking yourself all throughout the movie br br kevin spacey is simply amazing as is jeff bridges you can't beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times some of kevin actions in this movie are very funny when he was up in the tree for example and when he was talking to the queen mental patient the way he <UNK> half his face around the wall and just <UNK> br br to simply put it right from the start you'll be hooked and if you really love <UNK> you won't be <UNK> br br a solid 85
<START> i find the critique of many imdb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to get away from it all br br in this case however i have to say it was bad i am a scifi <UNK> and there was nothing in this movie that grabbed me for even one second br br there was no proper storyline i may be an idiot but i still do not know where the government was that was so worried about these pieces br br the pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these 3 pieces is scary half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third a 3 year old kid would have been able to put them together br br this movie was bad br br dominic
<START> eddy murphy and robert de niro should be a combination that results in a great comedy great often lead to <UNK> and this proves to be the case br br when eddy as a police officer <UNK> a drug deal being done by detective robert they <UNK> it so badly that they end up doing a live action reality tv cop show logic is not a great <UNK> of this movie the super gun that they spend the second half of the movie chasing down <UNK> it a twelve machine gun that leaves large holes in and three will destroy a house in about a minute without <UNK> is as more a fantasy than science fiction a five pound gun firing hundreds of shots per minute without any <UNK> is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past br br it is clear this movie was designed for neither adults nor children so if you are somewhere in between this is the movie for you
<START> the authors know nothing about russians <UNK> the movie is absolutely <UNK> has nothing common with the reality they also don't that the foreign prisoners in russia have a special prison so the <UNK> never live together with russian criminals the uniforms in this movie look if they were stolen somewhere in latin america prisoners in russia also don't work outside the prison each kill in russian prison is a subject of investigation so the prisoners kill each other only if there some very important reasons playing soccer is also forbidden in the <UNK> contacts between the prisoners are very <UNK> no chance for bloody <UNK> etc etc etc so this movie has nothing common with the reality
<START> this plot had more holes in it than an <UNK> simpson <UNK> br br i noticed two star trek references in the movie and yet br br ironically we have a lead character played by andy garcia br br who is the <UNK> of the <UNK> philosophy of the br br needs of the many <UNK> the needs of the few or one br br let's just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of san francisco at incredible risk michael keaton's character is almost as br br unrealistic as well he <UNK> to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is <UNK> when garcia <UNK> his br br attempt to kill a bunch of cops at once the child's doctor remains in charge of her <UNK> even after been br br held hostage several times in a short <UNK> of time but br br put her on a wide 5 stories up and she loses it br br andy <UNK> child is something of an <UNK> in this br br movie he is the most sympathetic and real character one of the movie's bright spots he furthermore <UNK> a line that must have been the result of <UNK> regarding fighting cancer that parallels keaton's motivation to escape all in all the movie was not a br br complete waste see from <UNK> to dawn 2 texas blood money br br for that but disappointing considering the talent on hand
<START> it helps that the characters this show is based on are among the best disney has ever come up with the writing is what really makes this show it's a total classic given you need to appreciate the type of humor to enjoy it and this is hard to explain the humor is akin to the old school scenarios of 40's and 50's disney with modern <UNK> it never <UNK> into fart jokes or anything of that type it's not adam sandler humor either though i have enjoyed that it is the exact same humor of the movie only expanded upon for the length of time a tv show <UNK> so if you didn't like it in the movie you won't like it here but imo the new groove was the best thing to come out of disney since <UNK> br br a
<START> as much as i love ellen <UNK> who is really underrated i have to boo this movie if you can't tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psycho sexual thriller or have never watched 20 20 it's like the filmmakers and actors didn't care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead <UNK> br br overall this movie serves to turn on the dirty <UNK> who like to mix violence and sex not a fun movie to sit through although if you like ellen <UNK> it's nice to see her place a tough lady
<START> i enjoyed the mr <UNK> cartoons i saw while growing up and i enjoy leslie comic skills so i thought this marriage must produce a funny child br br i couldn't have been more wrong br br this movie was just awful i don't recall a single funny moment this is one of the two or three times in hundreds of films over the years i've wanted my money back you will leave this film <UNK> because you won't ever have that time back to use in a better way in a comedy the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a <UNK> for gags this plot does neither it just kinda lies there <UNK> like a <UNK> fish
<START> i wasn't expecting much because of the harsh reviews and <UNK> to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result <UNK> colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films in my opinion allowed the narrative to take the focus though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was <UNK> i felt like many of the other things were not for example br br how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her br br the very strong and well acted love scenes br br the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually <UNK> them even more br br their strong differences of what it means to be created by their prior life experiences br br the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie br br i've heard and read several things about used in other <UNK> of course however i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and i feel that he does this well i don't need a director to use new tricks i prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately which i feel is the case with this film br br i recommend it
<START> it pains me to see an awesome movie turn into some lame repetitive and lazy series it is filled with plot holes and the plot is confusing in a bad way whoever the <UNK> writers were that decided to turn such a great movie into this garbage should have done some research instead of filling it with one liners and hollow new characters and the classic jokes from the first movie over and over and over and over again sure they get a little creative but its like seeing the same episode with a small twist pretty much like listening to <UNK> or has to prevent himself from failing has a complicated plan but decides to go the easy way to save time and just use a <UNK> someone questions the monkey and the bug appears in the background <UNK> with she <UNK> him without sounding like a bitch <UNK> herself as principal and she calls and he forgets that she is i admit this show does have it's moments another problem is the fact that looks younger and looks weird also no one can replace david spade and john goodman their the ones who made and and sorry but i give this show two thumbs down
<START> this movie has a lot to recommend it the paintings the music and david naked butt are all gorgeous the plot a story of redemption forgiveness and courage in the face of <UNK> is also very interesting and touching and it's not predictable which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age but the acting is mediocre the direction is confusing and the script is just odd it often felt like it was trying to be a parody but i never figured out what it was trying to be parody of and if it's not a parody well it remains a movie with great potential that it didn't live up to
<START> the beat is too strong we're deaf mutants now like them rex br br i am surprised that this movie has been uniformly <UNK> let me be the first to actually discuss the virtues of the beat and why you must see this film now br br make no mistake this movie is cheesy and bad in the conventional sense the story is preposterous the poetry is silly and the acting is inconsistent br br but these are the film's charms all of these ingredients form the recipe for one of the most <UNK> <UNK> films of the 80's br br if the reference to deaf mutants didn't <UNK> your interest then perhaps this will what kind of name is rex anyway it is such an unusual name for north american audiences that i said to myself even the names of the characters in this <UNK> movie are silly br br well the beat is so <UNK> <UNK> that the meaning and symbolism behind rex is revealed not too subtly by bart <UNK> the misguided <UNK> <UNK> you love to hate i won't spoil the revelation behind <UNK> name but please don't get too excited o k br br overall the acting is inconsistent john savage who plays the concerned teacher mr <UNK> is pretty good as is the fellow playing bart <UNK> but the rest of the cast are unconvincing that said the acting does not detract from the film why there is a sincerity in each of the actors' performances that makes the characters they play endearing so although the performances may suck you are still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best as a result the actors' sincerity succeeds where their acting fails which is quite often br br the homage to beat poetry in this film is bad bad bad but this is a good good good thing when it comes to entertainment would you actually enjoy better quality or more respectable poetry especially in a film like this br br folks that would be boring think about the <UNK> they made us read in high school <UNK> to avoid <UNK> the youth politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis etc even if you don't like poetry or arty movies with all of the intellectual <UNK> that implies you most certainly can and should appreciate ludicrous poetry in a wannabe art film how could you not enjoy the following br br do you remember the <UNK> of the dinosaur a woman's <UNK> <UNK> on the floor bad <UNK> bad oh the woman's so sad she <UNK> her hands and then waits by the door today yeah today br br yes that is an example of some of the remarkable poetry <UNK> <UNK> throughout the beat but what about the story you ask br br well the story is preposterous but then again that is the beauty of this film apart from some cliches stereotypes and predictable plot points there are enough genuinely unique elements to the plot story to keep things interesting who is rex where did he come from what the heck is he talking about deaf mutants illiterate angels do billy and kate really understand what rex is saying is the audience supposed to understand rex and his poetry <UNK> i've seen the movie several times and i still haven't figured everything out br br will bad poetry and high school talent shows really end gang violence br br i guarantee that you have never seen anything quite like the beat a perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry mediocre yet sincere acting and a <UNK> gang violence storyline that has yet to be <UNK> by any film ever made br br bonus for fans of classic nyc hardcore the <UNK> <UNK> make a rare film appearance as the iron <UNK> and it's a hoot to see them perform several songs i wish they included more concert footage but maybe that will be an extra included on the <UNK> edition dvd i <UNK> about br br
<START> this is a gripping story that borrows elements from the kennedy assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western tale br br the movie has a good music score though it relies on repeating the title theme a little too much <UNK> <UNK> and the rest of the cast are superb this is a more cerebral than usual spaghetti western that relies more on story than action and it succeeds because the story is excellent this is not to say that there is no action in the movie there is plenty and it is very well crafted this movie pulls you in right away and keeps you absorbed <UNK> the end you'll always be wondering what's in those documents everyone's after it also has some biting commentary on american politics br br this movie shows why in my opinion is in a three way tie with and <UNK> for second place in the <UNK> of spaghetti western directors
<START> i thought it was terrific very realistic and funny dialogue and realistic action in a i didn't like how the jennifer storyline is not really <UNK> or how the ending doesn't give us closure holly hunter fit the part perfectly she's one crazy actress this movie is well worth seeing
<START> i saw this again today for the first time in about 6 years i had forgotten how well acted this movie is paul newman gets the billing but dwight <UNK> holds his own and shows how good an actor he really is
<START> natalie wood portrays <UNK> <UNK> a disabled <UNK> who attempts to avoid being <UNK> as a result of involvement in her first love affair with her partner being attorney marcus simon played <UNK> by <UNK> real life husband robert wagner the film is cut heavily but the majority of the remaining scenes shows a very weak hand from the director who <UNK> wagner to consistently laying waste to a solid and nuanced performance from wood who also <UNK> a fine soprano the script is somewhat trite but the <UNK> nature of <UNK> dramatic <UNK> is unfortunately in place throughout as he is given a free hand to <UNK> his <UNK> stare at wood which must be <UNK> to an actress the progression of their relationship is <UNK> presented and this coupled with choppy editing leads the viewer to be less than assured as to what is <UNK> motivation being almost completely ignored in the writing although largely <UNK> the cinematography shines during one brief scene when wood is placed in a <UNK> and following the sound of a closing door remains at the center while the <UNK> eye <UNK> pulls away <UNK> her <UNK> and <UNK> more controlled direction would have allowed the performers even the limp wagner to scale their acting along the lines of an engaging relationship as it was released there is for the most part an immense lack of commitment
<START> amitabh and khan raised great expectations by their press <UNK> though it was quite easy for the critics and the fans too that after all this much hyped ram <UNK> <UNK> factory product is going to fall flat on it's face in all the <UNK> why because was so immature and childish and <UNK> mixed up guilty and unsure they themselves didn't know what the hell they were talking about to the press keeping up with the tag line that some love stories are not to be understood or some such rubbish why the title is <UNK> <UNK> needs to <UNK> his knowledge of <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> needs to study <UNK> in line another glorious flop of the year comparison with the sweet hearts and is inevitable as the so called plot line is supposed to have inspired by them but sadly <UNK> has hardly made any serious effort to delve deeply into the psyche of the aging and the young ones is <UNK> pop sucking the ultimate <UNK> of the innocence and contrary to that streak of <UNK> the leg show at the <UNK> table with a <UNK> that is <UNK> in that role <UNK> into <UNK> of shameless laughter <UNK> after <UNK> this girl is in fact at her seductive game <UNK> poor <UNK> to think she is in love with him the legs too are skinny enough and that act of putting the water <UNK> through the legs is down right obscene it's beyond any one's understanding how can a girl coming as a guest to some <UNK> house can be so <UNK> <UNK> and over <UNK> and why the hell that stupid wife played by remarkably well though scripted poorly and <UNK> <UNK> encourages her own husband to dance with a <UNK> saying young girl that part of <UNK> trying to gain some to his <UNK> life is absolute <UNK> because apparently it seems that he is happy as he is with a well settled life and a <UNK> to recreate this reminds of blame it on <UNK> the older daddy and his young love superbly played by michael caine <UNK> looks terrible in close ups and over all where as kevin spacey and jeremy <UNK> looked <UNK> and handsome which is why the young chicks some times get attracted to older men for their charming persona compared to the vulnerability of young boys of their age only good thing about this movie is those green <UNK> land <UNK> <UNK> roads and pleasant cinematography no substance or even any <UNK> show of emotions drama or even intriguing <UNK> sex like in <UNK> this shallow movie has no wonder fallen flat on it's face and had to be wound up from the screens during first weeks next time round before <UNK> <UNK> any such theme from hollywood <UNK> should do his home work and <UNK> should think twice you can not fool all the people at all the times mr <UNK>
<START> david <UNK> is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of <UNK> it <UNK> the problems of a culture that is <UNK> into technology that it can no longer <UNK> between fantasy and reality or between the <UNK> and the mechanical the movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with <UNK> one in this context the technology is able to be part of human body after playing the virtual reality game of the real world feels like a game and as a result human behavior change in order to apply violent game <UNK> even when the game is over in technology has evolved from <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> that plug directly into the human nervous system an idea that reflects marshall belief who is a well known media <UNK> that computers are <UNK> of human consciousness like <UNK> is an of the ear television is an of the eye <UNK> is an of the central nervous system high tech virtual reality is an of human consciousness in technology is <UNK> and thus more human than it is in our world but as technology becomes <UNK> humans become more mechanical and therefore less free unable to resist their game <UNK> is a virtual <UNK> <UNK> of man's existence jean describes a society in his book of <UNK> and <UNK> which all power to act has been transformed to appear the world has passed into a pure <UNK> of itself in it is obvious to see society with the themes of the invasion of the body the loss of control and the transformation of the self into other br br while you are in the consciousness slowly <UNK> with another identity your role in the game which is a reflection each <UNK> real life <UNK> while you gain the control of your life step by step the aura of your real life for <UNK> or <UNK> have become more than real ' our like <UNK> world of computer <UNK> now feels and for all <UNK> and purposes is more real than what we call the real world ' the purpose of the game which can basically be called is quite <UNK> because you can not even know what is experience unless you experience it as say that life without an exact explanation is absurd the game of is absurd too <UNK> ironically reflects the absurdity of our lives for instance in the game the other roles just stand still unless you ask them a pre <UNK> question and when you put their <UNK> funny looking state of being into the representation of our <UNK> the exposed absurdity really shocks br br the theme of the game is to understand what it is for this hidden <UNK> question creates anguish over the people who play they have no doubt about their existence however they do not know the underlying reason of their existence the essence br br have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature or essence as other animals and plants do each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature in the <UNK> of the 20th century french <UNK> jean paul <UNK> existence <UNK> essence choice is therefore central to human existence and it is <UNK> even the <UNK> to choose is a choice freedom of choice <UNK> commitment and responsibility because individuals are free to choose their own path have <UNK> they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads ' perhaps i should mention deals with the concept of freedom of choice too you achieve your final role in the game by taking right decisions if you don't than the game becomes and boring so you begin to <UNK> the game your existence rather than your essence you suddenly become from the game and realize your position outside the game well as a last word is a well designed reverse <UNK> of life thus <UNK> br br
<START> i would label this show as horrendous if it weren't for the fact that it's on the same network as arrested development because it is on fox and getting <UNK> while ad got cancelled br br it is absolutely beyond words how atrocious this show actually is but let me try and describe it take an extremely low rate <UNK> <UNK> and have him <UNK> out humor that would have been out of date if it were on married with children then take great plot lines from ad son has an ugly boring girlfriend and dumb them down so the idiots who watch sitcoms can understand them br br if you watch this i will have completely lost respect for you as should your family however if you are a fan you should love <UNK> new comedy <UNK> death looks like real funny cutting edge stuff i mean married couples not getting along brilliant
<START> this movie was an amazing tribute to whoever has gone through this type of pain and suffering the acting wasn't the greatest i'll admit that but it was passionate about it's message sending people into <UNK> without so much as an attorney or some type of trial is cruel and unusual they even had a damn trial for <UNK> so why doesn't every suspected terrorist have some type of fair and justified trial or hearing as to why they were <UNK> in the first place i'm getting off the movie but i think it's worthy to note about this sick twisted idea the government has the movie's way of telling the story and the <UNK> was a great mystery the whole movie i was trying to connect the daughter with the plot and it's made very obvious in the end there's no doubt that the directing was incredible but the one thing i didn't care for was that there wasn't as much emphasis on reese <UNK> character's interest and fight in the ideal she held a lot of skipping otherwise it was actually quite entertaining and most of all it kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played
<START> in landscape after the battle in the second era of his filmmaking career depicts emotional and psychological confusion in a former nazi prison in <UNK> freed immediately after the wwii br br a hand held camera explores a lot of extreme close ups and vivid colors the end credit as <UNK> on of <UNK> train cars <UNK> concludes the film the soundtrack is great except <UNK> which sounds tacky in pop art fashion in the opening sequence
<START> i just watched this today on tv it was on <UNK> sunday afternoon movie br br this wasn't a very good movie but for a low budget independent film like this it was okay there is some suspense in it but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie down the script is pretty lame and the plot elements aren't very realistic such as the way a <UNK> <UNK> would laugh and hang up when someone is <UNK> a murder i don't know what the writer was thinking when they came up with that idea but it isn't very realistic br br i thought this movie was going to be a good suspense thriller because there were a few scenes that seemed like they would lead to something good but unfortunately they never did there were a few plot elements that have been used in other movies similar to this and in the end didn't prove to be very creative br br if there is something good about this movie it is the cast every actor in this movie did good with what they had to work with the terribly underrated actress elizabeth <UNK> was great in this movie she is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice however if you want to see a movie of hers that is really good watch the excellent animated movie the <UNK> in that movie she put her sexy voice to good use br br what can i say this movie isn't really worth your time but the actors were good unfortunately they were all wasted on this movie which is a real shame this movie tried to be a good suspense thriller but in the end it fell flat if you want to see a good movie that is similar to this but much better see the <UNK> if you want to see something with the cast members of this movie watch any of their other movies you can real easily pass on this movie if you ever get the chance to see it
<START> the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo regardless of the age of the <UNK> the plot itself makes sense but the characters don't br br this might sound <UNK> but considering that the city of <UNK> is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any machine ever <UNK> human arrogance short <UNK> and greed quite so effectively i doubt it there are some <UNK> towards this in the movie but only when the team can be bothered to put them in by and large the or whatever they are are <UNK> with human characters seems sloppy to me br br the main characters seem to have some kind of emotional <UNK> though no light is shed on this little light is shed on the <UNK> at all a great pity the short length of the film coupled with the focus on <UNK> and the crime means that we don't see any character depth the all down yet we're left with no finished product a <UNK> version of this <UNK> would have made a great tv episode once some character sub plots had been established br br the highlights of this short film are the <UNK> designs and the action espionage br br the flaws really start to show through once you've had a chance to <UNK> all the goings on so i couldn't recommend this for <UNK> but it's certainly worth a watch or two whilst this review is mostly negative i really do think it's worth your time to watch this but it's not something to rush out and buy br br in a nutshell a watchable wasted opportunity
<START> why would burt <UNK> allow himself to play a poor <UNK> who is ultimately <UNK> by femme fatale anna <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> in the same reason why robert mitchum allows himself to be cast as another loser who falls for femme fatale faith <UNK> in the 1950 noir where danger lives perhaps they both felt it was a good way to show that they had as playing against type the usual <UNK> <UNK> role they were known for would enhance their image as actors who could play any role but the problem was that roles like steve thompson the pathetic love sick <UNK> in did nothing to enhance <UNK> career not only is <UNK> completely miscast in the one note role of thompson but there's something <UNK> unlikeable and may i say pathetic about the film's protagonist in the first place br br is an <UNK> slow moving film among the many unnecessary scenes in the film is at the beginning the flashback which chronicles <UNK> confrontation with dan <UNK> <UNK> at the nightclub everything that occurs in that initial flashback is explained later in the picture the <UNK> affair between steve and anna <UNK> strained relationship with <UNK> the cop and his bad blood with <UNK> if director <UNK> felt compelled to begin the film with a flashback why not keep it under three minutes i think it would have been more effective br br in it takes quite awhile before the protagonist commits himself and steps out of the <UNK> world of act one that's the scene where he's passing <UNK> and anna at the nightclub and notice how <UNK> spends so much time cutting back and forth between anna dancing and steve staring at her in addition to the cross cutting he also spends a great deal of time focusing on <UNK> and his band than moving the story along br br up until the crisis of act two the story <UNK> along with thompson having various uneasy encounters with anna and then drowning his <UNK> at his usual <UNK> hole at the <UNK> of act two he learns that anna has run off and gotten married to <UNK> it's becoming more clear at this point that one of the film's central weaknesses is that <UNK> is never on screen throughout most of the second act there are no <UNK> between thompson and <UNK> during this time and we're left with the rather <UNK> <UNK> between the two <UNK> as it turns out and anna <UNK> this later to steve the reason why she left was not only because he disappeared for eight months but she also felt pressure from <UNK> mother as well direct <UNK> from <UNK> the cop who implied that he would see to it that she ended up in the women's house of <UNK> anna goes back to steve because she realizes she made a big mistake with turns out that he's been beating her and she's now scared of him br br one of the silly <UNK> <UNK> by more than one character in <UNK> cross is that you can never <UNK> an <UNK> car but everyone acts so surprised when steve points out it can be done if it's an <UNK> <UNK> you would have thought that <UNK> would have known about <UNK> as an <UNK> car driver and <UNK> him beforehand but of course steve needs to make the <UNK> so that <UNK> won't kill him after discovering his affair with anna if they're so afraid at getting caught why do steve and anna meet at his apartment where <UNK> can so easily find them i really got a kick out of played by alan <UNK> the of the operation <UNK> is so dumb that he has to hire this alcoholic ex professor type who plots out the heist on a map oh there is the matter of <UNK> the ingredients to <UNK> the gas bombs used during the robbery and of course is good at that too br br the only really well done scene in the entire film is the <UNK> car robbery the editing was quite good as it depicted the rising action of a heist gone bad as the gas bombs go off the brutality of the gang is shown in high relief when <UNK> murders the innocent <UNK> car guard br br the climax of the film is as drawn out as the rest of the film why does it take so long for one of <UNK> to kidnap thompson there's that nurse then the <UNK> is waiting outside then he comes in and pretends that he's a friend steve falls asleep and finally after he <UNK> the <UNK> kidnaps him br br when steve finally meets up with anna at the house we wonder how anna got her hands on the cash did she somehow steal it from <UNK> after the heist when he went out to dinner it's never explained even worse anna suddenly becomes the evil femme fatale out of the blue before her <UNK> and attraction to <UNK> can be explained by her perceived <UNK> at the hands of steve and <UNK> but after going back to steve because she fears <UNK> she inexplicably turns on him when he is most vulnerable just as there is you have femme <UNK> br br in film <UNK> reference to the american style by silver and ward the authors <UNK> by as one of the most tragic and compelling of film noir i beg to <UNK> in order to have tragedy you need characters that have great depth and in order to be compelling you need a story that's plausible <UNK> cross has neither it's an overrated b movie that somehow has found itself in the <UNK> of art house <UNK> once again the herd mentality has <UNK> in <UNK> the pictures of <UNK>
<START> this is just dreadful i regret every second of the 80 minutes i spent watching this dreck i think it's supposed to be a comedy but i don't remember laughing much except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors br br an unattractive middle aged man called lester meets up with rich unattractive middle aged women via lonely hearts ads and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction that's the whole plot and that's really all that happens along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who <UNK> him about knowing his secret but its so badly <UNK> you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening the sequences in which lester murders the rich <UNK> are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies one sequence has a woman <UNK> with a wooden pole and then shoved into an <UNK> it's very <UNK> depicted but it is played out against <UNK> big band <UNK> music with lester pulling faces and <UNK> comedy poses throughout another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs you have to see this to believe it actually you don't have to see it at all in fact i strongly recommend you avoid this flop fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there's no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career one sequence stood out to me as particularly wretched the revelation when lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this <UNK> on screen so from this point on he just films the actor as normal shadow and all and thus totally blows the whole angle either he had zero budget for effects or he just didn't care enough to think up any way of showing it whatever it was that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is i couldn't even understand most of the film and there certainly wasn't anything on screen worth looking at half the time even the ending was as flat as a <UNK> a real dud
<START> <UNK> bert <UNK> is a would be <UNK> <UNK> robert <UNK> is a would be <UNK> both work at a <UNK> stand in the <UNK> of an office building <UNK> wants to sell a song to <UNK> lake a song <UNK> who also owns the building <UNK> secretary mary betty <UNK> is sweetheart when lake turns up dead circumstances <UNK> to make mary and <UNK> think that <UNK> is the killer they <UNK> again to <UNK> mary who goes to jail but who really shot lake who is the black widow the <UNK> who had threatened him the other characters in this wacky murder mystery are <UNK> suspicious wife a self satisfied private detective a seemingly slow witted janitor willie best <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> who thinks lake is stealing from him and another who thinks everyone is stealing from him it's up to <UNK> and his truth machine to reveal the real killer br br the baby voiced <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> strike me as an <UNK> pairing but they made several movies together in the 30s and some of them were funny br br not this one george stevens who went on to have a distinguished career directed this dismal comedy with a tedious murder mystery plot but two scenes are good and both feature <UNK> and betty <UNK> singing the excellent music in my heart written by dorothy fields and jimmy <UNK> the first time they sing it walking up a <UNK> after which they dance back down later <UNK> and <UNK> are on <UNK> so that they can see and talk to mary who is in a jail cell on a high floor <UNK> and <UNK> sing to each other through the bars br br the <UNK> has a few laughs but the level of comedy is best illustrated by <UNK> line sonny you've got the brain of a six year old boy and i'll bet even he was glad to get rid of it it's watered down didn't use the superfluous even when he said it
<START> there wasn't a 0 in the voting option so i was compelled to use the next available figure br br it is a sad day for bollywood when such type of movies which have star cast actors is nothing more are than a bunch of juvenile acting and an awful script br br this movie is nowhere near to be called a clone of <UNK> salman khan with his usual take off you shirt theme and govinda with his in humorous laughs if somebody had told 2 decades ago that i would be writing a comment on salman after his success with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i would have written him her off
<START> r 64 br br <UNK> merit less and above all dreary trash you know a movie is going to be bad when its sole star power is lance <UNK> the french title for this movie says it all inexplicable how can you possibly make a movie this unbelievably bad in this day and age whatever <UNK> trick is it worked this is <UNK> trash i'm talking <UNK> level crap meaningless unwatchable not even so bad it's good cinematic <UNK> of the highest order br br lance <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> a character who could have been interesting if he wasn't so utterly devoid of characteristics or personality he along with a bunch of morons goes on a field trip to search for an evil sasquatch which is believed to have attacked a plane which crashed out in the woods or something not much else happens there's some soft core meaning level nudity and some blatant rip offs of predator after <UNK> minutes of utter pain and another ripped off scene this time from blair witch the movie finally <UNK> across the finish line and ends as a bonus we only see the monster itself for about one or two scenes in the entire movie br br there's really not much to say about this film all you need to know is this is a very bad movie and not even worth viewing as a so bad it's good flick the <UNK> is to entertainment value what orlando bloom is to character acting avoid it like <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is not a great italian thriller get ready for the spoiler the main suspect the professor didn't do it but is it really a spoiler no because you know that he couldn't have been the murderer from the very beginning he and a student witnessed the first murder so there is absolutely no suspense as to whether or not the professor is the killer there is a long tedious build up to the final explanation of the mystery the solution is interesting but it comes out of nowhere the rest of the movie and it's not a short movie is just not exciting enough to hold your interest even in the tradition of wrong man accused it fails because the police never seriously <UNK> the professor and the killer is never after him dull dull dull
<START> i haven't watched this show in months but for a while i was forced to watch it every day because i had a roommate that liked it so maybe it's <UNK> some vast improvement in all that time although the commercials and the 4 2 rating on imdb aren't a good sign br br it was clearly just a quick replacement for <UNK> show even <UNK> says so and while i wasn't even that big a fan of <UNK> show his jokes were at least original and clever and far <UNK> than <UNK> has ever been <UNK> jokes are completely unoriginal and stale if you can't see that i guess there's just no hope for you but to be fair here are some examples br br <UNK> blatantly rips off <UNK> jon skit just takes it br br south park makes an episode about <UNK> one week later <UNK> has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to <UNK> bear in mind the joke isn't about <UNK> but about how much he's offended them on his show when up to this point he has never made a single <UNK> joke ever br br after <UNK> <UNK> two <UNK> photos go around the internet showing a black man <UNK> <UNK> and a white woman finding them weeks later after millions of people have already seen this <UNK> presents it on his show as if he discovered it and it's being shown for the first time the daily show would have been on something like that in a day pathetic br br even more annoying than the joke stealing is the way carlos has promoted himself and his show claiming he's breaking down some sort of pc <UNK> whatever and that if you aren't laughing you must be a weak <UNK> who can't handle any jokes about race yes carlos it's not because you're not funny it's because we're all too offended to laugh if that was really true then why was <UNK> show so popular he constantly <UNK> his audience for not getting it if he doesn't get enough laughs and often repeats and explains his jokes a technique most comedians stop using by age 14 br br the worst part is that <UNK> does not seem to be very intelligent it's sort of tragic that there are dozens of funnier more insightful comedians out there trying to make it while this guy is rolling in money his show is supposedly the third highest rated on comedy central which is <UNK> again it has a 4 2 rating on this site where the hell are they getting these numbers comedy central tries to bill itself as an edgy station but as long as it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible that will never be the case
<START> helen kate <UNK> owns a <UNK> in the sleepy <UNK> town of by the sea divorced helen has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer giving mother a bit more freedom working at <UNK> store are the manager janet ellen <UNK> a man crazy village <UNK> girl who has eyes for the handsome <UNK> george tom <UNK> and two young college students jennifer <UNK> nicholson and johnny tom everett scott one day helen stumbles across a romantic tender love letter and she suspects that johnny has written it for her throwing caution to the wind helen and johnny begin a small time thing but the letter subsequently lands in <UNK> hands including who thinks george has sent it to her and <UNK> who <UNK> helen has penned it for him and on and on the letter goes but in truth george possibly has eyes for helen and jennifer has fallen hard for johnny the town's museum <UNK> too may have a secret love will <UNK> affairs like these ever <UNK> themselves out this is a cute movie with a gorgeous setting and capable stars each of the main actors gives a pleasing performance including the addition of <UNK> <UNK> and gloria stuart to those mentioned previously then too the <UNK> scenery is most lovely the costumes quite well chosen and the photography very nice indeed there are a few surprises including a subtle gay plot development which may not please all viewers but for those who love romantic comedies this one should be included on any list of good choices for the genre
<START> very violent and nicely filmed movie is a bad sexy girl who will show that men can be raped too this movie has lots of black humor this guy will kill anybody just to forget he used to be a gangster there will be sometimes when you wouldn't know whether to <UNK> or to smile and think am i laughing at someone who is killing people
<START> it is extremely rare that i see a movie from 1955 that i don't love noir sci fi drive ins i dig it all the most robert <UNK> is a director who has done plenty of excellent work and most of this cast has fine performances under their belt so what went wrong br br when i used to work in the independent film world we used to talk about something called actors' movies actors' movies are movies that are unwatchable to anyone but other actors actors like actors' movies because they get to see acting which is to say completely over the top melodrama actors love to be given the chance to totally let loose give it all they've got and they get a great satisfaction from watching other actors do so in many interviews with actors they say he was a great director he never <UNK> with me in any way actually that's the opposite of good directing because the whole point of having a director on the set is to keep the actors from making fools of themselves which given the chance they will always do br br apparently robert <UNK> forgot that on this project or maybe he was ill or maybe he thought there was no hope for saving the script in the first place so what the heck whatever the case here is an example of a lesser known movie that is best forgotten the characters <UNK> and generally ham it up all the way through one thing i can say is realistic it's set in hollywood and everyone acts like their petty problems are the most important thing in the world doesn't make it fun to watch but it is realistic what isn't realistic is that a producer so desperate to keep his star under contract is going to go out of his way to him in almost every <UNK> way including <UNK> him to engage in illegal activity but this and other plot <UNK> merely carry along the melodrama increasing the opportunity for hand <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br i did manage to get to the end of this film which makes it no worse than a 3 out of 10 in my book but why test your own <UNK> when there is so much else available to rent
<START> this sequel to in the heat of the night will suffer in inevitable comparisons to its infinitely better predecessor instead of looking like a theatrical movie edited for television mister looks <UNK> like a tv movie edited for theatrical release with grainy photography cheesy opening titles and sets that look like they're made of <UNK> the murder sequence has a glaring continuity error the camera shows two hands <UNK> the girl then a shot of a hand reaching for a <UNK> then a shot of the girl being <UNK> with two hands again and finally the <UNK> coming down for the fatal blow solving the case should be easy find the only guy with three hands but the shoddy production values can't completely obscure this film's considerable merits namely sidney <UNK> performance as the cool detective determined to follow the evidence wherever it may lead even if it <UNK> a friend martin <UNK> is also convincing as the do <UNK> preacher <UNK> suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute girlfriend in addition to being haunted by the case is conflicted about his home life but the issues of race and barely <UNK> sense of social outrage are absent here so is the complex murder mystery that made in the heat of the night so compelling
<START> this film is totally <UNK> it manages to be thought provoking funny tragic and cinematic yet claustrophobic br br although the flashbacks are unnecessary the film maintains a <UNK> <UNK> grip and the performances are all excellent in particular alec baldwin and the <UNK> eric <UNK> as the film's anti hero barry
<START> the quintessential let's get ready for summer movie it's dumb goofy and maybe a touch dated but my kids just saw it and they laughed as hard as i did when i first saw it in the style of all little guys versus the establishment movies so yes the plot is very predictable but it's warm and funny and no it's not bill murray at his bill but he is starting to stretch out in what was his first starring role odd though to see how few of the fresh young faces in this film went on to do much more
<START> the black castle is one of those film's that has found its way into a boris karloff collection and is <UNK> expected to be an outright horror movie whilst some horror elements exist within nathan movie this really is a multi genre piece that's tightly produced and effectively portrayed joining karloff in what is a small but critical role are richard greene stephen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr rita john <UNK> michael <UNK> it's produced <UNK> out of universal international pictures the plot sees <UNK> english gentleman travel to the castle home of the sinister count von bruno <UNK> he's following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends an investigation that is <UNK> with danger and surprise at every turn br br this has everything that fans of the old dark house castle sub genre could wish for genuine good and bad guys a fair maiden dark <UNK> for doing dark deeds <UNK> traps <UNK> clock finale and we even get a good old fashioned bit of <UNK> into the bargain the cast are all turning in effective performances particularly greene and the wonderfully <UNK> <UNK> whilst jerry writing is lean and devoid of the pointless filler that has so often <UNK> down similar film's of this <UNK> a very recommended film on that karloff fans understand it's not really a karloff movie and perhaps more importantly that horror fans don't expect blood letting to be the order of the day a fine atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout the black castle is a fine viewing experience 7 10
<START> i am very thankful that the small college town of <UNK> near <UNK> <UNK> and home of the famous <UNK> theatre where gregory peck once acted managed to get an art film festival and show this film there is two and a hour hours from where i live but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word distant is an amazing brilliant jarring emotional captivating film as a turkish american this film was not only a <UNK> as to what life in turkey is like but on a larger scale it tells the world of what it is like to be turkish whether one lives in <UNK> berlin <UNK> new york or <UNK> it may be two hours in length as opposed to five minutes but this is effectively our bob <UNK> song there are so many wonderful scenes in this film it is very difficult to choose just a random few but for me one telling scene takes place in a downtown <UNK> cinema the title character played by <UNK> who sadly died in a car accident shortly after this film's <UNK> follows a very attractive young woman down a <UNK> to the <UNK> main <UNK> she goes into see vanilla sky as the image of tom cruise is reflected from a glass we sense that turkish men are competing with tom cruise for their own women's affections even though tom cruise is nowhere to found in the scenes shot across the <UNK> are also quite revealing as they <UNK> the beauty yet desperate empty which are a painful fact of life in turkey in this film the <UNK> <UNK> lovers and families a simple empty <UNK> of turkish brand <UNK> and a dying mouse jump off the screen the way <UNK> did in the 1982 <UNK> <UNK> film many of films including the herd 1978 completed by and <UNK> the father 1971 have been considered by many to be the best turkish films ever made without sometimes overblown social political anger especially in his last film the 1983 prison drama the wall distance captures the essence of turkish life quite remarkably this is a <UNK> achievement for a director who in my view can already be <UNK> as the turkish equivalent to directors like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i can't wait to see his other films
<START> not often it happens that a great last movie becomes such a moving performed and filmed masterpiece the cast is excellent as well as the <UNK> what starts up as a merry coming together of a group of well educated citizens of an early 20th century <UNK> turns into a dark <UNK> narration about all our fear from death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past thank you mister huston for this last piece of great cinema
<START> if you pack all the clichés about city <UNK> into <UNK> minutes you have ladder <UNK> br br it has a story but is highly <UNK> by all the clichés it turns it into movie that with every event becomes so predictable it's not worth watching there is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficial br br it looked like it wanted to be a tribute to <UNK> but ended up being boring and pretentious the parallel between jack <UNK> being <UNK> trapped beneath an <UNK> part of a building and <UNK> being trapped beneath the <UNK> of the twin towers was all too obvious br br it doesn't compare to movies like and certainly does not set an example for future movies about fire <UNK>
<START> even for sci fi this movie is movie is a little out there alright more than a little my first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind br br don't watch this movie expecting another <UNK> <UNK> fans are never going to like another richard kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards <UNK> <UNK> is a thing of the past get over it br br richard kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the <UNK> the first time you watch them to be honest i had to watch the box twice before i liked it br br the deeper meaning to spare you a bunch of <UNK> psycho <UNK> humans are self serving we make decisions that can destroy our lives and don't open mail without a return address br br summary creepy old man tells diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money then the movie takes a dive into the unusual to spare my fingers the <UNK> for pushing the button diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race br br i liked the <UNK> of the movie to ignore the generic movie <UNK> its different its intense it has a deeper meaning although its philosophy 101 material it leaves you guessing not a hollywood ending br br i disliked why would any being with the technology to <UNK> another life form <UNK> such a ridiculous scheme what god like alien has the patience for that diaz was good but was there a need for the country accent they live in virginia br br i give it a 7 because kelly didn't put as much attention to detail as with his other movies overall good flick
<START> i have been hooked on <UNK> since <UNK> through 2001 2002 2nd season when i tuned in to see <UNK> 10 minutes early thanks to <UNK> i now have all but 2 episodes on tape right up through last night <UNK> 4 9 i am a middle aged straight male and this is the only weekly tv show i watch br br i love this series because a lauren graham is a damn fine looking woman and funny and smart to boot b the dialogue is extremely well written c it is flat out hilarious putting overrated garbage like everybody loves raymond to shame many current tv comedies have been heavily influenced by the highly successful and much <UNK> <UNK> pit known as married with children where the viewer is encouraged to <UNK> and feel superior to the characters in <UNK> the characters have faults but we can see our own <UNK> in them and laugh with them not at them this is stimulating tv where the writers challenge us to keep up with rapid fire <UNK> and out of left field pop culture literature current events references i get immense pleasure out of watching these episodes over and over again catching all the one liners and references to previous episodes stars hollow is its own little world one that i will happily continue to visit as long as the series runs
<START> this movie was working toward two goals to make a political point and to tell a scary adventure story it's often difficult to do make a political point and still tell a good story consider the highly political but rarely entertaining final season of ellen beyond finds a good balance between politics and storytelling br br i already knew that san had won the 1991 <UNK> peace prize and knew something about the oppressive political situation in <UNK> so the political message of the movie was mostly a <UNK> of what i already knew but i thought the movie did a good job of telling about san and the mostly <UNK> <UNK> who have for years tried to silence her the device of presenting an unfamiliar setting through the eyes of a character that viewers can identify with is fairly common but it's quite well done in this movie br br of course the real measure of the movie was its entertainment value arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant unfamiliar place to shake her out of her depression over the violent deaths of her husband and son she is convincingly detached and depressed her <UNK> condition gives her a clear reason for her distracted <UNK> into the thick of a dangerous situation she does not understand something she'd otherwise be much too intelligent to stumble into br br once the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them even through the cloud of grief she's trapped with no easy escape that sets her on a path of adventure where she needs her intelligence to survive the writers deserve much credit for making her intelligent and <UNK> enough to deal with numerous dangerous situations while still finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble in the first place the directing is strong also keeping up the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the <UNK> br br this movie had additional impact on me and my wife because of other events of the same time period we were preparing for a trip to india and heard news reports of western tourists who had been taken hostage by a terrorist group in india avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful <UNK> country is quite a different matter from escaping an oppressive <UNK> but the movie and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unfamiliar country that common characteristic gave the movie meaning beyond the strength of its own <UNK> storytelling the movie illustrates the international <UNK> worst nightmare
<START> it may interest people to know that this film was made without any <UNK> to <UNK> herself and when she did finally see parts of it was so <UNK> that she announced that the film was not to be shown in india or she would cover herself in <UNK> and set fire to herself i do not know whether it was shown at all or not but given her standing at the time as a rising politician i doubt it since then i saw a report that she has been <UNK> from office and charged with further crimes from her days and has gone into hiding as a result br br her own concerns aside this is an excellent film made all the more so by its <UNK> brutal approach none of the rose <UNK> melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film it should be <UNK> that concerns about how feminist the film's messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant it's a true story her <UNK> are it seems not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her
<START> good drama comedy with two good performances from hunter hurt but albert brooks steals every scene he is in with a great script this movie <UNK> and gives everyone a chance to show their acting talent and although joan cusack is not in this much but she has one if not the funniest scene in the movie the highlight of the movie for me was albert brooks speech on the devil only one draw back is the fact it goes little slow in places and i only got totally interested in brooks role not so much in <UNK> or <UNK> i give this a 7 out of 10
<START> this is a superb tv series it's sympathetic and for once realistic portrayal of lesbian women is <UNK> handled and well done on top of that the directing is wonderful and the settings <UNK> and rich a real treat if you missed the first one i advise you watch next weeks <UNK> bbc 2
<START> after seeing 1 and the <UNK> of blood they shed i was ready for another rousing of open handed heart <UNK> and in a cage but <UNK> this was like the barney version of the first movie with that <UNK> from the karate kid at least <UNK> <UNK> still kicks <UNK> although he needs to do more movies like <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> face it folks is more challenging innovative and clever than its predecessor challenging its levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable amount of time one especially difficult level is called lightning <UNK> in which you may be struck by lightning at any given time innovative it opened a lot of doors too bad the died out not long after this title and clever the level names range from trademark plays on words lake to witty references that the <UNK> targeted audience won't get for many years to come <UNK> house br br what <UNK> me about most people's criticism of this game mainly comes down to two words <UNK> kong he is a worthy little buddy <UNK> to <UNK> kong and certainly does not deserve to be referred to as that retarded monkey will remain a classic until the end of time
<START> first of all i'd like to say i am a teenager so this is all <UNK> towards me and i can safely say that very poor <UNK> and the fact that it's accepted among both <UNK> <UNK> me it contains some of the worst attempts at comedy i've ever witnessed with mediocre acting to boot the supposed humor within the show is all based on saying someone's lines again with poor sarcasm poor sarcasm saying bad one liners and well you get the picture also i should mention that i do still watch <UNK> which i know i'll get a negative <UNK> for but that's quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it less we forget something missing wit the show's about a young girl <UNK> putting on a web show with her friends which i can say is without a doubt a <UNK> version of the internet that's fine but the show's just well not funny at all as previously stated if this is what children's programming has come to today parents show them something that's actually funny <UNK> or modern life would work br br also compared to it's show drake josh it's terrible which was implied seriously please watch something worthwhile even for a children's show it's poor
<START> i remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when i was 6 years old you do the <UNK> i absolutely loved it i was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it climbing the furniture jumping around making monkey sounds it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher <UNK> keep in mind that i saw <UNK> very shortly after this 1984 was the last time i saw that film until about a month ago it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at 3 30 am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at 9 00 am i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid br br upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even <UNK> then that that <UNK> <UNK> voice was dubbed by someone else ian was of course solid as usual and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up but what was most surprising was how good <UNK> was as tarzan he was great the depth he managed to capture in so few lines his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large <UNK> were just amazing br br as i stated earlier i am <UNK> fan but i'm used to <UNK> the hunted and <UNK> in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again br br so to make a short story way too long i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good but i was glad to see that <UNK> was good and i do not regret staying up until 6 <UNK> to see it
<START> after cleaning up dodge city with a little help from <UNK> <UNK> bat masterson goes to liberal kansas where they've got a nice little range war going plus a rather interesting scheme of br br randolph scott is bat masterson and he's after villains billy house and steve <UNK> who are driving off their <UNK> the they are driving off are in a scheme <UNK> by robert ryan seems as though he's <UNK> the various <UNK> to a <UNK> of land to <UNK> for a <UNK> of profit from their crop <UNK> about to lose his shirt as a result of all the <UNK> br br as portrayed by scott bat masterson is a stand up western hero who has a passion to go east and become a reporter which we all know he did later in life br br anne <UNK> and <UNK> meredith are involved in a romantic subplot involving <UNK> and ryan which is a little silly and does detract from the action anne <UNK> does sing nice though br br of course <UNK> hayes as always provides the great comic relief br br a good addition to the randolph scott collection of westerns also interesting because his later western films don't have him as wearing a hat as white as the one here br br this review is dedicated to <UNK> hayes of the professional bull riders who is a proud resident of liberal kansas a town with a great tradition whether bat masterson there or not
<START> uh oh i just said the this classic film has a plot that stinks well it's true so get over it this film was a vanity project for joseph p kennedy in which his mistress starred and money <UNK> to make her an even bigger star today only a <UNK> copy exists one that was a few years back however even if the film had been in perfect shape it still would have <UNK> for many reasons and without further <UNK> here are some of my reasons br br first gloria <UNK> aged <UNK> plays a girl in a convent school perhaps aged 16 or 18 come on she looks old enough to be the mother of many of the kids br br second the movie all <UNK> on the stupid concept of love at first sight while some people believe it this it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw away everything on a woman he didn't even know what a lot of <UNK> br br third the movie is <UNK> and the plot is nuts after leaving the school kelly goes off to east africa and then becomes queen of the <UNK> and later after the evil queen back in europe dies that's convenient the prince is able to get out of prison actually finds kelly and marries her and she then becomes queen of a real honest to goodness country <UNK> a break this is ridiculous even in the days of silent film this plot was a <UNK> br br so in summary this is a poor film with great production values <UNK> need to look good that is <UNK> around as a classic there are so many better silent films out there see them first and avoid this tripe
<START> call me old fashioned but i like movies with plots i thought <UNK> comedy was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which lots of <UNK> is <UNK> and the people watching it are more apt to enjoy it high <UNK> boy however has decided this is a full blown <UNK> and that <UNK> represent a piece of the comedy pie that need to be reached apparently allen <UNK> star and producer and the happy madison gang were right but that doesn't make <UNK> boy any less boring and unfunny they might be completely stoned but the characters are mostly half baked br br alex <UNK> a longtime supporting player for adam sandler first time star is a mid 30s professional video game <UNK> whose roommate has gotten them <UNK> he could look for a new apartment but then we don't have a movie after trying a couple friends he ends up living with good <UNK> grandma <UNK> doris roberts of everybody loves raymond she wakes him up a 6 am and has him do <UNK> and soon he's falling asleep on the job and so the new video game sequel might not get done on <UNK> br br like most people alex deals with his frustration and <UNK> boredom by either playing video games or getting high or both his friends co workers all do the same thing most of them are <UNK> that live at home in addition to loving video games they're all awkward and all with the exception of nick and joel moore only at times their characters aren't funny funny if you're <UNK> sure i suppose but i can't say from experience br br maybe all we loser guys like is getting high playing video games and <UNK> <UNK> women with specific attention on their breasts but even so it shouldn't be the driving force of an entire film neither should old women getting high on accident saw that one coming or being the but of gross out sex jokes but that's what happens when a film isn't about anything no conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes outside of the slight problems of being out of pot alex trying to get the hot girl linda to like him and the guys <UNK> to finish their levels for the video game <UNK> br br characters can be the saving grace for these meandering <UNK> flicks but aside from a lovable doris roberts the aforementioned as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them his roommates and joel moore's skill at making robot noises there's little character <UNK> <UNK> is a run of the mill main character with no comedic <UNK> his dealer friend <UNK> is an inept actor and waste of screen time and <UNK> hill and kevin are written so far into the <UNK> it doesn't matter br br if you like movies about nothing and watching them in a state of mind and body that enhance that <UNK> <UNK> boy will likely be just what you're looking for those who need a little more talent and wit to get on board with a comedy will be left <UNK> the most i can say for <UNK> boy is that it's watchable despite its <UNK> it won't feel like a total waste of time but you'll wish you did do drugs so you could at least have made the most of the hour and a half br br steven c br br visit my site at www <UNK> com
<START> anytime i'm not giving 150 to my dreams or my goals i think of mark the real life subject of american movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at having his first feature film produced and shot is so captivating that it will have you laughing shaking your head with sadness and rooting for him br br i haven't seen a documentary this honest since the movie on r the supporting cast <UNK> real life family and friends are all great give this movie a chance and you'll see a great film and a wonderful portrait of the stuff that the american dream is made of
<START> this review will have some very obvious spoilers so beware br br a friend brought this over and we made it through 45 minutes of the movie before we decided that fast forward speed was the only way that this film should be watched there were points when we were watching the movie at normal speed where i would leave prepare part of lunch and return to find that literally nothing had happened 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were <UNK> nothing happened the background no important facial gestures were made nothing but mind numbing awkward silence br br this is not how to make a thoughtful film especially when the movie's plot follows all the same basic hollywood movie <UNK> if i told you that disney was making a film about 4 girls starting a band and the singer was a french exchange student what you would expect to be the conflicts that <UNK> br br the lead singer has to overcome stage fright someone has an <UNK> crush the band is late for their performance and a side character has to buy them time br br spoiler alert br br all of those things happen in this movie br br at no point in this film do you have even the slightest <UNK> of concern that these girls won't be able to accomplish their goal br br this ends the section of spoilers br br i like japanese films i've spent a lot of time in japan i work for a japanese company heck i even know all the bands <UNK> in the record <UNK> and <UNK> that they're going through and i've sung along to the title track with friends at <UNK> br br this is probably the worst film from japan i've ever seen do not be confused though the characters will have points in the movie where they do typical japanese high school things this is not a typical day in the life of movie this is a day in the life of 4 extremely random heavily conflicted awkward japanese students br br there are noticeable problems with the dvd as well <UNK> decided that a great extra would be a producer reading <UNK> the <UNK> entry about the blue hearts what a value in addition they care so little about the <UNK> that the <UNK> name in the subtitles is different than it is in the chapter selection menu in the final <UNK> scene there is a very visible reflection <UNK> effect on everything but this seems to be the fault of the original film br br 2 10 do not view if you do not absolutely love awkward <UNK>
<START> i wasn't expecting citizen kane but i was hoping for some extreme guilty pleasure the script is bad but the school exterior shots were obviously done with the same 5 extras on the same day the <UNK> exterior shots were easily shot during a <UNK> br br the wardrobe was <UNK> around so much i hoped the wardrobe mistress had some good strong soap to wash the <UNK> i know the time but do you think they could have bought a couple of different styles of underwear what <UNK> up <UNK> hot chick would wear boy leg <UNK> under <UNK> <UNK> i was <UNK> to see one appearance of <UNK> in the <UNK> scene br br good points the actors were all very attractive and the girls had natural boobs too bad they never took the <UNK> off br br the special effects were neither effective and could only be describes as special if they <UNK> the short bus to the edit bay the final scene in particular is <UNK> laughably bad br br
<START> i was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television and sorely disappointed at the end result br br the only amazing thing was the wall <UNK> despite the <UNK> of the cable i didn't think nick <UNK> was peter parker and he was <UNK> of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit you could tell they were two different actors br br granted i can also spot in the modern spider man movies when i am looking at <UNK> and when i am looking at cgi but that is from a trained eye and experience working with cgi still the 70's version could have been better despite lack of special fx br br the <UNK> were hokey and looked like <UNK> that seemed to wrap around things rather than stick to them and what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in hello he's the web people br br sorry didn't mean to get so worked up but our beloved wall <UNK> deserved better
<START> why bother to see this movie it probably rates an award for being the worst career move of a major movie star since clark <UNK> laughable playing of an irish <UNK> in <UNK> br br it's <UNK> that bergman would choose both this movie and its director over a <UNK> hollywood career where she could choose among the finest scripts and directors being offered at that time to begin with there was no script to work with except a few notes then we are supposed to believe the polished bergman as a poor <UNK> willing to do anything to be released from a <UNK> camp including marriage to a poor italian <UNK> she doesn't even love i read where anna <UNK> was the original choice for this part if so that made a lot more sense than to cast the <UNK> bergman in such a <UNK> part but since she was in love with her director common sense flew out the window br br so she goes to live in this poor village where the men must <UNK> to <UNK> a <UNK> living from the sea a place she obviously hates to be and where she doesn't fit in br br her only friend is the village priest who knows she's not suited to the life of a poor <UNK> bride but tells her that for the sake of love she must <UNK> her true feelings of <UNK> and accept the poverty and despair she encounters each day on top of all of this there's this <UNK> always on the brink of <UNK> and drowning them all in hot <UNK> but like a true heroine bergman against her misery by <UNK> war on just about everyone else in this dreary film she even goes as far as trying to seduce the village priest in a scene that would generate laughter if it were not so pathetic since her poor <UNK> of a husband must lock her in a room to keep her from running away she's forced to use her body to <UNK> a married man to take her off the island to her no sacrifice is too great no man if he is willing to help her to escape the island and her misery i won't bother to tell you how this all ends the no script movie ending is as plausible as the rest of <UNK> i even remember from seeing it on late night tv that it had two different endings so be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this king size turkey and catch the miscast bergman it led to her downfall in hollywood for the next seven years and she was condemned for sleeping with her director while still married to peter <UNK> none of the movies she made with this director whom she later married are noteworthy except as proof of a career gone <UNK> i kid you not it's pretty embarrassing br br soundtrack
<START> i was looking forward to this so much being a big fan of the book however when it came out i remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time i've ever spent at the cinema br br in principle the acting the sets and the music were excellent and are the main reason why i'm rating this a 4 br br in this version sara is a little too self <UNK> for my taste there is no way she would have deliberately <UNK> to miss just to stop her <UNK> the other girls in the book she makes a point of describing lies as not just wicked but vulgar br br there's also far too much of a <UNK> ending for me <UNK> father coming back from the dead and all of them <UNK> off into the indian sunset while the book does have a happy and critics might say equally improbable ending it doesn't leave you thinking oh <UNK> <UNK> br br about the only things true to the book were br br 1 <UNK> father being a soldier 2 the lines between sara and her father are you learning me by heart no i know you by heart you are inside my heart 3 <UNK> friendship with <UNK> and her <UNK> although this last one wasn't developed as much as it could have been 4 the changing of her room by adding various luxury items that part was brilliantly done 5 the basic core a rich girl being <UNK> into poverty suddenly is there but that's about all that is br br people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience possibly all i can say to that is i have two cousins aged 7 and 12 respectively who were big fans of this film until they read the book br br if all you want is a <UNK> <UNK> family film then this delivers if you're looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess in fact if you've read the book don't waste time with this one it's such a shame with a cast like this if they'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic br br am i <UNK> on about <UNK> the <UNK> this and <UNK> the <UNK> that a little too much very probably but if someone attempts to adapt a book especially such a classic into a movie then they should at least have done the same thing preferably more than once
<START> it may have been inevitable that with the <UNK> of slasher movies in the early 1980's that a few good ones might slip through the cracks this is a great rare film from jeff who <UNK> his cult status with his memorable 1970's films <UNK> and blue sunshine br br five young people head into the <UNK> mountains this movie was actually shot on location to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired before long they will predictably be <UNK> by a <UNK> killer with an incredibly creepy <UNK> laugh br br just before dawn is <UNK> more ambitious arty and intelligent than some slasher films actually <UNK> out the characters well two of them anyway as much as a 90 minute long film will allow him the film has genuine moments of suspense and tension and actually <UNK> from graphic gore save for one killing right at the beginning br br there is an above average cast here including oscar winner george kennedy as a forest ranger who's understandably gone a little <UNK> from having been alone in the wilderness for too long jack <UNK> son chris future brian de palma regular <UNK> henry blonde lead deborah benson it's too bad she hasn't become a more well known performer judging by her work here ralph seymour <UNK> mike <UNK> camp and jamie rose <UNK> chicks in round out the cast br br some of the shots are interesting and the early music score by brad now best known for his terminator theme is haunting and atmospheric br br this is worth catching for the important plot twist at about the one hour mark although a moment at about 75 minutes in involving the heroine and a tree and the killer is almost comical it may actually remind a viewer of a cartoon one of the most clever touches is the final <UNK> of the killer which i'd never seen before in a horror film and probably won't see again br br i didn't give it 10 out of 10 because i can't honestly that i was that frightened still it's an interesting slasher that is worthy of re discovery br br that deed don't mean nothing son those mountains can't read br br 9 10
<START> i thought that this movie was incredible i absolutely loved it even though my brothers didn't that much the special effects were outstanding and this movie is about my favorite sport golf the only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row this movie just absolutely tops everything else i have ever seen it was everything i would expect out of a movie i just loved it also it was pretty kid friendly this movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it anything is possible i would give it a pure 10 10 it was better than the legend of and the two pirates of the <UNK> movies combined absolutely amazing loved it
<START> i remember seeing this film when i was fairly young being quite disturbed by it i found the storyline very <UNK> and can still remember the various bullying techniques used one in particular was when the other school children <UNK> in his soup before he could even taste a <UNK> they also bound him and <UNK> his private parts this was all because he was <UNK> why was he <UNK> because he was bad at games i have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been <UNK> because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular to me he is the type of person who would always be picked on because that's how children operate popular children are popular because they are in some way <UNK> popularity is a hard thing to define so even at the end when he is successful in his career it makes no difference he is still left feeling tormented i found the ending quite <UNK> as there was no resolution
<START> to the guy who <UNK> the idea for <UNK> i have one thing to say thank you sir <UNK> combines the big budget sci fi <UNK> of star trek the motion picture with the cheap horror thrills of phantasm and tops it all off with t <UNK> and some real <UNK> <UNK> at that and best of all it's actually a good movie it <UNK> me that someone actually justified a mainstream movie that is a vehicle for a hot chick to appear naked on screen for an hour and a half to producers god bless you all of you who were involved br br steve <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK> the american commander of an international space mission sent to investigate <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> crew finds an alien <UNK> inside the <UNK> and inside that they find three naked people in suspended animation two guys and a hot broad <UNK> may well to make a long story short they're space vampires naked space vampires they trash the crew except for <UNK> who decided that he had to let the hot chick out of her display case because the part of his brain that controls his nut <UNK> told him it was the right thing to do the <UNK> wings it back to our big blue ball in an escape <UNK> meanwhile another space <UNK> crew has discovered his ship floating dead in space and has brought the three space <UNK> of the living dead martians back to london and that's when people start turning into <UNK> and s t in general just starts <UNK> way out of hand too damn fast br br <UNK> teams up with the <UNK> <UNK> caine peter <UNK> of the british s a s to track down our naked <UNK> who is having one hell of a time sucking guys off left and right <UNK> discovered that he has a mental link with <UNK> that allows them to track her down with the ultimate goal being to blow her ass away and wreck her and her big space <UNK> that sucks up the energy of the people that the <UNK> attack will they succeed in time minor spoiler yes br br wow what can i say but wow this damn movie really works i can't believe they got actual british actors like <UNK> morris a clockwork orange and patrick stewart <UNK> man alive or some such title to appear in this film all the actors are good direction is good and really shines during the last half where we see the fantastic <UNK> of london special effects are no <UNK> either for 1985 this movie must've been the s t as far as fx goes all the effects are fairly impressive and there's a wide range of talent on display here in makeup effects light shows and very nice space scenes with some good old fashioned <UNK> and <UNK> painting very nicely done there's even some gore and bloody <UNK> shots for all the horror <UNK> out there br br <UNK> is a great film for anyone who has nostalgia for when popular films on the were made with 100 love from start to finish the creators of the movie really made sure all the <UNK> were covered and the end result is a <UNK> fun affair that doesn't let you turn away because the proceedings are just too good looking real solid entertainment here 8 1 2 out of 10
<START> one of the best horror suspense movies i have seen in a long time wow it was a big surprise and stunning at how good this movie was sometimes a gem like this will surface but is rare i expected a popcorn monster flick and a mildly <UNK> way to spend a late night but instead a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart br br this is a movie that makes you feel for the characters and what happens to them and it is filmed like you are there and it is really happening i know some people in other reviews compare it to open water but i disagree because i thought open water was quite boring and mediocre while this movie was the opposite although <UNK> they are filmed in the same realistic style br br the actors are <UNK> at least to me but they all are very effective and convey the dire situation with frightening intensity and realism the story is well done and flows smoothly the plot is logical and appears to be something that could happen all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think about very believable and this makes the movie more real because of it br br i had tears in my eyes at the end i must say a movie seldom has this effect on me this is how powerful and emotional this movie was done and i am suitably impressed by the director and actors of this great movie
<START> is the princess bride meets well <UNK> but wait really it's a good combination this was definitely one of the better movies i've seen in a long time it has the kind of witty dialog i associate with the princess bride or cemetery man along with the disgusting scenes of violence of a horror movie the heroic feel of princess bride combined with the this is odd lack of any really good guys that <UNK> had br br i'm not saying it was as good as the princess bride but it was in the <UNK> and it <UNK> some of the dialog <UNK> pleasing to brilliant the plot is interesting the characters while slightly are not due to their <UNK> nature there were <UNK> gay people in the 18th century contrary to a previous <UNK> remarks but just in a bit of the language they used the <UNK> made it fun though and not cheesy and easily <UNK> br br if you've ever read any simon r green or <UNK> <UNK> series you know exactly what this movie is check it out it's great
<START> the nest is really just another run horror flick that fails because of the low budget the acting is ok and the setting is great but somehow the whole film just seemed a bit dull to me the gore effects are not the best i've seen but are fun in a cheesy sort of way the <UNK> themselves are just regular <UNK> that bite people the nest reminded me of a much better film called slugs if you liked the nest then slugs is a must see as it's ten times better also worth noting is that lisa who plays elizabeth was in another run type film called deadly eyes aka the rats which is about killer rats as you may have guessed br br if you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch but you'd be far better off seeing slugs which is far more interesting and gory
<START> <UNK> constructed and perfectly played to the ends of the earth is a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age br br based on william trilogy these three 90 minute films <UNK> the journey towards both australia and experience of youthful aristocrat edmund <UNK> <UNK> aboard an aging man <UNK> war in the early 19th century as he heads for a government position down under br br among the crew and hopeful sharing his passage are a <UNK> bullying captain jared harris a politically radical <UNK> sam <UNK> a <UNK> 1st lieutenant who's worked his way up from the bottom jamie and <UNK> the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman <UNK> page whose ship literally passes in the night br br quite aside from the astonishing degree of physical historic accuracy director david and screenwriters tony and leigh jackson have a <UNK> eye and ear for the manners and stiff <UNK> of an earlier time <UNK> a totally convincing <UNK> of the <UNK> era br br <UNK> life is one brutal monotonous round of <UNK> <UNK> and danger after another and as edmund becomes <UNK> in the loves hopes and <UNK> of his fellow passengers he experiences a delirious <UNK> of life's <UNK> man's <UNK> and his sentiments br br those who enjoyed master and commander the far side of the world or patrick <UNK> series of novels on which it was based will love this  for everyone else it's a whole new world to discover
<START> this is one of the best movies i've seen the acting is good the plot is solid and the whole movie is very believable which adds a lot to the movie i rate this at least a 9
<START> i am ashamed of myself that i actually went to the theatre to watch this movie when it was first released while i suppose its <UNK> <UNK> depiction of the <UNK> <UNK> and jackie kennedy story is well enough done it's a movie that should never have been made in the first place hence my low rating br br the film chronicles the tale of a wealthy greek business shark called theo who <UNK> and wins the lovely young widow liz cassidy of a <UNK> american president sound familiar yes everything except the names br br the cast is not to be <UNK> anthony quinn plays the greek <UNK> to perfection and at least it's some <UNK> having just read that <UNK> himself <UNK> quinn for the role <UNK> <UNK> is of course beautiful and sophisticated in the part of for all <UNK> and purposes jackie and james <UNK> has the all american good looks of the president br br i haven't seen this movie since it came out nor do i wish to see it again i seem to recall a fair bit of bad language and some general <UNK> otherwise i suppose it's a sensational and supposedly intimate glimpse into the jet setting lives of the rich and famous <UNK> aboard their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc yes the scenery of the greek islands is spectacular the best part of the movie br br of its type it's okay i suppose there are no end of tv movies about the <UNK> which i confess to occasionally <UNK> in to and not to my credit this is basically just another far better to allow <UNK> and <UNK> kennedy <UNK> to rest in peace
<START> the <UNK> man is a smart surreal movie that makes you <UNK> what you're doing with your life and what makes you <UNK> when you see these people in zombie like doing everyday events and realize that's what we do and what we want in real life it really hits close to home this is a surprisingly effective movie that at the end leaves you asking questions about your direction and not so much the movie br br <UNK> is the main character whose life we get a 3rd person view of as he tries to adapt to a new life after being <UNK> in the beginning he seems to be the most popular guy in town as everyone at work <UNK> to him and he's invited to <UNK> etc a good example of this is in the scene with his new boss who offers him an <UNK> of an <UNK> amount of cash saying here's a little something to get you started <UNK> even gets a girlfriend 20 minutes into the movie which he eventually moves in with this seems like an ideal living situation as his girlfriend is an established interior designer attractive and doesn't ever <UNK> about anything he does but <UNK> is <UNK> with their relationship as with everything else in this world he then begins an affair with a <UNK> named who he eventually leaves anne for and claims he is in love with after telling how he feels she tells him that she is also seeing other <UNK> and says all of the relationships are nice soon after we see <UNK> at a train station where he tries to end his misery and to the audience's disappointment doesn't come about still looking for salvation <UNK> meets hugo who has found a hole which music can be heard coming out of so they <UNK> on a mission to get to the other side will it be better or will it be worse br br the <UNK> man shows us <UNK> obsession with appearances and its <UNK> mindset it does a great job making fun of us by filling homes with <UNK> products that the characters spend each lunch picking out i think he is mostly <UNK> fun at the dull <UNK> society and its high suicide rates for example there is a scene in the movie where <UNK> comes across a man who jumped out of a building and onto a <UNK> fence also <UNK> fed up with this world cuts his finger off and then later jumps in front of a train this is one of the most <UNK> outrageous scenes i've seen this world created by is equivalent to <UNK> where there is no punishment or reward in this world drink after drink <UNK> never got drunk sex was <UNK> and no matter how many times he tried he couldn't kill himself this movie reminded me of fight club and how both main characters were kind of out of sync with the world around them in fight club tyler <UNK> creates a second persona that does everything he wouldn't and in this movie the <UNK> <UNK> is the equivalent to tyler <UNK> after a while he wakes up and tries to escape the bland life he is now apart of by escaping through a hole in a wall br br does a great job with continuity in this movie meaning when a character has a half full cup in his hand and they cut away then come back they have the glass in the same hand and its not full or empty showing that the shot was done another day nowadays directors are more worried about the sound effects and overlook the little things like is that character wearing the <UNK> on the same hand as <UNK> filming since i took tv production for three years in high school it's hard for me not to look for continuity or voice overs which drive me nuts does the little things well he's got great lighting in each shot never leaves you wondering why something is in a shot and brings about an interesting topic this film really worked for me because it not only <UNK> but the western society and what's wrong with it the only real issue i had was with the man who commits suicide by jumping on a <UNK> fence because you eventually find out this world has no death but he laid <UNK> forcing you to assume he was dead and this never gets answered in my opinion br br <UNK> is the only main character as others come and go and never do more than support his him his first girlfriend anne <UNK> is an interior designer who at the surface seems perfect for him but eventually turns out to be dull this leads him to who he starts an affair with and falls in love with he soon finds out that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real <UNK> eventually meets hugo in the bathroom of a bar complaining about how nothing tastes good anymore and how he can't even get drunk anymore he follows hugo home to find the hole in the wall with that is filled with children's laughter and birds <UNK> br br doesn't have a lot on the resume but the <UNK> man is more than a jump start to a great career but a preview of an up and coming director if this is any indication of his talent and potential as a story <UNK> has a bright future and we can only hope that his future movies don't take so long to make it overseas for our viewing pleasure so take a seat and enjoy the ride as director <UNK> takes you from the comfort of your home to the <UNK> world that is the <UNK> man
<START> in the late sixties director sergio <UNK> made four spaghetti westerns in a row the classics the <UNK> the great silence the <UNK> and <UNK> three of these all except the <UNK> are constantly turning up on ten best lists when spaghetti westerns are rated until recently all i had seen was a very poor quality <UNK> with some english some italian a fuzzy picture and it was nearly incomprehensible now having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles still in two languages however i can safely include the <UNK> in that group of four classics johnny <UNK> is very good as the charismatic <UNK> a notorious hand with the gun returning to to investigate the death of his brother who was <UNK> by the <UNK> for losing their <UNK> it involves a <UNK> beauty who owns the bank a mexican <UNK> leader el <UNK> who was once friends with <UNK> an honest sheriff who dreams of better days and a small band of hippies well it was the late sixties and hippies were everywhere even apparently in our westerns it's not a desert western shot in the <UNK> somewhere and is lovely to look at there is a bit more nudity than i expect in a western but that's not a bad thing <UNK> is lovely as <UNK> who may be niece or dead brother's girlfriend that's never made clear this film deserves to be seen and once again we <UNK> for a nice dvd with all the <UNK> i think the <UNK> would be as well known as any of other westerns and that's high praise indeed
<START> i took my 4 year old twins to see this movie today and i would not recommend it for children their age br br this movie had many fighting scenes throughout it which i found too violent and my children found scary br br the subject matter was way over my kids heads and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon <UNK> towards children br br i was disappointed because we were all looking forward to seeing this but it just did not cut it if you have children under 7 years old i would not recommend this movie br br also the utter thing made me crazy during the entire movie
<START> <UNK> a band of five young american men all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the offensive during the wwii get the assignment as a forward <UNK> and to look for enemy activity they're in really bad condition both physically and mentally and think they have struck gold when their <UNK> is in an abandoned but once <UNK> mansion full with food but after a while there is some enemy activity and it is very odd not hostile but odd it seems like there is a german squad out there in equally bad condition that want nothing more than to surrender br br comments based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story doesn't seem to translate very well to the big screen indeed it is a different war movie much more about the mental pressure during than fighting and battles but i can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense full of <UNK> and unknown elements just fall flat in the movie it is not suspenseful just different and in many ways absurd many times people just act insane and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at br br so when this mental pressure fails to come through the main building piece of the entire story i thought the story fell through it wasn't good it wasn't interesting it didn't keep me on the edge and it didn't really send a message actually it did nothing br br the cast is interesting many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers the acting is good but not stellar and a few characters also fell through into the absurd zone much of that too i feel is due to that this story these characters need the time space and pace given in a novel that they can't be given here and going halfway definitely isn't good enough br br 4 10
<START> this is a solid underrated little thriller that has thrills a plenty with a cool story sandra <UNK> is terrific all the characters are great and i was surprised by how unpredictable it was as there were only a few predictable moments plus sandra <UNK> is simply amazing in this jeremy northam played an awesome villain and i know what <UNK> character in this is all about because i'm kind of the same type of person i hardly ever go out plus this is pretty well made and written for the most part this should be higher then 5 5 in my opinion plus denis miller was surprisingly better then expected in his small role the scene where northam <UNK> <UNK> on his boat was quite suspenseful and was one of my favorite moments and i also liked the chase scene in the carnival plus i liked the ending too as it was quite well done even if i did think northam was defeated too quickly there are lots of other good chase scenes as well and it's also clever at times too plus there are quite a few shocking moments as well this is a solid underrated little thriller that has thrills a plenty with a cool story sandra <UNK> is terrific i highly recommend this one the direction is great irwin <UNK> does a great job here with excellent camera work adding good atmosphere good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace the acting is fantastic sandra <UNK> is amazing as always and is amazing here she is extremely likable tough as nails yet quite vulnerable and i was able to feel for her because as i said i'm sort of like angela i hardly ever go out i really enjoyed her work in this movie <UNK> rules jeremy northam is excellent as the villain he was <UNK> unpredictable and very menacing he was great dennis miller is surprisingly ok and non annoying in his small role and managed to bring some comic relief rest of the cast are fine overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
<START> <UNK> is no doubt someone's attempt at originality but what we have here is art in its most morbid grotesque form so for that <UNK> has my respect but to be realistic it makes no difference what this abomination is about but for the record br br in the ultimate in incoherent horror we begin in an unknown time in an unknown place right off the bat we are <UNK> into the psychotic nightmare that is <UNK> a god is seemingly depressed <UNK> himself with a razor i mean really trying like hell to end it all it takes a while why wouldn't it after this ultra morbid introduction something is happening something is rising from the corpse say hello to mother earth what does she do well she gives birth to a thing the thing would have probably preferred to stay in the <UNK> but that's life the psychotic nightmare realm of <UNK> <UNK> the thing the only way it knows how the thing along with mother earth is <UNK> by unknown <UNK> <UNK> with evil intentions being the only clarity available from this point on things drag as they've never dragged before interesting grim images with a totally decent soundtrack is the high points of the remainder not to give the impression that i don't recommend this <UNK> because i do but only once and only for people with an appreciation for the dark side br br from my description it may appear that i don't get <UNK> trust me i get it and yes <UNK> is art if i've ever seen it everything in this film regardless of how unrelated it may seem is significant that perhaps is the only thing that makes <UNK> art with that said most of us require some form of entertainment value and this is coming from someone who enjoyed the <UNK> probably the most intriguing first five minutes i've seen in a film but let's be realistic the next 7 hours and <UNK> minutes would put one in a coma that is unless it's just meant for some kind of psychedelic purposes in that case never mind but how would one rate such a uniquely boring masterpiece depending on how much your attention span can take it should be either 1 or 10 any other number just wouldn't make a statement it hurts to do this but as far as entertainment value goes <UNK> just ain't it 1 1
<START> with awful movies like this one being even considered let alone being made it's very easy to see why hollywood is in such serious trouble with bad plots and worse remakes all the time br br i guess the viewer is supposed to be laughing their rear ends off over the <UNK> in jokes the <UNK> look and the it's so incredible <UNK> the <UNK> and so bad that is even past the <UNK> bad it's funny <UNK> mark and have <UNK> right into <UNK> embarrassing for anyone br br i'm very very sorry for every single minute i wasted on this one i want my time back br br save yourself the agony do not watch this the only reason for me to give even 1 point in the rating is that 0 wasn't an option
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is an unattractive piece of work in this unattractive piece of work of a film pat <UNK> desperate for work any kind of work agreed to <UNK> his role as the karate teacher and bring his brand of karate to the silver screen once again except this time <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the student br br i can just see the hollywood writers getting excited about the idea of having a tormented spoiled brat female take the role from ralph the film does not work on any level and it's boring on every level there's nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for anyone to hold on to the film was made without any thought of making money because it's just so bad br br i would gladly spit on all the actors in this film for having been involved with it and have the writers black listed for their miserable and insulting efforts
<START> <UNK> june 9 9 egyptian theater saturday june 11 2 <UNK> <UNK> theater br br being loved and <UNK> is essential for most children those born to <UNK> mothers and <UNK> fathers often found neither the beautiful country is the story of one such child rejected by his rural village then struggling to find his american father the film begins with green and wild country but <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and boredom the considerable talents of tim roth and <UNK> are wasted in pointless and ill conceived roles aboard the <UNK> <UNK> carrying and is dying brother across the ocean with what appear to be stock shots of <UNK> <UNK> new york city offers slave labor and cliché characters while very uneven from it's start the great curiosity of this film is the final segment nick nolte is given top billing among the cast i <UNK> suggested he would probably be in the final scene only and was not far from the truth as the journey brings to texas and his father the film takes on a <UNK> and <UNK> simplicity a <UNK> <UNK> these two men together into a family of father and son the ninety odd minutes of garbage we have just watched is rewarded by a profound and subtle performance from nolte as they slowly interact the credits rolled and i was surprised to see the names of <UNK> executive producer edward <UNK> and west texas native <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot line there is not one repeat one original plot line or special effect in this blah movie br br the <UNK> hitchcock did it superbly back before cgi and even with cgi this film falls short of a well done attack scene the creepy <UNK> boy the grudge did it and did it better the psycho done in cold creek <UNK> most recently however it has been done to death no pun intended <UNK> rebellious teen who no one <UNK> to about a dozen films have used this one right down to <UNK> the stuff from the basement can you say horror doors opening <UNK> what lies beneath did it with much more flair creepy <UNK> too numerous to mention br br the backdrop of <UNK> which should have been the central focus gets lost once you figure out what is happening which by the way is pretty early on br br one thing of many actually they never even try to explain in the movie is how they explain to the police that their <UNK> was sucked down the <UNK> in the basement so they really don't have a body br br overall don't bother
<START> okay the only reason i watched this movie is because <UNK> allen is in it since i admit to watching days of our lives i know her as <UNK> oh sure perhaps there will be a reason to watch this movie that would be the soft porn area they seem to at that and little else i would hope anyone renting buying this movie rented it only for the sex <UNK> because if they bought rented it for anything else say quality tv they may die of a heart attack this movie involves little imagination whatsoever while i do have a good laugh at it's stupidity and perhaps i'll buy it myself i am but a fool rent before you buy on this one 2 out of 10 note i have yet to give a movie a 1 star the sensual <UNK> alone gave itself and up from a 1 if they hadn't a straight 1 in the pot and i want a <UNK> if it hadn't
<START> horrible waste of talent not even worth watching when there is absolutely nothing else to do my hope against hope is that the actors at least got paid well anyway if you're a fan of <UNK> or <UNK> you'll be really disappointed by this big budget student film
<START> i first heard of this one while searching the <UNK> for reviews of another italian giallo horror effort the <UNK> the <UNK> of the lady in black 1974 whose <UNK> se dvd from video by the way i recently acquired  where it's <UNK> as being in a similar vein but also just as good having watched footsteps for myself now i can see where that reviewer was coming from  in that both films deal with the psychological <UNK> of their female protagonist <UNK> however this one owes far more to art house cinema than anything else  in particular the work of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> antonioni and specifically last year in <UNK> <UNK> and the passenger 1975 respectively <UNK> some have accused it of being deadly boring  an <UNK> often attached to such read cerebral fare br br anyway the film involves the quest of a woman <UNK> <UNK> to determine her movements in the <UNK> three days  of which she seems to have no <UNK> following a series of <UNK> clues she travels to the land of nearby locations then bear the equally <UNK> names of and  where she encounters several people including <UNK> <UNK> as an <UNK> regular of the resort who ostensibly recall the heroine staying there during her most prominent though are a young man peter and a little girl from mario <UNK> baron blood 1972  the former always seems to happen on the scene at <UNK> moments while the latter apparently <UNK> <UNK> with another woman sporting long red hair and a mean streak br br while essentially a mood piece this is nonetheless a gripping puzzle inevitably vague events <UNK> at a deliberate pace  and where much of the film's power <UNK> from the remarkable central performance which can be seen as an <UNK> of <UNK> role in the fine lucio fulci giallo a lizard in a woman's skin 1971 however there's no denying the contribution of cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> who provides any number of sweeping camera moves and an effective color scheme  <UNK> orange red blue <UNK> to create atmosphere and coming up with a <UNK> look for the bizarre finale and <UNK> <UNK> fitting melancholy score the composer is best known nowadays for his oscar winning work on <UNK> holocaust themed <UNK> comedy life is beautiful 1997 br br with this in mind it's worth discussing how footsteps was presented in the version i watched well being apparently hard to get in its original form i can't be sure whether it's uncut here or not except to say that the film ran for <UNK> minutes while the imdb  lists it at <UNK> this edition is <UNK> from a fairly <UNK> english language vhs the dubbing is surprisingly good given the international cast with burnt in swedish subtitles to boot besides the <UNK> copy <UNK> for a few seconds at a crucial point in the story around the <UNK> minute mark still we do get a welcome bonus i e a 9 minute from the in <UNK> format br br i realize i haven't yet mentioned the moon mission subplot to which <UNK> <UNK> presence is <UNK> incidentally around this same time he had a similarly brief but pivotal role in another good arty thriller with sci fi <UNK> and also set in a distinctive location  namely <UNK> 1974 as i lay watching the film i couldn't <UNK> what possible connection this had with the central that <UNK> mentioned a recurring dream about a movie she had once seen though not through to the end called footsteps on the moon a somewhat misleading alternate title for the film itself  <UNK> she at first recalls the picture as being called blood on the moon which of course is a classic 1948 western noir with robert mitchum and directed by robert wise that said i took this in <UNK> as merely one more outlandish touch to the film given also <UNK> former <UNK> as a <UNK> at a <UNK> discussing <UNK> future  and certainly didn't expect the <UNK> to turn up on beach at the very end to pursue the female lead where the sand then turns <UNK> into the <UNK> br br the film's plot will probably make more sense on a second viewing  though to be honest this is best approached as a visual <UNK> experience and one shouldn't really expect it to deliver a narrative that's in any way clear cut and easily <UNK> for the record the only other effort i'd managed to catch prior to this one was the <UNK> straight giallo the fifth <UNK> 1971 starring franco <UNK> which i had recorded off late night italian tv some time ago i did get hold of his spaghetti western rendition of carmen titled man pride and vengeance 1968  also with <UNK> and kinski  as a <UNK> after i'd already missed a <UNK> broadcast of it <UNK> the <UNK> had somehow proved <UNK> and consequently the disc wouldn't play properly
<START> this piece of crap doesn't worth a critical review so i'll write some information for those who don't know the background of this movie first off all it is not the first <UNK> movie they used this wrong info for commercial purpose they <UNK> second they made it for money not for anything else so they picked the jerk who won star academy like big brother it is a popular show and the jerk is popular but dumb cheesy <UNK> then picked the famous actor <UNK> al also dumb <UNK> but has a popular count how many times i'll use the word popular then email me to get your prize however has popular show and the <UNK> actress <UNK> who appeared in popular comic show unfunny so she is famous popular then they picked some <UNK> actors for blah blah blah the funniest thing is the director he is canadian with palestinian roots i believe that the identity of the movie is the identity of its director wait a minute the screen play was written by an egyptian screenwriter very awful one with some help from <UNK> critic famous as critic but actually he is a money collector this group of the multi races money slaves doesn't know anything about the <UNK> culture they don't represent it but when we know who is behind this garbage all our questions will be <UNK> bin is <UNK> prince and b u s i n e s s m a n who doesn't care about the <UNK> culture or <UNK> people he even doesn't live in <UNK> <UNK> even if he lives he will live in his own world his world is far far far away from the real world the people world so he doesn't know anything or care about anything except raising his endless fortune br br not <UNK> movie not anything movie br br screw them all br br <UNK> out of 10
<START> there are certain horror directors for whom i've built up so much respect admiration over the years that they can't possibly disappoint me know matter what garbage to decide to put on film lucio fulci is surely one of them but damned he's trying to disappoint me with his later efforts you can easily afford yourself to skip most of the films fulci directed or produced during the late 80's and simply watch cat in the brain instead because that one title <UNK> and repeats the best and absolute <UNK> footage of no less than seven other fulci flicks including the <UNK> murders sequences featuring in when alice broke the mirror as a whole this movie definitely ranks among our director's weakest and most pointless achievements the script is incoherent as hell the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there's absolutely no suspense to enjoy i love the title but it's actually quite meaningless there is a character named alice in the story but it's only a supportive role and she certainly doesn't break any mirrors i suppose she could break stuff simply using her voice as she's an opera singer but she doesn't the plot revolves on a middle aged and gambling addicted playboy who spends his days <UNK> wealthy <UNK> and killing them for their money lester <UNK> <UNK> the ladies as well as <UNK> witnesses in gruesome ways makes out of their body parts and <UNK> the <UNK> to his cat there's also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him the difference between when alice broke the mirror and some of <UNK> greatest horror films the beyond city of the living dead  lies in the fact that he totally doesn't bother to create a horrific atmosphere the characters lester included are <UNK> and boring and the murders are <UNK> depicted like it's the most common thing in the world to put a woman's head in a <UNK> or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car the lighting is poor the cinematography super ugly the editing clumsy and amateurish and the acting performances are downright miserable if i didn't know any better i would think lucio deliberately made a lousy film in order to protest against all the harsh critics that dislike his <UNK> no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it the obvious element to enjoy here is simply the outrageous gore bloodshed because even the attempt to blend in black comedy doesn't work properly as long as lester <UNK> around his chainsaw and cuts off women's feet when alice broke the mirror is an <UNK> piece of horror entertainment but other than that there's isn't a whole lot to recommend
<START> checking out is a very witty and honest portrayal of a bizarre family that happens to be jewish <UNK> plays virtually no role in the film but american jewish culture behavior gets thoroughly sent up it a loving way i wish the movie dealt with the religious perspective on the topics it explores because i think that would have been interesting br br i've never been a columbo fan so i wasn't familiar with peter falk he's a lot of fun to watch it's great to see judge <UNK> laura san <UNK> david <UNK> again why don't they work more they're all hilarious the script is terrific with a lot of memorable one liners i'll be sure to use with my own family watch for <UNK> <UNK> captain as the <UNK>
<START> this is a great movie to watch with a good friend boy girl friend or family basically one of those feel good movies you want to share with your loved ones without all the <UNK> crap you find in a lot of american feel good movies this movie is light hearted but makes you think and will make you laugh br br just a really simple but universal plot would think most people could relate in some way to this movie the characters in the movie are amazing and the actors do a great job in sucking you into the movie and the movie is topped off all along the way with hilarious true to life jewish humor i watched the movie for the first time last night and now i want to own it
<START> not to waste your time watching this vanity project i've had my comment deleted twice now for reasons that i have yet to understand other than the suspicion that someone involved with gone isn't happy with what i had to say so i've <UNK> things down to the <UNK> gritty this time with an <UNK> of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone nor unfair commentary br br gone is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words horrible stilted dialogue a script that just plain about like a fish out of water acting that would embarrass the most self centered of community theater <UNK> cinematography inspired by the survivor school of <UNK> <UNK> shots followed by static <UNK> exploring close ups terrible <UNK> work special visual effects that aren't pedestrian music that totally fails to sustain any mood or emotion terrible editing with utterly pointless <UNK> and fades no art direction to speak of the <UNK> of badness just goes on and on i felt genuinely cheated out of the time it took me to fast forward through most of it time that could have been better spent staring at a wall under no circumstances should anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this subject themselves to this movie because long before it's over they will be wishing they had been <UNK> before they made that mistake br br case closed <UNK>
<START> jenny lewis plays an awkward girl called <UNK> she <UNK> and drinks she doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a <UNK> mother beverly <UNK> <UNK> finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend billy rob <UNK> maybe she is attracted to him of course i don't need to tell you what happens after that br br this is probably my favorite tv movie this movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame this movie also has the best acting that i have seen in tv movies beverly <UNK> does a really nice job as a sweet and loving but <UNK> and blind mother she couldn't see what was going on under her own roof rob <UNK> is at his best here as the <UNK> jenny lewis is the standout she seems to be exactly like her character br br everyone seems to love this movie
<START> what the hell was this i'll admit there were some scenes that caught my eye such as the 23 <UNK> where the protagonist sees or the number 23 everywhere he goes but that was pretty much the movie in a nutshell for crying out loud this was supposed to be a suspense movie and being labeled as a psychological thriller i would have expected it to have at least some <UNK> effect on the mind but instead what did we get we just got something as <UNK> as an animal control guy finding himself in the middle of a mid life crisis and his journey to redemption kinda like an old man flick if you ask me i probably should have just rented wild <UNK> it wouldn't have made a difference i mean who are we kidding they should have made someone else the killer of that girl by <UNK> <UNK> with the protagonist of that book the number 23 they were pretty much giving out the movie to the viewers by <UNK> that he was the killer all along how would that have <UNK> our heads shame on all of you voters who chose to show some <UNK> towards this wretched piece of work you call a movie and kudos to most of the critics who <UNK> with my reaction
<START> great piece of fiction played as if factual tonight i was looking at the <UNK> of <UNK> robert was not a model meek prisoner and he was in jail because he was <UNK> and a <UNK> did not pay up once he got into jail he was so <UNK> he spent most of his time in <UNK> <UNK> or in the prison hospital killed a few people in prison too this movie reminds me of the <UNK> of <UNK> but even worse robert <UNK> did write books and he did contribute to society in <UNK> and the <UNK> had some hints of <UNK> but this guy henry young who murder in the first is suppose to be about was a a known bank <UNK> who took <UNK> and beat them up in more then one robbery he wasn't some poor guy who stumbled into a <UNK> store which just happened to be a post office and took some money this man was a hard core criminal he also killed a person 3 years before he went to <UNK> he killed another person in jail not because of the <UNK> <UNK> which ended over a year before the murder the real story of his life would of been more interesting they did not even get the warden thing right you can't be a warden in 3 different <UNK> at the same time and by all accounts the warden in the movie was a pretty stand up guy as <UNK> go plus if my <UNK> is right the warden played by karl malden in the <UNK> is suppose to be the same warden in this movie oh boy not only that in this movie we are to think poor henry committed suicide and he wrote the word victory not true he might be alive right now he was sent to <UNK> where robert <UNK> was also a medical center prison then <UNK> <UNK> for another murder he committed and then was released and jumped <UNK> in 1972 never to be found maybe he is hanging out with that <UNK> cooper guy who jumped out that airplane in washington state after committing a bank robbery lol now the acting was very good kevin bacon is in that class of actors which include jeff bridges and dennis quaid the vastly underrated actors club gary <UNK> well they just might of made up the warden part so he could play it because he was great christian slater still somehow sounds like jack nicholson i am not sure if that is a good thing or not <UNK> wife <UNK> <UNK> was in the movie i think just because she is his wife i like her though but not in this flick for some reason i felt this movie when it first came out was suppose to be a special project for kevin bacon i feel he could of taken a person who is truly a victim of the <UNK> system there sure is enough of them and spread some light on their plight other then picking a psychopath to show as a victim
<START> very disappointing and incoherent every now and then a <UNK> of an idea would develop and be <UNK> in the next line it had the feel of a film that had been cut and re cut to try and make it work i was bored and distracted all the way through and i'm speaking as a huge fan of the series many of the jokes were unoriginal and tired the medieval section went on far too long and the quality of acting was very poor some on the tiny guest spots like simon <UNK> and liam cunningham did more in their <UNK> 30 <UNK> than the main cast did in 90 <UNK> br br it's a shame really br br the only really interesting thing was getting a look inside the little shed on <UNK> square which is something everyone who is ever in that part of london wonders about
<START> it seems that all people didn't like steven seagal just take a look at his nomination list there are only <UNK> awards nominations with one win for him but i think he didn't earn anything of it i saw good movies with steven seagal i saw bad movies with steven seagal and the <UNK> 1998 is one of his best movies nearly as good as under siege 1992 or hard to kill 1990 the <UNK> shows his activities to protect nature surely this movie is not a great one and i must say that there is more violence than i like and why must <UNK> best friend l q jones die the death of a victim the role of dr is one of <UNK> best performances he has as always a very good charisma and in summary the <UNK> is good entertainment and with an average rating of only 4 points the most underrated movie of all time br br regards hans <UNK>
<START> the film is a joy to watch not just for the plot which is gripping but also for the superb performances of the actors <UNK> and <UNK> though considered a <UNK> on its first release it has become a critical success and it is clear to see why <UNK> acting style suited the film brilliantly she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something and her character in this film is i will not spoil it with saying what though it is <UNK> fairly early on <UNK> is lovable as the fairly but in love <UNK> i would recommend this film to all <UNK> or <UNK> fans it is a brilliant <UNK> style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does the film is <UNK> 2 <UNK> so you feel that you have not been sold short <UNK> steals the show in this film and it is clear that at the time of making the film <UNK> was very much smitten with her a definite must see for any <UNK> or 10 10
<START> i cannot stress how bad this movie is this director took every cheap little <UNK> shot at making these people look so <UNK> why are their clothes so dirty why on earth would you get the new clark kent to play a crack head you should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of your life buddy <UNK> br br i take serious offense to this fool wanting to cast real actors as thugs and <UNK> as some kind of clever joke why would you ask clark kent to play a <UNK> why are they yelling so much why is everyone so mean why are those kids so filthy no one would want to be so filthy not even a <UNK> child br br you need to grow up and not make any movies ever again
<START> i thought this movie was horrible i was bored and had to use all the self control i have to not scream at the screen <UNK> squad was beyond cheesy beyond cliche and utterly predictable
<START> there seems to have been some money behind this film but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if i hadn't actually started watching it br br to begin with once we are in the <UNK> with the characters the usual young adult stereotypes we've been meeting in horror films since the early '80s the film is shot almost entirely in close up since the actors are wearing helmet lights this means all we see are glaring lights <UNK> with utter darkness we never get to see what the characters see so when they shout out look there we are left to beg what where ultimately the film has a nauseating confusing <UNK> light effect with no sense to it until we get to the end br br and i won't tell you what 'the <UNK> means but you will recognize it if you've ever seen the old early '60s arch hall laugh fest with richard <UNK> br br but what crazy person would ever want to make a variation on a theme like 's long remembered as one of the worst films ever made but that's what we have here folks except that unlike the <UNK> is not anyone's idea of goofy fun it is unwatchable i ran it at <UNK> the normal speed just to get it over with hoping i would actually be able to see something by the end of the film but when i did it was just stupid this film did provide me with one satisfying moment though since it only cost a couple bucks after i got it out of the dvd player i was able to smash it with my own hands what a relief
<START> usual awful movie i'll not bother you about the synopsis just put together the core <UNK> an evil <UNK> military officer and one or two solve all <UNK> and you'll have the movie if i can call it that way br br seriously <UNK> in this kind of movies are more useful than swiss army knives br br the big one is approaching <UNK> some places and it's over a <UNK> wants to destroy insert important city name here <UNK> insert another important city here a <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> it a <UNK> is near to go off <UNK> it coffee is cold <UNK> it you didn't like transformers <UNK> yourself but i can't assure this will fix things br br in the end how many more movies like this can be made before they start <UNK> one another i doubt there are still many things to blow up with a <UNK>
<START> now i do understand that this film was not meant as an <UNK> against all indians but it is an amazing film because it <UNK> to investigate the <UNK> that some indians have concerning their women and sexuality i have known for some time that <UNK> is very common in this society with women being murdered because the husband's family doesn't want them any more after his death or because she had a small <UNK> as well as the frequent killing of female <UNK> because they are seen as a curse instead of a <UNK> i also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter even if the film was so strongly attacked when it <UNK> in india a decade ago as a result of the extreme <UNK> in the movie most western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this film br br although i am a male am not <UNK> feminist and i am straight the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is not an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by lesbians and man <UNK> in fact i don't think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a <UNK> argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands yes i use the word wicked and mean it as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their sexuality in many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence br br one husband married a <UNK> young woman <UNK> out of family <UNK> this arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning <UNK> makes an attempt to connect with her <UNK> husband however he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about <UNK> and he continues to have an affair with a liberal minded chinese lady to make matters worse he did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies in their dead marriage sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way <UNK> could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met and unfortunately he could have cared less br br another husband was married to a lady who was <UNK> <UNK> oddly after initially trying to have children they have gone the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever it's because this man has decided to become an i e in <UNK> a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment now his wanting to do this was all well and good if he was not already married and had <UNK> for his wife however being married this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother he assumed his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care the closest he would allow her to him sexually was to sleep next to him as having her next to him helped teach himself to overcome the desires of the flesh this must have brought nothing but frustration to her br br so you've got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an <UNK> for their sexual needs eventually these needs bring these sister in laws together at first just emotionally but later sexually as well the movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional <UNK> br br late in the film when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from <UNK> <UNK> husband a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossible br br this is a very challenging and adult film while there is very little nudity the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids very disturbing indeed is one minor character who <UNK> in front of an old <UNK> lady as i said this is not a film to let your kids watch however for a mature audience this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to think br br the film features good acting complex characters excellent writing lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some but which i found rewarding the only serious negative i cannot blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on <UNK> this is because although the movie is in english the accents are quite strong at times and it's not always easy to understand what's being said but and this is the worst part there are no closed or open <UNK> including them is a must for western audiences if you do watch this film see if you can find it on dvd or hopefully a newer release on video will have <UNK> mine sure didn't br br by the way director <UNK> <UNK> a popular female director has made several other wonderful films such as earth and bollywood hollywood a consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional indian culture and expectations and with a strong emphasis on female characters not surprisingly this west thinking lady makes her home in canada and is divorced a truly unusual woman to say the least for a similar film that explores traditional culture meets western culture try another canadian gem eat drink man woman
<START> i don't really know what it is about dirty dancing there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie i cannot possibly <UNK> the hundreds yes hundreds of times i've watched it beginning to end but every time i do come upon it on tv i am <UNK> and <UNK> and sit myself down and there i am for two hours loving the movie as if i'm watching it for the first time although patrick <UNK> and jennifer grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more to see this passion and commitment and i can't help <UNK> up a tiny bit at the end when patrick comes up to the <UNK> family and tells her dad nobody puts baby in a corner classic moment for all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy maybe in a way it is but it was the of the 80's films and put patrick <UNK> right on the map his performance was <UNK> br br three cheers for dirty dancing br br ps the soundtrack is fantastic an absolute masterpiece
<START> this is a tough film to review since several factors need to be taken into account let's <UNK> the more <UNK> ok are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of jeffrey dahmer can you <UNK> an independent low budget film are you objective enough to not dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look well if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one this film is an almost 100 accurate <UNK> of <UNK> adult life and subsequent murder spree and is <UNK> as an autobiography it isn't a <UNK> unrealistic account that unfortunately the theatrical film dahmer 2001 was the movie begins with dahmer played quite convincingly by carl crew sitting in the police car as they raid his apartment his thoughts of what got him there are presented to us in a past tense narrated style that accurately explains much of <UNK> <UNK> and motives which led him to commit murder almost 20 times we get to know the character both the <UNK> side as well as the side that came moderately close to living a normal life it isn't anyone's fault but <UNK> that 17 people died but being a criminal psychology student i was pleased to more than just his <UNK> side represented <UNK> in this film you see him having a loving relationship with his grandmother as well as trying to find <UNK> but of course we witness the side of him that everyone remembers it should be noted that there is little actual <UNK> violence with much of it suggestive in shots such as of blood or a body being struck through a <UNK> curtain you do see two deaths that i remember one being a pretty <UNK> throat slash and the other being a man shoved alive into a barrel of acid while you don't see anything graphic this cruelty and the convincing acting of both crew and his victim make this a disturbing scene and while the actual <UNK> <UNK> is kept low you will see the results there is a prop hand and head or two but it seems as if this was to <UNK> the viewer and doesn't look to be <UNK> besides these fake <UNK> pieces are where the budget limitations are visible although acceptable they look enough like <UNK> to not be too disturbing the film actually concludes before <UNK> death in 1994 due to the fact that it was released a year or two prior that's about the only big difference from the real story and the information that remains is as i've stated very true to the facts the film quality could be better the dialogue often sounds a little too quiet and the acting of several characters is a bit hammy but it's not overboard in my opinion this is a flawed but ultimately honest and serious look into one of america's most remembered serial killers i think it's safe to say the film is memorable as well and i respect it for <UNK> its limitations to deliver the story in a believable manner aided by a thoroughly excellent carl crew as dahmer
<START> i rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on or the movie itself purely based on the chance that it's one of those rare overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy br br unfortunately this is not one of those movies i am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality or worse deliberate agenda but certain elements of it made it impossible to <UNK> it is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to cope with the difficult realities of their life that is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the <UNK> of it br br here we have a community of simple farm workers who <UNK> to the us in search of <UNK> and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men and when i say evil i mean evil all white people in this movie are <UNK> racist sadistic abusive <UNK> whose sole purpose in life is sexual <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> the poor immigrants it would be a sad story if it wasn't so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious br br the portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction the immigrants are <UNK> clean and could serve as <UNK> for boo <UNK> and the world over i couldn't help but laugh when i saw these field workers presumably digging in the <UNK> all day with their <UNK> clean clothes and <UNK> hair cuts from a top notch hair <UNK> a little restraint and a more <UNK> hand at the <UNK> could have made this a much better movie <UNK> some intended emotion rather than sarcastic <UNK>
<START> ok from the point of view of an american who i assume do not know much about <UNK> this would be an amazing film for them first of all its got heart good morals the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy however to us where i come from <UNK> is the number one sport it is a way of life it is a game played only by the <UNK> and the <UNK> are <UNK> like heroes as though americans do for their baseball basketball stars am not really sure if it was the cheap budget or the maybe the director or actors knew very little about <UNK> and being a <UNK> fan my whole life i can see than some of the actors didn't even knew <UNK> existed before acting in this movie in <UNK> up to me this movie was terrible if you watch it and thought it was great please make time to go online and maybe <UNK> all blacks this is new <UNK> national team and the ones who made the famous believe me they will make the <UNK> boys look like school girls
<START> horses on mars is an engaging animated short that takes a sometimes comical look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those yet to <UNK> the story is personal and at times sentimental and is supported by strong digital animation and narration that involves the viewer in this science fiction story i was fortunate enough to view this short in widescreen format at the 2002 sundance film festival and must suppose that when transferred to the small screen it will lose some of its ability to draw the reader into the no less thoughtful story and stunning graphics
<START> although credit should have been given to dr for stealing the story line of <UNK> <UNK> the egg this was a fine film it touched both the emotions and the intellect due especially to the incredible performance of seven year old justin henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character and each one's <UNK> the thought provoking elements <UNK> long after the tear <UNK> ones are over overall superior acting from a solid cast excellent directing and a very powerful script the right touches of humor throughout help keep a heavy subject from becoming tedious or difficult to sit through lastly this film stands the test of time and seems in no way dated decades after it was released
<START> in 1970 <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> beauty contest in london and brought the occasion to a halt by <UNK> the stage with <UNK> and eggs why because rightly or wrongly they felt the event to be <UNK> and <UNK> to women i offer no criticism of their actions its a free world we live in what i want to know is why don't their modern day <UNK> <UNK> the studios where shows such as this are made and do likewise br br <UNK> the <UNK> is all about four self absorbed women from new york carrie is a slave to fashion who turns into a <UNK> when a man so much as eyes on her charlotte <UNK> to find the perfect man they don't exist love so she can use sex to <UNK> the poor devil lawyer miranda scares men away by nonsense like <UNK> of touch with my <UNK> and lastly we have samantha the living <UNK> of the old <UNK> ad <UNK> <UNK> hold up these characters particularly samantha as a shining example of modern day <UNK> well if shouting rude words in busy <UNK> is progress i think the <UNK> should take a long hard look at themselves and what they're supposed to represent br br had <UNK> the <UNK> been the creation of a man it would have been pulled from the <UNK> for being sexist instead like <UNK> <UNK> before it it has <UNK> supposedly intelligent women into thinking it has acted as a positive force for good there's something very <UNK> and cold blooded about the show 'the benny hill <UNK> was sexist too but at least it was funny
<START> for a good take on the roman empire watch the excellent bbc produced miniseries i <UNK> this just sucked the acting was pathetic and you could almost see the actors looking at the camera hans <UNK> was irritating cheese factor was so high that it <UNK> <UNK> with repeated viewings even <UNK> was tame i think this film was <UNK> supported by religious groups who shall remain <UNK> the overt tones of christian <UNK> and <UNK> were blatant if that gives any hint stay away what ever you do the running time is so long that i was able to read harry <UNK> first book faster than the time it took to view this tripe br br italy has done better don't let hans cute face fool you he is not a great actor he is a great bore
<START> to be honest fellow imdb reviewers i enjoyed this show a lot the reason well it didn't try to be more than it is i mean a sitcom with regular expectations with a well known and repeated plot funny and talented actors and clever jokes oriented for a post college audience br br this is what grown ups is all about trying to be mature but in a funny way br br white is funny as always and delivers some witty and hilarious sex oriented jokes the humor is very 90's without taking in account the <UNK> of the new millennium and that's the main reason in my opinion why the show didn't have success it got stuck in the 90's br br oh and mrs <UNK> was really funny and <UNK> br br my favorite show has to be the one that deals with <UNK> biting the ass not a cult classic but i'm sure it's part of regular early <UNK> nostalgia
<START> in victorian times a father is separated from his family when he is <UNK> accused of <UNK> and they are sent to live in the country the children adapt to their new situation make friends and <UNK> the help of a kind old man they wave to on the train to help reunite their family br br actors who direct movies are often not very good at it <UNK> however the great veteran actor of dozens of british comedy classics is one of the few exceptions his brilliant conception he also wrote the script from the novel by e of a classic british children's story is what raises this film to art whilst the story may be highly <UNK> the wonderful performances and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> settings combine to make a truly memorable movie the photography by arthur is the definition of good movie making not a shot is wasted in telling the story but at the same time the images combine to create a <UNK> romantic atmosphere <UNK> is simply perfect as the kind hearted <UNK> okay i fell in love with her at an early age but i defy anyone to disagree and <UNK> whose comic acting <UNK> is on a par with <UNK> is unforgettable as <UNK> the humble yet proud <UNK> porter this is a film out of time romantic charming hugely enjoyable and with a beautifully naive sense of good hearted kindness towards all
<START> the dog can act unfortunately nobody else in the cast of this <UNK> faux children's film can a stray yet very clever dog <UNK> himself into the lives of two children much to the <UNK> of their bitter and cold hearted father in what can only be described as <UNK> the evil widower <UNK> his children who may or may not be mentally challenged from playing with <UNK> neither the children nor <UNK> <UNK> soon the children are kidnapped and <UNK> has to help the police find them it's only then that the old man realizes that <UNK> is good not bad br br tom lester whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dim witted <UNK> on green <UNK> plays one of the <UNK> so does the <UNK> over <UNK> deborah previous screen <UNK> include beach <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> it's a bikini world she also played both <UNK> and <UNK> in the past and here attempts to <UNK> her good girl reputation by playing it bad br br stay away from <UNK> he's a dog and this movie is a dog
<START> i chose the english patient for a history extra credit assignment i thought that this movie would be incredibly boring instead it has become one of my favorites it portrays life in wwii quite accurately and the love story is amazing the love story made the movie so incredible i felt this interesting feeling of passion or something it made me want to watch the movie over and over again <UNK> scott thomas and ralph <UNK> are amazing actors and the way they played their characters is amazing the look wonderful together and actually seemed to be in love i recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to watch as a <UNK> activity or for an assignment
<START> an obvious vanity press for julie in her first movie with blake let's see where do we begin she is a <UNK> during a world war she <UNK> that by falling in love her friends who are presumably <UNK> because they are german citizens are <UNK> and must die and she winds up as a heroine ok the scenes with the drunken pilot and the <UNK> who work for french intelligence can't even be described and we won't even mention <UNK> romantic scenes with a female by the way when they visit a museum look at his <UNK> i it on video and it's priceless is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie i don't know and you won't either
<START> it is beyond me why two million danish people each week sit down to watch this terrible show the dialogue is terrible and not realistic the characters are hollow and simplistic there's a tough man a tough woman and a sensitive man the writers actually say that they have <UNK> the characters after greek mythology give me a break all the characters are of course brilliant policemen when i have watched this show i have <UNK> for district hill street and <UNK> blue these are brilliant shows and is a lousy copy this program is a <UNK> of the disease danish television is currently suffering from
<START> i don't understand why everyone is hating on barney if you hate the show so much then don't watch it its stupid how everyone is changing the i love you son to i hate you if you don't like it fine whatever thats your opinion but there is no point to <UNK> the show when it isn't even that bad ok so its corny and yes it has its flaws but its a kids show kids don't want to be sad and miserable they want to be happy and barney helps that and even in the show there are moments of sadness and anger and etc and yes barney uses magic but the kids see barney as a <UNK> of imagination kids need a place to escape to express themselves the world is a miserable and hard place we all need a place to express ourselves and be happier barney does this to us this show is great i watched barney when i was younger yes some people find it stupid but i watched it and i'm top of my class it might not necessarily make you smarter but that's not the point i believe that the point of barney is to provide a place where kids can be kids and the spirit of childhood can be expressed where imagination lives on so many teenagers now are unimaginative and are scared to express themselves barney helps encourage that barney helped me to not be afraid and to just show myself for who i am i'm a <UNK> at high school now an <UNK> student with a 4 0 a drama student with a love for theater and art and with a new baby cousin who loves barney i watch it with him and enjoy it and sing along with it yes its corny and silly and whatever but its great for kids who wants to be an adult who doesn't have time to have fun im a kid at heart and i love barney its great for kids and those who are a kid at heart br br its a great show for babies and <UNK> so stop hating say that you don't like it but stop it with the dumbest show ever or a load of bull or whatever keep it to yourself take a chill <UNK> or whatever here's something i never liked <UNK> street but you don't see me going <UNK> is a load of bull or cookie monster should die or whatever i hate all of the t that people say about books or movies like barney or twilight if you hate it ok whatever no one cares don't go saying hate things about it <UNK> you might just offend someone
<START> <UNK> is without doubt the best tarzan movie i have ever seen christopher <UNK> portrays a very believable man trying to return to the world of mankind alongside the fantastic ian <UNK> the struggle of john to leave the jungle and the apes who raised him is quite stirring some very memorable scenes including where <UNK> makes the jungle noises to the romantic interest and the scene where he witnesses his ape father's death <UNK> feelings for both worlds is well developed and really makes you feel for him br br an excellent and underrated movie
<START> after seeing the trailer it was an easy decision not to see this film i mean i don't care for stupid <UNK> comedies i'm sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together smoke a bowl and go check out this flick with the guy from the simpsons and some guy named billy bob should have been a good time but the film's just not that funny too bad somebody had to go and bum their high br br unfortunately i found out that the trailer was misleading after it had already left the theaters so i had to wait for the video i really enjoyed it nice locations quality production and excellent performances from the entire cast looking back at it the plot twists weren't totally unexpected but i didn't find it <UNK> because the premise was so engaging br br so why was this absorbing drama <UNK> as a comedy did something happen to the producer leaving the associate producers to do the marketing by themselves
<START> this movie is truly unique it really captures the spirit of the play but makes it entertaining to the modern generation the romance between <UNK> and juliet was believable and erotic not pulled off by many adaptations it is also so funny i was almost crying with laughter br br like with most troma its in your face taboo subjects gore and sex and yet add in some really good acting and a shakespeare plot you really have to see this movie to believe it br br there are some <UNK> jokes in the credits best credits i've seen since hot shots loads of troma in jokes as well as general satire and shakespeare <UNK> and from the house of <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> this movie to a friend and had an almost impossible job of getting it back troma at its best this film really is a gem and goes in my top 5 favourite movies of all time br br though its not the sort of film you'd watch with your mum and might offend some people for anybody bored with run of the mill cinema with a wacky sense of humour you must see this film
<START> it's some years since i've seen this movie so forget most of the details however i loved it at the time and found the plot intensely gripping the climax heart stopping i remember being literally on the edge of my seat at the theatre back in 1979 br br jane fonda plays a los angeles reporter <UNK> who stumbles upon an accident at a local nuclear power facility she wants to go public with the story aided by her hippie cameraman michael douglas who has photographed the event but a sinister conspiracy attempts to cover it all up jack lemmon is absolutely wonderful in the role of the nuclear <UNK> conflicted middle manager torn between loyalty to his company and <UNK> the right <UNK> by <UNK> the <UNK> situation his facial expressions speak volumes here br br apart from the engrossing plot and riveting tension this film is all about jack lemmon his character and his superb acting performance as for jane fonda i was a huge fan of hers at the time i suspect she just moved on from her anti war <UNK> to taking on the nuclear industry br br this movie seems intended as a nuclear scare <UNK> and three mile island notwithstanding they're different types of <UNK> our canadian <UNK> is safe and well respected around the world i wouldn't hesitate to <UNK> near the nuclear power plant about an <UNK> drive away where my friend works as a very competent engineer apparently they shut down for every <UNK> problem <UNK> of the financial loss i sincerely doubt that there are any <UNK> <UNK> there one can hardly imagine any of the <UNK> or highly trained <UNK> willing to risk any sort of <UNK> or whatever it's absolute <UNK> of course the moral here is to spare no expense or effort either in building the facility or <UNK> its ongoing safety br br if we want our western lifestyle we have to get our energy somewhere for those who claim nuclear power can never be made completely safe true of course perhaps they should <UNK> as a coal <UNK> or else return to pre electricity horse and <UNK> days br br by all means enjoy this entertaining and highly suspenseful movie which apparently is based loosely <UNK> on a true story it's a real <UNK> a thriller and maybe even a killer but please don't get your attitudes about the operation and safety of nuclear power plants from it
<START> this intelligent moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition reminds me of william novels br br the characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume and seek for a way to live within those roles rather than throw them off altogether but as the story develops the two wives trapped in <UNK> <UNK> draw together drawing on the strength of their friendship and love they give each other the courage to abandon their roles br br they have found that living within their traditions is no life at all it is a sort of living death without passion without true connection to others without <UNK> although they know there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom it is a price much less dear than the sacrifice called for by a comfortable predictable existence br br the screenplay is wonderful the acting marvelous near perfect
<START> notwithstanding that the house of adam is meant to be a mainstream gay movie that anthony john shaw who is gay curious and a major <UNK> hunk and adam jared who is openly gay and a close second in looks that there is a whole minute of wonderful convincing and naked <UNK> sorry no frontal between anthony and adam <UNK> minutes into the movie that alone may be sufficient for many of us notwithstanding all that to which i give a thumbs up the house of adam is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard a big thumbs down br br <UNK> and acting abilities are either <UNK> or else truly suffer from the bad script direction and editing or rather the lack thereof their <UNK> scene is nevertheless convincing and may have more to do with their really being into each other considering the rest of their scripting and acting br br writer director <UNK> bonus feature self <UNK> as to his movie making skills is off the wall br br so the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down overall the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for shaw and <UNK> as nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above far and away the absolute worst and <UNK> acting was by thomas michael as albert ross <UNK> father having not even of <UNK> school acting quality he truly represents a <UNK> casting failure br br the actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as well br br if only the production editing and post production were as good as the trailer this movie would have been quite something else the trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place that and the hope that this gay centered movie was supposedly <UNK> played and <UNK> at gay film festivals br br overall the movie is a big thumbs down br br is it worth buying renting and watching it only if you have an irresistible <UNK> to see the naked love making scene and a few minutes of semi convincing dialogue between anthony and adam or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies
<START> i absolutely loved this show never understood why it was called bug juice though i must have been about 13 when it came out i remember they ran it over the summer holidays on channel 4 between re runs of summer and saved by the bell or something like that i remember sitting there and wishing i was at summer camp too ha ha all the kids in it looked to be having so much fun it was all about discovering who you are and growing up first kisses and all that stuff i remember there was this really cute guy in it i think he was the main reason i got up in the <UNK> that particular summer they should have more teen <UNK> <UNK> like this i thought it was great
<START> the box to this movie totally <UNK> itself the cover shows a view of legs <UNK> in a short <UNK> the title is <UNK> ' the synopsis on the back of the box made it seem as though cat the main character was an <UNK> who became one of the popular students but that popularity lead to a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape from everything that the box built this movie up to was a horrible lie i expected a sort of crappy direct to video version of targeted at the teenagers of today br br let me tell you what was really about yes this really is the plot so if you don't want to know what happens stop reading we have one unlikable boring rich girl this unlikable girl's best friend is a <UNK> the <UNK> gets <UNK> from school so the unlikable girl befriends some british girl this leads to the unlikable girl dating this boring guy who the box refers to as the most popular boy in school ' if that guy was the most popular guy in their school i wish i would have gone to that high school because i could have kicked the crap out of him anyway as any movie will tell you the most popular guy in school is <UNK> a murderer or drug addict or thief or in this case all of the above anyway everyone ends up <UNK> the unlikable main character because she is jewish then the most popular guy in school beats her best friend the <UNK> to death with a rock because the <UNK> caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act the unlikable girl's stoic mother and <UNK> younger brother are there for her at the end oh and the entire movie is about <UNK> rich kids and their horrible parents too gee what is wrong with that that sounds like a fantastic movie well that's what i thought but you see there are no likeable characters in this movie the main character is boring the filmmakers made her average while during the film she keeps <UNK> off about what a freak she is the <UNK> is not <UNK> enough and has little screen time the popular guy is nothing to write home about the popular girls are just your run of the mill rich girls there are no moral lessons cat the boring main character is not a freak does not ever become one of the truly popular girls and worst of all after all the crap she goes through she thinks she is still too good to <UNK> the only nice girl the <UNK> girl to be honest i have no idea why the movie is called <UNK> i kept asking who's the <UNK> is she the <UNK> are they all <UNK> at <UNK> minutes <UNK> this is not a long movie but after actually watching this awful waste of a vhs tape and not knowing who the <UNK> was i was surprised that the movie was only an hour and a half the movie felt like it was two hours and some change after a while i was hoping the movie would be about pop <UNK> at least when you look at a box of pop <UNK> you know what to expect
<START> special sneak previews are always a good time no matter what movie it is you are seeing the theatre will always be packed by people who have been awaiting the film like free stuff thought it'd be something to do or just got lost either way no matter how good or bad the film the audience alone will make it enjoyable now when said movie is a pg 13 pseudo horror film can you really delve into horror when the mpaa is on your back <UNK> everything you know there will be <UNK> laughing and breath holding with the the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous <UNK> and <UNK> to the characters on screen as for the actual movie i feel sorry for those involved because it really could have been much better had it been paced right and allowed to stretch its legs beyond the scare fade to black show aftermath progression these films have in the end we are shown a boring plodding story with no surprises and few moments of actual suspense br br the story is a common one a family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try and <UNK> their relationship with each other once settled in the spirits of the house come out to the <UNK> <UNK> child whose past makes it even easier for the parents to <UNK> everything told to them of course the child is not crying wolf and those around only find out when it is too late i will credit the <UNK> brothers directors of the acclaimed the eye that i would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without hollywood <UNK> on the were done by someone else but the brothers <UNK> credit it's a shame what our studio system does to <UNK> especially when it was creative independence which made the films that brings them in and not <UNK> <UNK> for really having a fitting style and for keeping the tired plot line somewhat fresh unfortunately though i also must give them credit for the almost unbearable <UNK> similar to why i disliked what lies beneath i couldn't stand the drawn out suspense which goes so far as to make it laughable when our heroine and her brother stand in a <UNK> with a ghost behind them the scene lasts about eight minutes with just static oddly composed close ups and depth of field focus changes to end up culminating to absolutely nothing for being only <UNK> minutes i almost think it would have worked better even shorter br br besides a very effective opening sequence featuring the fantastic <UNK> <UNK> strangely playing a boy and a great atmospheric credit sequence the only thing that saves the film from utter garbage is the acting except for penelope ann miller who first made me wonder what ever happened to her and then after a few scenes made me understand why i never asked that question in the years she was absent and dustin <UNK> completely lacking in credibility the acting is very strong <UNK> mcdermott does a nice job as the father trying to keep his family together through all the tough times he has many little moments of light comedy to <UNK> his serious dramatic role william b davis everyone's favorite is used effectively as an almost foreboding character sadly not <UNK> more our true stars are <UNK> stewart and john corbett stewart plays the emotion very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and panic room on her resume as for corbett if he didn't pull off his role the entire movie would have <UNK> completely i do wish he would be given more work as i've enjoyed him since the under appreciated series the visitor still need to check out his first role in northern exposure a show i haven't yet been able to catch up on it's a shame he will probably be most recognizable for the overrated my big fat greek wedding br br if anything the gave me a nice introduction to the <UNK> <UNK> work and <UNK> my desire to check out their chinese horror <UNK> the mood and performances were there it was just the simple and <UNK> story that needed way too much padding to make a feature film if they <UNK> more into other characters rather than just stewart's it could have been more effective while also having something more to show then ten minute scenes of nothing if our protagonist is the only one being attacked there is no suspense as to how far the creatures will go to harm her the moments of danger had no gravity to them and until the ending really just stood in as filler i am excited however for the free comic book given away after the special screening as hopefully the medium will allow for a faster paced story that <UNK> before it tries to surprise
<START> a friend gave me this movie because she liked it i decided i would finally watch it it was <UNK> long i kept waiting for the suspense to happen but it never did i kept waiting for something to happen after the opening scenes and it never did i stopped the movie and came back later i actually forced myself to watch the rest of it hoping it would get better it got worse i kept asking myself who are these people do they have feelings are they just robots i'm glad i didn't pay to see it or pay to rent it the end would have been better if dutch died from the <UNK> wound at least we would have gotten some emotion from the audience or maybe not
<START> even if i had never seen or heard of <UNK> co this would be a sweet little movie but my dad was born and raised there and those are my <UNK> horses you see pulling the <UNK> so this movie is very special to me a lot of the interiors are shot in buildings and houses i recognize and are very realistic the story is a little hokey but <UNK> is that kind of magical place where things like that could happen john denver was a better actor than a lot of people give him credit for mary <UNK> plays the kind of common sense lady with a lot of <UNK> she played so well in many other films most notably white christmas i usually don't get to go out there in the winter so i like to see this movie at christmas time to tide me over until my next trip
<START> this is the most inaccurate and <UNK> biblical film i have ever has the misfortune to watch i would like to know why anybody on earth could enjoy viewing this i am so surprised that a big name like jon voight would agree to act in this <UNK> piece of garbage many people who may not have read the bible will now be <UNK> by believing this film was accurate and the thought of that really bothers me i think the makers have a lot to answer for the worst thing is that i believe nobody could make such obvious mistakes with a biblical film since they can research the bible for the truth so i believe the makers deliberately twisted what the bible says and that is something nobody has the right to do and i find that very offensive there are no words strong enough to describe exactly how i feel about this
<START> the biggest tragedy surrounding this thoroughly delightful movie is its lack of u s distribution i was fortunate enough to see this film at the boston international festival of women's cinema and highly recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to see it terrific performances and thoughtful script and great direction from the talented and funny rose all combine to make this film a winner
<START> the china syndrome launched a whole string of films about the potentially devastating effects of <UNK> nuclear power a black cloud of paranoia that would hang over america for much of the reagan years it's a well made and effective drama given an extra punch by its high power stars notably jack lemmon who plays a senior official of the nuclear power plant who suffers a crisis of conscience but one can't help but think that it was the <UNK> timing of the three mile island nuclear accident that occurred just a couple of weeks after this film's release that has given it its lasting appeal as a classic from the 70s as watchable as it is it's certainly no classic br br with a red headed jane fonda as a news reporter and a <UNK> michael douglas as her camera man and the film's producer by the way br br grade b
<START> in <UNK> <UNK> confusing art house zombie film rupert everett plays <UNK> a caretaker in a cemetery where the dead don't stay buried for long aided by his simple assistant <UNK> deals with the zombie problem by either shooting the undead in the head or splitting their <UNK> with a spade br br however soon after falling for the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his recently <UNK> <UNK> finds himself than ever br br having garnered some particularly <UNK> comments from some of <UNK> more respected horror i decided to see what the fuss was all about i've just finished watching the film and i can honestly say that i haven't been this disappointed by a horror film for quite some time br br with its dreary muddled pseudo philosophical plot and an extremely bland performance from leading man everett is an irritating and plodding mess that not even some <UNK> gore courtesy of sergio <UNK> and welcome gratuitous nudity from <UNK> anna can save i am at a loss to understand the amount of in depth analysis and discussion that this pretentious <UNK> has received from its misguided fans
<START> i loved this movie 10 years ago when i was about 16 years old my biggest mistake was to watch it again 10 years later it's not the worst i wanna be a pilot movies ever but it has so many flaws in it that you can hardly overlook them br br <UNK> one vision along with the rest of the soundtrack makes this film better than the average patriotic nonsense you usually get to see br br
<START> <UNK> isn't very unique in horror genre in fact it isn't even scary at all it reminds me of its american cousins horror slashers it's just a copy of any other horror slasher and as a german movie it's just too american with nothing to add to it br br actually <UNK> is too predictable and boring its plot is not intact and consistent it's got stupid scenes to it which don't even fit into a horror movie genre amusing sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear why do they need to have it all in just one movie they should have made a cheap german adult movie instead br br i can't recommend this movie to anyone because it's just too boring
<START> north and south is a miniseries from the golden age of television miniseries in the 1980s which was a time for long sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos it is for the most part excellent for what it is although i personally prefer the less soap opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history br br james read and patrick <UNK> deliver excellent performances especially read whose george <UNK> serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story the series also contains top notch work from <UNK> alley wendy hal <UNK> lewis smith genie francis <UNK> <UNK> brown and others the costumes filming sets and music are all first rate as well br br don't take it as a history lesson but take it for what it is a well made sweeping epic from a <UNK> era book 2 which followed a year later is also excellent but i would advise viewers to skip book 3 which came out 8 years after book 2 and was not nearly as good as the first two parts books 1 and 2 are classics though even with their elements and they are well worth watching
<START> saw this at sundance one of the first years i attended the festival blew me away br br it went by much too fast and i've never been able to find it again i figured it would show up on a <UNK> somewhere but still no joy my <UNK> <UNK> on the details i just remember being surprised over and over again and on the edge of my seat br br anyone reading this have any leads online dvd beat up vhs copy i'd try to make it worth your while br br over the years i've probably seen over 200 short films used to live near <UNK> where they have an incredible shorts fest in april this definitely ranks among my favorites and i hope to see it again br br many thanks to anyone with leads on how to see it
<START> did the other reviewers watch the same movie i did this was poorly written poorly acted and just overall boring i made it well past the halfway point in the movie and then just gave up i can't possibly imagine an ending that would have made the rest of the movie worthwhile don't waste your time with this dog seriously
