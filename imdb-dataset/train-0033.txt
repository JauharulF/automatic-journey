<START> i wasn't expecting the highest <UNK> of film making with joel <UNK> directing this one so i was surprised that <UNK> wasn't a complete waste of time br br in technique it's often derivative of saving private ryan with the shaky camera work grainy shots the film occasionally running like it's skipping a <UNK> all those techniques <UNK> used to make his film seem more realistic but in the end was more distracting than anything else br br but unlike saving private ryan the emotional <UNK> wasn't as weak as the characters in this film seemed more like real people and the story less contrived not so wrapped up in the american flag <UNK> gets an <UNK> in subtlety br br next to the first section of kubrick's full metal jacket this is the most realistic portrayal of boot camp that i have seen in a film and for that i think it's worth watching br br it's not a great film but neither is it a bad film
<START> this is the least scary film i have ever seen how the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film the blob moves so slowly that an o a p in a <UNK> could escape it the blob has a large slice of luck coming across a typical horror film woman who instead of running away stands still for half an hour so that she can be eaten if you <UNK> seen this film i recommend you do its far too funny to be taken seriously
<START> this is one of those topics i can relate to a little more than most people as i hate noise have no idea how those in big cities new york especially how people get any sleep at all it <UNK> me that people can stand all the noise out there these days the basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic it's too bad that's about it tim <UNK> is decent although except for a couple of scenes especially with the absolute <UNK> looking <UNK> <UNK> he didn't seem to really be altogether there my biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning talented actress to boot <UNK> <UNK> she doesn't have a lot to do but she is <UNK> beautiful even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door it makes me sad that there can be people such as paris hilton kim <UNK> in the world w no <UNK> skills or talent to have more fame and success than this talented beauty i didn't care for much of this film because the script isn't very good but am glad i got to see some new talent i hope that producers directors think about <UNK> when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film if they can make <UNK> fox a star c'mon she isn't that hot her acting talent is worse than made for disney channel tv shows from 1 film it should happen easily for her as she is gorgeous has talent i'd recommend her changing her last name so we can <UNK> it and make it more <UNK> here's hoping this makes her career if there is any justice she can pop up on some big summer movie or two in the next couple years
<START> i wanted to like this film i really did it's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat it tries too hard to be funny in some places the daughters over <UNK> cooking attempts over reaches in others the scene where they clean up someone's yard so he agrees to join the team and has some scenes that while mildly interesting are really just filler all the work <UNK> and i didn't find the <UNK> <UNK> or worth hating so much as i found them to be <UNK> annoying br br i've met people like those in the film while playing church ball and i will say the <UNK> are spot on still in the end i really didn't care all that much about the characters or their quest for church ball glory maybe because they were all so one dimensional which i might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall br br kurt hale and <UNK> entertainment has made some good films but this is not one of them
<START> this movie probably would only get a 7 or 8 from me to tell the truth if i had seen trailers or had any kind of knowledge of what the film is all about since it was virtually all a surprise it was almost a perfect piece of edgy entertainment that gets a strong 9 from me br br i read through some of the comments briefly and saw that someone else had almost the same experience as me and he advised to just watch it it was good advice read the rest at your own risk of spoiling br br eva <UNK> plays a head strong success <UNK> network tv <UNK> that took a joke made by a co worker while brain <UNK> tv program ideas about russian <UNK> seriously the story follows her in a documentary style on her pursuit to make this happen
<START> this film is a portrait of the half <UNK> teenage boy benjamin who has to visit a <UNK> school because of his lousy marks in <UNK> he didn't make the best experiences in life before and got serious self <UNK> issues after a rough start at his new school he starts making friends falls in love with a girl and does some american <UNK> teenage stuff br br beside some comedy elements the film is told in a very serious way <UNK> on benjamin and his problems br br if you already don't like this story outline save your time and watch something else if you do please be aware of the following br br 1 benjamin is a total loser whatever he does he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self pity all the time for me he wasn't that kind of charming loser who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind i could barely stand watching br br 2 the film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just aren't except for <UNK> maybe and yes i know this film is based on an auto biography written by a 17 year old but having some experiences with german schools and german youth myself i don't believe him br br 3 showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject but i doubt that teenage boys do an <UNK> on the cookie contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his <UNK> during mass masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the <UNK> wet cookie afterwards although it kinda amused me in a <UNK> way it's nor funny neither <UNK> the serious attempts of this film br br 4 there's a sub plot about <UNK> family and his father <UNK> his wife still i don't know why it's there and where to put it it just bored me br br well i personally hated this film for having the character of benjamin being without a message concept scheme whatever and it's failing attempts to be dramatic and serious however i can image that some people may find it sensible and touching if you liked the other sister you'll probably like this one too i hated both br br 17 year old boys shouldn't write an autobiography and if they do it doesn't seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it br br 2 out of 10
<START> everyone has already commented on the cinematography good to great the personalities larger than life the structure <UNK> with many references to surf culture through time what is missed is a bigger question of <UNK> importance <UNK> mainstream american culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding br br i was a <UNK> in the 1970s we used to watch <UNK> films at the local high schools in <UNK> i remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin <UNK> heat putting on a <UNK> shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night often the narrator was the filmmaker himself reading a script off sheets of paper sometimes a surf band or <UNK> punk band would add music i was never happier except for the <UNK> and <UNK> seeing <UNK> <UNK> took me back in time br br it also <UNK> a feeling that living life on the edge not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder not keeping up with the <UNK> pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and <UNK> may be the answer to the question what is the purpose of life at least for those like greg <UNK> <UNK> hamilton and the like they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue to live life solely on our own terms maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams br br it was this message that really impressed me
<START> elvira mistress of the dark is one of my <UNK> movies it has every thing you would want in a film like great one liners sexy star and a outrageous story if you have not seen it you are missing out on one of the greatest films made i can't wait till her new movie comes out
<START> fred <UNK> al lewis sid <UNK> and <UNK> de <UNK> star in this funny funny movie the late fred <UNK> is truly wonderful as herman <UNK> who lives with grandpa <UNK> al lewis wife lily <UNK> de <UNK> and his son and daughter sid <UNK> is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the <UNK> family when the wax figures of herman and grandpa begin to <UNK> the town everyone blames the two the two now have to clear their names before it's too late you'll laugh out loud just like i did
<START> in the hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch who when they came to town <UNK> pretty hardy after all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before <UNK> got to all parts of the usa br br the <UNK> who worked for trail boss <UNK> favor as played by eric <UNK> were no different but <UNK> was a man of all business he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it br br with the long run of <UNK> and the fact that the <UNK> stayed with it for the most part we got to know all the <UNK> at some point a some point story lines were focused around all of them though the bulk were with <UNK> and clint eastwood's character <UNK> <UNK> the number 2 guy with the herd br br clint eastwood's western image was <UNK> by <UNK> it's a shame that these are not shown more often probably because they were done in black and white had this been an nbc show this would have been done in color like bonanza and be running as often as those shows are we'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend br br ironically enough it was eric <UNK> who left the show before it closed to do films he did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a <UNK> movie name sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film drowned in a river had he lived he might have become a name like eastwood's br br clint took over as trail boss in the last season and then the show completed its run and he of course became the icon he is today and not just in the western genre br br <UNK> was a tough western who had some tough guys in it no <UNK> in this one these were working <UNK> just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year br br they really don't make television series like these any more what a pity
<START> this was a fantastic episode i saw a clip from it on youtube and i <UNK> that should it ever show on tv i would <UNK> myself to the set in order to watch i wound up watching it with a friend of mine who happens to be gay and the two of us cried at the end this was a truly well written heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two cops who i felt really were in <UNK> words the lucky ones it is episodes like this one that really make cold case one of the most captivating and much loved works of television magic on cbs i <UNK> <UNK> more episodes and a re run of forever blue because i will always watch it again and again
<START> ah the sex and gore movie it's too bad they don't make these anymore unless you live in japan but if they all turned out like this that is not a bad thing br br the movie basically consists of the two lovely vampires picking up <UNK> along a country road taking them home to their castle having crazy sex with them and then eating them except the first victim who they keep around for no particular reason things are complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women she keeps seeing it gets real ugly from here by the end the two <UNK> are in such a <UNK> that they're eating everything in sight and manage to let their captive victim escape <UNK> so much for that secret existence br br the fact that the two <UNK> don't mind taking their clothes off and <UNK> around with each other is the only thing this movie has going for it otherwise it's a bloody confusing mess why is their tomb so far away from their castle watchable only for the <UNK> few minutes of <UNK> <UNK> the only thing i got out of this movie was these two valuable bits of advice shooting lesbians will not kill them it will only turn them into vampires and don't pick up <UNK> along a country road they are probably vampires other than that it really wasn't worth my time
<START> watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories i'm <UNK> now have not seen it since i was 12 14 i had almost forgotten about this movie but when i watched it again recently some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye that little robot <UNK> friends for ever it was just like <UNK> my childhood it was an absolutely amazing experience for me i will always <UNK> this movie for that reason i hope some of you readers can relate to my experience not for this particular movie but any movie you have not seen in a long while very nostalgic br br thanks for reading
<START> just saw ice age a very funny and especially nice looking film the story is simple but effective the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design br br more inspired by traditional animated movies than reality the designs give you a really really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour sometimes the touches of reality shine through especially the water was impressive but nonetheless it's a fantasy world based on reality including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to <UNK> the costs of rendering br br pixar films shine with technical brilliance this one shines with effective uses of technical know how br br enough technical <UNK> the film's entertaining family friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny
<START> <UNK> <UNK> a small town lawyer travels to the nearby big city on business connected with the death of his friend johnny yes <UNK> is a man despite the feminine sounding christian name were the <UNK> trying to make a <UNK> reference to the fact that john wayne's birth name was marion <UNK> at first believes <UNK> death to have been an accident but soon realises that johnny was murdered further <UNK> reveal a web of corruption <UNK> and election <UNK> connected to boss cameron the leading light in city 's political machine br br that sounds like the plot of a gritty crime thriller possibly made in the film noir style which was starting to become popular in 1941 it isn't a man betrayed despite its theme is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama <UNK> falls in love with <UNK> attractive daughter <UNK> and the film then concentrates as much on their resulting romance as on the suspense elements br br this film might just have worked if it had been made as a straightforward serious drama one reviewer states that john wayne is not at all believable as a lawyer but he couldn't play a cowboy in every movie and a tough <UNK> lawyer taking on the forces of <UNK> crime would probably have been well within his <UNK> where i do agree with that reviewer is when he says that wayne was no cary grant <UNK> romantic comedy just wasn't up his street one of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors could be required to play any part their bosses <UNK> of them regardless of whether it was up their street or not and as wayne was one of the few major stars working for republic pictures they <UNK> wanted to get as much <UNK> out of him as they could br br that said not even cary grant himself could have made a man betrayed work as a comedy that's not a reflection on his comic talents it's a reflection on the total lack of amusing material in this film i doubt if anyone no matter how well developed their sense of humour might be could find anything to laugh at in it the film's light hearted tone doesn't make it a successful comedy it just <UNK> it from being taken seriously as anything else this is one of those films that are neither fish nor flesh nor <UNK> nor good red <UNK> 3 10
<START> in a famous <UNK> he wrote about charles dickens george <UNK> points out that many readers always <UNK> that dickens never continued writing like he did in <UNK> papers that is he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career this would not have been too difficult for dickens his contemporary robert <UNK> did precisely that only <UNK> on the <UNK> of the fox hunting set mr fancy <UNK> <UNK> is a title of one of his novels among hunters and horse lovers <UNK> still has a following but most people find his novels <UNK> dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man and don't forget his first book sketches by <UNK> was also a funny book so dickens third book is oliver twist which got pretty grim at points <UNK> says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books dickens would definitely and successfully have agreed to that br br but <UNK> overlooked the genre writer who <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> as i said is a genre writer <UNK> on hunting but not everyone is interested in hunting but p g <UNK> saw himself as an entertainer <UNK> fun at the upper reaches of the british social system his earl of <UNK> is <UNK> of raising the finest pig in england than being well earl of <UNK> his <UNK> is always prepared to <UNK> when he is supposed to be <UNK> to an unfair superior his stanley <UNK> will always have a perfect scheme that should net a huge profit but always manages to come apart at the end and best of all his <UNK> will always put his brilliant brain to work <UNK> the inept <UNK> <UNK> his boss since <UNK> had a limited view of his mission as a writer he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world his books never lost their glow they served and still serve their purposes in fact compared <UNK> with his far more serious contemporary evelyn <UNK> who also wrote funny books but of a more intellectual type the best of <UNK> remains among the high points of 20th century british literature <UNK> <UNK> decline and fall and the rest but in his determination to make his points if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently <UNK> for every vile bodies there was some failure late in his career like the ordeal of gilbert <UNK> while <UNK> could do lesser hack work too his falling did not go as far as <UNK> did br br <UNK> also was a gifted <UNK> when you hear bill in the score of <UNK> it is not <UNK> and <UNK> tune but <UNK> and <UNK> tune <UNK> from oh lady lady a dozen years earlier he was a handy <UNK> too so it is pleasing to see that he took his novel a damsel in distress and turned it into the screenplay here br br it has the normal <UNK> touches that perfect butler <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a wonderful performance is a <UNK> in <UNK> a friendly gambling game of chance among the staff of the <UNK> home he heads he is also unable to <UNK> occasionally from singing italian opera despite <UNK> <UNK> attempts to control his <UNK> this is typical <UNK> characterization so is the way the love affair between lady <UNK> and jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of <UNK> and young albert both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash <UNK> always does that type of plot switch with <UNK> switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest br br <UNK> was also lucky here to have burns and allan to work with it is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together such as six of a kind and we're not dressing george and <UNK> did their best support with fred astaire the fun house sequence which includes the song stiff upper lip is wonderful as is an earlier sequence where the three do a <UNK> <UNK> dance that astaire learned from burns but <UNK> marvelous illogical logic is used by <UNK> in scenes with <UNK> see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be only albert happens to notice <UNK> <UNK> mistake and looks at <UNK> as though he's either stupid or mad her dialog with lady caroline <UNK> 's son <UNK> ray noble the british band leader leading him to imagine that he will marry her but saying goodbye to <UNK> as she drives off with george to get married is wonderful too br br the film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of ginger rogers in it and the weakness of joan fontaine fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role but the flaw is really <UNK> he didn't make the character very interesting but the film can stand without that given the other performers and their characters <UNK> music and <UNK> marvelous sense of fun
<START> jesse and celine ethan hawke and julie <UNK> are two strangers on a european train the two come from widely different backgrounds he's american and she's french after they talk a bit on the train jesse manages to get celine to get off the train and explore vienna with him during the next several hours the two wander vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become <UNK> <UNK> with each other but will this <UNK> relationship last past sunrise br br this wonderful romantic comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline written and directed by richard <UNK> and confused <UNK> before sunrise never <UNK> because of its' small cast in fact it <UNK> due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans
<START> i think i watched this movie but don't quote me as i may have fallen asleep during watching it as it didn't exactly grip my excitement and imagination at least i know i watched enough of it to know i won't be watching it again soon or ever br br <UNK> talk about lame really lame totally lame it wouldn't even appeal to a six year old it basically had no worthwhile dramatic impact <UNK> <UNK> just <UNK> turned into dreck comedy that was supposed to be comedy ya <UNK> fooled me <UNK> <UNK> br br now if the aliens had been <UNK> <UNK> like in the movie <UNK> we could have had the human characters do something a little more profound than be overly <UNK> <UNK> like yelling and screaming and running for their lives so they wouldn't be eaten so the story could be something more exciting than watching paint dry br br don't bother watching this it's not worth the effort you can find something more interesting to do like watching paint dry or falling asleep
<START> as a member of the cast i was a member of the band at all the basketball games i would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in <UNK> this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of <UNK> where it was shot seems that the u of o sign was shown while we were shooting we were allowed to eat several <UNK> with the cast and production staff mr nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill mannered men i have ever met quite a time for a young 20 year old but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60's and early 70's despite what hollywood may think <UNK> player from <UNK>
<START> all i can really say is that i'm glad that i was <UNK> <UNK> while watching the movie or i would be very angry for having wasted 2 hours of my life the acting was terrible the plot was even worse there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of mst3k
<START> <UNK> is an x con that five years ago got married to marie their marriage has been stable until <UNK> past catch up with them and he's offered to do a <UNK> job <UNK> job is a heroin delivery from germany to sweden which should go easily br br in germany <UNK> meet <UNK> a girl from <UNK> that has been sold to a <UNK> owner <UNK> <UNK> what he sees and decide to help <UNK> out of her misery due to the fact that <UNK> father during the war <UNK> to sweden <UNK> now goes with <UNK> to sweden to make up with the past <UNK> promises <UNK> to help her find her father no matter what it takes finally back in sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than <UNK> ever thought of br br this movie doesn't seem to fit in the ordinary class of swedish movies due to the fact that it's been <UNK> alot <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> makes it all average the effects makes the movie a little too much though see it and <UNK> for yourself br br
<START> when a comedy movie boasts its marvelous soundtrack on the back cover you know your not dealing with a top notch movie i rented this movie with friends expecting to get some chuckles but overall to get most of our laughs off each other making fun of the movie we couldn't have chosen a worse movie br br the movie may have been alright with a few changes first off the comedy was painful physical gags were poorly performed and placed the fat kid in the movie made us want to kill ourselves bless him for trying scene in and scene out but he was like a puppy begging for love if he had been pulled from the movie everything might have been bearable there were some funny jokes i believe one was when the group of boys steal one of the <UNK> porn movies and it turns out to be gay porn but to best sum up the comedy i will simply tell the opening gag for the fat kid he wears a <UNK> <UNK> shirt and talks about not knowing when something is done br br to finish off the editor of the movie could have saved the movie by <UNK> the fat kid cutting out 20 minutes of the school scenes and making an ending that is longer than thirty seconds of random <UNK> br br oh btw there are two good elements that the movie possesses <UNK> <UNK> plays his role wonderfully and performs his jokes so that none are missed or under appreciated the other redeeming element to the movie is the beautiful mrs ali <UNK> her character is ignored most of the movie which is a shame br br don't waste your time even renting this one it didn't appeal to me and i was part of the target audience 18 male
<START> what does the executive producer do in a movie if i remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major hollywood player it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story screenplay not being up to scratch br br <UNK> follows the saga of one sunny davis a <UNK> <UNK> cocktail waitress who saves a visiting <UNK> and as a reward gets made a top <UNK> likely as things progress ms davis who has problems being able to string two sentences together finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations when i say that <UNK> stars goldie hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what i'm saying about the story screenplay not being up to scratch exactly
<START> <UNK> tank police is without a shell of a doubt one of the most amazing shows ever produced but not just in the field of animation while the first part acts 1 and 2 mostly consists of action and fun the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the <UNK> of the second part acts 3 and 4 i do have some complaints though in the first part the tank <UNK> quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all one might also question the <UNK> of <UNK> jumping on the wing of helicopter <UNK> even though it was cool <UNK> rules
<START> this is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine the fire on and with your feet up it doesn't require that much brain power to follow so is very good after a long day i would say it is very unrealistic if you expecting anything serious then don't bother but it is very funny just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a <UNK> for a while and then actually get to enjoy it i would definitely recommend it
<START> the master <UNK> based off of sir arthur conan <UNK> short story the adventure of charles <UNK> <UNK> is the first feature length sherlock holmes story with jeremy brett that i have seen the story is interesting and dark the film has a somewhat dreary sad feel to it but it is quite entertaining with some especially funny scenes br br spoilers sherlock holmes and dr watson attempt to <UNK> the identity of an <UNK> <UNK> who has been ruining some of the most prominent families of england by <UNK> private letters that will in one way or another destroy their lives they eventually find out that he is charles <UNK> <UNK> an art dealer after the few tragic consequences for victims that could not pay up our heroes must next help lady eva <UNK> who must pay a sum that is beyond her means or else her upcoming marriage will most definitely be called off the scene in which holmes and watson <UNK> <UNK> house are intense although the film has an essentially happy ending the tone is sad and <UNK> br br outstanding performances by jeremy brett and edward <UNK> as usual and robert hardy as the notorious villain most audiences probably recognize him today as <UNK> <UNK> in harry potter <UNK> gordon as lady eva <UNK> norma west as lady <UNK> and sophie <UNK> as agatha the scenes involving her and holmes are a riot i give it a 1 2 out my only complaint is that there wasn't enough inspector <UNK> i wish they would have added in the scene at the end of the short story where he gives the description of the two <UNK> one of which matches watson
<START> the effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is so mannered that i have to assume that that was the desired intent the sets are artificial and at no time did i not feel that i was watching a movie it seemed like the actors were just reading their lines rather than <UNK> to one another while the film has elements of early film noir except that it is in color the approach is so exaggerated that i almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre br br given that the presentation had no appeal to me i was at least expecting an engaging story usually i am pretty slow on the <UNK> when it comes to stories with plot twists but you could see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes by the time of the gee i forgot the 80 000 moment i thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous for a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling <UNK> to behave so <UNK> is beyond belief if at any stage she had <UNK> like a normal intelligent person the whole story would have fallen apart br br this wooden production left me cold
<START> <UNK> <UNK> yet <UNK> half realized character study an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates a talented but <UNK> star basketball player and a pot smoking <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> we never learn why these young men are friends they may share <UNK> about the world and their places in it but they don't seem to have anything else in common making his directorial debut jack nicholson who also co wrote the screenplay with jeremy <UNK> based upon <UNK> book doesn't introduce us to the characters with any clarity nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen there are some very decent performances here particularly from newcomer william <UNK> in the central role but most of the picture is <UNK> perhaps intentionally <UNK> or unsure bruce dern plays the hard driving basketball coach karen black is the older married lady <UNK> is having an affair with and michael <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> friend in an off putting over the top performance nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor <UNK> i assume to let the character interaction dominate the film's tone his script is no help either and as a result it is unclear whom we're supposed to sympathize with small random moments do work a supermarket fight between <UNK> and black dern visiting <UNK> in his <UNK> room all of the scenes set on the court however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess hoping to <UNK> an all important b ball game with a sexual assault nicholson shows no style at his craft nor does he earn points for <UNK> as his staging of these events is <UNK> and ugly when a director goes out of his way to <UNK> his actors one has to question his motives in doing so perhaps if drive he said ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his <UNK> in judgment and taste unfortunately the <UNK> closer is as <UNK> as much of the rest of the movie 1 2 from
<START> i last read a nancy drew book about 20 years ago so much of my memory of the fictional character is probably <UNK> from what i gathered the books were introduced to me at an era when teenage <UNK> were popular to children growing up at the time for my case the 80s and early 90s with hardy boys famous five and of course <UNK> <UNK> 's nancy drew amongst the more famous ones i still remember those <UNK> books with very dated cover <UNK> usually quite heavy for a kid to <UNK> around and the <UNK> of the book perhaps attributed to the fact that the words are <UNK> in large <UNK> br br well the character has been given some <UNK> along the way as i recall my sister's subsequent nancy drew books becoming less thick of <UNK> with updated and a more <UNK> nancy illustrated on the cover i can't remember if those stories were the same as the old <UNK> ones but i guess these books being <UNK> have their fair share of <UNK> itself for the times br br in this warner brothers release of nancy drew the character no doubt gets its update to suit the times but somehow the writers andrew <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her 50s ish small town sensibilities thereby <UNK> some charm and <UNK> that <UNK> folks like me would appreciate her fashion sense her <UNK> and <UNK> even some quirky little behaviour traits that makes her well nancy drew br br her family background remains more or less the same living with her single parent father carson drew <UNK> <UNK> who is moving his daughter and himself to the big city for a better job opportunity and to <UNK> his daughter off <UNK> in the town of river heights mom is but a distant memory and the <UNK> makes a cameo but what made nancy drew work is the casting of emma roberts in the lead role niece of her famous aunt julia she too possess that <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> red hair and that <UNK> smile her nancy drew while in the beginning does seem to rub you the wrong way actually will grow on you and in almost what i thought could be a <UNK> scene from pretty woman it had the characters walk into a classy shop with almost opposite reactions br br while dad carson drew tries hard to bring nancy out of her <UNK> environment and to <UNK> into normal teenage life trust nancy to find themselves living in a house whose owner a hollywood type has been was found murdered under suspicious circumstances mystery solving is her comfort food when she finds herself an <UNK> of the local <UNK> and not before long we're <UNK> off along with her on her big screen adventure br br there's nothing too black <UNK> about the crime and mystery and instead it's a pretty straightforward piece for nancy to solve in between <UNK> corky josh <UNK> a <UNK> friend from school and <UNK> jealous boyfriend ned max <UNK> while hiding the truth of her extra <UNK> activities from her dad the story's laced with cheesy fun and an <UNK> sentimentality which charms and together it becomes somewhat scooby doo like with minimal violence and no big bag <UNK> or explosions this is seriously a genre which is <UNK> clearly with chick flick alert br br i guess the movie will generate a new generation of fans <UNK> the memories of old ones and probably just probably might spark a new fashion trend of sporting penny <UNK>
<START> one of the most <UNK> and brutal films i've ever seen but also one of the most tragic and moving ones this is an action melodrama like the world has never seen it before sometimes the plot got me close to tears while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bone <UNK> blow to the guts chilling performance by edison <UNK> the story of a hk cop and a <UNK> killer hunting each other down while bit by bit losing their humanity is a strong one featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera work dog bite dog is pure hk bloodshed without the <UNK>
<START> i must confess that i was completely shocked by this film for one i went to see it on a <UNK> expecting something mediocre but given this the most shocking thing was that this was in a <UNK> american cinema at all this is british comedy at its finest dark quirky and funny in ways that american films just never are i must stop short however of <UNK> this <UNK> to anyone i went to see it with several people some english some european and some american and while some of us loved it mainly from the first two groups some hated it and found it worthless if you think you're into this kind of thing then go if not don't 10 10
<START> the emotional impact of this movie defies words it is elegant subtle beautiful and tragic all rolled into two hours this is will smith as he <UNK> into his acting ability the full range of it who knew i saw the pursuit of happiness and thought this must be a <UNK> for the blockbuster over the top actor smith his performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to smith a <UNK> of talent the <UNK> of scripts i'm not sure but i view him differently now seven pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief don't watch it for the plot watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart both literally and <UNK> it is a story of human guilt <UNK> love and sacrifice
<START> the second half of steven <UNK> revolutionary bio on che guevara deals with his last campaign to <UNK> revolution to bolivia in order to maintain his <UNK> <UNK> of che soderbergh conveniently leap <UNK> the mass <UNK> he <UNK> over after the revolution in cuba and the <UNK> of his <UNK> adventure this is the history of a failure he writes in the <UNK> of his <UNK> <UNK> to concentrate fully on che's attempt to <UNK> support to rise up against the government in bolivia it would turn out to be a disaster and <UNK> final act br br what plagued the first chapter follows suit here as soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> guevara once again being played like james dean in east of <UNK> by <UNK> del toro the problem is guevara has little success in gaining <UNK> and he soon finds himself and his starving <UNK> being <UNK> up in the heart of darkness <UNK> jungle unlike <UNK> <UNK> in the magnificent <UNK> the wrath of god soderbergh fails to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> possibilities to <UNK> the desperation of the <UNK> he seems more concerned with keeping che's <UNK> above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead <UNK> there is one <UNK> moment where che sits <UNK> an <UNK> horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall <UNK> <UNK> en scene remains flat sloppy and uninteresting br br in both of his films soderbergh shows he is clearly a che <UNK> and because of it his focus remains <UNK> and narrow he spends too much time building his <UNK> to che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga especially <UNK> castro making matters worse he does it with a slow and <UNK> approach that never catches fire one would think he was <UNK> in enough <UNK> and <UNK> to realize that sweeping change is <UNK> a lot better with sweeping style
<START> the reasons to watch this knock off <UNK> tribute to a great movie called <UNK> it's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on someone pays you to watch it br br do yourself a favor and pop in the dvd for <UNK> rent it <UNK> it on <UNK> or put it in your netflix cue and skip the flock entirely the flock the same story with with a few changes furthermore the editing just <UNK> of <UNK> and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times the worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots with sounds of people people <UNK> over the radio except there are no police <UNK> flying <UNK> in this one br br bottom line i call it a blatant knock off if you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film go ahead but either way go watch <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> toby malone family know he is a talented <UNK> and are pleased when he <UNK> an audition to join a big club they hope that when he arrives in the city his cousin will look after him br br but the cousins are like <UNK> and cheese one a naive farm boy the other a <UNK> <UNK> who has managed to get mixed up with drug dealers and gangsters <UNK> is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day br br having missed his cousin george <UNK> robertson on arrival in the city <UNK> encounters further trouble when a young biker takes him for a ride in more ways than one br br toby malone probably better known for his work in theatre puts in a commendable performance as the <UNK> teenager there are <UNK> signs of a low budget but as with so many other low budget movies there's more fun seemingly more <UNK> and more charm than there is to be seen in the average hollywood blockbuster
<START> this film is overblown predictable pretentious and hollow to its core the settings are faithful to the era but self conscious in their <UNK> by prolonged exposure the lingering over <UNK> stops the action and <UNK> almost as much as the empty dialogue tom hanks seems to be <UNK> much as bruce willis did in <UNK> war tom you can't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank the content did not warrant the <UNK> acting by paul newman this is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb <UNK>
<START> there are lots of extremely good looking people in this movie that's probably the best thing about it perhaps that even makes it worth watching br br loaded tells the story of <UNK> price jesse <UNK> a young man who's about to make his mark on the world he's the son of a well to do family with a good reputation and he's on his way to law school but like so many such settings things aren't quite as perfect as they appear the expectations in this family far <UNK> the love except for school <UNK> father rarely lets him leave the house this seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that <UNK> the family which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn't spelled out until the very end <UNK> claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his <UNK> the celebration soon follows some <UNK> back to a beach house party and from there <UNK> befriends sebastian cole corey large who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld br br while technically well made this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn't very engaging also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out of place such as slow motion fast motion freeze frames and <UNK> these are the types of effects a director might normally <UNK> to show a character's perspective while on drugs except in this case they seem to have been <UNK> tossed in at random points in some cheap attempt at style br br despite its cast of relative <UNK> performances were good all around most notably with respect to the main antagonist corey large i suspect we'll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future br br of course when mentioning the actors i must mention their looks rating based on <UNK> this movies scores an 11 the women in this movie are incredible looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you're watching i'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on that br br overall i can't recommend this movie not for buying renting or even seeing for free it's unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through
<START> this is not as funny and gory as the dvd box claims i really love twisted and <UNK> movies but this one is really just dull it's one hour of ripped off <UNK> flying baby born dolls and a lot of rape i think the intention with this amateur sleaze was to make a it's so bad it's good movies but it fails it's just bad a few scenes are ok but in whole it's a mess if you like amateur splatter like this one only way better i would recommend <UNK> <UNK> violent <UNK> 2 and 3
<START> beyond the excellent direction production acting the predictable drama lies an essential message in the script br br listening leads all the way in order for the voice to <UNK> listen to <UNK> with other in voice listen in order to approach yourself listen to discover the needs of any situation or others listen it appears that the script writers are conveying a life's secret listening leads to an awareness of one's self it <UNK> the other senses especially vision <UNK> the horizon one's soul too can be discovered the artistry of this movie as it is in heaven <UNK> displayed the unfolding of life not only its joy sadness but ultimately the hope of life all this by the leading character's first <UNK> to the choir br br just listen it leads all the way
<START> full moon high 1981 3 of 5 <UNK> larry cohen stars adam arkin ed <UNK> <UNK> kelly br br tony arkin is your average ordinary high school guy <UNK> for the big <UNK> game girlfriend trouble and growing hair in strange <UNK> know the usual but the hair in strange places part gets a wee bit out of control when a trip to <UNK> with his father yes <UNK> leaves him with a wicked case of the <UNK> now doomed to walk the world forever young as a werewolf how will adam get any girls br br <UNK> moon <UNK> is not often talked about but it is a silly and entertaining horror spoof larry cohen q the <UNK> <UNK> the stuff <UNK> as many gags as he can possibly come up with as writer director arkin <UNK> halloween 20 years later shows nice timing in the lead role if you happen to be a fan of spoofs like <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i think you'll have fun with this chuckle fest
<START> so it starts with a beautiful old house in the country you have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and not surprisingly the <UNK> always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason <UNK> the people laugh joke etc this dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids they get scared they start to feel stuff oh no a girl <UNK> s ghost some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc this girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls yeah yeah blah blah she does but oh no she dies as she does and goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell two people survive and escape the house the script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and <UNK> the one who dies saving the kids says oh no the acting is wooden the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss i was extremely disappointed when i watched this a very big let down my sister who gets sacred very easily got bored in this film it is appalling
<START> i am a huge adam sandler fan and one day i was looking at the cast crew selection on one of his dvd's and saw <UNK> <UNK> and decided to go out and rent it so i went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it we put it on and we were shocked to see an adam sandler that didn't hit <UNK> yet he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out i couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap i didn't laugh chuckle or even <UNK> at this movie actually the only time i <UNK> was when i saw how horrid this movie was i could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie and it didn't work once although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script i realized why i had never heard of this movie because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before this movie in my opinion was the worst movie ever made ever
<START> i have seen the movie at the <UNK> a few years ago where the audiences liked it i liked it as well summer phoenix performance still <UNK> me <UNK> why i decided to write a comment br br the story unfolds in london around <UNK> where a jewish girl decides to become an actress she tries desperately to become one but it <UNK> before a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage that she has talent and that she <UNK> with the audience and emerges as a stronger human being br br there were certain reviews were her performance was <UNK> they accused her of being dull not able to bring life to her character i think <UNK> her strong point <UNK> exactly what esther <UNK> should be and phoenix makes a brave decision to make her esther a rather boring girl so her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise br br the cinematography is great the images of london around the turn of the century are very dark and sad you can see how unpleasant life was back then br br the only fault in my opinion is the length of the movie you loose touch with the characters after all it´s only about finding the actor in yourself so there are no dramatic actions in the film it´s phoenix credit that we <UNK> loose the interest in the movie after the first hour
<START> i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian <UNK> but i found this show to be not funny at all the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it's getting talked about i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason they are usually true but there really wasn't anything funny about these stereotypical characters the fresh of the boat dad who doesn't understand his daughter the radical feminist muslim daughter who by the way is a terrible actress and the young modern indian man trying to run his <UNK> as politically correct as he can he's a pretty good actor i only see him getting better br br it is very contrived and the dialog doesn't flow that well there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed and don't really care to watch another episode br br i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again she's always a treat and a natural at everything she does too bad her daughter in the show doesn't have the same acting abilities
<START> this is a beautiful movie filled with adventure the <UNK> in the bottle is a classic scene romantic in it's finish all things turn out as they should be i saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy i wished was true
<START> having enjoyed <UNK> complex novel so <UNK> i was prepared to be disappointed by joseph <UNK> and fred <UNK> screenplay given the fabulous complexity of the original text however the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone <UNK> and <UNK> of the book br br it certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film i imagine the latter would seem disjointed with very odd episodes apparently randomly <UNK> together without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot br br it's amazing to see how filthy the film is given that it was shot in <UNK> in 1967 the irish film censors only finally <UNK> it for viewing by general audiences in ireland as late as 2000 it was shown to <UNK> audiences in a private cinema club the irish film theatre in the late 1970s <UNK> <UNK> is not simply <UNK> and raunchy it offers many wildly perverse episodes never mind that so many of these <UNK> were <UNK> when the book was published in <UNK> they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967 br br it is astonishing and <UNK> to watch the cream of the irish acting profession of the 1960s respected players all daring to utter and <UNK> <UNK> hugely <UNK> text with such gusto br br bravo
<START> not a film to be taken seriously but a great little film nonetheless br br it's definitely not just a piece of fluff the acting imo is excellent br br one of those films you wouldn't go out of your way to see but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable like an old friend br br definitely worth seeing if you get the chance br br
<START> i truly enjoyed the movie however i did not realize that little richard had so many things going on in his life first of all i was not aware of lucille there is very little hardly any mention of females being <UNK> involved with little richard even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way i wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned overall the movie was great i also did not like leon playing the part of little richard he is a good actor but i feel that the part of should have went to a different actor visually he did not remind me of little richard i also was totally unaware of the <UNK> that little richard was a part of from the movie he was <UNK> as a sexual addict in todays time he would be referred to <UNK> for his sexual addition he was a <UNK> i don't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that i feel should not have been a part of the final cut
<START> why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others replace <UNK> with the civil war and the apollo moon landing with the titanic sinking and you've got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low life trash is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to <UNK> and who failed grade school composition do i'll show those old <UNK> i'll put out my own movie and prove that you don't have to know <UNK> about your topic to still make money yeah we already know that the one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into <UNK> thinking the next time i see a slut in a bar who looks like diane lane i'm running the other way it's child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids it's audience abuse to simply stick <UNK> and the <UNK> into a flick as if that <UNK> <UNK> means the film portrays 1969
<START> i never much liked the myra movie tho i appreciate how it pushed the hollywood <UNK> at the time certainly miss <UNK> costume became an iconic image though i have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about br br i <UNK> myra on <UNK> a couple of years ago and didn't think it had aged any better thru the years there's a segment about it in the <UNK> cinema cartoon history comic books where it's given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production however imho the movie is too bitter to be charming too silly to be a turn on and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform engage or entertain
<START> i've seen a movie thats sort of like this were a <UNK> drugs woman and he then picks there nose with a knife and rips there nose to <UNK> he then <UNK> there tongue and eats it br br the most gruesome part of the movie is were he cuts there left eye out and starts dancing with it he then starts to eat the woman naked br br i'm not sure what the movies called but i know it's a cult movie and that it was made in germany br br anyway the nose <UNK> is fairly crap br br its a crap movie and the picture and volume quality is very rubbish br br please don't waste you're time buying and watching this movie its totally crap br br i prefer day of the woman also known as i spit on your grave its one of the best cult movies ever check out this link http www imdb com title <UNK>
<START> the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father <UNK> and a bunch of nuns christopher lee who has since said that he was <UNK> in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved is father <UNK> and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine the cast are not too bad though most have now retired from acting the film has terrible sound effects mainly created from <UNK> keys on an old computer it seems and it ridiculously <UNK> at times showing a scene of the sky for instance for what feels like hours at a time despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world is doomed sort of way and the production is adequate interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie <UNK> band writer frank ray <UNK> and charles <UNK> assistant <UNK> burton despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it
<START> i loved this movie i totally disagree with some negative <UNK> that i've read over the years this was a great vehicle for eddie murphy he appeared to have a great time with his part as chandler <UNK> and he should never care about what the critics say if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it and it was fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with mr murphy's great comedic style you have to keep in mind that <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the <UNK> world during the time this film was released i was working in a video rental store this was one of the most popular with all our customers every single time we put this one up on our <UNK> all the copies we had went out fast with wait list <UNK> that kept it on the <UNK> for months everyone who rented it loved it i was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and i knew the taste of my customers so i highly recommended this one to most of them i really feel that this film is a sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later yes i did buy this film for my own video library i <UNK> the little boy who played the <UNK> <UNK>  j l <UNK> but after looking at his profile in imdb i noticed that he never did any more films that is sad because he definitely had an on screen aura and could have continued with a film career i also <UNK> victor wong who played the old man i loved him in his part as <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> trouble in little <UNK> 1986 at any rate this was a great film the only <UNK> that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more <UNK> in nature  such as <UNK> rather sexual remarks about the <UNK> lady that was presented to him as a <UNK> it was funny but it still was out of sync ok so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mind set of the day perhaps this was still an adventurous and <UNK> type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from hollywood now that's entertainment
<START> <UNK> criminal <UNK> ross <UNK> has been sentenced to death and <UNK> execution on a spaceship designed for just such a purpose but tonight there's going to be a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> on a conveniently placed escape <UNK> and flies towards earth which apparently is nearby there he confronts a group of teenagers who look thirty and a game warden john phillip law who help protect him from his worst nightmare the bounty hunter and <UNK> <UNK> or more properly <UNK> the <UNK> br br from the cover of the box i was confident this was going to be an awful movie but as awful as it turned out to be it was a ton of fun as well probably at least partially because i was watching it with someone who happens to be intensely awesome the director fred <UNK> ray who has <UNK> in making over one hundred low grade films most notably hollywood chainsaw <UNK> does what he does best and throws together a plot that only half makes sense and gives us <UNK> special effects bonus p j soles appears as tara obviously at a low point in her career br br sure there's plot holes why are there <UNK> <UNK> in california allegedly los angeles county if i understood the warden correctly what's up with the space woman's tacky <UNK> why is there a subplot about the ship captain <UNK> trying to win her heart when this story goes nowhere what the heck is <UNK> 5 how does chicken wire create an <UNK> field that will short circuit an <UNK> yet land mines do virtually nothing why does <UNK> look like a drunk native american football player with <UNK> and the <UNK> guy robert clarke does his character even have a point does the game he plays with the captain have a point does this movie have a point but the biggest mystery is the <UNK> or <UNK> the <UNK> played by <UNK> clive what is an <UNK> why does it look like <UNK> hannah from blade runner only much larger because see if something is a cyborg it's part human but if it's an <UNK> it's all machine this was an <UNK> so there was no reason to make it look human it could have looked like anything yet the person who designed her made her the size of a <UNK> with david <UNK> hair and a <UNK> that shows me just a little too much if you're going to make a female <UNK> wouldn't the purpose be to have her be seductive and lure enemies in mission not accomplished they say beauty comes in all <UNK> and <UNK> but i think i found a huge exception br br if mystery science theater 3000 were still around today this film would be on a very short list of movies that need to get <UNK> br br beyond the butt nasty <UNK> sorry <UNK> female weight <UNK> are gross the film is alright maybe there's not much of a story and maybe the characters aren't really very interesting and maybe the scene with the deer is incredibly adorable for no particular reason what use does a killer robot have with a deer but overall i actually liked the movie i won't be <UNK> it out to my friends or running out to my local video store to pick up the latest dvd copy which i'm sure is just packed with amazing special features not but i consider seeing this movie time well spent and look forward to similar adventures in the future
<START> spoiler alert well i think this movie is probably the worst film ever made probably in the style of ed wood without the heart the lightning is terrible the music is very bad piano and <UNK> come on the acting is well there is no acting br br there's a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger br br the killer is a fat <UNK> clown who couldn't <UNK> a turtle br br every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clichés of slashers movies in the film without effort br br the end is so far the most stupid ever made think about it the guy ken <UNK> who's acting skill is about the same as his writing he's the brain behind this flop invite a co worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week end and kills them on monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen br br the tragedy is that mr <UNK> try to make us <UNK> that it's a family affair that goes on for generation his uncle is the clown killer br br so of course no cops are gonna question him after his co worker goes missing br br whatever br br
<START> after tracking it down for half a year i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing br br not disappointing because i'm one of those die hard <UNK> fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of <UNK> but i couldn't believe <UNK> was forced to make a movie as such in his respectable self now i'm sure he <UNK> that he made this movie nevertheless they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed ill at ease and half depressed most of the time br br man i still can't believe he made this movie i had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie <UNK> br br but i'm glad to have watched it thank goodness he has grown up
<START> being an <UNK> myself this has been a straight knock in my face fortunately i don't live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of <UNK> hates about <UNK> people or people close to that region and it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention to let your head sink into your hands and say oh my god how can that be possible no not with me the in my opinion totally exaggerated <UNK> <UNK> club scene is not necessary i watch porn sure but in this context i was rather disgusted than put in the right context br br this movie tells a story about how <UNK> people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of <UNK> and boring <UNK> a girl who is treated like a whore by her super jealous boyfriend and still keeps coming back a female teacher who discovers her <UNK> by putting the life of her super cruel lover on the line an old couple who has an almost <UNK> daily cycle she is the official replacement of his ex wife a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her <UNK> and finally a crazy <UNK> who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super annoying br br after having seen it you feel almost nothing you're not even shocked sad depressed or feel like doing anything maybe that's why i gave it 7 points it made me react in a way i never <UNK> before if that's good or bad is up to you
<START> boy this was one lousy movie while i haven't seen all of the burton taylor <UNK> i can say with confidence that this is the worst this rich but ill woman taylor of course owns this beautiful island in the <UNK> <UNK> over a put upon staff when she's suddenly visited by this traveling poet who mouths <UNK> in fact the whole film is just a talk fest with much of the talk making no sense even in 1968 no one could make heads or <UNK> of this pretentious nonsense and the passage of time makes that even more clear if it weren't for the beautiful cinematography and scenery it would deserve a negative rating the only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars
<START> in the immortal shaun of the dead we are introduced to a london where the <UNK> and the high and mighty alike are forced to battle flesh eating <UNK> corpse versions of their friends and family at the end of the film it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap <UNK> fido presents us with an <UNK> to shaun set in 1950's america in a hilariously witty and original what if movie br br the film is set post zombie apocalypse for a change after the <UNK> of the zombie wars ended by the creation of the <UNK> company and their <UNK> zombie <UNK> which make the corpses as <UNK> as <UNK> every town in the world is <UNK> off from the wild zone the once <UNK> landscape torn <UNK> by the surviving zombies and left overs from the apocalyptic wars the <UNK> town of <UNK> is your typical <UNK> 50's <UNK> with one small difference social status is <UNK> by a family's amount of <UNK> zombies unfortunately the robinson family has no zombies whatsoever due to their <UNK> <UNK> fear of the <UNK> dead timmy robinson and his mother helen both suffer from the <UNK> of suburban life until the day that helen <UNK> a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the <UNK> br br the zombie earns <UNK> love when he <UNK> him from a pair of violent bullies and the two form a bond to rival the classic boy and his dog cliché a boy and his zombie timmy names his pet fido and he soon becomes an aid for both timmy and helen to escape the prison like routine bill has put them in but when <UNK> <UNK> collar goes on the fritz and he <UNK> the elderly mrs henderson the <UNK> have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie <UNK> and still manage to keep their beloved fido br br a film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all star cast including the matrix 's carrie anne moss as helen robinson and billy <UNK> as fido fido is a <UNK> com for the ages with some rather twisted subplots for example the sweet and unsettling feelings that helen and fido begin to have for each other and a poignant commentary on 50's <UNK> and the zombie genre the film manages to bring out the worst and the best in its characters while still <UNK> you to care for them br br fido is by far one of the best dark comedies i've ever seen one of the best films that i've seen in a long time and the best <UNK> com since the incredible shaun of the dead
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br james <UNK> wesley snipes is hiding out on his ranch in montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist then he's approached by the agency again to travel to london to have another go his target has been <UNK> there and is under heavy police protection but they don't want him merely to capture their man they want him taken out all goes well but then the mission gets <UNK> and when a senior police chief <UNK> charles dance is killed the blame falls at <UNK> feet hunted like an animal he takes <UNK> in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named emily <UNK> bennett who's dealing with issues of her own and becomes his <UNK> sidekick as he goes about <UNK> his name and working out who betrayed him br br this latest snipes straight to dvd <UNK> came out of nowhere with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time i don't recall seeing any <UNK> or trailers for it anywhere with this in mind and after <UNK> history of duff dvd efforts this might have seemed like one which <UNK> <UNK> would tell you to drop like it's hot but i felt compelled to give it a go anyway it doesn't rank among his worst but it doesn't reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones the <UNK> 7 seconds says it all really either br br this is at best mildly suspenseful with a minimal of action <UNK> all in the way of cool dialogue and snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role likewise in a main supporting role it's quite clear dance has only showed up for the pay <UNK> as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their <UNK> br br it says a lot that by the end the only <UNK> that's keeping you interested is when <UNK> will end with <UNK> and with it an end to any further sub par el dvd action films
<START> <UNK> is a fantasy music film staring michael jackson with different segments i will rate each segment <UNK> br br segment 1 opens the film with a music video the music video is a concert of michael jackson performing the song man in the mirror the music video also show's montages of historical figures such as gandhi martin <UNK> king jr john lennon and more the first segment was a good choice to open the film i liked the song and also loved the montage of the historical figures i even loved the message in the song i give the first segment a 9 10 br br segment 2 shows a montage of michael jackson's start from the jackson five to his solo career the montage i thought was well made i liked the animation they put into it and i also loved their choices of songs such as i i want you back beat it thriller can you feel it and the way you make me feel the only thing i wish they could have done a little a better in one of the songs in the montage is we are the world the reason why is all you see is rain drops and in those drops are images of michael jackson and the chorus of the celebrities but it's a little hard to see the chorus other than that the segment is still good i give it a 9 10 br br segment 3 is the song bad you're probably thinking it's michael jackson's music video of bad well yes and no this segment is the music video but it's <UNK> by kids the segment was cute but it wasn't as good as the other segments i give it a 6 10 br br segment 4 is a short <UNK> music film that takes place after the kid's version of bad called speed demon the short is about michael jackson being chased by his beloved fans and the press and he <UNK> himself as a rabbit and rides a motorcycle to try to get away from them the <UNK> in the chase sequence was great but some parts in the film the <UNK> characters looked a little fake when they interact with real people also at the end of the clip out of nowhere michael jackson rabbit costume comes to life and he's dancing with it i liked the dancing but that was like out of nowhere i give it a 8 10 br br segment 5 is michael jackson's <UNK> winning music video leave me alone the music video is about the media <UNK> their nose at michael jackson's personal life and michael jackson feels they won't leave him alone no matter how much he's proved innocent the music video really speaks out but keep in mind this happened before the child <UNK> this just all about the rumors of him in the 80's but i didn't feel this video should be in this movie because it's a kids movie and i don't think kid's will understand what he's singing about i give this music video 8 10 br br segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called smooth criminal michael jackson plays a gangster who uses his powers of a wishing star as a crime figure to protect children including john <UNK> son sean lennon from an evil mobster named mr <UNK> played by joe <UNK> the segment i thought really brought out the film especially when he <UNK> and sang the song smooth criminal with a bunch of criminals i also thought the special effects were good the weird thing about the segment is why are kids hanging out with a grown man it never explained why also joe <UNK> character talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them i mean why would you talk about drugs in a kids film other wise it was good my rating for this segment is a 8 10 br br segment 7 is the final segment of the whole movie the film <UNK> with michael jackson singing a cover version of the <UNK> song come together and then during the <UNK> we see michael jackson singing with <UNK> black <UNK> michael did a good cover of come together and i think it was good idea putting including a group of good <UNK> with a talented <UNK> like him my rating is 9 10 br br this movie is a good michael jackson film i think it really brings out children s imagination the film is almost as imaginative as the beatles animated movie yellow submarine if you like michael jackson and you're up to a film with a lot of creativity this is the film my overall rating for this movie is 8 10
<START> it has very bad acting bad story lines bad characters you should never see this show if you see it on turn it off or you be cringing for the next 30 minutes it should have never been aired it's not great you should never see it never ever ever so now if you ever wanna watch this show please don't turn to the the <UNK> for <UNK> or disney channel for hannah montana <UNK> of <UNK> place or nick for drake josh those are much better family shows so believe me on this i've watched it before and it is honestly and i say honestly the worst show i've ever seen and i've seen a lot of tv so do me a favor and never watch this show
<START> say what you want about andy <UNK> but if his family was even 10 as deranged as the one in this film well then i guess he could have turned out worse unfortunately the video print of this film contains sex scene <UNK> originally shot by the <UNK> to boost the <UNK> box office appeal several times during the film <UNK> ugly <UNK> and silent film music abruptly ends and suddenly good looking stand ins for <UNK> <UNK> actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60's guitar rock it's pretty easy to fast forward through if you're trying to pay attention to <UNK> original film which unfortunately is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes what remains however is still compelling stuff i don't think i've ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before
<START> one of the most frightening game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed great storyline with a romantic horrific and ironic plot fans of the original resident evil will be in for a surprise of a returning character not to mention that the voice acting have drastically improved over the previous of the series don't miss out on the best of the series
<START> anyone who has studied any physics or <UNK> science will walk out disgusted after 40 min as my wife and i did the ignorant masses might be entertained by the hand <UNK> arguments and the absurd conclusions drawn without even an attempt at a logical reason from real science i'm offended by such nonsense presented under the <UNK> of science i can only conclude that the writers picked up a quantum physics book didn't understand a word of it then watched the matrix about a thousand times and <UNK> to write this movie br br for example the washington <UNK> crime experiment was done by the <UNK> <UNK> program a brief search will reveal the science of their methods http www <UNK> com <UNK> groups t <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br save your money
<START> famous was famous for their tension and release style of cartoon where the semi main character is in terrible peril only to be rescued by the hero at the last second this particular casper is the only one i can remember where death actually takes a hand but even in death there is still a happy ending br br the constant in famous studios cartoons is that virtue always <UNK> <UNK> always gets to his <UNK> in time baby <UNK> always out <UNK> the fox little <UNK> always learns her lesson and some <UNK> cartoons are really dark and depressing br br you have to give them credit as much as i love looney tunes and tom and jerry i don't think anyone was putting out a better cartoon product at that time than paramount color animation music the great winston <UNK> editing voices they were consistent and a glowing example of the best that the art form had to offer
<START> some people might call paulie a kids' movie but i wish to <UNK> that it's more than that probably more than anything else this movie successfully goes to great <UNK> to show the plight of immigrants in the united states <UNK> given the recent <UNK> portraying a parrot telling a russian immigrant janitor tony <UNK> of how he searched america for his original owners the movie tells several stories there's the elderly woman gena rowlands whom he befriends then a mexican immigrant cheech <UNK> and others br br all in all it's a very well done movie i usually don't expect much from these sorts of movies but this one is a treat i certainly recommend it also starring jay <UNK> buddy <UNK> bruce <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i read about this movie in a magazine and i was intrigued a woman who one day sees herself drive past in her own car well i thought this could be interesting br br but it isn't first the title the broken the broken what what is broken the oh wait i get it the title itself is broken wow clever unfortunately this is virtually the only thing going for it br br the premise is not that bad but i think <UNK> <UNK> did much better in <UNK> a cross between invasion of the body <UNK> and mirrors and a rather mediocre one at that a more suited title would be 'the <UNK> since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages or maybe 'the <UNK> since it doesn't explain anything at all not in the narrative nor in the story itself only some vague idea about evil copies and <UNK> <UNK> with cheap scares and scenes used to death but nothing <UNK> it's just messed up br br on the other hand the acting and the special effects are quite good but then again it's not a difficult role to act br br after watching the movie twice i still feel <UNK> a little confused maybe and not in the e a poe or stephen king kind of way do yourself a favor and don't watch this one simply put there are better thrillers out there
<START> in the hands of lesser actors than <UNK> <UNK> and robert ryan this film could have become silly and trite but with these two experienced <UNK> leading the way i found silent fury to be a most exciting and <UNK> little mystery when their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that <UNK> is already married and that he was best man at that wedding one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work as <UNK> ryan and her attorney set out to <UNK> the strangers claim of a prior marriage they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to <UNK> the claim that she is indeed already <UNK> although it's not very difficult to figure out just who the main baddie is it's still lots of fun as the intensity and pace of the story <UNK> all in all a good solid mystery film with fine performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting cast which includes the often underrated paul kelly
<START> return of the jedi is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right and that is a shame because the last <UNK> installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale and does so very convincingly br br yes there are ewoks cute and <UNK> bears that arguably served to <UNK> the star wars <UNK> and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader the most recognizable villain in movie history br br return of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline which went from slightly implausible in the empire strikes back to very convincing here an exciting opening at <UNK> palace a masterful performance of ian <UNK> as the emperor luke finally coming into his own the resolution of solo and <UNK> romance and the extremely powerful final moments on the <UNK> moon br br yes there are slight <UNK> but they are the <UNK> of a generation of <UNK> who've had time to <UNK> every single scene it's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter it's not a <UNK> movie it's fantastic
<START> i liked this movie a lot i rented this expecting something not too bad to spend an evening it turned out a particularly satisfying experience some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so in a movie not intended to be just a stupid slapstick comedy but with some meaning and moral values it manages on both counts the leads are all good but especially the guy who stars also wrote and produced the movie i've never seen any of these actors before but they were likable and made me care about what happens to them in the end which is saying a lot the script is clever and involving and has a refreshing feel to it i think you wont be disappointed to watch this
<START> finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen well we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers andy played by hoffman and hank played by hawke will spiral <UNK> towards destruction since where else is there to go but down but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie hoffman is superb as usual and even hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really cannot think for himself hawke might have been a little out of his element but he played the part well enough add into this mix <UNK> wife played perfectly by marisa tomei cheating with hank <UNK> <UNK> of company <UNK> to pay for his drug and sex <UNK> and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery this movie will get you thinking
<START> this is available on a drive in double feature from dark sky films and since i just had finished up <UNK> i watched this too this is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time br br we begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town but where exactly are they they stop to look at <UNK> from some chinese <UNK> and try on chinese style clothes at a shop but then we see some aztec dancers and all the while these girls are being followed by two guys who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town and they finally catch them br br it seems that one of the girls has a <UNK> on a string around her neck and these guys want to find the <UNK> and where did she get it so in flashback we go back to find out and how did they know she had this <UNK> hard to say really br br now back in the day when these two women were 10 years old they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat and after stopped to get air in their tanks they <UNK> this young boy back to his home <UNK> only to have his grandpa come out invite the young <UNK> up for <UNK> tea with <UNK> but not everyone has the tea todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls and then when they're away from it the boat blows up and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared well it seems as though these kindly folk raise their own <UNK> but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell and serve it <UNK> tea br br but the girls and todd did leave the island but now they're returning <UNK> by their <UNK> and they're there to find the treasure despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before there also seems to be someone else on the island and the thugs mysteriously begin to die one by one and since there's only three it doesn't take long and there's even a sort of happy ending which will leave the viewer every bit as <UNK> as they were throughout the rest of the film br br the two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues and combined with no acting ability they're borderline hilarious the <UNK> type family is also devoid of acting ability despite the fact that the grandpa is hank <UNK> who appeared in many films and tv shows the action is confusing the locales are even more confusing and the island looks like southern california br br so what the hell is this i'm not sure but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think or say huh 4 out of 10 very bizarre
<START> david lynch's crude and <UNK> drawn take on south park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clichés about suburban middle class families the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a <UNK> large <UNK> mouth hole from which are <UNK> the most horrendous <UNK> noises the son and mother are <UNK> horrified incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series br br lynch is not famous for his comedies i e on the air aspects of wild at heart and i am not particularly fond of comedies in general however there were a couple of scenes in <UNK> which made me laugh out loud there are some clever bits of animated cinematography where lynch conveys wide <UNK> of reaction in his characters through a <UNK> <UNK> of shots as opposed to facial expressions which never really <UNK> in <UNK> br br i believe lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight forward if disturbing animated comedy here interestingly he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra low brow humor i e most will farrell films while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross out humor while the blend doesn't really work very well here it is nothing if not <UNK> br br worth seeing by lynch fans
<START> <UNK> could have been a very well made movie on how the <UNK> war was fought it had the locations the budget and the skill to have been <UNK> saving private ryan or black <UNK> down instead it come across as a <UNK> 4 hour bore of trying to <UNK> the war move with the <UNK> movie even the war scenes were terribly executed using the same hill in all their battle scenes and spending unnecessary time on casual talk instead of trying to appeal to the indian public a better movie would have been a to the book account of what happened at <UNK> like black <UNK> down or even spending time on the <UNK> point of view like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even better it could have used a competent director like ram <UNK> <UNK> to write direct and edit the film until then i'd like to see some one re edit this film with only the <UNK> portions included it would make the movie more watchable
<START> at first i didn't didn't like it that much although i did they didn't include the third <UNK> generation the love between <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> well explained and some actors were too different from what i had imagined br br later i realized that had the movie been more loyal to the book it would have been like five hours long and would be kind of tedious now i like it very much because my favourite characters are there as i <UNK> them clara really looks like an angel in live and her introduction to the story at the <UNK> of the film was fantastic loyal and short glenn close is <UNK> i <UNK> her just like that only not in mourning throughout the whole thing <UNK> is find enough i never really liked his character and although i was interested in him i hated him a lot more specially when he hit clara as in the book the very last part is the most exciting one and it has real history too there br br the movie is really good specially considering that it was a <UNK> film based upon a latin american book its amazing how many famous stars are there don't you think so
<START> today's sci fi thrillers are more like rambo in outer space with monster special effects frequently ludicrous such as sounds of explosions in the <UNK> of space though tame by today's standards the special effects of forbidden planet were quite striking for their time even today they still hold <UNK> yet the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason that radio thrillers still have appeal much of what was going on was left up to the <UNK> of the audience what did the <UNK> creatures look like by having much of the <UNK> of the story never <UNK> or only <UNK> in the end the tension and suspense held throughout the movie the ending was also very thought provoking and satisfying in my mind this is still one of the best if not the best sci fi films ever made
<START> o my gosh just give me a minute to breath this movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesn't let you go until the very last blow in your face ending this is the the movie for fans of <UNK> and such legend of zu was beautifully created although i didn't like a few things they used alot of stand ins i wanted to see the real person fight but oh well a few small let downs and i didn't really like it a lot until i watched it again when you understand it more it totally kicks a i encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true asian movie to see this movie i give this movie one of my highest ratings go and see it when it comes out in america
<START> in another one of bugs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wacky shorts the famous <UNK> works in a department store display case when owner <UNK> decides to stuff him of course this proves nearly impossible as bugs apparently knows the store better than <UNK> and knows when to cross dress as always they keep everything coming at top speed and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have seemed when it first <UNK> among other things <UNK> <UNK> is a fine example of how the looney tunes looked in the <UNK> before the <UNK> <UNK> crowd polished them but don't get me wrong the cartoons were still really good after the <UNK> forms arrived br br anyway this is a great one br br <UNK> are <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> man is the first thriller i've ever done  robert altman br br in 1955 charles <UNK> directed the night of the hunter a spooky slice of southern gothic in which robert mitchum plays a scary serial killer one of the film's more famous sequences consists of two kids escaping from mitchum on a <UNK> the kids <UNK> <UNK> whilst mitchum <UNK> after them like a monster br br seven years later mitchum played an equally spooky killer in cape fear another film set in the american south that film featured a local attorney trying to protect his family and likewise ended with mitchum <UNK> folks on a boat in 1991 martin scorsese trying to branch out and tackle something more mainstream remade cape fear boat scene and all br br now we have robert altman's the <UNK> man another slice of small town southern gothic altman says he <UNK> the night of the hunter for inspiration and <UNK> such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to spread his wings and try a popcorn picture but what he's secretly attempting to do here is <UNK> the <UNK> films of the southern gothic genre br br so instead of a showdown on small boat we get a showdown on a giant ship instead of two kids being kidnapped we get two kids being safely returned to the police instead of money being hidden we have money being readily given via a last will and testament instead of the righteous attorney of the <UNK> film and the <UNK> attorney of the 1991 remake we get a rather three dimensional lawyer in kenneth branagh instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys instead of the monster breaking into the family's house boat we have the hero hunting the monster on board the <UNK> house ship similarly instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by robert duvall etc etc etc br br altman goes on and on <UNK> everything just a little slightly pulling at the edges and doing his own thing his touch is most apparent during the film's first half hour the film existing in an uneasy space between conventional plot driven movie storytelling and altman's <UNK> for <UNK> dialogue casual <UNK> <UNK> camera movement and the way that characters aren't so much introduced as they are simply part of what's going on br br still despite altman's best intentions the film never rises above mediocrity altman's too bound to the conventions of the thriller format to do much damage his style is too <UNK> to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to <UNK> other <UNK> films in the genre <UNK> man is thus too mainstream to work as a more pure altman film and too altman to work as a mainstream thriller br br the film's not a complete waste though robert downey junior kenneth branagh and the usually <UNK> <UNK> hannah all turn in <UNK> performances the film also has a nice atmosphere set against a approaching <UNK> and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns while it's not the complete disaster that <UNK> cape fear was the film still never amounts to anything special br br 7 10  in the late 90s altman made 3 <UNK> films set in the american south kansas city <UNK> man and <UNK> fortune unlike <UNK> man both kansas city and <UNK> fortune tackle the genre on the <UNK> more <UNK> <UNK> that altman was most comfortable with br br kansas city is the more important of these two films its <UNK> of class politics and crime and its desire to break <UNK> away from typical gangster genre <UNK> would prove influential on all serious 21st century film crime writers see for example the wire that said <UNK> fortune while a much <UNK> tale is perhaps the better picture br br note altman claims that this is his first thriller but he directed images an art house thriller in 1972 br br worth one viewing
<START> men do i love police movies filled with action shooting chases <UNK> br br boy was i let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie we've seen it all before the <UNK> the bank the surrounding yet 2 bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire without getting hit due to some <UNK> br br not just a few shots no hundreds of shots going back into the bank where the dumb <UNK> didn't lock the safe or doors when the bad guys went out how stupid did the director think we'd be br br okay the shots in between that fake a documentary were good but after seeing the film i only got the thought why didn't the police get a decent shooting course and why where there so many cops and was <UNK> on a real long break truly bad
<START> apparently none of the previous reviewers most of whom praise the film for its accuracy have actually read a biography of louis <UNK> the most glaring <UNK> is in the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> iii back in the 1930's the latter was <UNK> shown in a bad light while far from an admirable character he was an inept politician and a self <UNK> military genius who allowed france to be dragged into a disastrous war he was not the stupid <UNK> depicted here he had an intelligent interest in science and like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the <UNK> it would bring far from <UNK> <UNK> he was his <UNK> building him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his research while the lab was under construction <UNK> became <UNK> ill a <UNK> deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead ordered work <UNK> on his own authority when the emperor heard about this his outrage <UNK> the <UNK> so that there was a <UNK> of buck passing and work promptly <UNK> the emperor personally visited <UNK> to comfort him and <UNK> him that he would get his lab the emperor would often bring members of his court to admire <UNK> projects and it was obvious to everyone that <UNK> was one of the <UNK> favorites <UNK> main worry concerning the emperor was that <UNK> thought <UNK> was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything and was constantly <UNK> him tasks outside of his previous experience <UNK> a very modest man was always <UNK> this but <UNK> would say that he had complete faith in him and <UNK> despite his <UNK> always came through they always had a close and friendly relationship and after the emperor was <UNK> <UNK> refused to say a bad word about him grateful to the end of his life br br the part about his daughter having the baby and <UNK> <UNK> his principles to get a doctor never happened the part about the <UNK> and <UNK> for which he was famous is generally correct but the notion that the <UNK> experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is false he was famous and respected at the time this happened this movie is ok from a dramatic standpoint but very distorted as biography
<START> i remember watching this on prime time when i was about 7 years old i was a huge comic book reader at the time and anything relating to <UNK> was anticipated heavily the end result however was <UNK> br br i was aware of the emma <UNK> diana prince stories as they had only recently come to an end and diana was returned to her <UNK> form however there was so little action that i was bored throughout most of the movie the final costume was an interesting idea but looked more like a <UNK> than a superhero br br i saw the movie again in my late teen years it hadn't improved much cathy lee crosby was more familiar thanks to that's incredible but her acting was no better the script had a few good ideas like the rogue amazon and a decent villain in <UNK> <UNK> but it just didn't come together and was still boring br br i think they should have built the back story better and built the show into a more epic climax it was too much like a bland spy film crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book the amazon elements were intriguing but needed to be expanded br br the film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful if a bit too camp and low budget the budget was also pretty low here and <UNK> don't come cheap br br it would be nice to have the movie available on dvd if only as a comparison and historical document even superman 4 is available and it has nothing over this film except chris reeve and gene hackman it's worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions
<START> it's a tale that could have taken place anywhere really given the right circumstances street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing the aging entertainer finds buys a male child to pass his art to from there we follow them through the <UNK> of their challenging but free life along the river traveling town to town he performs and has some degree of <UNK> despite the times and the influences the man is kind and good br br overall the performances are first rate especially <UNK> <UNK> who portrays the street performer the child <UNK> <UNK> is beautiful and downright strong and <UNK> the overt prejudices well the two protagonists along with supporting help from the kind opera singer master <UNK> an interestingly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness sadness and love some have mentioned this film's remote similarities to <UNK> wang <UNK> <UNK> farewell my <UNK> yet this film can't stand easily on its own any resemblance is remote at best br br my only <UNK> with the king of masks is the ending it was weak cliche and about as subtle as a <UNK> the audience was already wrapped up in the story what was the needless manipulation for what a shame to bring a fine motion picture that far only to surrender to emotional and corny pathos like that it frankly made this film good instead of the classic it should've been that aside the king of masks is still very well worth your time i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films highly recommended
<START> i am currently on vacation in israel for summer and so was able to see this incredible film a bit of a warning before i begin writing i speak <UNK> <UNK> and so the <UNK> parts were no problem however about a quarter a bit less of the film is in <UNK> and i was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit this did not detract from my understanding of the film but did cause me to miss a few jokes which <UNK> some strong laughs in the theater br br after a year of american cinema which many <UNK> as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest yet the bubble surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting witty dialogue and relevant political climate br br the film opens on a <UNK> on the israeli palestinian border for the first few moments we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on yet this is an important element of this film's strength the political situation and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background most importantly tel <UNK> serves as a character of its own in this film it is constantly <UNK> street names and restaurant names are constantly <UNK> the <UNK> and city development is <UNK> quite <UNK> and ultimately the city <UNK> along with the film the film focuses on the love between noam <UNK> <UNK> and a palestinian immigrant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the societies of tel <UNK> and <UNK> serving as a constant foil we always know that their relationship is forbidden and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema the love is incredibly strong and stands as the <UNK> of the film the secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong flamboyant restaurant owner <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> relationship with the ultra butch and grating <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is particularly a source of amusement the love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite fine crafted works of art and the cinematography is astounding in the first love scene of the film the camera pans down as a male character gives <UNK> sex to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> into a shot of noam and <UNK> this shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love br br to give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate so i will instead focus on the witty dialogue even when watching this movie in my second language i could not stop laughing throughout lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide <UNK> receive virgin women or men in heaven and an <UNK> of <UNK> from the bible as the worlds first suicide <UNK> this dialogue shows a particular sense of <UNK> and reality which is rarely seen in cinema the music used in the film is also particularly powerful music is only used in times when characters <UNK> could or should be listening to it and in one scene the music <UNK> when a character <UNK> one <UNK> and stops when he <UNK> the other little elements like this truly elevate the film br br i could not give greater recommendation to a film this is a superb work of cinema which is <UNK> as well as extremely well crafted
<START> i stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked the story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves waves that are <UNK> huge waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves there is nothing special about the film other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk sure there are scenes of them surfing but what makes this movie so special is the people here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching half way into this movie you'll want to go off and learn to surf as well few documentaries have ever managed to <UNK> the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film see it
<START> with all this stuff going down at the moment with <UNK> i've started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the <UNK> and watched <UNK> again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent <UNK> is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about <UNK> feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad <UNK> br br visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like <UNK> in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call <UNK> an <UNK> for <UNK> to the making of this movie but <UNK> and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him br br the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so <UNK> the smooth criminal sequence and joe <UNK> is convincing as a <UNK> all powerful drug lord why he wants <UNK> dead so bad is beyond me because <UNK> <UNK> his plans <UNK> joe <UNK> character <UNK> that he wanted people to know it is he who is <UNK> drugs etc so i <UNK> maybe he just hates <UNK> music br br lots of cool things in this like <UNK> turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the <UNK> bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene br br bottom line this movie is for people who like <UNK> on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically <UNK> <UNK> buddy in this movie is a girl michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty well with all the attention i've gave this subject hmmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most <UNK> <UNK> i hope he is not the latter
<START> domino is a great movie it's about a young woman names domino harvey <UNK> knightley who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle she joins with two fellow hunters mickey rourke edgar <UNK> and the adventures begin the script is good very down to earth and realistic with the tone of the film the only problem i had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do instead of the character of domino br br even with that <UNK> knightley gives a fierce performance she shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance mickey rourke follows up his oscar worthy performance in <UNK> <UNK> with another tough guy performance edgar <UNK> really doesn't do anything except speak spanish every once in a while and stare at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gives a good supporting performance <UNK> was herself although she did surprise me on one particular scene lucy liu has great chemistry with <UNK> knightley in her scenes with her br br the best thing about the movie though is the direction tony scott's fast paced style really brings the movie to life the cinematography is some of the best i've ever seen it takes a regular movie and puts on acid all the blacks are <UNK> the whites are <UNK> and it has a sort of green glow to it the action scenes are <UNK> br br overall if you liked sin city man on fire you'll like domino
<START> i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television it is far superior in action than most movies since martin sheen is excellent and though nick nolte has a small part he too provides excellent support <UNK> <UNK> as the villain is superb br br when sheen <UNK> the water in his <UNK> ford cool along the <UNK> highway it is spectacular br br the ending is grand br br i'm disappointed in the low vote this received i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days br br good taste <UNK> the masses
<START> very few movies have had the impact on american culture the way urban cowboy has thank god it was temporary but <UNK> is almost in a class by itself as one of those flicks that when you're flipping channels at 3 <UNK> you just can't take your eyes off my top three are animal house and walking tall btw but that's beside the point i remember urban cowboy hit the theaters and <UNK> there were <UNK> being opened on every corner men were sporting cowboy hats with their penny <UNK> and if you didnt know how to two step you were considered a social moron personally i think it's a great movie travolta really surprised me on the heels of <UNK> who'd a <UNK> he's actually believable too the soundtrack is awesome too bad <UNK> <UNK> of tv's dallas fame ruined johnny lee's career cause that guy was just terrific the show <UNK> here is scott glenn as the <UNK> ex con redneck cowboy and i ain't got nothing against <UNK> ex con <UNK> semi being one myself but i've always <UNK> what i feel to be the greatest power line of all time pack at s t sort of like <UNK> make my day and watching him slap sissy around is the closest thing i'll see to my julia roberts fantasy so like i said beautiful 9 10
<START> how viewers react to this new adaption of shirley jackson's book which was promoted as not being a remake of the original 1963 movie true enough will be based i suspect on the following those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one and those who have never been exposed to either and who are big fans of hollywood's current trend towards special effects being the first and last word in how good a film is are going to love it br br things i did not like about this adaption br br 1 it was not a true adaption of the book from the <UNK> i had read this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to and that seemed reasonable no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of the stand and not even then but there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at in the movie reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining i didn't like that either what the movie's press release should have said is we got the basic very basic idea from shirley jackson's book we kept the same names of the house and several though not all of the leading character's names but then we decided to write our own story and what the heck we watched the <UNK> and the shining and ghost first and decided to throw in a bit of them too br br 2 they completely lost the theme of a <UNK> <UNK> carefully picked guest who had all had <UNK> with the <UNK> in their <UNK> to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been born bad no instead this doctor got everyone to the house under the false <UNK> of studying their insomnia he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they <UNK> to their fear like lab rats who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment nice guy this doctor who did not have the same name by the way was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day br br 3 in direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies some houses are just born bad this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there and this time around <UNK> gets to unravel the mystery shades of the <UNK> the only problem was the so called mystery was so <UNK> told that i'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience but then there was no mystery in the first place not in the book because the house was bad to begin with it's first victim died before ever setting eyes on it br br 4 the way the character of luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous he was supposed to be a <UNK> playboy who was someday to <UNK> the house and was a true <UNK> of it's history and in this one he was just a <UNK> voiced bumbling nerd who couldn't sleep insomnia remember and was a <UNK> liar br br 5 i was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word the scene with <UNK> sister's family and mrs <UNK> little opening speech to going off into <UNK> of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than the haunting it's like it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do br br 6 i missed <UNK> narrative through the whole movie the original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person through <UNK> eyes and we always were <UNK> to her thoughts that totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version they also tried to make <UNK> much more of a heroine the original <UNK> was not a bad person but she was a bitter person could she be otherwise after <UNK> 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a <UNK> sister and she liked to <UNK> and she lost her temper this one was almost too good to be true this was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer's had obviously been watching ghost one too many times br br 7 they changed the history of the house and it's <UNK> too much there was no <UNK> <UNK> the daughter of hugh whose legend <UNK> large in the original versions there was no companion and there was no <UNK> there was also no grace wife of the original doctor and hugh <UNK> wives died in totally different ways these changes changed the story way too much i don't know whether the producers of this movie should be glad shirley jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should be sorry if ya get my drift the <UNK> she could <UNK> are not something to be <UNK> with br br in conclusion let me just leave you with some words from the original luke appropriate <UNK> of the word house for movie this <UNK> should be burnt to the ground and the ground <UNK> with salt my favorite movie of all time remains so no competition from this one
<START> this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge i found the first 10 minutes a bit slow but after that the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about <UNK> a living br br some of the scenes are very funny i don't think that a non bridge player would get the charm of this movie br br some of the dresses are really beautiful pity the movie is in black and white i can only imagine what they would look like in colour the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that br br watch it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it
<START> sunshine is a european <UNK> set in <UNK> between <UNK> and 1980 it's the epic story of hungarian jews the <UNK> family this name literally <UNK> to sunshine the family has humble <UNK> then is <UNK> becomes <UNK> mobile changes it's name and hopes to <UNK> into hungarian society so <UNK> generations can advance <UNK> the story is told through the eyes of the <UNK> son in each of three generations ralph <UNK> plays these three roles for those who missed the <UNK> ii and the holocaust in europe the <UNK> approach to life doesn't work out very well br br sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success but it is an opportunity missed the story line dominated by world history is predictable and transparent this is <UNK> with voice cover narration and <UNK> footage the family <UNK> <UNK> from one predictable event ie the <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> ii <UNK> communism etc to the next with little continuity depth or detail the jewish <UNK> theme is <UNK> and important sub themes the <UNK> diary and family philosophy that could have given the family character and credibility are l <UNK> until the very end <UNK> the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest infidelity br br ralph <UNK> <UNK> flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material the 3 for 1 casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater sunshine is basically hungarian history channel material it has the look and feel of winds of war <UNK> with forrest <UNK> <UNK> with something about sex br br
<START> loved the movie loved the two families crossing paths in history only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family's line continue he is <UNK> <UNK> son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children <UNK> never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate <UNK> even with the mistakes in the movie just loved it the acting was great not sure where the story was with mr sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier the other <UNK> did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much poor warden must have had a really <UNK> childhood to be so mean when she grew up
<START> yesterday i attended the world premiere of descent at the <UNK> film festival in nyc i had a great time it was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow my <UNK> marcus patrick br br i give the movie 7 5 starts out of a possible 10 stars br br the movie begins with <UNK> rosario dawson at college you can <UNK> the typical college environment with wild parties and <UNK> going on the photography in this film was excellent she meets jared <UNK> <UNK> and they become <UNK> it appears like any other relationship in the beginning the man is in quest of the woman's attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get both played this well very innocent <UNK> between the two he invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart br br the apartment is very dreary and dark they eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous <UNK> this actually reminded me of a <UNK> here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her this is a very dark and gritty rape scene this scene is not for the young or weak at heart the rape scene is a little long and hard to take but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows br br <UNK> now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex she falls into her own <UNK> she starts attending the <UNK> of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no <UNK> on how she got there she is told to go see adrian marcus patrick the first thing i remember about this character is that they say he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving he is actually the one who introduces <UNK> to drugs they begin a relationship of <UNK> which comes into play later in the movie the club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise i thought they were well done and i noticed that the director of photography was <UNK> at the end of the showing during the credits by the audience br br <UNK> is then back in college as a <UNK> and who is in her class jared her rapist you could see the confusion and emotion on <UNK> face what should i do what do i do next the shots of her face and the emotions are priceless br br what unfolds next is not actually whats happening she acts interested in jared she appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be <UNK> again i was sitting there saying could this really be happening it wasn't nothing could be <UNK> from the truth br br she invites him to her apartment and of course he shows up now her apartment is dark and gritty she has him strip down completely he thinks he's going to get lucky she then <UNK> him like any woman can she's <UNK> him everywhere and he's getting excited note for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity may not be right for the younger viewer br br she then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him once again the scene is dark gritty and very rough br br if you are going to see the movie and don't want to know what happens next skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraph br br this is where adrian <UNK> the picture <UNK> has adrian save her by performing extremely rough male sex with jared she thinks this is the final revenge adrian continues to take all of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> his dignity to nothing marcus as adrian plays this scene as believable as anyone can he is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen after the movie during a q a session marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and <UNK> <UNK> believes that this revenge will save her but i don't think it does one of the final scenes has a <UNK> of <UNK> face and you see a tear roll down her cheek this was a fabulous <UNK> scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie did she get the revenge she wanted was it as satisfying as she expected in my opinion it does not it only makes matters worse br br this is an excellent movie will well acted roles and i recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it i would just be a little <UNK> if under 17 years of age rosario <UNK> and marcus should be <UNK> for jobs well done the directing and photography must also be <UNK> it was a night that i enjoyed
<START> okay this is <UNK> be short and sweet review something the movie should have taken a practice <UNK> <UNK> made its life shorter and <UNK> than it was br br this movie is there's a good reason there was a <UNK> with over 40 000 <UNK> all demanding uwe boll stop making movies from <UNK> people liked blood <UNK> being a <UNK> there br br the jokes are good if you've never heard them a thousand times before the acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that i even a few moments wonder if they're even using a script br br the movie has little to nothing to do with the original games hello if you've played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal <UNK> like mass murder because he <UNK> his toe or <UNK> there's way too much story for such a stupid movie like i said i wouldn't even steal this movie and for the person who says this is ' funniest movie of <UNK> need to take a look around the news is better than this
<START> this movie was one of the best disney movies i've ever seen great for the entire family to watch the ideas may be a little far fetched but it's a feel good comedy and the acting is great love the little boy j p and academy award winner <UNK> <UNK> part may have been very short but very memorable highly recommended
<START> as this movie is completely in swiss <UNK> it's probably hard for most german <UNK> to really follow this movie i'm not from switzerland but i worked there for some years so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings i've seen a lot of movies of this kind <UNK> scary movie loads of scifi spoofs etc but this one is the best one of that kind i've seen so far i give a 9 of 10 the only reason i can't give a 10 is because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they <UNK> no subtitles in any language on the dvd so there's almost no chance for non swiss to understand
<START> gundam wing is an amazing show from start to finish every single episode is a joy to watch the story is typical gundam fare in the future <UNK> <UNK> grows to the extent where we create space <UNK> in order to expand the story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other gundam show it is the year after colony <UNK> and the corrupt earth government known as the earth <UNK> alliance is violently taking over the free <UNK> to combat the alliance control and the even greater threat that is to come an evil <UNK> organization hiding within the alliance known as oz which later takes control of earth and the <UNK> <UNK> members of the <UNK> send 5 super powerful <UNK> to earth to try and save the <UNK> from the threat that is to soon come these <UNK> known as <UNK> fight oz and try to regain peace in the <UNK> as oz takes the front stage completely <UNK> the alliance and taking control of earth and its <UNK> br br gundam wing as i previously stated is probably the most enjoyable gundam series to watch in my opinion a large part of this reason is the difference between this series and any other gundam series before it but also the stories are far more deep and intricate than majority of the other gundam series gundam wing has more depth and emotion to it than any other gundam show i have ever seen thus far this particular series seemed to focus more on character and the relationships amongst those characters than epic space battle now don't get me wrong this show still has many epic battles within it and the show still maintains the epic atmosphere that other gundam series have but it achieves this by having the story follow an ensemble cast of 6 or 7 characters as opposed to following just 1 br br no matter how you look at it this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable gundam series out there and i strongly recommend it to any fan of anime or sci fi in general the show sports some amazing animation and superb action but the depth and <UNK> of the story is what keeps you coming back for more the characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them this show is definitely one that shouldn't be missed br br a perfect 10 10

<START> i hate this programme not only is the very concept ludicrous but it tries so hard to be <UNK> something that was left out of similar i confess ending <UNK> like <UNK> she wrote br br sigh why is it that the writers can't ever be intelligent enough in this programme to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in court br br come on after x amount of years of the cases being <UNK> why must every suspect every episode confess damn it to a murder which would otherwise go <UNK> br br i bet all police wish that criminals were this good <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> officer you're a bright one i guess if you've <UNK> enough to convince yourself i did it i may as well admit to it and make it easier for you in court what can i say it's a fair cop br br absolute dog s t and an insult to those of us with with enough brains to even have heard of i q
<START> hybrid starts as water treatment planet security guard aaron <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is involved in an accident which leaves him blind luckily it just so happens that brilliant scientist dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who works for <UNK> has developed an operation to transplant organs from one species to another <UNK> decides aaron would be perfect for her first human experiment <UNK> her team transplant the eyes of a wolf into aaron he miraculously <UNK> his sight brilliant right well no not really since aaron starts to go mad as he sees random images of wolves starts to develop a lust for blood aaron escapes the <UNK> building goes on the run but he is too valuable to just let go a full scale search is <UNK> to capture him br br directed by <UNK> <UNK> this is yet another sci fi channel offering that is quite simply put terrible in every possible way i think it probably started out life as a straight <UNK> <UNK> but ended up as one of the most boring dull sci fi channel films i have seen that doesn't even feature any sort of monster or creature hybrid is awful the script is terrible i am not even sure who it was meant to appeal to the initial set up is ok with aaron getting wolf eyes but then hybrid <UNK> the sci fi elements becomes some sort of horrible drama as it focuses entirely on <UNK> mental state as he wonders around doing nothing in particular with some native american woman yep you don't think the sci fi channel could make a film about wolves put loads of rubbish about native american mythology in there as well do you the dynamics of the character's is bizarre aaron is shown as the <UNK> hero yet he is the only character to kill anyone in the film is a fairly unlikable <UNK> annoying person while dr <UNK> is shown as the evil scientist yet she gives aaron back his sight does nothing but try to help him i mean aaron is given back the gift of sight yet <UNK> is the villain also the regular sci fi channel <UNK> of us military <UNK> is present the problem is why do they want aaron so badly he isn't a soldier while he has wolves eyes to help him see in the dark he's utterly <UNK> the script can't make it's mind up whether it's all in <UNK> mind or it's real the ending is hilariously bad with a half naked <UNK> this was made for telly aaron running through a forest with a pack of wolves set to some horrible music that i think is supposed to be emotional but makes it even more funny there are so many things wrong with hybrid it's slower than hell there's virtually no action there's no werewolves the film goes round in circles trying to get into <UNK> mind yet it's all so ridiculous silly boring you won't care one bit there's never any explanation as to why despite just having wolves eyes <UNK> aaron starts to develop other wolf senses br br as a <UNK> i have problems with my eyes hell i have had major surgery on my right eye i can guarantee you that after an operation your eye would be <UNK> up you wouldn't be able to open it it would hurt like hell yet despite having eye <UNK> as soon as aaron wakes up in bed his eyes are perfect with no <UNK> or even <UNK> there are no special effects no blood or gore or violence nothing to <UNK> you in fact now i think about it there's nothing even remotely horror or sci fi feeling about this it feels like a drab film of the week br br filmed in <UNK> in canada the film looks ok but is bland forgettable the acting is poor from all involved none of whom i have seen before hopefully never again br br hybrid is a terrible film that is obviously <UNK> as some <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but is far from that most people will really struggle to get to the awful ending which will probably have you in <UNK>
<START> i think i truly love this film <UNK> de <UNK> was originally a silent film but later dubbed into french in 1930 despite having someone else's voice dubbed over hers this remains a stunning tour de force for louis brooks the fact that her singing voice is dubbed by the legendary edith <UNK> helps to <UNK> us <UNK> about the dubbing deception br br this is the story of <UNK> and we first see her at a resort with her macho boyfriend andre georges <UNK> and their friend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> enters the frame as a pair of legs we see her inside the car changing into her bathing costume <UNK> is very free with showing off her body and this does not sit well with the <UNK> andre when <UNK> considers <UNK> for the title of <UNK> <UNK> we know that a happy ending is not going to be sitting at the end of easy street br br the film seems to focus a lot on men <UNK> beautiful women we see plenty of bathing <UNK> and the reactions of the men staring at them but at the center of it all is the magnificent louise brooks br br if you don't mind watching films from the <UNK> <UNK> then consider checking out this one louise brooks is not a name that most average movie buffs may readily know but as soon as you see her you will be <UNK> and you'll want to know more also check her out in <UNK> <UNK> if you can find it br br be <UNK> of the us <UNK> dvd release i don't know if their projection speed is correct a lot of the scenes appear to be shown at too fast a speed this may have been the way they were shot i don't know but since it's the only way to see this film it's worth <UNK> that one minor bitter <UNK>
<START> hey people what's up it's me man the one and only mike sonny <UNK> killer kelly you know you can't really write a review on the script of <UNK> cause there we didn't have one as far as i know the story was just made up as we went along i had the best time of my life making that film and got so much <UNK> that i ran out of <UNK> fun times so glad that you all enjoyed the film i really didn't get to do the fights that i had <UNK> every time i set up some moves the fight director kept changing them still i had a blast and met some really great people especially the purple female ninja who has seem to fall of the film making scene
<START> an our gang comedy short br br the gang <UNK> <UNK> into watching their younger siblings caring for these forgotten babies turns out to be quite a chore leaving the little <UNK> with no choice but to come up with some ingenious <UNK> to the baby sitting problem br br <UNK> is in his glory in this hilarious little film arguably his best highlight <UNK> retelling the plot of the tarzan movie he's recently seen to the audience of <UNK> movie <UNK> will recognize billy <UNK> voice in the radio drama
<START> bad movie for sure it's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects a lot of <UNK> scenes the airport one for example and a real unfunny time charles dance is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in last action hero eddie murphy is doing a non comic joking and i heard that this sunk had already succeed big time success i'll never understand why or how in one tv interview i've heard eddie murphy himself when he was nominated for an oscar 2007 <UNK> it in a comic way br br one of the comments said hey it's the 1980s well no my friend it's the cinematic <UNK> which made a lot of <UNK> movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s br br there are 2 reasons made me write about this movie the first is that i'll never forget the long <UNK> fascinating legs of charlotte lewis especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was <UNK> about her naked legs as it should be but how odd as i've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again anyhow the second reason is that i've found this movie's title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever br br the bottom line bad movie <UNK> legs
<START> one of disney's best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for 1 hour forty two minutes and after all wasn't movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast <UNK> with delight <UNK>
<START> or an audience a quick <UNK> br br so you've got this doctor who's been <UNK> with stolen body parts for some vague reason he wants to perfect <UNK> but feels he needs to do this in his basement wtf and then suddenly unfortunately and conveniently his fiancé gets her head cut off in a traffic accident that he's responsible for <UNK> with grief he <UNK> her head in a <UNK> pan or is it <UNK> and <UNK> it full of <UNK> serum <UNK> to keep it alive and then she <UNK> talking her head off so to speak even though her neck was obviously severed at the vocal <UNK> and she has no <UNK> so she couldn't speak even if she had 'em seems the <UNK> b <UNK> doesn't appreciate all that her fiancé has done for her just like a woman br br then his grief turns to <UNK> as he sees the possibility of <UNK> his <UNK> head onto the body of the first sleazy bimbo he can pick up off the street meanwhile the doctor's assistant a sort of dime store <UNK> gets into philosophical arguments with the head who has struck up a <UNK> friendship with the monster in the closet every mad scientist has one eventually the screenwriter realizes that he can't keep <UNK> his <UNK> and fear of <UNK> issues on the audience ad <UNK> so he kills everybody then presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the movie's financial <UNK> have a chance to stop <UNK> on it br br have i mentioned that i think this is a bad movie br br someone should tell turner classic movies to stop showing that edited version without the gory stuff the sight of the assistant with his arm ripped off <UNK> around the house without leaving much blood anywhere is just too precious
<START> <UNK> miyazaki name became prominent with <UNK> away however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts who remembers that spielberg directed duel or george lucas directed <UNK> <UNK> i remember seeing <UNK> of this movie almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual <UNK> of the design and animation so when i found a copy in a well known store for <UNK> i couldn't resist but buy it the odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not <UNK> with my memory of it memory is funny that way br br viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists <UNK> is how very like jean <UNK> <UNK> some of the artwork is i can only assume some influence here br br when <UNK> catches a falling girl <UNK> his adventure really begins the quest for laputa a reference to jonathan <UNK> overlooked portion of <UNK> travels with healthy references to jules <UNK> it's a basic good vs bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on laputa br br this is the portion that is strongest in my memory the <UNK> <UNK> aspect of laputa returned to nature the <UNK> of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree this is in my opinion the highlight of the movie the views of the surface of laputa as opposed to the <UNK> underground br br although this is the <UNK> of this movie to show that even technology cannot overcome nature the irony of the last robot <UNK> the garden and animals the ending of the movie silent running is almost exactly the same br br it is incredibly stylish i would not say <UNK> very beautiful and <UNK> and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings <UNK> and the design and look of just about everything br br <UNK> is a true master of this kind of <UNK> anime buy this movie and treasure it
<START> ugly shot poorly scripted and <UNK> paced sequel to joe <UNK> 1981 classic the howling is one of the two or three only good werewolf films ever made and yet it got <UNK> by a series of obnoxious and <UNK> sequels like this one if it's any <UNK> <UNK> is a sequel in name only and there's absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in <UNK> film the plot here revolves on a <UNK> cult of <UNK> werewolves  primarily female ones  led by <UNK> <UNK> is played by <UNK> <UNK> who transforms from a <UNK> old lady into a blond super babe with impressive <UNK> in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually <UNK> her arch enemy is played by a <UNK> <UNK> christopher lee his character  <UNK> <UNK>  is an occult investigator who travels to <UNK> kingdom accompanied by an american couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult in case you're exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity this is your film even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we're even treated to exploding <UNK> and the vile image of a dwarf who gets <UNK> on a <UNK> fence however if you want a little substance or depth you'll be sorely disappointed the dialogues are embarrassing and there's absolutely no tension to <UNK> anywhere the <UNK> constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires the <UNK> setting <UNK> wooden stakes and <UNK> gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the film's only gimmick during the end credits a shot in which she rips off her top is re edited repeatedly according to my fellow reviewer dr gore no less than <UNK> times which is pretty pathetic and pointless the music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful i'm talking about the fierce looking <UNK> during the opening credits and the dark <UNK> of <UNK> castle the directing by <UNK> <UNK> is a giant mess and  as far as i'm concerned  his only worthwhile film remains the beast within released three years earlier
<START> when hey arnold first came on the air in 1996 i watched it it was one of my favorite shows then the same episodes started getting shown over and over again so i got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it i was sort of surprised when i heard about hey arnold the movie since it doesn't seem to be nearly as popular as some of the other <UNK> cartoons like <UNK> <UNK> nevertheless having nothing better to do i went to see the movie anyway going into the theater i wasn't expecting much i was just expecting it to be a dumb movie version of a <UNK> cartoon like the <UNK> movie was i guess i got what i expected it was a dumb kiddie movie and nothing more there were some good parts here and there but for the most part the movie was a stinker simply for kids
<START> the brain machine will at least put your own brain into <UNK> trying to figure out what it's all about four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the <UNK> as a scientific study of man and environment since the only common <UNK> among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off none of them will be missed br br the whole affair is <UNK> by a mysterious creep known only as the general but it seems he's taking his direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous good call there on the <UNK> part there's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly <UNK> in on who later claims he doesn't take his direction from the general or 'the <UNK> too bad he wasn't more effective he was <UNK> rather easily before the whole thing went <UNK> br br if nothing else the film is a <UNK> treasure <UNK> of 1970's technology featuring repeated shots of <UNK> phones room size computers and a <UNK> machine that won't quit perhaps that was the basis of the film's alternate title time <UNK> nothing else would make any sense as for myself i'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered dr <UNK> experiment titled <UNK> stress <UNK> it applies to the film's actors and viewers alike br br keep an eye out just above the <UNK> head at <UNK> when he asks an agent for his weapon a boom <UNK> is visible above his head for a number of seconds br br you may want to catch this flick if you're a die hard <UNK> <UNK> fan could he have ever been that young james best also appears in a somewhat <UNK> role as a <UNK> <UNK> but don't call him father for something a little more up his alley try to get your hands on <UNK> the killer <UNK> that one at least doesn't pretend to take itself so seriously
<START> what happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they <UNK> to function how alone can one man get when the mundane crap we have to do in order to be part of society gets to be too much what happens <UNK> explores these questions definitely a startling original debut from <UNK> the tone is strange and claustrophobic as we get inside the mind of a guy named keith that is so messed up he can hardly form a proper sentence we follow him around as he tries to make contact with people and function day to day most of us have known people like this people that say sorry too much or i appreciate it when there's nothing to appreciate so we know there are people out there like this but why would someone want to make a movie about them well because its interesting and <UNK> and the lead actor <UNK> mann do an excellent job this film is about as un commercial as a film can get a few friends filmed it over the course of a few years as they saved money it was shot on <UNK> and the <UNK> film look is beautifully low budget with no <UNK> this may be a tough one to find i think it's been screening randomly for the past year or so hopefully it'll be on dvd at some point i saw it at the silent movie theater here in la there were 10 people in the audience among them <UNK> glover if that tells you anything about how weird this movie is highly recommended
<START> holly is an issue driven film but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental at its heart is it is a character driven film which wouldn't be nearly so successful without the fleshed out portrayals of patrick ron <UNK> the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience and holly <UNK> <UNK> the strong <UNK> but ultimately over matched young <UNK> girl from the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing everything is <UNK> and well done the contemporary classical score may put some off at first but it is top notch composition and <UNK> the admirable restraint which is evident throughout this film which raises many issues but provides few clear cut answers ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for holly and the many who share her plight kudos to those who managed to get it made
<START> the tooth fairy is about the ghost of an old <UNK> witch that <UNK> children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives the first few minutes introduce you to the 1949 beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switches to present day the worn out horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid acting they could have done without the <UNK> brothers and a few other scenes but overall the gore scenes were bloody but quick which had a <UNK> effect the eye candy is pretty good for both <UNK> camera work is good dialog is fair but cheesy i expected the film to be a bare bones low budget slasher with very few redeeming factors i was surprised by the quality of the film
<START> there have been more interesting polish documentaries on worm <UNK> in <UNK> the competition worm <UNK> had a better plot and more interesting characters i was physically ill after watching this movie the cheating husband i think <UNK> scott was a joke in every meaning of the word poor jennifer must really need the work and what was with the accent the locations and random <UNK> reminded me of a high school prank and showed the <UNK> of a 10 year old in cooking class it was that bad that i think i will write the sequel named this is not a <UNK> thank you for listening it was a great weight of my conscious
<START> the second care bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor it has a deeper plot better character development and the tunes especially the closing song are both catchy and warm hearted sure the movie tends to over stress caring but come on it is a care bears movie this movie is a great picture to show to kids because it <UNK> friendship love and again caring not to mention the care bears are just too adorable
<START> please note that i haven't seen the film since i discovered it in 2007 and my town is smaller and doesn't carry it however i really want to say something about it i'm actually doing research for university on the title character richard maurice <UNK> and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different hollywood's ideas of people and artistic license granted the real dr <UNK> totally <UNK> <UNK> to cure insanity in women and would never have <UNK> anything as liberal as represented in the film i think it's laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate <UNK> who say this film has some historical basis the only actual fact i can see is the friendship between dr <UNK> and walt <UNK> please don't waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been <UNK> by the film industry
<START> basically a dentist husband wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity the premise is interesting the acting is good and the music although sometimes abrupt and without direction is pretty cool br br the problem is the plot the husband dentist drops his wife off <UNK> at an opera before the show she has a minor role and then walks back in to give her something but sees her with another man the rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode his visual hallucinations and a macho alter ego denis <UNK> a former patient of his and his fear in confronting his wife <UNK> he will have to do something about it i won't tell you the ending but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a <UNK> <UNK> the motivations of the characters are missing why is she cheating on him he's a dentist decent looking good father the film doesn't say who's she doing it with don't expect any answers on that either why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this who knows what purpose does all the kids <UNK> serve where is this film going good performances by campbell scott and hope davis and denis <UNK> as comic relief are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which doesn't know if it wants to be american beauty or a family film a root <UNK> is more interesting avoid it
<START> like many people here i started out finding my patience being tried by this film by the end i actually shed a few tears br br it seems to be in the nature of most old films to drag for 7 <UNK> length and then catch fire right at the end older film goers learned to <UNK> their time <UNK> through the slow parts calm in the knowledge that the big payoff is on the way but that isn't quite accurate you see to earlier audiences what are to us the slow parts were the main body of the story they watched and found <UNK> and <UNK> interest there modern audiences post spielberg are in a constant state of waiting to be hit with a small climax every two minutes when they see older films it's the <UNK> problem of modern movies well that isn't going to happen it is not necessary to apologize for these films it is simply that you have to <UNK> your expectations and personal rhythm when you watch them at this point the difference between <UNK> and the informer is like the difference between <UNK> and a traveling production of rent think about it for a minute or two not to strain at the obvious but <UNK> still deserves a hearing br br the exciting part for most modern viewers begins with the ira <UNK> scene and <UNK> to the final couple of minutes which if you are at all on board or even paying attention by that time will tear your heart out it's not some high tone universal abstract <UNK> for forgiveness it's a <UNK> from one <UNK> and those who feel sorry for the big <UNK> for a little mercy it's that personal and that embarrassingly naked an appeal for after being mad at gypo irritated at him thinking this is the dumbest character of all time you finally find yourself won over by the scene of <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> to another woman to talk her man into going easy him br br the film may be sentimental but the sentimentality is not cheap as some here have charged there's a matter of life and death that plays out here and as long as you take the <UNK> of one life to a <UNK> seriously it's sentimentality <UNK> out of the most serious stuff br br 8 of 10 and the fault for it not being 10 of 10 is my own and in some measure yours if you are reading this we have all asked for more ever more faster ever faster until we cannot put ourselves in <UNK> just yesterday really as easily as we should be able
<START> after seeing the credits with only one name that i recognize and that was the preacher in this film russ <UNK> i did not expect much from this film and i was not disappointed a man is planning on killing his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life <UNK> to the husband is that the plastic looking skull that he uses in contrast a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull a simple plot with a twist of irony at the end if you are tired late one night and in need of sleep this will help you to sleep that sleep
<START> a long time ago i watched this movie from the middle on cable i then had a crush on mary <UNK> i saw her again in eating <UNK> i was convinced that she's the <UNK> woman on screen br br i maybe biased about this movie 9 out of 10 br br <UNK> the only movie i own on original tape
<START> sammi <UNK> a metal rock god they tried to stop him they tried to <UNK> him the tried to <UNK> his music much like the real life dee <UNK> from twisted sister <UNK> gore or <UNK> <UNK> killed in a fire sammi cure was suppose to play on halloween at his old high school for a dance now eddie <UNK> his 1 fan and the only one who knew how sammi was and what he felt or did he <UNK> the d j at the local radio station gene simmons has and gives the only copy of <UNK> last record eddie but when eddie tries to play the record backwards he finds sammi talking to him from the dead and telling him what to do to get back at the bullies at his school that hate him and his music everything works out until sammi starts to kill a great movie and must see for heavy metal <UNK> fans with a great sound track by <UNK> and just in case you don't know what the songs sound like or know <UNK> and doesn't like them they changed there voice a bit and there style as well to sound like the more known cinderella or <UNK> is the movie a true horror movie well that depends on what you call a horror movie to me a true horror movie is a slasher with lots of killing or just plain be scary this movie is neither not enough deaths but it can't be called a action comedy drama suspense or thriller so that is why i would guess it has to be a horror so if you wanna rock <UNK> roll <UNK> on the mid night steel your soul than sammi <UNK> and trick or treat is the for you i mean what are you afraid of it's only rock <UNK> roll
<START> this is a film that has it all the dashing hero the beautiful damsel in distress the noble figure with the tragic flaw and a truly wonderful robot forbidden planet has <UNK> that special magic over the years and doesn't lose its flavor with repeated viewings although the sex appeal of the youthful anne francis helps considerably on that score br br movie fans will recognize the <UNK> leslie <UNK> portraying the handsome and heroic commander adams although those of us who have grown fond of him in comedic roles will perhaps be a bit taken <UNK> by his appearance in a serious role the distinguished and noble looking walter <UNK> is also a featured player as the scientist with a secret id other supporting cast deserve a nod especially warren stevens as the <UNK> and <UNK> doc and of course the charms of miss francis as noted above br br this film was an early <UNK> in the use of electronic music in the 1950s no less the credits call them <UNK> but those of us who tried to <UNK> together early versions of the <UNK> device will recognize the eerie and spooky <UNK> and <UNK> sometimes used in the sound track still it lends to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and <UNK> world of the <UNK> br br the special effects are also quite <UNK> i recall my fear as a <UNK> waiting for the next <UNK> of the invisible id monster and when it is finally <UNK> in the one battle scene it literally <UNK> me to my <UNK> in wonder and awe the magic of <UNK> art is fully exploited in the <UNK> scenes of the <UNK> scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various <UNK> and <UNK> guided by the enigmatic dr <UNK> br br i recall feeling some measure of <UNK> that dr <UNK> would have such a cool toy in the form of <UNK> the robot the persona of <UNK> is quite charming and in some ways he seems more human than some of the other characters viewers of follow on shows like twilight zone and lost in space will recognize the recycled <UNK> prop in some of those episodes although i recall he never had the personality of the original <UNK> br br i must admit to not fully understanding the <UNK> of the plot until i was old enough to understand the various references to <UNK> psychology and the danger of <UNK> the hidden and normally contained fears and rage we carry within but have trained ourselves through force of will to <UNK> and control through <UNK> to societal <UNK> although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed it remains unknown or perhaps deliberately overlooked by dr <UNK> until pointed out by the clear thinking commander adams who forces dr <UNK> to confront the evil within himself it still gives me <UNK> <UNK> when commander adams pushes dr <UNK> down before the <UNK> machine that <UNK> him with superior intellect which opened the <UNK> gates of his <UNK> to the power of the <UNK> machine here here is where your mind was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it still lacked the power to operate the great machine but your <UNK> had been made strong enough <UNK> br br forbidden planet remains probably my favorite sci fi film ever and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful <UNK> and realization on the screen
<START> this is a straight to video movie so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first lion king but that said this was downright good br br my kids loved this but that's a given they love anything that's a cartoon the big shock was that i liked it too it was laugh out loud funny at some parts even the fart jokes had lots of rather creative tie ins with the first movie and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand but without being <UNK> like in shrek do you think he's <UNK> for something br br a special note on the fart jokes i was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises in fact there were almost no noises imagery at all the references were actually rather subtle they actually had a setup punchline etc and were almost in good taste i'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom and this movie is fine in those regards br br hmm what else the music was so so not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie but plenty of fun for the kids no painfully corny moments which was a <UNK> for me a little action but nothing too scary the secret of <UNK> gave my kids nightmares not sure a g rating was appropriate for that one br br all in all i'd say this is a great movie for kids of any age one that's 100 safe to let them watch i try not to be overly sensitive but i've had to jump up and turn off the tv during a few movies that were less kid appropriate than expected but you're safe to leave the room during this one i'd say stick around anyway though you might find that you enjoy it too
<START> just kidding this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it was so bad though that it was hilarious my friend and i <UNK> rented it because it looked so bad cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs the plot <UNK> some of the voices were dubbed the quality was horrendous but i sure had a blast watching it
<START> from it's uninspiring title to the flat acting performances <UNK> is very much an <UNK> film throughout the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin <UNK> name is attached to it and the silly and out of place nod to the rodriguez tarantino flick <UNK> <UNK> till <UNK> these things do not make a great movie however and this is more than evident all the way through <UNK> the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing the mexican music score that <UNK> many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool but it's becomes annoying very quickly especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican it doesn't fit with the tone of the movie the film's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a <UNK> who because of her obsession with grisly murders takes a job with a firm that <UNK> up murder scenes it sounds boring and it is br br william baldwin is the only <UNK> on the cast list and even he doesn't make an impression he hasn't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing he's pretty much wasted angela jones or rather the taxi driver from pulp fiction takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman and it is always clear that it's her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role not her acting ability she may have been good enough in her small role in <UNK> masterpiece but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film and if it weren't for her latino accent she wouldn't convince the audience that she's a weirdo on any level <UNK> is a one hundred percent proof piece of forgettable trash films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics but this one fails on all levels whether you're a tarantino fan william baldwin fan horror fan or just a movie buff this is one to miss
<START> i saw the movie and really could not stop my tears its tragedy that india has no such leaders after freedom who dare to do justice with their own children when they don't behave properly in current generation politicians bring their children's into politics without <UNK> their caliber and skills i remember the dialogue from gandhi <UNK> kind of society we want to create make with such people about harilal ' no wonder that it will be a dream that india will hardly have such leader in this or next generation einstein was right when he said about gandhi that <UNK> 50 years one would hardly believe that such person with body soul and mind <UNK> gandhi had ever lived on this earth ' i sincerely want to thanks a lot to anil kapoor <UNK> khan and all film actors actresses for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son all father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles
<START> if you cannot enjoy a chick flick stop right now if however you enjoy films that illustrate complex characters and provide extraordinary acting read on br br ann grant lord is dying her two daughters arrive to be at her <UNK> ann begins talking about people from her past of whom the daughters are unaware and they question as to whether these lost <UNK> are real or imagined they come to realize that these people from their mother's past are indeed real br br the story shifts basically between 1953 and circa 2000 with a few glimpses at <UNK> life between those years it was in 1953 that ann met the love of her life and experienced her life's greatest tragedy br br one of <UNK> two best friends from college <UNK> is being married <UNK> other best friend is <UNK> brother buddy <UNK> and buddy are the children of a rich <UNK> family whereas ann is a <UNK> singer living in <UNK> village who wants to be a free spirit but is still bound by many of those 1950's conventions br br soon after ann arrives to be maid of honor at <UNK> wedding she meets the person who will become the pivotal character in the lives of the three harris he is the adult son of a former servant of the family who grew up with <UNK> and buddy and has gone on to become a <UNK> in a small new england town ann immediately becomes <UNK> of harris which adds a <UNK> to the fact that <UNK> has always been in love with harris and continues to be buddy also is in love with harris but being 1953 he has <UNK> that homosexual desire for harris to his good friend ann for he cannot admit to himself that he has a sexual <UNK> for another man buddy <UNK> his inner frustration <UNK> by being the alcoholic wise cracking bad boy of the family much to the <UNK> of his very proper and uptight parents br br needless to say all of these expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy after all this is a chick flick br br in the present time <UNK> daughters have become distant from their mother and are suffering their own life <UNK> and doubts <UNK> is working to emotional <UNK> trying to keep up her roll as perfect mother and wife nina having always felt inferior cannot maintain a relationship br br stir all of these relationships into a span of fifty years and you get an intriguing look at society its values and its effects upon the personalities and actions of the complex people involved br br all of the acting in evening is excellent but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes along with two unique family relationships that make this film so very very special br br claire danes plays the 1950's ann and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is conflicted by what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants to do her performance is not easily forgettable br br vanessa redgrave plays the dying ann whose mind shifts from the present to the past to <UNK> of fantasy and of course redgrave pulls it all off with sterling style br br natasha richardson <UNK> real daughter plays <UNK> daughter <UNK> in the film the scenes between this real life mother and daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watch br br toni collette plays <UNK> other daughter nina nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while <UNK> out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister collette is perfect for a part such as this but i have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays br br <UNK> <UNK> plays 1950's <UNK> and shows us a woman even more conflicted of her expected role in life than her good friend ann she is very good br br meryl streep <UNK> mother plays present day <UNK> what is there to say about meryl streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance br br director <UNK> <UNK> states in the dvd extras that he sought out glenn close to play the relatively small part of <UNK> mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film he certainly was right and <UNK> performance in that one scene <UNK> it in your mind all the other scenes in which close is <UNK> very proper mother and you get another performance to treasure br br there are three other scenes in the film combined with the one featuring close described above that make the whole movie worth watching on <UNK> wedding day ann comes into her room and <UNK> into to bed with her friend to discuss <UNK> <UNK> about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love this scene is repeated fifty years later when <UNK> comes and <UNK> into bed with her dying friend ann to talk about the lives they have lived in this latter scene streep and redgrave are enthralling br br the other memorable scene at least to me is when buddy declares his love for ann hugh <UNK> as buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his <UNK> sexual feelings his performance is superior br br chick flick yes a very special film with unbelievable acting directing and scenery definitely i cannot recommend evening too much
<START> i'm a nice guy and i like to think of myself as genre <UNK> and i guess by that i mean i try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it <UNK> in if nothing else that saves me from feeling like i should be saying really nasty things about people or films which i don't like doing br br the plot in this one was <UNK> obvious the production values very low and sets <UNK> simplistic the acting rose into good for a high school play territory from time to time my feeling was this was filmed in a day please tell me it was br br worst of all the sex while reasonably <UNK> was fairly mundane <UNK> by at least in my copy a sound over that was inconsistent with the action climatic <UNK> and <UNK> while lying on a bed <UNK> a <UNK> there was definitely no edge to it at all nothing <UNK> or interesting and with surprisingly quick cuts br br my vote is a 1 then with the following summary statement would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded and the rest of the movie <UNK>
<START> after a series of power <UNK> on a remote island <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are on the loose and <UNK> residents of the island man the sci fi channel has made some bad original movies but i think this might possibly be their worst so far this badly written and directed jurassic park rip off offers all the usual clichés mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are <UNK> <UNK> characters walking down long dark <UNK> alone brain dead teen characters who's only function in the film is to die a horrible death etc and <UNK> no suspense whatsoever the special effects are <UNK> puppet heads in close ups of the title <UNK> are bad enough looking like stiff <UNK> dolls but the <UNK> makes the computer generated dinosaurs in walking with dinosaurs look life like by <UNK> just downright awful there's some gore but most of it looks pretty unconvincing oh and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst things i've seen in years i couldn't even laugh it was so bad br br don't waste your time this one is just downright bad br br 2 10 br br oh and here's some interesting trivia for <UNK> film borrowed music <UNK> from the 2003 sci fi film alien hunter which was far superior to this piece of crap
<START> i got to see the movie on thin ice on the television in india i must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine the basic story makes me <UNK> what makes certain <UNK> decide to move on where as others still remain addicted br br however i felt that diane keaton was at her best the scene where she has <UNK> and begins <UNK> her home for cocaine was the best the two boys are good and <UNK> <UNK> also showed what a good actress she is the script is well done as is the cinematography and direction and casting br br a must must watch movie for everyone
<START> <UNK> this film is but it is funny as all get out it shows the boys locker room mentality being played by the other side it is good to see such <UNK> turned and how silly they are but that's probably not news to most women 'cause just ask one they've heard 'em all before br br watch it with a small group or party of mixed gender and <UNK> 3 of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight and the other 2 7 can you ever really please them
<START> here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film a sub genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so i've heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie and as much as i hate to be redundant the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything the punch bowl over poor <UNK> head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie hey everyone this is the director and the following is my carrie rip off scene enjoy ' but that's just a suggestion br br spoilers the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning she gets killed people wonder in the old oh but that stuff only happens to other people tone and then they start to get killed the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful but they have no idea how to do it take jason for example here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he <UNK> the check on a date according to what each person had and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated he is assumed to carry some significance besides that and more importantly he has the same <UNK> as the little boy that all the girls <UNK> in sixth grade and the same <UNK> that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious <UNK> day cards br br it is not <UNK> for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully <UNK> by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects and jason is a perfect example of the effort but not such a good example of a successful effort sure i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer but that's not the point we know from early on that he is terrible with women which <UNK> him to the little boy at the beginning of the film but then in the middle of the film he appears at a party smiles <UNK> at two of the main girls and then gives them a hateful look and walks away disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation we already know he is a cardboard character but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him br br on the positive side the killer's true identity was in fact made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also unfortunately yet another rip off early in the film when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own <UNK> he makes no sound suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female rather than a male as everyone suspects but then for the rest of the film we just have this <UNK> relentless <UNK> killer with the <UNK> mask and that gigantic butcher knife director jamie <UNK> who with all due respect looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade mentions being influenced by halloween this is of course completely unnecessary because it's so obvious from how badly he <UNK> the film the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael <UNK> is that michael's mask was so much more effective and he didn't have a problem with <UNK> this stuff is shameless br br at the end there is a brief attempt to <UNK> us one more time as to who the killer is complete with slow and drawn out and the killer <UNK> mask <UNK> but then we see <UNK> nose start to bleed as he holds kate his often reluctant girlfriend and we know that he's been the killer all along nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act and these unexplained <UNK> were not exactly the <UNK> way to identify the true killer at the end of the film valentine is not scary i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember and even i wasn't scared and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren't so obvious that they were just going to die i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews although the film was in and out of the <UNK> faster than battlefield earth but the end result is the same old thing
<START> i thought this was a very good movie it would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off i'm sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending that's why this made this move such a good movie it shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it's 2 sisters dealing with a boy the same boy that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them it's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over i really enjoyed watching this movie and i still do now when it comes on i seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on it would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died this way it would keep him alive even though he's dead
<START> this a great disney flick it is the story of an aging high school baseball coach dennis quaid who was once on his way to the big <UNK> as a <UNK> but suffered a career ending injury but through series of events jimmy morris quaid gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the <UNK> this is a great family film it is inspirational but doesn't pour it on too thick it's fun and entertaining adults will enjoy this movie as well as kids it is based upon a true story though i'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story quaid is sensational as the title character very convincing if you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy look no further 9 10
<START> i sought this film out because i'm a new <UNK> fan and wanted to see more of his work first of all his irish accent is great he's got a keen ear for <UNK> it seems his acting was marvelous as usual james <UNK> aside i thought the film was very well done it showed the conflict in northern ireland as the mess it really is both sides are guilty of grave <UNK> and the men drawn into the conflict usually have very little to say about their circumstances br br also it is interesting to realise that not every man or woman that is supposedly fighting for his country is really doing just that for example when kenny james <UNK> asks ginger ian hart why he does it ginger can't come up with a morally acceptable answer why because ginger isn't in it for the noble cause of protecting his country or the rights of his fellow <UNK> ginger is in it for the fun of killing he's full of blood lust and it's the perfect job for a guy like him in a struggle like this there are guys like liam john lynch who just want to live their daily lives and enjoy their families guys that see all of the fighting just <UNK> more fighting there are guys like kenny that are born leaders full of charisma and they add fuel to the flames rather they mean to or not also kenny genuinely believes in the cause he believes what he is doing will make a difference in the future which is a bit odd 'cause his character seems too intelligent for it all but like a lot of other seemingly intelligent men he is sucked into a gang lifestyle not even realizing it <UNK> it's too late then there is ginger a pure psycho who isn't in the fighting for any other reason but for the sheer thrill of it which in a <UNK> type war makes him a <UNK> asset some might argue however now in this film ginger has out lasted his worth and has become a very dangerous loose cannon br br everything comes to a <UNK> point and predictably the ending is a tragic one what makes this film worthy is that is shows both sides of this ages old conflict being american i can't begin to fully understand what all struggle is about but i do know there has to be a better way br br all in all a well acted touching but <UNK> film
<START> this movie is intelligent that is more than most other movies it <UNK> the least common <UNK> stupid people will probably not appreciate it the story also relies heavily on dialogue it has some parallels to lost in translation although before sunrise is much <UNK> somehow less abstract and simply a lot better br br the script the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic the actors play absolutely brilliantly rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has <UNK> this perfectly together br br the dialogue moves into very personal issues with the risk of becoming a little over the top it does however stay on the right side almost all the time although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing <UNK> on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors sometimes it <UNK> great results and overall this movie is simply <UNK> only very very rarely is love in films depicted in a way that i find <UNK> and realistic every time that is achieved the result is fantastic i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect she still looks stunning in this film 12 years after br br this is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss one of the best movies i have seen from the 1990s
<START> it must be assumed that those who praised this film the greatest filmed opera ever didn't i read somewhere either don't care for opera don't care for wagner or don't care about anything except their desire to appear <UNK> either as a representation of <UNK> <UNK> song or as a movie this strikes me as an <UNK> disaster with a <UNK> reading of the score matched to a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the text br br it's questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio <UNK> very <UNK> but without the smallest justification from <UNK> text decided that <UNK> is about <UNK> <UNK> so that the title character in the latter stages <UNK> into a kind of <UNK> babe though one who continues to sing high <UNK> few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of <UNK> jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of <UNK> and also appears <UNK> in double exposure as a kind of <UNK> or conductor who ate <UNK> during the playing of the good friday music in which by the way the <UNK> <UNK> of nature is represented by a <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> stuck in ill laid <UNK> an <UNK> which <UNK> me in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such <UNK> with our thoughts but i can't think why <UNK> couldn't <UNK> in for <UNK> and <UNK> mountain <UNK> as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of music br br the sound is hard to endure the high voices and the <UNK> in particular <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> that adds another sort of <UNK> to our <UNK> with the uninspired <UNK> and <UNK> unfolding of the ritual someone in another review mentioned the 1951 <UNK> recording and <UNK> though his <UNK> are often very slow had what jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the <UNK> and flow of the music and after half a century the <UNK> sound in that set in modern <UNK> is still superior to this film
<START> just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film i decided to write another review i missed a few things out last time br br first the script second the acting third jesus christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when joseph <UNK> finally gets blown away in a very <UNK> climax br br i can't believe i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a <UNK> or something br br are you getting the picture
<START> a <UNK> darkly minority report blade runner sin city and sky captain and the world of tomorrow  if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking out br br french animation project <UNK> took seven years to make on a <UNK> budget and tonight i finally got to see it at a private screening for the international film festival in <UNK> my spontaneous reaction is awe my further reflection is <UNK> <UNK> and closer analysis <UNK> gets a <UNK> <UNK> it is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes <UNK> apparent as do the flat characters br br nevertheless it is clear that the people at <UNK> films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface the visuals are <UNK> they have used live action motion capture <UNK> into key frame animation with stark jet black and bright white <UNK> and a heavily <UNK> <UNK> background for those of you who are not down with the <UNK> <UNK> the film looks like a fully animated sin city its fluid transparent dark and stylized <UNK> is <UNK> by great lurid lightning it's a vision yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of <UNK> futuristic weapons suspenseful music heavy <UNK> and glass <UNK> breaking it's every tech <UNK> wet dream br br the film <UNK> in on an <UNK> lit bleak <UNK> paris in which a major corporation called <UNK> has begun to <UNK> in the lives of the citizens with <UNK> think the fluid transparent screens from minority report and genetic <UNK> the latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young <UNK> <UNK> voiced by the lovely <UNK> <UNK> cut to our hard boiled cop on suspension and protagonist <UNK> daniel craig  a man who takes the law into his own hands  who is assigned the case of finding and <UNK> <UNK> during this case he is being aided by <UNK> sister with whom he also begins a love affair a very half <UNK> love affair if i may say so br br the world of renaissance is remarkable director christian <UNK> takes a fair <UNK> at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with <UNK> rats femme <UNK> and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy <UNK> the problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled out <UNK> in the story or the film would have been too surreal for mainstream audiences <UNK> to its lurid animation format it follows then that we have a <UNK> of clichéd characters such as evil laughing villains sleazy crime bosses and butch tough chicks who blow smoke every chance they get it <UNK> noir in our faces and it isn't necessary br br what is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived it seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of <UNK> the plot this is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction daniel craig helps here too by bringing a no nonsense attitude to his hard edged cop character at one point in renaissance he is seen in a vivid car chase that surely is one of the most <UNK> <UNK> and top notch sequences of the film unfortunately the novelty of the sci fi visuals have worn off post this car chase and <UNK> could benefit from being slightly shorter in summary a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience br br 7 out of 10
<START> the movie is <UNK> in religion so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it in my opinion this movie pretends to explore deep issues but <UNK> on stereotypes and prejudices with little true insight what the people in the movie and therefore the writer failed to see was grace they failed to understand that god is the author of beauty and he is the creator of passion and sexual <UNK> in the proper context of marriage bonds to imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is <UNK> and both the man the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty is just an <UNK> such stereotypes really don't exist for even jewish holy <UNK> speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife's pleasure before his own <UNK> says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh and that no man ever hated his own flesh but he <UNK> and <UNK> it even if you want to ignore the new testament the writers characters completely ignore that there are <UNK> such as the song of <UNK> in the old testament and the even the book of <UNK> which says <UNK> in the wife of <UNK> youth let her breasts satisfy you always how can that be read in any way other way than that god knows and <UNK> of and smiles on the marital union and the enjoyment thereof real men don't ignore the value and needs of their wives those that do deny a very basic teaching of the <UNK> christian religion god never said those things it's absurd <UNK> <UNK> because of the <UNK> of the <UNK> of the true god of abraham it didn't need to be so how sad what <UNK> desperately needed was truth not tradition in knowing loving and <UNK> god we love others more before ourselves that is the faith of the god of abraham <UNK> <UNK> joseph once for all delivered to the saints bought paid for by jesus christ the righteous but alright ignore all this and abandon ancient holy <UNK> and turn to the wisdom of homeless people ghosts that's a good plan i would never recommend this movie partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic but also because it really doesn't offer any valuable insight check out <UNK> if you want to see a much more useful treatment of jewish tradition at odds with society
<START> freddy's dead did the <UNK> thing it could've done after the disappointment of the fifth film it started from scratch sure this final film in the saga is silly but at least it's original some of the visuals are even a bit breath taking and the story of freddy's kid lisa zane returning to town to face her evil father is unique br br overall the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater it has a bunch of good actors zane <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter it's one sided it's a magic trick and in the end it's nothing but goofy childish entertainment br br
<START> johnny dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it's overblown gags and complete lack of a <UNK> script or story that makes any sense but that's the point right br br the cast is likable michael keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed <UNK> dunne peter boyle joe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and danny <UNK> all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me but the complete scene <UNK> here is richard <UNK> <UNK> the word <UNK> into movie history as a mobster who <UNK> best at murdering the english language br br i associate many childhood memories with this film as i watched it quite often so maybe i'm prone to enjoy it more than many others johnny dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even <UNK> some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking and sex br br i like it but it's hard to recommend br br 7 out of 10
<START> than this what would happen if terry gilliam and douglas adams would have worked together on one movie this movie starts with a touch of brazil when at a certain point the story moves straight into the twilight zone bringing up nothing new but just nothing and nothing is great fun when dave and andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable <UNK> heads well yes br br anyway this movie was imho the biggest surprise at this year's <UNK> br br just like in cube and cypher natali gave this one a <UNK> weird but very special design which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time timeless somehow
<START> 1958 the sleepy small southern town of <UNK> evil sheriff roy <UNK> the almighty <UNK> <UNK> in peak nasty form cracks down super hard on <UNK> by forcing said <UNK> off a cliff to their <UNK> deaths on an especially dangerous stretch of road <UNK> meets his match when cool young hot rod driver michael <UNK> a <UNK> smooth and brooding portrayal by martin sheen shows up in town in his <UNK> up <UNK> with the specific intention of <UNK> the death of his brother <UNK> real life sibling joe <UNK> in a brief cameo director richard t <UNK> working from a taut and intriguing script by richard <UNK> the same guy who directed the 70's drive in movie gems welcome home soldier boys and <UNK> county line relates the gripping story at a <UNK> pace neatly creates a <UNK> 50's period setting and <UNK> <UNK> plenty of suspense out the tense game of wit and <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> the uniformly fine cast helps a lot sheen <UNK> a <UNK> james <UNK> rebellious vibe in the lead <UNK> makes the most out of his <UNK> bad guy part plus there are excellent supporting performances by michelle phillips as sweet diner waitress maggie stuart <UNK> as a <UNK> deputy nick nolte as <UNK> gas station attendant buzz <UNK> gary morgan as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> younger brother <UNK> <UNK> baldwin as sassy local <UNK> sissy <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> cab driver johnny and <UNK> downs as the stern judge j a hooker the climactic <UNK> confrontation between <UNK> and <UNK> is a real pulse <UNK> white <UNK> thrilling <UNK> terry k <UNK> sharp cinematography the well drawn characters for example <UNK> became obsessed with <UNK> <UNK> after his wife and kid were killed in a fatal hit and run incident the <UNK> <UNK> score by <UNK> de jesus and the beautiful <UNK> scenery all further enhance the overall sound quality of this superior made for tv winner
<START> i love the book jane eyre and have seen many versions of it all have their strong points and their faults however this was one of the worst i have seen i didn't care about jane or mr rochester charlotte <UNK> jane was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part but she had no emotion in any of her lines i couldn't imagine what mr rochester saw in her br br that brings us to mr rochester william hurt had even less emotion than jane if that were possible how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery but it certainly didn't hold my attention perhaps the director <UNK> fell asleep during the production br br the timothy dalton too handsome for mr rochester version is far more faithful to the book but <UNK> <UNK> plays the perfect mr rochester in the 1997 a e version which is not all that true to the book br br trying to find something positive about this movie <UNK> <UNK> was perfect in her role
<START> many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been attempted that may be so but the addition of the narrator and dr <UNK> like scenery makes this show a must watch with adult innuendo throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set the show is both reminiscent and <UNK> the <UNK> portion of the show is not what drags viewers in the twisted plot and love lines scattered throughout this seeming paradise are what keep loyal viewers coming back for more this is a success that abc should never let go of bravo abc lost was getting old way to <UNK> prime time 9 episodes prior to the writers strike left audiences wanting more
<START> the <UNK> aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob <UNK> although his career must have been <UNK> <UNK> after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock br br the lame <UNK> of the <UNK> aspect to the show is <UNK> in one episode co starring lou diamond phillips which just <UNK> that this show is the last <UNK> of the damned in order to catch a fugitive the <UNK> uses some theory about <UNK> so he gives this long explanation that if we have seen the suspect in places a b and c then we can use bubble theory to <UNK> where he might be he does this all on a <UNK> or maybe with a stick in the dirt i cant remember br br anyway when you look at the finished product he basically took three spots and picked a point right in the middle and said ok <UNK> here's where we are most likely to find the fugitive at which point one other character points out oh that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live is that <UNK> its not even connect the f k g <UNK> this show reminds me of the <UNK> major i used to work with in <UNK> who had a <UNK> analysis he could do to support points that every one else had already agreed on through either less complex analysis or basic common sense br br it just goes to show when you're a hammer everything looks like a nail i can't wait <UNK> they stick the <UNK> team on <UNK> they'll use <UNK> call an <UNK> in the middle of the mountains and hit <UNK> and not even scratch the five children he uses as human <UNK> <UNK> hey its all about the numbers br br totally ludicrous tv show
<START> film <UNK> of old tv shows seems to be the norm in hollywood these days but this <UNK> toilet humor do you kiss your mother with that mouth foul language rip off is a blatant middle finger to all dukes of hazzard fans both north and south of the mason dixon line from the opening sequence of bo and luke duke making a <UNK> run for uncle jesse no shine running in the show because it would put the boys back in jail as a <UNK> <UNK> to the closing sequence of uncle jesse smoking <UNK> with the <UNK> of georgia uncle jesse was the moral <UNK> despite his previous <UNK> ways this disappointing waste of film is an open faced insult i can't tell you how many parents i saw get up and remove their children from the theater within the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized that they had been horribly <UNK> the original dukes of hazzard was a family show with basic moral values the original dukes of hazzard was a kid safe <UNK> powered show of fun that parents didn't have to worry about teaching their kids george <UNK> seven words i have read reviews stating that the show and the movie are nothing but racist those commits might be correct about the movie those commits are absolutely incorrect about the show the show if anything was about how to get along and be friends with anyone hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us <UNK> rebel or otherwise who still believe in honor loyalty trust family and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing hollywood has finally brought to light its belief that those of us in the <UNK> are stupid <UNK> beer <UNK> foul mouthed trash that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell prove the hollywood <UNK> that they are wrong do not go see this movie <UNK> the <UNK> fill warner bros email and <UNK> mail boxes with complaints that we don't appreciate them destroying one of the greatest t v shows of all time save your money and buy the dvd's of the original show but whatever you <UNK> do not go see this movie
<START> the <UNK> is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it it seems so light the humor is always medium <UNK> never unfunny but never gut <UNK> the story is a very simple thread the characteristics of the plot are often recycled features namely the <UNK> bad guy in need of a pal and the straight laced glass wearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow <UNK> each other's <UNK> i also find the <UNK> parallel to the story unnecessary as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself however it really is a good film because though it seemed so thin and <UNK> at the time it wasn't it has a subtle way of connecting with the audience br br i believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though it's a formula that is nothing new even most of the humor both main characters virtually the only characters in it are somehow met and gotten to know forget calling them real that's not at all what i mean what i mean is that though pierce <UNK> filthy <UNK> <UNK> hit man is a detached comical character he's <UNK> firmly by the writer and definitely by brosnan who is <UNK> <UNK> how much he enjoys his breath of fresh james <UNK> air greg <UNK> character seems quite the same in his detached <UNK> but he's given certain very unexpected <UNK> that for a moment due to the film's <UNK> pass us by but then hit us only a moment later we then realize the film is not simply analyze this or planes trains and <UNK> told <UNK> over again its truly saying something br br the film's climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists but with its <UNK> how can that possibly be the focus of the film though the plot has been leading up to it no the focus is what brosnan and kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other strangely the <UNK> is a film about regret and loneliness brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day and though we don't understand why kinnear is so <UNK> and accepting with brosnan continually <UNK> his life it's slowly understood that brosnan is <UNK> kinnear from a more down to earth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption the very last scene of the movie stays with me it i think is where the film's subtle side stepping impact finally begins to <UNK>
<START> fever pitch has many of the clichés we have come to identify with hollywood romantic comedies a relationship between two people with little in common the secret he's been hiding that she discovers the inevitable <UNK> and the very public  well i won't go any further but you get the picture in spite of its predictability it works especially if you love baseball as i do though i'm not quite as obsessive as ben <UNK> a boston <UNK> played by saturday night live comedian jimmy fallon br br adapted from a novel by nick <UNK> by veteran screenplay writers <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ben is a <UNK> boston red sox fan whose uncle gave him season tickets when he was seven years old and he's been kind of stuck emotionally at that point all of his life to the <UNK> of his relationships with women ben is not just a fan but a fanatic who travels to <UNK> meyers florida each winter for the red sox spring training games and never misses a home game during the regular season his family does not consist of parents or siblings but the fellow <UNK> who attend each game with him and his bedroom is not a place to sleep but a red sox museum to visit br br when he falls for business <UNK> lindsay <UNK> drew barrymore he is threatened with the possibility of having to grow up but ben is not quite ready to do that he would rather attend the <UNK> series than go with her to <UNK> to meet her parents or to go to paris with her and miss the <UNK> series it takes his relationship being on the verge of <UNK> for him to stop and think about his <UNK> especially when a <UNK> size dr phil wannabe asks him you love the red sox but have they ever loved you back while the premise of fever pitch is that some things are more important than baseball <UNK> the thought you would never know it from the way things turn out of course to any one familiar with the history of the boston red sox it is a team that will break the hearts of its most die hard fans but this is 2004 the year the curse of the <UNK> came to an end and as the red sox move to a new level ben might just do the same both lead performances are excellent and the <UNK> brothers even manage a pretty gross gag while fever pitch will never be mistaken for an art film it is a <UNK> romp that will have to go down as one of my guilty pleasures go blue <UNK>
<START> it started out with an interesting premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best in the latter half it quickly became a c movie then d then f then i wish that this wasn't a rental so that i could put it in the <UNK> i can't say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the writing however i never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a 10 year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of <UNK> i really hated this movie as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity this movie did a great <UNK> to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it i strongly recommend superman 4
<START> i am glad being able to say almost only positive things about the movie with <UNK> and the <UNK> sisters renaissance br br and firstly that it looks as it ought to look a <UNK> adventure renaissance is the tale of a <UNK> investigation in search of a missing young <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> for the <UNK> company br br the tale of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> is though much less known than sin city the better movie and the one more appreciated by the <UNK> to the french comics <UNK> it will be even more meaningful i have <UNK> my french comics collection last week though i'm not so <UNK> the atmosphere the music the characters their lines the plot are all nice and endearing a <UNK> top cop <UNK> is displayed to find a young woman who was a rising star of <UNK> research <UNK> <UNK> mildly hot blonde whose rebel sister <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> i guess br br for me an <UNK> <UNK> of comics and tv series renaissance a <UNK> beautiful cartoon was like a replay of a wild wild west <UNK> a <UNK> past replaced with an equally <UNK> <UNK> jaded and <UNK> but in a sense as thrilling renaissance is not suspenseful nor does it look especially <UNK> but it's <UNK> and hypnotic moreover it achieves <UNK> albeit briefly a world a true <UNK> we will think about the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> sisters and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> telling of his distant childhood in <UNK>  i liked <UNK> feel of a certain <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and also the professional assured look among these new cartoons this one and <UNK> dick adaptation the only and first dick adaptation ever stood out for me as works of beauty and genuine excitement br br i thought the futuristic devices were appropriate and when not conventional vividly eerie like the <UNK> costumes br br as <UNK> the characters have exotic names like <UNK> and <UNK> mostly gathered from the arts and <UNK> world <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK>  br br none seems to have noticed that <UNK> poster features a rourke look <UNK> guy is <UNK> which doesn't make it a sin city rip off but not a <UNK> of originality either and in fact there's more resemblance to the miller <UNK> the bleak futuristic look of a <UNK> society the <UNK> of the hero in fact a cross of <UNK> character and <UNK> persona in the previous movie  <UNK> the other hand this cartoon <UNK> a more public air a <UNK> of straight <UNK> and in a word it's like sin city for <UNK> <UNK> kids i mean 'cause there's a bit of nudity on display to what i have said one might <UNK> that the traits mentioned are characteristic even as clichés and common places of the futuristic more adult <UNK> look true enough and it was <UNK> miller to have brought that things on screen and renaissance bears some <UNK> here and there now it's also fair that every ring ought to have its <UNK> so to each sin city its renaissance i admit being quite partial to these bleak futuristic tales a rather <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the group of people are travelling to <UNK> in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son who likes to drive with his eyes closed their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nation s spirit in 1941 and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes the man who steals the show is a <UNK> 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him in the end the movie takes one <UNK> turn and the trip becomes nothing but a <UNK> s song of a dying country
<START> spoilers all too often hollywood's shakespeare adaptations entertaining pieces of cinema beautifully shot they are well performed and faithful to the text films including branagh's henry v and <UNK> much <UNK> about nothing are powerful pieces of work watching <UNK> <UNK> lost therefore it's such a huge disappointment for expectation to be so <UNK> thrown to waste sadly <UNK> <UNK> lost is awful the king of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his friends have <UNK> drink and women for three years to focus on their studies plans begin to fall apart however when the enigmatic princess of france alicia <UNK> and her <UNK> arrive soon love is in the air and philosophy is off the <UNK> mind br br from the start you realise that this film is not quite shakespeare cleverly <UNK> into a 1930s musical by ken branagh the plot is still there and the script remains but now it has been sacrificed in favour of dire musical taste classics like the way you look tonight let's face the music and dance i'm in heaven are all destroyed by weak singing and a strong feel that they just don't belong here br br aside from weak singing we are also treated to an increasingly large number of awkward performances by regular stars ken branagh and friends might enjoy making this film but they provide us with a stomach turning collection of roles br br the main eight actors four men four women are all equally dire and the only positive on their behalf is a vast improvement on the truly dreadful timothy <UNK> br br in fact only one individual leaves the film worthy of any praise and that's the consistently magnificent nathan lane lane has proved over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this feature he once again adds an air of humour to the <UNK> <UNK> br br there's little else to be said really <UNK> <UNK> lost deserves mild praise for branagh's original take on an old tale unfortunately though that's where the <UNK> end <UNK> acted performed sang and constructed <UNK> <UNK> lost is perhaps the weakest shakespeare adaptation of the last forty years it should be avoided like the plague and should never have been made a poor disappointing choice by branagh and here's hoping his next effort is better
<START> while there aren't any talking animals big lavish song production numbers or <UNK> with half white half black hair it does have 1 thing realistic people acting normally in a strange <UNK> and walt roy did in their <UNK> with the studio if you thought think the <UNK> or the island at the top of the world weren't identical or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis then your <UNK> is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a <UNK> cartoon
<START> as i sat in front of the tv watching this movie i thought oh what alfred hitchcock or even brian <UNK> could have done with this chances are you will too it does start out <UNK> a british park ranger living in los angeles <UNK> <UNK> marries a pretty <UNK> brunette woman lisa zane whom he met in a park only a short time ago then one day she <UNK> the police are unable to find any <UNK> that she ever existed and <UNK> <UNK> his own search so far so good just as he's about to give up he turns to his <UNK> best friend billy zane and they stumble onto her former life in l a 's <UNK> underground of drugs <UNK> and <UNK> filmmaking and then to her history of mental <UNK> at that point <UNK> life is in danger and the film falls apart none of the characters from lisa <UNK> past are remotely interesting the film moves slowly and there's very little action there is a subplot regarding missing drug money but it's just a throwaway no chases no <UNK> sequences and no suspense just some dull <UNK> and a lot of chat by boring characters one thing worth noting lisa zane and billy zane are brother and sister but they never appear in a scene together by the end of the movie you're torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake

<START> nicolas <UNK> is a failure a <UNK> in a bank everyone walks all over him then his friend a writer who's books no one likes has a plan to change his life our hero tells his boss he is <UNK> he <UNK> to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women and he manages to do just that br br if it were not for the amount of death murder suicide natural causes in the film this would be a farce there are numerous <UNK> at marriage politics <UNK> and life br br jean louis <UNK> is a likable amoral rogue <UNK> schneider is at her most appealing definitely worth a look
<START> i first heard of this movie after <UNK> the 1976 flick snuff i was told that devil's experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to <UNK> either this movie or the second one so my interest was <UNK> br br devil's experiment is a short film with no story no character development just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes they torture her in various ways like beating her spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol forcing her to listen to hi pitched noise for 24 hours smash her hand with a <UNK> burning and putting <UNK> on the burns throwing guts at her and ultimately <UNK> a sharp <UNK> through her eye br br i must say that a lot of this movie was fake like the beating scenes but then some of it was actually well done as far as <UNK> you out the scenes in which the woman is being <UNK> around in circles was making me <UNK> watching it or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about the worst is the eye scene i didn't <UNK> when watching it but simply thought damn that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie i did enjoy the flick but i don't know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer 7 10
<START> wow something of a surprise though flawed it is far better that i expected br br the brand new space liner <UNK> with some 3 000 passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to <UNK> without warning the <UNK> cerebral central computer sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to <UNK> br br soon there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the <UNK> <UNK> penny the captain cary and the director of the <UNK> line <UNK> br br it turns out that the alarm was false and that the main cerebral is acting br br <UNK> the remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship and br br avoid personal conflicts in order to survive br br the film starts out very well the opening commercial is a very nice touch there are obvious parallels to 2001 a space odyssey and to the historic br br sinking of the titanic the film does slow down at times and has pacing br br problems but is generally well made and well acted
<START> are highlights of this <UNK> feature the pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan <UNK> after her father dies on an island off the coast of scotland the villagers live the simple lives of fisher folk my copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery and the camera work on <UNK> is splendid maurice <UNK> directed pickford in this pleasant film pickford was already a major star in <UNK> and this film seems to have been written just for her <UNK> young woman succeeds over misfortune pickford whip <UNK> lazy villagers toward church is very funny and the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done not a great <UNK> film but still worth seeing matt moore pickford was married to his brother owen moore is the love interest and is good as the <UNK> island <UNK> <UNK> joy is one of the villagers but i couldn't spot her either my copy <UNK> lots of <UNK> and <UNK> and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning <UNK> are <UNK> very effective
<START> this film is deeply disappointing not only that <UNK> only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blues it is his <UNK> and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple who were <UNK> with j b <UNK> and show their private video footage as well as tell stories <UNK> introduction of the <UNK> topic starts off quite interestingly <UNK> to world's culture or actually american culture traveling in space but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating <UNK> of stories from the 30s <UNK> this movie as a mere sleeping aid yawn i had expected more of him
<START> doc savage the man of <UNK> is a horrible movie poorly scripted over acted and just plain silly that being said it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level this movie begs to be watched in a group with an ample supply of cheap beer it's one of those movies like santa claus <UNK> the martians or <UNK> the hunter from the future so bad it is almost good if you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch it's campy it's fun it has a theme by <UNK> if you're looking for a good movie though look elsewhere 3 10 br br btw i've heard rumors some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake
<START> like a <UNK> named desire also directed by <UNK> both on stage and screen panic in the streets depicts a new orleans in which its major claim to fame the <UNK> of jazz doesn't even rate a mention it was richard <UNK> seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer <UNK> himself appears in an uncredited small role as a <UNK> attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with jack palance still being billed as walter jack palance as the local mr <UNK> followed side kick zero mostel barbara <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> meyer tommy <UNK> plus the rock solid ever reliable paul douglas as the cop who comes round to doc <UNK> point of view it's a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen catch it if you can
<START> i kind of liked the lonely lady give pia a break she looks great and she has really nice eyes what's not to like the scene where she gets raped by ray liotta with a garden <UNK> was kind of gross and cruel actually a lot of stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel but its a trashy movie a lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad i liked this better than valley of the dolls which was not only trashy but boring as well at least this wasn't boring br br pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer watching her talk about <UNK> and byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable i'm sure <UNK> a nice person in real life she just doesn't project the writer vibe she looked much happier when she was working as a <UNK> for that guy from saturday night fever and wearing a <UNK> disco dress br br a couple of the scenes are funny the one where she tells the two timing actor that she's pregnant and he rolls his eyes and <UNK> at her to stop hanging around all the while he's practically <UNK> over every bimbo who <UNK> by br br <UNK> nervous breakdown scene is good it was probably a mistake to go so <UNK> on it the <UNK> of floating faces and freeze frame scream <UNK> and her subsequent <UNK> <UNK> is kind of overdone br br the acceptance speech is a hoot though i want to see someone do that speech in a drama class br br but again this is trash we're talking about you could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties
<START> this movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art what strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed besides following the play like a tv broadcast there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games this brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory today's tv <UNK> style so different than that of 1986 is still inferior in quality compared to this movie br br the players are not the only stars the audience the <UNK> the <UNK> covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history in this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way in that regard today's tv <UNK> style has not yet reached this level of quality although it is now much closer than before br br there are several <UNK> players <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> france <UNK> england <UNK> germany <UNK> o spain <UNK> brazil and <UNK> mexico br br this movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of mexico 1986 although most of them are well covered across all the movie there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves this is what makes this movie so interesting and unique br br because of what happened because of <UNK> during mexico 1986 much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely <UNK> biased much of these comments do not take into account that there is a <UNK> and two <UNK> that they are as human as the players and that all of the <UNK> make mistakes one way or the other soccer rules do not allow <UNK> to use tv based <UNK> to make decisions so for the most part <UNK> have to decide on what they perceive as a consequence <UNK> play an active part in the development of a game their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie br br the sequel movie for the 1990 world cup compared to this one is just a source of bitter disappointment much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game whereas this movie tells things from a more distant <UNK> point of view
<START> if you've seen this movie you've been to puerto rico i've lived in puerto rico all my life and have to <UNK> admit that we <UNK> are living a real chaos right now drugs being the main reason for the shootings and killings we have almost every day these people will shoot anyone anytime and anywhere and many innocent lives have been lost because of this we don't feel safe anymore and in addition to this our so called justice is no longer moved by truth and <UNK> but by money influence and power <UNK> y <UNK> is based on real <UNK> facts and truly portrays puerto <UNK> three main problems the drug related killings money and power <UNK> our <UNK> and innocent people and children being <UNK> and even dying because of this <UNK> and his wife <UNK> with their true to life plot and their award winning direction were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is puerto rico is a beautiful and friendly country living a nightmare that doesn't seem to end they recently won the <UNK> wing award for best director in the world cinema competition at the 2006 phoenix film festival
<START> i don't know the stars or modern chinese teenage music but i do know a thoroughly entertaining movie when i see one br br kung fu <UNK> is pure hollywood in its values it's played for laughs for love and is a great blend of kung fu and basketball br br everybody looks like they had a lot of fun making this the production values are excellent and modern china looks <UNK> than los angeles here br br the plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school only to be kicked out and then discover <UNK> as a basketball play and love and more etc is great this is fresh fun and immensely entertaining br br with great action and good dialogue this is one simply to enjoy for all ages and for our money was one of the best family movies we're seen in a long time br br please ignore the negative reviews and give <UNK> a chance we were really glad we did a good sports comedy movie
<START> you'll notice that the <UNK> who appears in two scenes and gets to speak is played by stephen king don't give up your day job is the standard thing to say but that's not fair king <UNK> himself reasonably well he's no worse than any other member of the cast and better than most the story on the other hand is pure rubbish please give up your day job br br never have i seen so many dreadful performances of which the lead actor's the lead actor's is probably the worst gathered together in the one film everyone acts <UNK> but not in any entertaining way they all somehow manage to go over the top without <UNK> or <UNK> energy i blame screenwriter director tom holland it can't be that all the actors are really this bad what are the odds against that admittedly i've never heard of any of them before but still i don't think i could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if i tried one actor despite my best efforts would turn out to have talent so what's more likely that tom holland rolled a dozen <UNK> snake eyes or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly that would also explain why actors are bad in direct <UNK> to their <UNK> in the script the more direction an actor got the worse he performed you want me to bend over like a <UNK> talk from the back of my throat show all my teeth and look bored all at the same time okay br br this theory is confirmed by the fact that holland undeniably managed to co write a lousy script several writers here have commented on the fact that billy <UNK> is not a likeable character but that's a misleading way of putting it he's not a <UNK> character all we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he's fat and that all he can think about is food all i can think about is food he tells us <UNK> and in the end br br sigh i suppose i ought insert a spoiler warning here br br in the end he becomes evil why i can only <UNK> perhaps he's under some kind of <UNK> yeah that's probably it by evil perhaps i mean inexplicable it's not so much badness as a socially <UNK> suspension of ordinary means end psychology anyway his actions at the end make no sense <UNK> actions make much sense and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience br br by the way here's my <UNK> for <UNK> line delivery i don't think you'd like it in fact big dramatic pause i don't think you'd like it at all
<START> nobody could like this movie for its merit but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their <UNK> quality then this is for you it ranks up there with road house for its preposterous characters sets and story line the bad writing really <UNK> me up i want you to dust those guys off instead of dust those guys f <UNK> take off from the <UNK> but when they get into <UNK> they're f <UNK> without a hint of anger or <UNK> segal goes back to work for the general who only minutes before was <UNK> a <UNK> mind wipe on seagal segal runs out of bullets and <UNK> to a knife to kill the guards so naturally the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too the hand <UNK> is a dud but explodes anyway the little stealth fighter can fly all the way from california to <UNK> without <UNK> then segal flies it back to california the long way i e by way of europe even though there's a <UNK> giving him air support 20 minutes away in the <UNK> sea the <UNK> in the <UNK> consists of 3 black <UNK> 2 flat screen <UNK> and pictures of <UNK> and <UNK> on the walls what a hoot
<START> powers booth is hypnotic as cult leader jim jones who led his peoples temple followers from 1953 until 1978 when he led them in a mass suicide in 1978 where over <UNK> died a very well done movie which may seem a little dated due to the 70s time period but well worth the time 8 of 10
<START> you'd think that with ingrid bergman and warner <UNK> that this film would have been a lot better sadly the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain <UNK> br br the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the <UNK> family everything is so very <UNK> and <UNK> the family <UNK> bergman and things couldn't be more perfect well that is until the mother fay <UNK> dies the stock market crashes in <UNK> <UNK> out the family's fortune and bergman is forced to go back home to france this portion of the film is a bit <UNK> sweet but not bad br br later after the family's <UNK> have improved bergman returns the four boys are now all grown and there isn't really a <UNK> reason why they'd hire her once again as a <UNK> but briefly everything is <UNK> once again but when wwi occurs the four all go to war gosh in the midst of this one of the sons david brings home his new wife susan <UNK> miss <UNK> character is as black and white as the others though while they are all good and <UNK> she's obviously a horny she devil to make things worse she comes to live in the family home while david is at war br br now here is where the movie gets really really dumb brain <UNK> dumb <UNK> begins an affair with one of david's brothers but when the father sees a <UNK> of the lovers bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her not <UNK> with jack why why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the <UNK> <UNK> once and for all this is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941 br br the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for <UNK> <UNK> to be exposed this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess as expected however the truth eventually comes out and everyone is <UNK> once again happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut <UNK> br br the film suffers because of poor writing <UNK> affair made no sense at least in how it was handled and having characters who are so gosh darn good or evil with nothing in between sinks this movie to the level of a second rate soap the only thing that saves it at all is the acting they tried as best they could with a turgid script suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken
<START> in the areas where they <UNK> this fine movie is light years ahead of <UNK> innocence which gave the impression of a <UNK> eye and heavy breathing <UNK> young girls here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they <UNK> their way through an <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> the three principals all unknown to me give very sure <UNK> performances the kind in fact that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to <UNK> this quality of acting in other films so i wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again it would be nice if this could get away from the art houses and into the <UNK> where there's just an outside chance it might <UNK> to the <UNK> crowd it isn't aimed at
<START> i have been familiar with the fantastic book of <UNK> mister <UNK> for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it i have heard lots of positive remarks about this so i had high hopes once this film had finished i was horrified br br this film is not a good film at all <UNK> mister <UNK> was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4 5 10 of the book was missed out particularly i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this there was not much dialogue it was rushed and far too fast moving but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william <UNK> and tom in this film which was a true let down the casting was not all that good either i thought this could have been really good but it was so different to the book <UNK> poor adaption one of the worst i've seen this deserves a decent remake <UNK> better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage
<START> and it is this film i imagine that if indeed there is a negative <UNK> damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity br br okay maybe it's not that bad but it is probably the worst film i have ever seen next to <UNK> the hands of fate and i have seen a lot of bad movies believe you me br br this is just a crummy b movie bad film making at it's finest or is it worst the thing i really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief now a little comedy relief is a good thing but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons rather than on the heroes of this film who are actually in it for less time than them br br to be fair crown international really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing but honestly this was probably a bad film to begin with so crown really couldn't have done that much to hurt it br br this really needs to be in the bottom 100 list i wouldn't wish this one on my worst enemy br br actually it's my kind of campy b movie it was bad but i still liked it despite my one star rating
<START> en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track but which looks <UNK> close to a <UNK> a female reporter runs into a strange <UNK> <UNK> who agrees to help direct her to her destination the strange man then <UNK> a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story an <UNK> couple plot to kill the woman's husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story a group of <UNK> have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes <UNK> at having his grave <UNK> on br br the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer <UNK> <UNK> and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed <UNK> nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short and that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy with joe <UNK> as the tale telling <UNK> jackson giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen the locations are uninspired the script is dreary there's a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending well that <UNK> belief br br to be fair some of <UNK> creative camera work is effective although the <UNK> technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad <UNK> and joe <UNK> <UNK> gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off <UNK> are <UNK> out a face is removed brains are <UNK> and there is a messy <UNK> these <UNK> just about make the film bearable but be warned the zombie chronicles ain't a <UNK> in the park even for seasoned viewers of z grade trash br br i give the zombie chronicles 2 10 but <UNK> raise my rating to 3 since i didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3d although i have a <UNK> suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference
<START> i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10 but that this one isn't even in the top 100 br br this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks but there are so many reasons to love this movie br br the rescue of han solo from <UNK> this official <UNK> up the han solo in debt sub plot that was established when we first met the character in a new hope br br the emperor was finally <UNK> well alright this might not work as well now that the <UNK> are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kids br br the <UNK> bike chase alright so this was a special effects moment but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films br br the 3 part climax 1 the battle of <UNK> led by han and leia 2 luke confronts his father the fall of the emperor 3 the destruction of the second death star <UNK> moment br br the final celebration with our heroes like i said this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy <UNK> the fall of the empire our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other br br all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story
<START> highly regarded at release but since rather neglected immense importance in the history of performing arts a classic use of <UNK> plots one of my favourite films why hasn't the soundtrack been re released
<START> this is a film of immense appeal to a relatively well defined group of which i am not a part i went to a preview of this movie not knowing what to expect i ultimately found it disappointing the history of a dreadfully dysfunctional <UNK> downright twisted hungarian jewish family is not my cup of tea an epic saga like this should really provide its viewers with something more in the end ultimately pictures such as this are about the human condition this picture cast almost no new light on any of its more meaningful <UNK>
<START> clint eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this but this one does not embarrass him dirty harry catches everyone's attention and unless one wants to watch romance there is no reason why you won't like him he is cool because he is dirty is great because he kills without much thinking is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care br br from what i have seen in movies in which eastwood acts the character of the lead role always <UNK> the audience in white hunter black heart he is the crazy director in in the line of fire he is the old <UNK> while here is the almost <UNK> with his job that is to say he makes work for himself doesn't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation br br based on a rape victim this movie is promising for all the no non sense movie <UNK> the movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot however what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not as it is far too obvious from the beginning it is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving also there are too many people far <UNK> than dirty harry
<START> i admit i have a weakness for alternate history stories from its a wonderful life to <UNK> day to 12 <UNK> among those <UNK> is this little gem it's pretty difficult to get through mr destiny without giving a nod of appreciation to each and every cast member from the <UNK> james belushi to the murderous <UNK> cox this movie lacks the <UNK> and scale to make it a great film but it's a fine cheer up on a rainy afternoon it's also a great rental for an <UNK> date
<START> i rented this movie from blockbuster on a <UNK> i like alan arkin and the cover was catching i read the back and knew right away it was going to either be the best or the worst movie i have ever seen i guess i got lucky i laughed from beginning to end alan arkin brings a great character to this movie i have since bought a used rental copy for my own collection and watch it all the time i have <UNK> this movie to loads of people and they all enjoyed it as much as i did i see complaints about the <UNK> and dvd functions but it doesn't take away from the movie the <UNK> was <UNK> for blockbuster <UNK> which is why they didn't allow you to skip past the previews aside from that you shouldn't let the functions of the dvd to <UNK> you from watching the excellent film
<START> another turgid action adventure flick from the quinn martin productions factory roy <UNK> plays undercover agent diamond head mr head to you working for his g man <UNK> aunt mary looking for tree who's on a mission to well just watch the movie br br this one deserved and got the full mst3k <UNK> as the boys and various reviewers have pointed out the movie <UNK> had more <UNK> locations than this film apparently shot on a <UNK> budget this movie highlights <UNK> broken down dive <UNK> gas stations and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> later to star as <UNK> in hawaii five o appears as <UNK> <UNK> inept sidekick while france <UNK> models the jenny craig <UNK> gone horribly wrong others sharing the <UNK> screen include a drunken richard harris <UNK> a george <UNK> <UNK> a not so smart hit man with <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> and the villain tree sporting a <UNK> british accent you can pretty much figure out the plot halfway through the opening credits but relax just enjoy the <UNK> mediocrity of this 70's movie of the week br br whenever i think of this movie and i think of this movie often i catch myself <UNK> the theme written for <UNK> and <UNK> no one knows why br br trivia note diamond head was directed by <UNK> <UNK> one of three contract directors at universal who would go on to make much bigger films in his case jaws 2 the others were john <UNK> war games and a young fellow named steven spielberg
<START> sammo <UNK> 1989 film <UNK> driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama interesting and sympathetic and also non sympathetic characters some genuinely funny humor and truly over the top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced <UNK> of the unique industry br br sammo and max <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> play two <UNK> drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century i think they drive their <UNK> and are also desperate for love sammo is interested in local baker girl <UNK> nina li <UNK> while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he falls <UNK> in love with many other characters get introduced too and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong soon we get to know for instance that a ruthless gangster family is <UNK> the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists too and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created as well as some nice drama br br the film has a great cast the leads are all very good and restrained not as painfully awful over acting and humor as in <UNK> otherwise great eastern <UNK> 1987 for example and they are also thanks to the carefully written screenplay pretty likable and easy to identify with the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey <UNK> <UNK> the legendary action director and director of films like <UNK> of the soul 1 and 2 ninja in the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1 and 2 the masterful composer <UNK> lo <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> the killer and <UNK> <UNK> school on fire and prison on fire among many others <UNK> driver included the shaw veteran liu <UNK> <UNK> whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks alfred cheung <UNK> <UNK> the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from 1988 the late great <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horror kung fu comedies to name just a few in fact the cast in <UNK> driver is one of the most interesting i've seen in any other hk production br br the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and one crisis they confront thanks to <UNK> <UNK> character they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love no matter what's your past or what you've done for living get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle <UNK> also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship and of course love still i think what <UNK> says to max about the future bad cooking is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively unfortunately br br but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in which is the action the outrageous and over the top action the fight scenes include traditional kung fu some sticks meat <UNK> and the like and they're used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i've seen in any film ever jackie chan's drunken master ii 1994 they really are that great there are <UNK> and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or <UNK> simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his her breath as the film has one fast car vs <UNK> chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and <UNK> bodies flying through the air and <UNK> with force to the hard destination still the film makers seem not to accept the violence of the film as sammo is like the late bruce lee willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa and i think this kind of <UNK> no matter how obvious or shallow it may be is a good thing even in a harmless film like this as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment br br the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i'm not sure everyone in hollywood or america for example would understand or like at all the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing also some funny scenes are created out of <UNK> passion for <UNK> still the greatest <UNK> filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former <UNK> as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this and this is nothing but positive and <UNK> reaction of course br br <UNK> driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among <UNK> greatest achievements if the few minor flaws were not there this could rate even <UNK> and higher 8 10
<START> marvelous film again dealing with the trials and <UNK> of world war 11 england what makes this film so good is the touching of the human element this film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classics such as mrs <UNK> and hope and glory as is the case with this film we see the desperation of people in the time of war br br the performances are outstanding here especially by the <UNK> john <UNK> who is assigned a child who has been <UNK> from the london bombing br br we soon see why this child <UNK> his bed he comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly br br the old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life when the child is returned to his mother the old man goes to london and seeks him out only to find tragedy he literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy's home br br the picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships
<START> this was quite possibly the worst film i've ever seen the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful i'm a big fan of <UNK> benson i think she's usually a wonderful actress i can't imagine why she decided to do this film her character <UNK> is drunk for almost the whole film with the exception of the opening scene on the plus side there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad i actually laughed out loud but despite that i would not recommend this film to anyone it's only 80 minutes long but that's 80 minutes of your life that you will have completely wasted
<START> today i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood br br hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation <UNK> changed everything it changed our perception of security it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity most importantly and <UNK> it changed our world br br however i can't not stress how utterly <UNK> <UNK> and angry i am at the <UNK> blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a <UNK> profit out of death and destruction this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word of mouth among <UNK> and critics alike most surely to be <UNK> by the mainstream press hollywood has sunk to a new low even lower than the low down <UNK> who <UNK> the most <UNK> acts of <UNK> and <UNK> cruelty behind it all is uwe boll i am very angry at this movie how dare they <UNK> the memories of families of those lost how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who <UNK> their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that <UNK> day of <UNK> how dare they try to <UNK> and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the <UNK> of a mourning and weary post <UNK> world how dare they br br to those who have the <UNK> to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength remember think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and <UNK> to the lives lost on that day think back to that day of the <UNK> of families of loved ones think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks br br ask yourself if you have a soul br br think remember respect the memories of the lives lost on <UNK> by not seeing this film at all
<START> after reading the original play i thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be <UNK> <UNK> puts in a once off great performance as public <UNK> the repressed antagonist who is <UNK> openly on screen by his <UNK> but unseen to others <UNK> private <UNK> <UNK> kelly also plays an excellent <UNK> whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by <UNK> br br definitely worth renting out if you can find it probably <UNK> outside ireland uk
<START> this film is not morbid nor is it depressing it is sad because aids in the early <UNK> was sad but its real message is one of love and <UNK> br br mark and tom were in a long term loving relationship their devotion to each other is evident right away and as the <UNK> of aids <UNK> and become the <UNK> point of their lives you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming br br when <UNK> life was originally released i was deeply involved in hiv aids education and health care <UNK> as a <UNK> at an hiv aids clinic the film spoke to me like no other aids film of its day could because mark and tom were real people living the very experiences that i saw on a daily basis in real life i knew from <UNK> experience what it was like to watch aids eat away at <UNK> vibrant young healthy people seeing it happen to mark and tom in the film was very much like watching my real life friends <UNK> it touched me in a way that even all these years later still affects me
<START> deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom as it primarily takes place on one set the premise is that an accomplished playwright whose star is falling receives a magnificent <UNK> from a former student and so he plans to off his <UNK> and appropriate his play to the loud <UNK> of his wife or so you think for the first half of the movie past the halfway mark deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head then right around and then in a mad spin all the time keeping its title appropriate it's an excellent mystery movie <UNK> in wit br br michael caine as the senior playwright plays himself in this movie a slightly loony and very dramatic brit no surprises here he does his usual good work he gets the best line of deathtrap which he <UNK> perfectly what is your definition of success being gang <UNK> in a state <UNK> br br christopher reeve on the other hand <UNK> comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious and <UNK> young playwright he also gets to show off his very toned body which he must've <UNK> coming off the superman movies br br caine and reeve have <UNK> in another movie that's one of my favorite comedies noises off it similarly revolves around a play as well although this time caine is the director and reeve is an actor they are joined by comic veterans carol <UNK> john ritter <UNK> <UNK> taxi and mark <UNK> baker perfect strangers together they demonstrate the <UNK> that <UNK> the bed <UNK> cast and crew of a play on the surface the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch wish this underrated movie was available on dvd
<START> a number of richard <UNK> films as director have been <UNK> of major historical figures young winston gandhi chaplin grey owl is also a filmed biography of a historical individual but in this case <UNK> subject is a much more obscure character br br grey owl was a canadian writer of the 1920s and 1930s who promoted the ideas of <UNK> and nature <UNK> at a time when these causes were less <UNK> than they are today he was widely believed to be an american indian the story he told about himself was that he had been born in mexico to a scottish father and <UNK> mother and had <UNK> to canada where he had been adopted as a member of the <UNK> tribe he lived in a cabin by a lake in a remote part of the canadian wilderness where he earned a living as a <UNK> he <UNK> britain twice in <UNK> and <UNK> to promote his books and to give <UNK> on <UNK> and achieved great success even being introduced to the royal family during one of these <UNK> attenborough then a teenager saw grey owl at the london <UNK> theatre after his death in 1938 however it was revealed that he had not been who he claimed to be his real name was <UNK> <UNK> and he had been born in the english <UNK> town of <UNK> br br the film <UNK> somewhat from the facts of grey <UNK> life in a scene set in 1934 he states that he is <UNK> years old in reality he was born in <UNK> so would have been <UNK> in that year <UNK> would have been pierce <UNK> age when the film was made so i am not sure why this change was made numerous events are <UNK> into the last four years of grey <UNK> life 1934 1938 in the film it is during this period that he meets and marries <UNK> bernard whom he called <UNK> in reality he met and married <UNK> as early as <UNK> the film also <UNK> the fact that they were divorced in 1936 and that grey owl <UNK> shortly before his death br br the revelation of grey <UNK> true identity <UNK> affected his <UNK> reputation and he was <UNK> as a fraud his supposed <UNK> was even used to <UNK> the causes which he had <UNK> richard attenborough however takes a more sympathetic view of his achievements one of the themes explored by the film is the question of ethnic identity although the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was not a canadian indian by birth there is no doubt that he had a deep knowledge of <UNK> culture and <UNK> and that he spoke their language <UNK> he was accepted by the <UNK> as a member of their tribe it therefore seems unfair to describe his claim to a native north american identity as being a <UNK> one merely because it was an identity he had chosen rather than one he had been born into br br according to the film grey <UNK> wife <UNK> was herself of indian descent but came from a family which had been <UNK> into white canadian culture her marriage can therefore be seen as her <UNK> of her family's original cultural <UNK> she was clearly influenced by her husband but she also had an influence on him <UNK> him to give up his work as a fur <UNK> as she had moral <UNK> to killing animals for their fur br br one criticism made of the film is that pierce brosnan is miscast as the hero a criticism which seems to be <UNK> in the <UNK> that brosnan can only play action heroes in the james bond <UNK> it seems to me however that brosnan may deliberately have taken this role in order to avoid being <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> grey owl being about as far from the suave sophisticated agent bond as one can get the original bond sean connery also seems to have deliberately <UNK> for <UNK> roles when he appeared in films like the hill or the molly <UNK> brosnan is in fact very good in this role although i would agree with those who found annie <UNK> weak as <UNK> br br another frequently voiced criticism with which i would not agree is that the film is boring certainly it is not an action film like the bonds nor is it a great epic biopic like gandhi and it may indeed seem boring to those who were expecting it to be either the one or the other it is however likely to please anyone with an interest in the early days of the <UNK> movement or the philosophical <UNK> of national and ethnic identity the scenes of the canadian <UNK> are also beautifully photographed richard attenborough has done us a service by helping to revive interest in this half forgotten but fascinating figure 7 10
<START> this review may contain some spoilers br br just when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore along comes <UNK> dawn chong as a space <UNK> and willie nelson as a native american <UNK> it's even worse when you factor in that these two are the better aspects of <UNK> ' a film that should only be viewed for laughs br br chong is an alien sent to earth to seek out the only remaining half breed part man and part alien apparently the earth is in dire <UNK> something is wrong with the <UNK> of mankind and in a few decades the world will be turned into a <UNK> <UNK> only by <UNK> the <UNK> of the half breed can the kindly alien race save the planet don't ask me how that is since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by <UNK> which is caused by humans you would think earth could only be saved by getting rid of the <UNK> creatures not saving them anyway the half breed turns out to be billy <UNK> a man living in a small <UNK> town and is part native american from his mother's line despite the fact that his mother is a red headed <UNK> and his grandfather is willie nelson wasn't this the sort of <UNK> that made the <UNK> carmen <UNK> bomb the chosen <UNK> such a <UNK> chong arrives in her ship just as <UNK> nearly <UNK> after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of <UNK> being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend before you can say utter the word <UNK> ' chong is revealing her secret to <UNK> who isn't surprised for a moment and <UNK> the word to <UNK> family chong also makes pals with <UNK> mother who seems to have lost a few of her <UNK> over the years well this is because <UNK> father was an alien that abandoned her of course he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to earth for <UNK> so he can use <UNK> <UNK> to make the people of earth his slaves huh his laughable attempts to use his <UNK> powers and capture <UNK> suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie not only are they boring but they are the scenes where you will be <UNK> the <UNK> the most br br the ideas might be nice on paper but they are handled here with the <UNK> of stupidity particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien but the effects are the <UNK> of the movie the opening scene involves chong on her spaceship <UNK> with her superior someone who we do not see but that chong <UNK> with through a <UNK> that <UNK> pink light they use no spoken words but <UNK> so we are treated to subtitles trouble is both chong and her <UNK> subtitles both look alike and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually <UNK> at any given moment which makes the whole conversation nothing but <UNK> the spaceship is the worst effect to come out of hollywood this side of an ed wood film now i am usually <UNK> on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this but these effects really got to me the most offensive was the most simple one a fake night sky the stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a <UNK> tone most notably are the moments where chong tells someone she comes from <UNK> and we get a shot of the seven stars thing is the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie but any <UNK> knows that <UNK> is a star <UNK> between the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and the <UNK> doesn't take up much room in the sky at all these effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment be careful for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have willie nelson turn into a human spotlight and oh it has to be seen to be believed br br <UNK> star bright last star i see tonight i wish i might i wish i may not have to watch any more of this trash today br br <UNK> score 1 out of 10
<START> this is a very good made for tv film it depicts trouble in <UNK> circa 1970's and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around the worst most <UNK> part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog the teens do everything to annoy and <UNK> this poor family but boy does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end the father <UNK> surely does not take all of the <UNK> from the punk teens lightly and is quick to <UNK> after lack of help from the police that is he stands up to them and <UNK> his home and his family a very good actor i might add br br i watched this on tv when i was like 8 or 9 i have never seen it again on tv and would like to definitely a good one it's the sort of movie one may catch on a <UNK> night very late at night and can't stop watching or an afternoon film on a weekend it's the kind they just don't show anymore br br it is definitely worth seeing
<START> this is a great movie most of us have seen jurassic park where the chaos theory is <UNK> by telling about a <UNK> wings causing a <UNK> on the other side of the planet well bug is all about that or at least something don't worry this is no spoiler i'm definitely not a religious type and don't believe in pre destined stuff fate etc but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really exists br br further more the acting and camera are excellent too another prove that it's still possible to make a good movie without a <UNK> bucks
<START> the movie is just as fun as staring at the sun sheriff <UNK> is a total <UNK> that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his <UNK> <UNK> and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of nicholas cage sucking up all that so called blood which in reality seemed like fruit punch br br most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a movie the rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time the ending was awful the <UNK> were cheesy and the scenes were terrible what else more should i say to you viewers out there my advice would be to get your <UNK> shot if you've already watched the movie this movie may give you the <UNK> in the mouth if you didn't get your up to date shots
<START> my friends and i were just discussing how frustrated we are with the way movies and especially romantic <UNK> are being made we feel offended by the schlock that hollywood is serving up these days as they act like all is well br br well all is not well with the exception of a few bright spots like this movie it doesn't have the big name actors the big budget i don't think it had a big release i rented from hollywood video it didn't really have anything that most big budget romantic <UNK> have br br but it did have what most of those lack it had great chemistry between the love interests parker jonathan <UNK> and sam alison eastwood their love story wasn't forced on us like so many the director took his time to allow these characters to truly get to know each other their story reminded me of one of my favorites <UNK> br br the supporting cast added not only really funny comic moments but depth to the story as well james <UNK> character was absolutely priceless <UNK> gay friend was hysterical <UNK> interaction with his fellow employees in a psychic <UNK> was a lot of fun br br i laughed i cried i remembered how great it feels to fall in love
<START> true the idea for this tv series may have <UNK> from the immense success which ally <UNK> is enjoying worldwide even here in germany however this said <UNK> <UNK> is very different from ally <UNK> in many ways br br the two main characters work beautifully together felix <UNK> felix noble played by well known german actor <UNK> m <UNK> and sandra <UNK> sandra strong noble strong get it played by charming rebecca <UNK> exchange quick romantic <UNK> and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom like criminal cases in berlin and surroundings further they are aided by a magnificent cast of co stars most notably their secretary played by <UNK> <UNK> who is a rare gem with great comic potential also the shady <UNK> dealer otto and the noble childhood pal of felix frank work very well not to forget <UNK> best friend and room mate patricia played by the beautiful barbara <UNK> br br all in all a joy to watch on monday <UNK> no wonder that the series and its stars have received several <UNK> will felix get sandra br br i hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out
<START> featured in <UNK> the <UNK> is an all star cast ranging from silent screen veteran <UNK> <UNK> to actors studio <UNK> susan <UNK> set at an <UNK> psychiatric hospital what is this movie about you wonder high drama doctor patient relationships shock therapy treatment no this <UNK> is about who exactly will get to pick the <UNK> for a psychiatric hospital you think i'm kidding you won't believe your eyes as you're watching this unbelievable storyline that was turned into a movie <UNK> head shrink dr <UNK> richard widmark wants to have all of the <UNK> patients involved in the design selection and execution of the needed new <UNK> <UNK> wife played by <UNK> mouthed gloria graham wants to get her 2 cents in on this monumental task too so does long time <UNK> miss inch <UNK> <UNK> directed by vincent <UNK> you kinda wonder if he really became this overly involved in minute detail because of his marriage to worry <UNK> judy garland talented actors like lauren bacall susan <UNK> charles boyer and john kerr are wasted in this hokey story what were they thinking
<START> how i got into it when i started watching this series on cartoon network i have to say that i've never seen anything like this and it was the best but when i started collecting the series on vhs and years later on dvd part of <UNK> anime legends <UNK> it was amazing and truly worth watching it had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat and of course the theme songs just communication and rhythm emotions were the best br br characters and <UNK> my favorite characters in the show were <UNK> duo <UNK> <UNK> lady <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> my favorite <UNK> in the show that i liked the most are the wing zero and <UNK> and of course the <UNK> and <UNK> i and ii br br meaning of the show what this series also tells us that in real life wars are very hard and we can sometimes win or lose but peace can also be hard to obtain and i do believe the gundam pilots are doing the right thing and are trying to obtain world peace br br but however this show is truly the best of the best so in closing to this review after you watch this show see the movie endless <UNK>
<START> in keeping with disney's well known practice of stealing i mean buying out known <UNK> and <UNK> them this live action version of the <UNK> cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re makes in a year of bad re makes i grew up on the original cartoon tv series any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie not present is <UNK> cool computer book also not present is the gag with the self <UNK> orders that always ends up <UNK> on the chief new are a smooth talking gadget <UNK> the original cartoon had a <UNK> vehicle that could turn into a van or a car and an element of a typical unrealistic hollywood romance don't fill the <UNK> to pay for disney executives and even their ex executives don't see this movie br br
<START> another powerful chick flick this time it revolves around diana <UNK> who is always getting into fights at school instead of getting <UNK> she takes her anger elsewhere to the boxing ring she trains to be a boxer and there she meets <UNK> adrian and begins to fall in love with him this movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone doesn't believe in you in this case her dad doesn't believe in her that alone makes the movie worth the price enjoy
<START> maybe i'm biased to <UNK> fox stories and all but i thought this was wonderfully done br br i really enjoyed that it was shown when lily wasn't comfortable such as the fire and the room trying not to spoil too much here i think that's important for kids to see and try to understand br br after reading a few others comments i'm a bit confused one says that at the end spoiler the mother and her son appear as she's been the one telling her son about her story the movie i saw did not have the mother or son at the end merely a painting of a girl with a fox can someone <UNK> me on that anyway i really enjoyed this movie although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through still worth it if they can sit still
<START> 14 years since this show was made and it is still is the best show ever made the writing was 1st class and the production second to none this show would never be made today and that this a shame i hope if you are thinking about finding this show to watch that you do br br <UNK> came out the year i left high school at the time my <UNK> tv show was the x files this gives you an idea of why i first got into this show <UNK> was a far better program with better writing but only got one reason i know this is not the only program to only get one season another example that comes to mind would be the lone <UNK> x files spin off it had good writing and was funny but also only got one season it does not seem right br br we also have to remember that this show was around before shows like twilight made dark shows <UNK> so i think this may have also let to the show going down hill br br watch this program and enjoy it 10 out of 10 for me
<START> what we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80's incompetence that will render even the biggest <UNK> of trash cinema completely speechless <UNK> of the lost kingdom is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy sword and <UNK> adventure that doesn't have an actual plot but does eagerly shamelessly borrows elements from other films writer ed <UNK> and hector <UNK> who watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically in order to make a fantasy adventure you need one super evil villain preferably with a black cape one young hero in training one lone warrior one <UNK> type of <UNK> pet one wise midget living in the woods <UNK> and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to serve as filler the story is phenomenal and so original with simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician <UNK> takes over the power and killed the king simon wants to go back and save the people but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape simon befriends lone warrior <UNK> the usually cool dude bo <UNK> who clearly needed the pay check who <UNK> simon during the long and devastating journey full of <UNK> dangerous encounters and magical <UNK> admittedly it doesn't even sound too bad thus far but that's merely just because i <UNK> all the deliciously inept little details simon has a best friend named <UNK> for example <UNK> is an <UNK> version of <UNK> and evokes <UNK> chuckles whenever he opens his <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> something incomprehensible the obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the plot and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content simon has nightmarish visions inside the <UNK> of a suspicious forest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an old score with the pig faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there's the supposedly horrible <UNK> <UNK> where you can only sing your way out of but the absolute most <UNK> brilliant sequence  not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema  involves the <UNK> of four zombie warriors simon <UNK> the legendary courageous warriors hoping they will assist them in their battle but the rotting corpses only take a few steps complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves that's it so much for the zombie sub plot best sequence ever i could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more <UNK> but you get the idea <UNK> of the lost kingdom is a tremendously messed up so bad it's good film word of advice do not watch this <UNK> piece of junk alone invite friends preferably the <UNK> headed types with a wicked sense of humor and watch it in group it will be a night to <UNK>
<START> red rock west is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget all you need is a smart script good actors and loads of atmosphere <UNK> delivers all these and more br br <UNK> cage plays an ex marine injured in <UNK> who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an <UNK> because of his bad <UNK> he roles into red rock and is mistaken by bartender wayne <UNK> walsh not quite as his most menacing but still evil for a hit man from texas br br he pays him to kill his wife and make it look like <UNK> only when he gets there just to check her out she offers him double to kill wayne cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the <UNK> lovers be but a series of <UNK> and <UNK> results in him <UNK> <UNK> in and out of red rock back and forth eventually this leads to a run in with <UNK> from dallas a <UNK> and somehow sympathetic dennis hopper the real hit man from texas who offers to help without knowing he's making the plot more complicated br br <UNK> never had a big release thus most of it's audience discovered it on video or on cable tv <UNK> viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a tv movie but it's bigger than that the slick slowly timed direction moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the dvd on a big <UNK> br br the only weak point of the movie i can think of is lara flynn <UNK> boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke ish <UNK> i certainly wouldn't fall for her but if you assume that <UNK> <UNK> character is in to <UNK> lesbians then you'll accept it nonetheless
<START> episode two of season one is a delightful holiday tale of love betrayal and a homicidal escaped lunatic dressed as father christmas br br a woman mary ellen <UNK> has just murdered her <UNK> on christmas eve for his life insurance what begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged santa <UNK> suit wearing psychopath larry drake perfectly over the top threatens her life as well as her precious young daughters br br this episode is <UNK> remembered by even those casually <UNK> with the program by the way this particular reviewer watches it every christmas on routine most notable for it's <UNK> suspense and narrative twists and all through the <UNK> is among tales from the <UNK> best
<START> ah true memories i lived in holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every sunday evening and later <UNK> i saw it during my 14 <UNK> very good for my at the time school english as dutch tv provides subtitles for other languages except for <UNK> shows nowadays so you would hear the original voices and language the best series were the first three ones and then after the third series the great character nazi von <UNK> who was such a <UNK> enemy disappeared from the series i don't think they ever really caught him he always escaped leaving room to have him appear again in a next story because evidently the series also was distributed to germany and a nazi enemy wouldn't go over very well too bad because geoffrey <UNK> did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent nazi aristocrat who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on england it was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series but ronald leigh hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal they were very believable to me at the time and as a kid i could just imagine to be part of these youngsters who at the time were about four years older than me it was a very exciting series to me standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with the prisoner as well i hope they will <UNK> a good quality dvd of the series that would be wonderful even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch the later series were not as good watered down and just not as much fun as the first three hopefully they also find the other series with von <UNK> to be put on dvd <UNK> from canada
<START> such a <UNK> world has been created for us in <UNK> a bug's life we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this <UNK> on film but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a <UNK> and <UNK> world animation can offer  when it's in the right hands that is  a bug's life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high <UNK> film productions br br it is only <UNK> second animated feature the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely <UNK> mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 with their landmark movie toy story it was a movie which <UNK> convention re invented and <UNK> new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now they return with their <UNK> effort which to be honest draws a <UNK> sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film br br after all it's a film about ants well all walks of the <UNK> and bug world are covered in a bug's life but it is the <UNK> which is the <UNK> point in this film as humans are the <UNK> point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an <UNK> act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they <UNK> however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toy box items were able to become the <UNK> most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever <UNK> the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and <UNK> bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of <UNK> you'll probably ever encounter br br not only are they all entirely <UNK> and likable  there isn't an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters  but they're colourful they're <UNK> and they're <UNK> and the array of characters is also <UNK> for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of <UNK> already <UNK> onto a bug's life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is <UNK> david <UNK> and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and <UNK> worker ants <UNK> on the lush beautiful <UNK> island he is the one considered the <UNK> <UNK> of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the <UNK> <UNK> with his antics br br the problem <UNK> in the fact that the <UNK> <UNK> is for a bunch of greedy <UNK> led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to <UNK> their wrath and <UNK> amongst the <UNK> little ants when they show up to <UNK> island for their <UNK> <UNK> and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term hopper offers a <UNK> to save the ants from total <UNK> at his <UNK> hands however it's a <UNK> which is simply impossible to <UNK> the <UNK> and clockwork in <UNK> mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave <UNK> island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the <UNK> rescue and fight off hopper and the <UNK> br br if you think about it a bug's life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by <UNK> and wicked enemies  one lone village <UNK> goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in a bug's life the help comes in the form of a down and out circus <UNK> who is <UNK> perceived by <UNK> as warriors in a bar room <UNK> br br much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus <UNK> bugs among them are an <UNK> stick <UNK> david hyde pierce a side splitting <UNK> german <UNK> by the name of <UNK> and a quasi femme fatale <UNK> who's in fact a gritty and <UNK> <UNK> dennis hopper it's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen as is the entire movie <UNK> br br as i've said much amusement and <UNK> comes out of their characters and <UNK> interactions with one another which give way to a <UNK> of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie what makes a bug's life even better is that the film isn't <UNK> simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kid friendly situations are a bit more <UNK> than we'd like however it's easy to ignore this fault and it's <UNK> easy to enjoy this film br br although a bug's life may not reach the <UNK> and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that they're not just a one hit wonder but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards it's only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bug's life other than see it it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at <UNK> california but this beats out the lot of its year  and i'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998 br br 8 5 10
<START> i too was quite <UNK> to see how few people had voted on this film and just had to write something about it although my comments are quite similar to those written already br br i like many things about the film the superb acting between mastroianni loren the way the film is narrated humanity and love slowly developing between these two <UNK> and <UNK> to the simultaneously continuously ongoing <UNK> <UNK> pace of the fascist radio <UNK> who happens to be a colleague of <UNK> part and the <UNK> going to and coming from the show to me this is a very fine film about what it is to be human maybe some of you would argue that the anti fascist message is too clearly delivered but to me this didn't destroy the film in any way my vote is 10 10
<START> i realize several ben stiller movies are out or will be out this year but perhaps he should insist on quality not <UNK> br br i was <UNK> at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in along came polly br br <UNK> <UNK> is grating <UNK> and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year <UNK> <UNK> is getting tiresome he undoubtedly has comic talent but he needs to either find another <UNK> or take a break find some material that is actually funny because his movies are going from painfully <UNK> to excruciatingly bad br br there's absolutely no chemistry between stiller and jennifer aniston which is a shame because she's a good smart actress with a promising career as long as she keeps making more movies such as the good girl in which she's terrific and less like along came polly she'll have a career of which she could be proud br br aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she's working but it's a <UNK> task for any actress with the exception of a few moments with alec baldwin as <UNK> boss stan and philip seymour hoffman as <UNK> best friend sandy there's nothing funny in this awful film other supporting characters including debra messing as lisa and hank <UNK> as claude are annoying <UNK> accent is not only stupid it's terribly unfunny br br the premise of along came polly certainly showed promise unfortunately it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy instead of this lame dull boring excuse for a comedy
<START> first of all i've got to give it to the people that got this thing together 9 11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that <UNK> to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts it's a shame although not surprising that the movie was banned in the us br br that being said i think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments the movie starts up with the iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> work the absolutely beautiful <UNK> children and the color of paradise much like those 2 films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of <UNK> <UNK> in iran absolutely beautiful clip same goes for sean <UNK> clip which is superb as well but just as some of the clips are <UNK> others are absolutely brutal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does the mexican clip and just like his gut wrenching <UNK> <UNK> he does it as brutal as he can most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background those sounds are of the <UNK> and their shock as the second plane crashes those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families those who were angry and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers a very hard clip to watch and one that you won't forget br br some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as you're not the only ones that are suffering in particular the egyptian and british clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the us has caused to other people br br i will also make a special mention to the clips from <UNK> <UNK> france india and japan although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually isn't br br however not all the clips are great and i make a special mention on the clip from israel which in my opinion is extremely weak while the idea was good a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in tel <UNK> but his story gets <UNK> because of what happened in new york is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to the realization is terrible the clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air time at all costs a guy saying he's a witness and hoping that he can go on tv and soldiers and <UNK> shouting just because the clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation br br if you happen to have the chance to see it then you should that is unless you're a conservative in which case you'd better stay out as you might get offended but if you're not then you might learn how many of us outside the us lived through 9 11
<START> i guess i only have myself to blame for the gigantic <UNK> that is <UNK> of a virgin you already know not to expect a cinematic masterpiece when you see a <UNK> and proudly promoted title like this and the first impression only gets extra confirmed when <UNK> the film is a mid 80's production from japan now there are quite a lot of demented and sick filmmakers active in japan but <UNK> <UNK> surpasses them all with his thoroughly <UNK> and sickening trilogy revolving on nothing but aggressive sex and the sadistic abuse of young girls not even attempting to tell a story <UNK> of a virgin simply presents a <UNK> of un <UNK> semi pornographic sex and truly poor gore effects that wouldn't even please the most <UNK> fan of cheesy 80's horror images of a bunch of <UNK> and their fashion models are inexplicably <UNK> with scenes of a filthy <UNK> having crude sex with a <UNK> under aged girl he <UNK> her not even a minute after <UNK> typical and she begs him to stay even if she has to share him with other women i don't get it is this supposed to represent a general male fantasy because it's really clichéd and <UNK> anyways back to the bunch of horny <UNK> and <UNK> models surprised by upcoming fog on their way home the group <UNK> themselves in an abandoned country house where they have more appalling sex and eventually fall victim to a ridiculous sex demon who kills them all the acting performances are amateurish the dialogs inane and primitive and <UNK> direction is weak and uninspired i can tolerate all that including the woman <UNK> portrayal of sex but i came too close to turning the film off during the <UNK> mean spirited wrestling sequence one of the males brutally hits kicks and throws around one of the girls and calls her a filthy whore until she literally <UNK> her <UNK> and cries with agony this sequence is in my humble opinion the absolute low point of asian exploitation cinema one to avoid and maybe even <UNK>
<START> i saw this film in the worst possible <UNK> i'd already missed 15 minutes when i woke up to it on an international flight between sydney and <UNK> i didn't know what i was watching i thought maybe it was a movie of the week but quickly became <UNK> by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman who's child had been kidnapped the premise started taking twist and turns i didn't see coming and by the end credits i was <UNK> through the the in flight guide to figure out what i had just watched turns out i was <UNK> discovering do <UNK> <UNK> who'd won best actress at cannes for the role i don't know if secret sunshine is typical of korean cinema but i'm off to the dvd store to discover more
<START> i did not watch the entire movie i could not watch the entire movie i stopped the dvd after watching for half an hour and i suggest anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves before taking the disc out of the case br br i like mafia movies both tragic and comic but corky <UNK> can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy br br the problem is corky <UNK> simply tries too hard to get the audience to laugh the plot seems to be an excuse for moving chris <UNK> corky from one scene to another corky himself is completely <UNK> and lacks subtlety or <UNK> all his strange mannerisms come across as contrived chris <UNK> is clearly <UNK> rather than taking a role it <UNK> you right out of the story each scene is utterly predictable the <UNK> <UNK> that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced in comedies such as mr bean the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you can <UNK> with the characters motivations and initial event and the situation the character ends up in is not <UNK> corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately <UNK> up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audience br br if chris had not played such an alien character who never really <UNK> with the other characters in the movie and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable except for trying to draw laughs and the comedy scenes weren't so predictable and stereotyped all the jokes seemed far too familiar this movie could have been watchable but it isn't don't watch it
<START> it's not too bad a b movie with sanders <UNK> hale <UNK> hamilton <UNK> fitzgerald and even willie best we could be either with charlie chan <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> holmes or the saint etc in other words you get the chance to spend another hour in the company of some old friends from plain to <UNK> murdering and being murdered always a pleasure in my book br br <UNK> a hard boiled dame out to avenge and clear her framed and dead father a police detective by planning and carrying out with her <UNK> a string of underworld <UNK> which would surely have had the opposite effect sanders joins in the fun simply by dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting falling on both him and the first killer at the right time and killing him br br the story and <UNK> ok the only <UNK> i've got is near the end with the <UNK> and almost laughable discovery of who the evil genius <UNK> was did they almost forget about his relevance in the plot that said a solid entry in the series
<START> i have been a star trek fan for as long as i can remember when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very excited br br the premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters the <UNK> <UNK> enterprise is the perfect <UNK> to show the <UNK> of what many people have come to love br br scott <UNK> was just superior as captain jonathan archer <UNK> <UNK> gave a commanding performance as <UNK> <UNK> that it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is <UNK> going to take us into the great history of <UNK> br br enterprise looks like it's going to be a good series well worth watching and i recommend that watch it
<START> i have been a <UNK> hal hartley <UNK> since i saw his short surviving desire in high school and even then was still completely <UNK> by his <UNK> brilliant henry fool but this 10 year later sequel is not only unnecessary it's <UNK> br br after a choppy and <UNK> start fay grim <UNK> into pseudo <UNK> flat out boredom and finally <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and that's just the plot br br the majority of the new faces are as <UNK> and poorly developed as the movie one particularly flat character ends up <UNK> half the time we spend with the infamous henry fool himself and it's his only spoken scene in the film br br jeff <UNK> agent <UNK> it seems is the only bright character a pun surely intended by hartley as well how then is he left spoiler dead via a car bombing easily making this the gentle natured hartley's most violent film to date and <UNK> all wrong in a film that's already all wrong from the word go br br as for the other new characters <UNK> james ned fool or is it grim not to mention fay herself well i won't spoil their <UNK> as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own when it isn't <UNK> itself with yet another <UNK> <UNK> angle which gives the <UNK> impression that hartley is moving backwards from auteur to crappy film student br br this piece is a complete disaster a dreadful mess that isn't even good <UNK> enough to <UNK> in its <UNK> instead it self <UNK> <UNK> the typically fun <UNK> <UNK> of its director into the real world one <UNK> and <UNK> than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say in doing so hartley tracks sh t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them br br i have rarely been so depressed at the movies and i'm counting leaving las vegas which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them instead of immediately <UNK> characters already beloved br br grim indeed
<START> a sad sad sight indeed is the <UNK> revenge the <UNK> are brought back one last time fred <UNK> received a huge paycheck to come back to the role of herman <UNK> in this made for tv movie about a pair of wax <UNK> of grandpa and herman that are robots <UNK> the city as <UNK> for a robbery of a <UNK> <UNK> at an exhibit with the police on their heels the two elderly television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes in order to clear their names we get to see them dress in drag as <UNK> a minor <UNK> in the film grandpa turns into a bat with attached wire a couple times one time even flying to <UNK> with herman somehow <UNK> his frequent <UNK> miles i guess and a most annoying relative the phantom constantly sings and breaks glass ad <UNK> what is most sad is hard to <UNK> is it that <UNK> especially and al lewis look so <UNK> in every scene and so indifferent to the material is it the hokey costumes of the robots that have that school production values look about them maybe it is the ridiculous script sid <UNK> crazy mostly unfunny antics or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super k mart fashion <UNK> at any even the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for <UNK> standards as for the rest of the cast <UNK> de <UNK> is adequate in a most vacuous role though showing more <UNK> than usual for a woman of her years and experience k c <UNK> makes an ever so not <UNK> eddie <UNK> jo <UNK> is an attractive marilyn bob <UNK> as the aforementioned phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner the film has a real cheap feel about it even for a made for tv movie
<START> this kid is rather bad but in no way do they make him the type that <UNK> adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn no he is not so much a brat as he is a kid with severe emotional problems a nice couple looking to adopt get rather <UNK> into <UNK> him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not through in a bizarre michael richards character and the always annoying gilbert <UNK> and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there i actually prefer the sequel to this film as i like the fact they brought amy <UNK> back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too the plot is simple enough though as the <UNK> parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the <UNK> is throwing a party as they <UNK> they soon realize they have themselves a little <UNK> add to that this little <UNK> getting into contact with a convict of some sort not sure about this character at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something not all that good but i will pick this ahead of that culkin kid any day of the week
<START> a thief in the night has got to be the best out of all the end times thrillers i have no clue what people are complaining about what people are whining about when they say that these movies scared them into accepting god they just needed to find an excuse and blamed a thief in the night do not listen these movies do not only tell of one of the many possibilities of the <UNK> but they're also fun to watch in their simplicity they are in fact low budget and that is a little obvious but not all too obvious upon first viewing i had no clue because i really assumed that a lot of movies like these made in the 70's included low budgets all the time br br a thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical patty myers who lives for what comes her way until her husband and nearly all her friends disappear in the <UNK> rapture everyone warned her about at first the movie isn't all based around her until the rapture happens what it leads up to are showing that everyone else around her are becoming christians and believing in christ which is usually what happens to a lot of people everyone around them they once knew and loved will be gone forever and the one who is left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves no one can ever blame themselves because they're always right br br just like these <UNK> who complain about the movie these people must be full grown adults i'm thirteen and you don't see me whining especially since i was exactly like patty before i re accepted christ into my heart for those who haven't seen it if you want a little bit of everything tossed into a christian movie instead of <UNK> typical everyone else is wrong movies than you'll enjoy a thief in the night don't knock it before you try it something new is always good trust your own instincts
<START> i just watched the convent for the second time i had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken friday night film some gore some style bit of humour and <UNK> i was <UNK> to find that i could no longer appreciate it much it seemed like someone had set out to <UNK> <UNK> epics like night of the demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile for the record i'm not even a huge fan of night of the demons but there were some things i really <UNK> about it the convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much apart from the main girl likeable performance from joanna <UNK> the <UNK> girl and a sweet cameo from <UNK> <UNK> pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable <UNK> at the absolute lowest levels of moronic offensive <UNK> the film is then <UNK> <UNK> by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that given the awful dialogue it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film the evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes though not scary their certainly kinda cool and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore towards the end when <UNK> <UNK> is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy the <UNK> direction also occasionally <UNK> good results although sometimes the camera just moves too fast all in all this was a film where for me the shining good points just can't make up for the things i hated those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more but for me it wasn't a good time
<START> oh dear god this was horrible there is bad then there was this this movie makes no sense at all it runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman the fact that <UNK> isn't a real city takes away since i live in <UNK> watching this movie and <UNK> all these places made it unbearable why didn't they make it a real city the only writing that was decent <UNK> in which john heard did a fantastic job he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time and the movie be a <UNK> too bad hopefully someone important will see it and at least give john heard credit where credit is due and hire him as lead bad guy again which is where he should be on the a list
<START> in her first <UNK> role esther williams plays a school teacher who's the victim of sexual assault she gives a fine performance proving she could be highly effective out of the swimming pool as the detective out to solve the case george <UNK> gives perhaps his finest performance and he is so handsome it hurts john <UNK> is the student under suspicion and although he gets impressive billing in the credits it's edward andrews as his overly protective father who is the standout br br <UNK> in glorious technicolor the <UNK> moment is irresistible <UNK> and at times compelling drama
<START> this game ranks above all so far i had the honor of playing mine on <UNK> so the graphics were really good the voice acting was above standard the difficulty level is just right <UNK> has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn't expecting the only rating this game deserves is great
<START> a delight mini movie a musical short based on three of cole <UNK> broadway smash songs bob <UNK> first credited film is a delight he plays an american playboy millionaire on vacation in paris the film opens with him sitting at a table of an out door <UNK> telling his friends about this beauty that takes his breath away suddenly he spots her a few <UNK> away he is so over come his friends <UNK> him and suggest just show her your bank book but hope claims he can win her in less than 30 days with no money they bet <UNK> <UNK> over the issue and take all his cash and <UNK> hope follows her and when they are alone <UNK> out a <UNK> she does not believe he is sincere until he sings to her you do something to me by cole porter but she must leave and he tries to earn money as a tour guide so he can pursue her but when she sees him showing another girl around town <UNK> she wants to drop him he continues to chase her and catches up to her and her family at a race track where he <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> on the last race hoping to win enough to impress her through a series of events and large <UNK> dance numbers he loses the winning ticket and she decides to marry him rich or poor so he wins the girl the race and the bet and sings two more songs
<START> this is a documentary i came across by chance on the uk tv channel <UNK> and i have to say i found it extremely interesting and thought provoking i will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary basically this is professor jared diamond theory on why certain parts of the <UNK> societies <UNK> and others did not the argument he presents was new to me and <UNK> about how the fortune of the right <UNK> and the right animals that where able to <UNK> is certainly a compelling one as for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of <UNK> when trying to get a message to the masses people have claimed his theory is <UNK> but i do not buy this and see it more <UNK> <UNK> it was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion highly recommended viewing
<START> this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning but never fleshed out to it's expectations the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas typical of the asian directors but doesn't know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it the story was <UNK> and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film never finding a solid <UNK> interesting angle basically the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases the acting was very good however all the actors gave good performances and jude law was outstanding as he is always is it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film
<START> i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months i was actually surprised at how good it was br br the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burned br br a few years later the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party though not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party br br later through the film the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well br br at the end of the film you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened but marty is in the hospital with severe burns although the murders didn't happen the burns and the pranks apparently did happen br br the acting is terrible but that is fine br br i love the story i really sympathize with marty it's like <UNK> 2005 the bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge br br i would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers br br i give this movie 8 stars out of 10 good cheesy slasher
<START> this movie has a very broadway feel the backdrop the acting the <UNK> and yet that's all it has some <UNK> of a broadway without the bang br br the movie is slow paced the picture disjointed the singing <UNK> <UNK> on you so that you suddenly are reminded it's a musical br br disappointing sinatra br br <UNK> sinatra's fiancé surely the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary br br tolerable mr i remember the numbers on my <UNK> br br delight <UNK> understated singing very biased br br surprise how much jean simmons looks like <UNK> leigh in her <UNK> scenes it's the bone structure how i would've killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again
<START> the most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its <UNK> that if one becomes a saint he or she and his or her family and his or her significant other live forever let's forget that in order to become a saint the saint must be dead and saints don't have significant others that for a millennium nick has been the jolly <UNK> to <UNK> scrooge is never even hinted at open on nick learning how to make toys then on fred learning how to run numbers nick giving a sick child a <UNK> fred <UNK> the <UNK> along with the family farm after a few more such episodes <UNK> to present day fred <UNK> his <UNK> at siblings anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy there i just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy br br this santa who is one ho ho ho ho ho away from a massive <UNK> is a neurotic <UNK> <UNK> with the queen of the <UNK> an operation straight out of mega mall hell and answers to a board huh which just gave the <UNK> bunny his pink egg oh and his right hand man is a <UNK> blonde in a skin tight mini dress and go go boots ho ho ho ho ho br br but what really sent me over the edge was slam being named 1 on the naughty list shouldn't a naughty list be reserved for the future <UNK> and <UNK> children who are the true <UNK> of evil nope to old <UNK> fingers a good boy who <UNK> out because he is <UNK> and <UNK> is the demon seed br br the <UNK> behind fred claus should be boiled in their own <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i thought this movie was very well done taking place in the mid 1950's everything looked accurate to me it was well cast and believable i don't usually care much for this type of movie because they just don't have any depth but i felt this movie <UNK> in to the characters and you could feel how they felt you got to really know them and care about them it did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time this movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups after the movie was over i wished there was a part two i wanted to know what happened to dani and her family this movie is bound to be a classic if you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on tv or rent it
<START> ok this movie is stupid i mean that in a good way though it was stupid on purpose and was one of the better stupid movies i've seen the jokes and gags are <UNK> bad but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me the supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre there is a pretty weak plot but it works just fine br br <UNK> character is the focus here she is lovable and adorable <UNK> <UNK> has a world of acting talent that just <UNK> in this movie on top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly stunning few men could disagree with that the parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie br br i had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last br br highly recommended to fans of comedy and to fans of beautiful women i wish they had made a dozen more <UNK> movies
<START> this is my favorite all time movie it used to be my friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when i was single i first saw this movie with my aunt <UNK> and sister <UNK> i was in the 2nd grade i fell in love with travolta and sissy was my new best friend i've read a lot of comments about why bud left sissy how sissy has to learn to act married but let's go back and look at this for a second spoiler my interpretation of the movie now not when i was eight is this about bud <UNK> relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at <UNK> riding the bull they get in a huge fight bud tries to make sissy jealous by asking pam to dance sissy then thinks two <UNK> will make a right and wes asks her if she needs any help they're all on the dance floor acting like fools when bud asks pam when are you going to take me home and rape me pam answers when ever you're ready cowboy bud then goes home with pam to her <UNK> in downtown <UNK> which daddy has bought for her with his oil money and all that that implies bud is the one who <UNK> on sissy sissy is waiting for bud when he returns home the next day sissy is the one who leaves bud then it's up to bud to prove to sissy that he is a real cowboy and win her back br br anyways that's my interpretation everyone has their i'm sure i love this movie br br and believe it or not i got myself a real cowboy i love him too
<START> what an insult to olivia <UNK> who plays the film's heroine robin to have keanu reeves appear so large on the box art of the film and at least on recent <UNK> to have only reeves appear on the box considering that she was the star i realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this long forgotten after school special but at least give the woman some credit br br despite that this has to be one of the worst teen sports themed films that i have ever seen and it <UNK> very hard to add not only every teen and sports movie cliché from the class <UNK> between the <UNK> <UNK> to the teen romance and in <UNK> to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of <UNK> with the music in one of the warehouse dance scenes is even quite close to michael <UNK> notable <UNK> which was made famous by <UNK> or was it the other way around it includes similar dance sequences and worse yet even the 80s dance and sports traditions of corny dance offs between the heroine and her antagonist s the one who doubts her <UNK> and abilities on the team we saw this in <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> dancing at the prom although it wasn't much for competition but rather for fun for example in fact this movie is chock full of unrealistic <UNK> such as the somewhat <UNK> erotic rolling in the clothes at the salvation army with robin and her friend from the team br br nonetheless the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background to top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible she lives with her <UNK> mother her obnoxious sister and her <UNK> and slightly abusive <UNK> needless to say <UNK> is not so appealing add to the mix a talent for <UNK> but several obstacles to joining the team including the <UNK> of her arrogant <UNK> <UNK> and a coach who also eventually doubts her abilities to compete well and of course we can't forget that she's got eyes for one of the pretty boy <UNK> who is dating one of the obnoxious <UNK> nor that she doesn't have a steady boyfriend although keanu as tommy later enters the picture could this kid be any more pathetic and it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long redundant and clichéd quest to prove her worth to everyone br br but even the major moments of cheesiness which <UNK> most of the film are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog i like how the gym coach suddenly appears at the diner in the middle of the dance off to <UNK> the <UNK> it makes episodes of <UNK> <UNK> look like shakespeare br br i imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor for that you might be satisfied but it is also an incredibly forced drama so <UNK> <UNK>
<START> one of the ten best comedies ever br br this seems a comedy so <UNK> and light that sings keaton's comedies are <UNK> <UNK> intelligently ordered thought br br wonderfully amusing deliberately delightful and inventive three ages should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if i were to sketch one a <UNK> love story will <UNK> the viewers i want to bring here this <UNK> comedy is like <UNK> destiny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> again a couple <UNK> the waters of <UNK> of <UNK> the stone age in rome and in keaton's <UNK> a <UNK> country in renaissance italy and in china the same device works in the both <UNK> a grim eerie melodrama the other a light <UNK> comedy at keaton it's essentially the same couple and maybe the same is with lang the babe desired by both buster and <UNK> is nice i have found three ages well written and smart without being <UNK> sophisticated the plot is basically very <UNK> babe is a piece of furniture the only protagonists are the two male <UNK> and <UNK> br br keaton's movie is simply enormously likable and perhaps one would be tempted to <UNK> this looks like ambitious <UNK> it's not but it is grand fun large fun ample fun and wallace <UNK> makes a fine nemesis
<START> being an independent filmmaker and a huge fan of edward d wood jr i purchased this documentary believing that this would finally set the record straight on how gifted and brilliant ed wood actually was br br what i got was a disappointing self centered <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of bitter self <UNK> has <UNK> br br where people do remember ed wood jr do people actually remember the second cousin of the guy with the <UNK> tape who knew someone who was in plan nine from outer space br br it appears as though the very minute there is a <UNK> interest in ed wood these people come out of the wood work only to take mean spirited <UNK> at someone who actually gave them a chance when no one else would after 50 years i would suggest that many of these people should let go of the fact that they didn't get the 75 they were promised br br ed wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to entertain in fact that was all he lived for you may giggle when you see <UNK> films but somehow you are aware that you are laughing with him and not at him br br but i <UNK> back to the film at hand if you are expecting a film about edward d wood jr you won't get it here if you want a film about <UNK> bitter old actors this is the film for you
<START> salvage 4 out of 10 <UNK> day meets a christian <UNK> horror film okay maybe it's not that bad but it is close br br claire played by alicia <UNK> lauren <UNK> lewis is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer chris ferry who is quite menacing and brutal i say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a <UNK> or was it cue music br br the basic problem with the film is that these fifteen minutes of plot done quite well the first time is repeated over and over again and since claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality i just stopped caring what happened to claire and started wondering what lame twist at the end was going to pull this together br br i was rooting for a <UNK> which honestly would have made more sense but instead got one of those too obvious by half surprise endings think the village or below <UNK> the film <UNK> faster than <UNK> <UNK> directors cut all the great twist endings in horror movies the sixth sense the original invasion of the body <UNK> happy birthday to me worked because the audience wasn't expecting a left field explanation heck even the <UNK> ending in the original friday the 13th was worth a <UNK> br br salvage on the other hand screams twist ending with every scene change other <UNK> faults is the one note piano soundtrack though the featured songs were decent the obvious time padding claire doing the <UNK> <UNK> mother's subplots the way claire says hello is anyone there every time she thinks there is a serial killer around br br also some of the secondary acting roles in particular <UNK> mother played by maureen <UNK> who resembles a mary kay zombie shows the first time actor low budget roots br br both too clever by half and not nearly clever enough salvage keeps your interest if only to see how they are going to fix this mess problem is they really don't
<START> even though this was a disaster in the box office it is my favorite film it gives a powerful message of family it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in <UNK> compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more realistic it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan if you want to see the indian godfather amitabh portrays that in this film don't read reviews by critic they're just ignorant this movie has good mix of comedy romance drama and especially action so if you want to see action more realistic than main <UNK> <UNK> still good movie this is the movie
<START> this is a movie that has a lot of things that only japanese people can understand even well translated there are some things that are obviously private jokes or <UNK> symbolism my guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort but that just got wasted on me br br what i felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects some kid becomes the one and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway it would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about but between the azumi bean <UNK> yokai and the one that looks like a big <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eat your heart out i couldn't really <UNK> the plot br br bottom line nice visuals the kid screams a lot the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap
<START> stereotyped derivative unoriginal and boring western the two popular stars charlton heston and james coburn both give performances that are far from their best and <UNK> so they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue heston is a sheriff who liked the world better as it used to be before and coburn is an outlaw who owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt additionally heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and coburn is mean and tough but not as cold blooded a killer as some of the minor villains apparently the filmmakers couldn't come up with even one original idea about how to make this movie somewhat distinguished 1 2
<START> it surprisingly had a plot i've seen movies with less plot i don't wanna mention asian movies but i thought the camera wasn't bad at all for a cheap movie like this and also the atmosphere wasn't too bad there is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens although i do think that about a lot of movies in this case it was horrible of course br br it ripped off some movies so badly just for single scenes the acting was bad but i've seen worse the movie was bad but i've seen worse watching this film is an experience between boredom laughing fits death wish <UNK> <UNK> and entertainment on a low level br br so if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you br br i gave it 3 10 because it can be entertaining if you don't expect to see a good movie and you're in the right mood
<START> this movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete the one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such acclaim was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel <UNK> br br this movie makes me want to go to the <UNK> i am not a negative type of guy but man the acting in this flick is no comment the plot was a bad reflection of the life of carlito <UNK> and i am sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick i still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it
<START> well <UNK> recorded this because of angelina jolie it had 2 5 stars it seemed promising it went downhill fast br br there is much overacting even from angelina she's about 20 and playing a 16 year old there are three characters that are supposed to be italian everyone else is italian american the native italian accents were good i thought the young male lead is cute my wife says everyone else in this movie is a fat italian woman even the men br br i should have known that when dick van <UNK> was cast as a randy doctor that that was a bad sign the two couples chasing their kids around are like the four italian stooges br br my wife would not let go of the remote hopefully she was not taking makeup clothing or <UNK> <UNK> it was a sick and twisted combination of hideous and <UNK> it was <UNK> br br cutting off my left <UNK> was not sufficient to distract from the pain of watching this movie if this movie shows up on your tv do yourself a favor and ram your head through the tv screen instead you'll be glad you did the only movie i've ever seen that was worse than this was <UNK> the movie or maybe deadly friend
<START> it might be a little <UNK> to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films but i think it's the best way to give an <UNK> of the place election <UNK> in the gangster genre <UNK> it works somewhere in between the godfather and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> papers aka battles without honour and humanity in that it is simultaneously both <UNK> and realistic dark and gritty but it's also a <UNK> to film and as such it carries the distinct touch of the hong kong auteur br br every two years the hk <UNK> <UNK> a new boss only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the <UNK> of the rest of the <UNK> and the police that's the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that as in the <UNK> papers there's a great deal of scheming back stabbing and <UNK> and switching of <UNK> sometimes all it takes is a phone call in one of the most memorable scenes i've seen in recent time which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect election is not as action oriented as one might expect although it is violent and i'm not talking about the glossy <UNK> version of hollywood violence this is dark and grim <UNK> camera <UNK> in the scenes of people being <UNK> in ways that reveal both the humanity and <UNK> of the <UNK> and victims after all violence is an integral part of us whether we like it or not br br if you're familiar with <UNK> style then you should know what to expect the pacing is relatively slow and deliberate the cinematography is great slick and dark in equal <UNK> <UNK> dark <UNK> brown dark green and orange while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it in the end election <UNK> a peculiar place it's not exactly a character study and it's not an action oriented gangster film it explores a situation the election and its aftermath but does so in style and is both realistic and <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> in particular echo of an oriental godfather
<START> elephant walk may not be the <UNK> of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasi melodramatic mode it is the story of love both genuine and <UNK> as well as <UNK> ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal <UNK> a previous reviewer john <UNK> questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called elephant walk should have been built by the former owner the <UNK> the late tom <UNK> right across the <UNK> traditional path to the major source of water the river to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the <UNK> of man that his son played by peter <UNK> should become enthralled by the super image and <UNK> of his <UNK> father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as his role models the point of the father was that he was a self made man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their <UNK> to water who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water this is the <UNK> of the film what will animals do to get water what will humans do to get power or love <UNK> today's <UNK> <UNK> is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the <UNK> of miss taylor were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in <UNK> and the magnificent <UNK> this would have been just another <UNK> one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it <UNK> the latter day wealth and power <UNK> by the english immigrant <UNK> that were part and <UNK> of the british raj it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> not to be overlooked are the wonderfully <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> work window and <UNK> borders evidently <UNK> by art directors j <UNK> johnson and hal <UNK> and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island such <UNK> reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought br br for those <UNK> to the <UNK> of time place and architecture there is always the <UNK> of miss taylor as she marries a man she doesn't really know and is <UNK> <UNK> by a another man against the background described and under the <UNK> <UNK> of the legacy of a man deceased as i said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was <UNK> by the special effects <UNK> of today br br this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an <UNK> drive in not on the home tv so <UNK> the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera work and scope
<START> this was filmed back to back with the 1992 re make of conan <UNK> famous novel 'the lost <UNK> and it shows br br the film starts <UNK> enough with a ruthless organization <UNK> to exploit the lost world and <UNK> et al returning to defend the <UNK> <UNK> but then things go downhill everybody is stranded on the <UNK> and we're left with a feeble boring over length rehash of the first film br br the dinosaurs who are hardly ever seen are just laughable are we expected to take that <UNK> toy that's supposed to be an <UNK> seriously and the <UNK> seems <UNK> to the spot br br do yourself a favor and get hold of the <UNK> silent version of the lost world unbelievably in this age of cgi and other advanced effects the <UNK> version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re make
<START> this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen it is humorous how bad it is the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancing i've seen <UNK> with a better plot when the <UNK> was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away but as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it isn't going to do anything compared to if you watch it i don't recommend renting it but if it comes on tv watch it for about <UNK> just to see what i mean i couldn't watch more than <UNK> but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good <UNK>
<START> mark <UNK> stars as mark a college radical <UNK> mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot and he <UNK> all the way to the desert he does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport and flies it himself br br once out flying over the desert mark spots a car from the air a young woman named daria steps out and sees mark <UNK> in the plane mark <UNK> the plane very low several times causing daria to duck or get hit when he lands he becomes <UNK> with daria who is strangely <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br after engaging in <UNK> conversation for hours mark and daria get naked and make love in the sand but with mark <UNK> the law they realize that he needs to keep running so mark and <UNK> brief <UNK> is quite poignant because it doesn't get to develop into a full blown romance br br <UNK> point was the <UNK> of the early 70s both films have a rambling vague quality along with complicated meanings and characters <UNK> was as reckless in person as his character was in this film a few years after making <UNK> point <UNK> robbed a bank in real life while serving his prison sentence mark died an <UNK> death he was killed by a 150 <UNK> weight which fell on him when he was <UNK> br br the best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography and special visual effects the incredible slow motion scenes of <UNK> floating in the air after an explosion were a stroke of genius although not as ground breaking a film as easy rider was <UNK> point still <UNK> with the early 70s <UNK> i recommend it for those who like avant guard films which showcase the <UNK> of the youth rebellion during the early 70s
<START> i'm no big fan of martial arts movies but the video shop was nearly empty and jet li was in lethal weapon 4 and i got it free when the other films i'd rented either way i rented it i absolutely loved it my <UNK> and myself 22 year old <UNK> and <UNK> students spent the half hour after the film making strange kung fu noises and throwing <UNK> <UNK> at each other i can't explain it well maybe a little <UNK> i never enjoyed bruce lee skinny bloke kicking big bloke beating him kicking bigger bloke etc film ends think jackie chan with a little less comedy and more action
<START> i really liked this movie and went back to see it two times more within a week br br ms <UNK> nailed the performance she was like a hungry cat on the <UNK> <UNK> with her prey she <UNK> out in rage and lust taking a too young lover and crashing hundreds of her terrorist <UNK> mother's pieces of fine china to the floor br br the film was full of beautiful touches the <UNK> the wonderful wardrobe the flower boxes along the <UNK> i particularly enjoyed the ancient greek class and the <UNK> of <UNK> br br it had a feeling of <UNK> of <UNK> that is where people of means <UNK> in <UNK> sexual adventure as she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff she is at ease and why not what is to <UNK> a devil in the flesh br br the whole movie is a real treat
<START> oh my where to start this movie was just awful the writing was bad acting was bad special effects were bad i think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh i was in the mood for a scary movie but certainly didn't get that i thought it would be decent enough since i'm not <UNK> i've watched several bad horror movies in fact it is my goal to see all horror movies not matter how awful they may be at one point in the movie i made a comment about the corn <UNK> blood and in the special features they actually admit that it was <UNK> <UNK> brand name corn <UNK> the movie had all the necessary things for a horror movie blood nudity crazy killer stupid moves but it was just completely lacking anything to really make it good the writer should either take some classes or just give up
<START> i did not like the pretentious and overrated apocalypse now probably my favorite vietnam war film is the deer hunter the deer hunter focused on one part of the war and then focused on the lives before the war this movie is essentially deer hunter 2 the script is too loose compared to the deer hunter the story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel for the characters like the <UNK> did the vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as the ones in the <UNK> this is why i can only give this movie 7 out of 10 br br however i think that the acting was outstanding deniro and harris are truly amazing actors they totally immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend bobby in combat <UNK> character is a half dead alcoholic who hides the guilt that he has in bobby losing his life trying to save his br br i also like the supporting cast everyone in the town is part of the movie the town obviously can't handle vietnam vets very well like many small towns it is all about being quiet humble and <UNK> one's business <UNK> character however can't be any of these things it is interesting how wars effect people some people <UNK> quickly while others never really recover
<START> beware spoilers this movie was okay goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it okay so the <UNK> foreign guy who spoiler here <UNK> with the biker for his clothes was funny this guy's boss was good too but the movie really <UNK> to sarandon and hawn these two should have had a lot more time on screen together they're chemistry was great the bathroom scene wow romantic sweet <UNK> br br hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the <UNK> in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians to talk about sarandon would be to give a lot away spoilers this is a rather <UNK> romantic political comedy and it <UNK> both somewhat the political side a whole lot more than the romantic it touches on political issues and just barely <UNK> on romantic areas br br
<START> a very strange and compelling movie it's about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to <UNK> his life as a door to door <UNK> salesman the director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that <UNK> life there is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something i do as frequently as i should one of the more memorable films i've seen in a long while hasn't left my mind and i look forward to future efforts by <UNK> fantastic performances all around the simple line i really appreciate it is now iconic to me
<START> how can anybody say that this movie is a comedy if i had not gone with then my <UNK> i would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back i love <UNK> paltrow but it was like she was on the wrong set i like most chick flicks but i hated this one this is the only time i saw so much <UNK> and was not turned on those outfits were way overdone no one talks that way anymore and i don't think they even did then the dancing part was horrible my ex said to me later didn't ya like that part didn't ya think it was <UNK> i said yes only to spare her feelings now i know why we never married this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
<START> this film is in the <UNK> drum type br br they were both dreadful but they are 100 better than this tripe br br badly acted made oliver reed is the main name <UNK> <UNK> also is in it <UNK> a pity rating is 1 2 about as low as <UNK> can get br br as always br br jay harris
<START> and what a <UNK> two of the <UNK> great singers star together in this underrated musical he writes music she writes lyrics and they both work for basil <UNK> who can't write either because his wife died actually she just got fat best scene is the <UNK> shop number where bing sings an <UNK> number while the swing band gets their <UNK> out of <UNK> just wonderful and this is a rare starring role for broadway legend mary martin and she's quite good <UNK> <UNK> john scott <UNK> william <UNK> oscar <UNK> once again the manic <UNK> charles lane and helen <UNK> co star and who knew <UNK> could be funny
<START> unfortunately this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original nicholas cage fairly wooden as far as actors go <UNK> the screen with a range of skill from non <UNK> to over the top the supporting cast is no better br br the plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold it turns out it's just a bill of poor goods disbelief cannot be suspended nor can a <UNK> of a doubt be given the only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual as the medium requires and <UNK> <UNK> the location should be <UNK> br br there was much laughter in the audience and multiple <UNK> literally at the end br br disappointed wait for the original to come on television pour a <UNK> and enjoy
<START> this movie is the first of <UNK> <UNK> society trilogy and the trilogy kicks of to a great start the movies in the trilogy are only connected <UNK> and these themes are actually apparent in all his films if you look close enough <UNK> <UNK> society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of <UNK> struggling their way to the top of <UNK> <UNK> the kid brother is a lawyer and the <UNK> gang is becoming increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses the movie takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore pretty violent and tough miike has done worse but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex mostly homosexual in this one the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie but with a great drive and true <UNK> if you've only seen <UNK> far out movies <UNK> the killer <UNK> etc this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over the top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side as seen in the other films of the trilogy and as always with miike there are at least two scenes in this that you'll never forget see it and figure out which ones for yourself br br 8 10
<START> let's just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand this is a very dumb film with an even dumber script lame animation and a story that's about as original as <UNK> don't bother unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children they might laugh especially if they're off their <UNK> there's a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with <UNK> that cost approximately zero effort but they don't even bother to break a sweat <UNK> a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing this film frankly <UNK> me off <UNK> shame on you for <UNK> so low
<START> there is not a <UNK> of entertainment in this entire film there's not one scary funny or even interesting scene in this film it <UNK> itself as a horror then goes on to call itself a comedy it doesn't even attempt humor neither does it attempt to be scary br br in order to not be bored by this film you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all i'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this its not funny scary shocking or intriguing so was it supposed to be a drama because it really wasn't dramatic either br br please just do yourself a favor and don't watch this film life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this
<START> this film was absolutely ugh i can't find the word oh wait crap i mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring i nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth ram <UNK> <UNK> has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake what was he trying to do be like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and win all the awards next year like he did for black ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at what was amitabh doing he's destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films first <UNK> then <UNK> <UNK> then <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and i'm telling you he's already past half his way i mean all this is really good for the other actors like shah rukh khan who's getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of amitabh i never really liked him because he thinks he's god and i just knew <UNK> was going to be in that movie br br if you want to save your <UNK> 75 and spend it on something good go watch <UNK> <UNK> because that's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the <UNK>
<START> this is a rip off of the old frankenstein premise an acclaimed scientist is killed in a <UNK> accident and his father a noted brain surgeon saves the brain it is then put into a robotic body of his own design his brother an <UNK> genius gives the <UNK> <UNK> to transfer thoughts into motion the whole project goes bad when the creation goes <UNK> br br special effects are undeveloped the script is lacking and it is humorous that this is not scary a bit well very small kids will think this is good if you are wide awake at three in the morning and this comes on night night br br the lead characters are played by otto <UNK> john <UNK> and ross martin ed <UNK> played the <UNK>
<START> that's what my friend brian said about this movie after about an hour of it he wasn't able to keep from <UNK> off i had been <UNK> about how <UNK> it was and finally i <UNK> and played it having run out of <UNK> for boring br br imagine if you will the <UNK> of hack work something so uninspired so <UNK> dreadful that all you want to do after viewing it is sit alone in the dark and not speak to anybody some people labor under the illusion that this movie is watchable it is not not under any form of <UNK> or brain damage i would only recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how truly unbearable it is don't believe me gather <UNK> br br granted as a nation we in america don't always portray middle eastern peoples in a <UNK> manner but how about a kid in a <UNK> outfit <UNK> in <UNK> fashion to a stack of <UNK> <UNK> oil <UNK> you'll find that here get it the arab <UNK> oil i couldn't believe what i was seeing having the kid fly planes into a <UNK> would've been more appropriate who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke it's not even close to cleverly offensive it just sucks and makes you want to punch <UNK> got paid to write that bit in the face br br in the middle of the film a five man singing group called the <UNK> takes the stage at an <UNK> ball okay are you ready the joke is they sing terribly and off key why did i write that in <UNK> also because the joke is pound pound <UNK> into your head with a marathon of horrendous sight gags they start off mediocre enough glasses cracking punch <UNK> shattering then there is i am 100 serious a two frame stop motion sequence of a woman's shoes coming off you read that correctly the music was so bad in one frame the woman's feet have shoes on in the very next the shoes are off get it because the music was so bad her shoes came off what the f br br then there is an endless montage of stock footage to drive home the point that the singing is bad if any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell i would be <UNK> this movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would <UNK> out the doors robert downey sr directs comedy the way his son <UNK> respect by staying drug free badly other things to watch out for br br 1 the popular music <UNK> in wherever possible every time <UNK> appears a really inappropriate <UNK> pop song plays plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really <UNK> for some reason br br 2 barbara <UNK> criminally awful accent she sounds like she's trying to talk like a baby while rolling a <UNK> around on her tongue there is no nudity and there are several scenes where the boys all <UNK> and <UNK> from a glimpse of her <UNK> like they're in a community school acting class and they've been directed to act like <UNK> retarded people br br 3 <UNK> <UNK> his revolting dog a <UNK> remember when this movie came out throwing in abortion and <UNK> was seen as edgy br br 4 tom <UNK> plays a <UNK> boy hungry <UNK> back when hollywood thought <UNK> and homosexual were one in the same flat out embarrassing br br 5 watch the ending nothing is wrong with your vcr that is actually the ending tell me that doesn't make you want to explode everyone who's ever made any movie ever br br watch this at your own risk up the academy has been known to actually make other movies like the jerk or blazing <UNK> less funny simply by placing the <UNK> near them
<START> saw a trailer for this on another video and decided to rent when it came out boy was i disappointed the story is extremely boring the acting aside from christopher walken is bad and i couldn't care less about the characters aside from really wanting to see <UNK> husband get <UNK> christopher <UNK> role is such a throw away what a <UNK>
<START> though i like e e doc smith's books and david a <UNK> books of <UNK> the anime which is <UNK> based on the books is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair br br though the story may seem familiar to sci fi fantasy buffs such as some kid on an isolated planet <UNK> mystical powers and <UNK> the death of his family it is quite an entertaining one nonetheless plus <UNK> was the first animated motion picture to use hand drawn and cg animation all at once sure it may look a bit outdated now but it is still an <UNK> if it were not for <UNK> none of that would have ever happened personally i think computer graphics look better in animation that live action br br too bad they only released it on dvd <UNK> in a few countries in the <UNK> mostly on <UNK> that are quite foreign and different i just wish they release the <UNK> movie and tv series on dvd <UNK> in every part of the world not just certain parts br br p s <UNK> rules i just think he is so amazing and neat looking as well
<START> i bought this dvd for 1 at <UNK> after seeing it i might just return to the store and try to get my money back the only reason i gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has a few novel story elements though it really never rises to the level of being interesting this film has all the <UNK> of being a made for the drive in theaters market ultra low budget amateurish acting and a liberal dose of sex for an early 60s film in fact i wonder if perhaps the only reason the film was made was to make a fast buck and because someone knew some <UNK> they could use as extras the film is about a <UNK> doctor who wants to transplant his <UNK> severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting <UNK> most of the potential <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> or a model whose only real purpose in the film is to <UNK> as they remove most of their clothes however they keep too much on to make the movie even worth watching for the naughty bits and the film isn't quite awful enough to merit watching by bad film buffs
<START> i am surprised that everyone even the critics seems to think this was a good movie it was the most clichéd thriller ever made that i have seen we have the <UNK> <UNK> who wants to force the <UNK> <UNK> or girls in this case to do something or face the consequence the <UNK> <UNK> in this movie must use her <UNK> and skills to defeat the <UNK> <UNK> and save the day and her loved ones using charisma bravery and even luck to save the day br br where to begin well a young woman by the name of lisa <UNK> meets a young man by the name of jackson <UNK> nice name at an airport one coincidence leads to another and soon it seems as if fate is bringing these two together sharing drinks sitting next to each other seemingly getting along in every way is there more to this <UNK> could these two be meant for each other does <UNK> have a reason for their strange and random encounter br br well as it turns out unfortunately yes jackson needs to lisa to help him <UNK> the director of <UNK> security by moving him from one room to another so that his men can launch an attack on him oh if she doesn't do this then her father is dead though we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness jackson more then explains how this is going to happen and why its in <UNK> best interest to help him br br of course lisa <UNK> his evil plans with her <UNK> and in the process stabs him in the neck makes him trip over <UNK> and hitting him with a field hockey stick oh and before that she leads him on wild chase through miami airport where she gets passed post 9 11 security and steals a car that she later uses to run over the man who was ordered to kill her father br br yeah right br br first of all i find it strange that a man like jackson who can get his hands on high tech <UNK> needs the help of a hotel manager couldn't he just sneak a bomb into the building wouldn't that make it <UNK> for him and his team by leaving out any third parties and why do characters like jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they are threatening doesn't that make it easier to stop them by the same people br br the actors did their best considering the movie they were given <UNK> mcadams and cillian murphy are still actors to look out for also i believe that <UNK> <UNK> who played the <UNK> <UNK> will be someone we will see more of it's just too bad they all were stuck with this br br 2 out of 10
<START> this show is freaking hilarious the jokes are original god and i love eric and <UNK> yeah i know what they say after the <UNK> season it's not funny anymore because eric and <UNK> are no longer in the show and randy is a real <UNK> randy is comparing to eric and <UNK> br br you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with i'm a cool guy kind of guy randy it isn't his fault anyway but the writers are trying to keep the <UNK> season funny it's still is not as much as the earlier seasons but its alright br br the <UNK> are awesome the circle red is a real kind of mental <UNK> dad and kitty is always half high half pie hyde tries to be cool all the time he has his moments too the least <UNK> characters are jackie and donna they're cool but not without <UNK> and eric br br great show <UNK>
<START> i thought <UNK> care was quite bad and very unintentionally funny but at least not as bad as i thought it might be sometimes it's somewhat suspenseful but never a good shocker br br spoiler ahead br br the fun lies in ridiculous moments but the all time classic moment is this peter <UNK> <UNK> is stabbed and beaten by the killer he lies <UNK> in the corner of the <UNK> amy <UNK> van <UNK> <UNK> beside him and asks poor peter shall i get you a band aid br br this movie was shot in dutch and english to spare costs all license <UNK> are usa and the background in the news studio is a <UNK> of manhattan very funny if you're dutch and watching the original version in dutch
<START> an independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume enter broken and <UNK> promoted twenty minute short with style and <UNK> to spare but is it any good as a film or does it only work as a <UNK> piece ah there in lies the rub br br broken is the story of bonnie <UNK> who is <UNK> after awakening from a <UNK> nightmare one night by a sadistic stranger and his colorful <UNK> quote from the video box as she's held captive it becomes obvious that her <UNK> know things about her that even she didn't know about herself while they question her a black clad soldier guns his way into their <UNK> in an attempt to rescue her mayhem ensues br br fortunately for us director alex <UNK> seems to know what he's doing or at least he's very good at <UNK> it broken does not suffer from any lack of visual flair which is especially commendable considering its budget and the <UNK> of all involved what it does suffer from is weak and kind of derivative writing think long kiss <UNK> meets the matrix written ten minutes after reading fight club the good news for <UNK> and producer writer <UNK> rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the <UNK> of eye candy on display does the plot really matter that much in a twenty minute short meant to show off the technical skills of its creators no not really br br though it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspects in light of the films budget and length broken is no genre classic the biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a full length feature the final twist doesn't get enough build up time to be shocking if <UNK> were allowed the time to slow burn the feature as needed plot elements would seem less random and the film more complete here's to knowing he's getting the chance br br audio <UNK> <UNK> digital 5 1 presentation is second to none in the indie world i've never heard such aggressive surround from such a small feature the matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep <UNK> have punch and even the dialogue gets in on the surround effects of everything presented on this disc it is the audio that speaks the praise for modern independent dvd production also included is an equally impressive <UNK> 2 0 surround track which is the menu <UNK> br br extras there are literally hours of making of features to be found on this disc there are so many extras in fact that i find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here while still expecting my readers to continue reading whatever shortcomings the actual short may have the dvd is <UNK> in its <UNK> resources people who enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production including everything from the <UNK> art to the <UNK> campaign those with plans to make an indie film of their own can learn just about everything they need to know from these features br br the extras are broken down into <UNK> <UNK> these include pre production production post production after the short and cast and crew <UNK> from a critical standpoint i found that some of the sections were quite short had they been edited into one <UNK> per menu option they would've been less frustrating to <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> to the top selection with every return to the main section menu this is of course just <UNK> but perhaps for future dvd releases the filmmakers will take my advice to heart br br it has six audio <UNK> and hours of interview footage and talented people and despite the <UNK> <UNK> their true colours do shine through br br the <UNK> to share their film making secrets with anyone who picks up this dvd is quite generous from the extras i learned what editing and effects <UNK> is most reliable and effective what brand of camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price even where to get cheap air soft <UNK> on top of this i was given several alternate <UNK> in case i found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production wannabe filmmakers unwilling to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this dvd br br overall i've scored the actual short as a 6 out of 10 but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort because i'd have scored it an 8 or 9 in these fields i recommend the dvd for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with a mere eight thousand american dollars those who purchase the dvd can think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project as the more attention these guys get the more funding the feature length version will get
<START> i just watched this horrid thing on tv needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get frankly i don't know how much lower the bar can go br br the characters are composed of one lame <UNK> type after another and the obvious attempt at creating another bad news bears is embarrassing to say the very least br br i have seen some <UNK> <UNK> in my time but there is no reason to list any of them since this is <UNK> <UNK> br br let me put it to you this way i watched the vanilla ice movie because it was so bad it was funny this this is not even that good
<START> while some scenes of training were realistic too many of them depicted military <UNK> as ex nazi types obviously the people who wrote the screen play were either anti military types or writing a film for that audience br br i am a <UNK> <UNK> vet and even during this period military <UNK> who <UNK> in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison br br and i really loved the scene where the hero and his buddy both <UNK> are sitting down in the <UNK> office smoking <UNK> and talking and <UNK> with the captain as if he were their buddy this sort of thing never happened in training or in a <UNK> situation as was the purpose for the scene br br at the end i asked myself what was this film about as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except i hate all authority thank god i got it from the library and did not pay to rent it
<START> once in a while you come upon a movie that <UNK> your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions leaving you <UNK> vivah is just that  maybe more after watching <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i really thought that bollywood has reached its <UNK> and will never come up with anything like that ever boy was i wrong i went to the store to buy some <UNK> and decided to pick this movie up along with the new don just so i can compare the great <UNK> with <UNK>  although the decision is already made in my mind after <UNK> whether i should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do when i saw the rating of u instead of an a i was happy that at least it is something where i don't have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a hollywood b actress for the first 5 minutes or so i thought i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting after all everyone who has seen shahid <UNK> know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor boy  was i wrong about this movie this movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never let it go it was a great movie with a good storyline about the <UNK> traditions of our society i liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept of arranged marriage but also that he did it with a conviction that it is the right thing to do i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good i felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever it was still very very good the good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the i watched that movie a second time the other good thing is that <UNK> songs are not pushed into the script as we have all seen in so many movies these songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition just like ajay <UNK> went from being a joke to a great actor after company and salman found his groove after hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this movie will help shahid <UNK> jump to being of the better actors and <UNK> in bollywood this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role he acted well and <UNK> to being the nice good looking young rich kid yes you will not find him playing basketball and <UNK> every point on a <UNK> like you saw <UNK> in <UNK> even though he is shown to be an indian in england  both countries not big on basketball by the way he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values amrita <UNK> for the first time came across as someone to be remembered in all her other movies she was competing with big faces which was actually <UNK> her no one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie some of the scenes in which she has to cry especially towards the end really shows her knowledge and depth of acting although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one i think this movie will and should do wonders for her move over <UNK>  there is finally another girl who if given a decent chance to work with good directors can grab the torch from you she is beautiful with a great voice and has a face that exudes complete innocence oh having almost 0 body fat does not hurt either yes people i will challenge you find even 0 1 fat on her and unlike so many others like <UNK> she can actually act too i thought i will never be <UNK> by anyone's beauty after <UNK> and early <UNK> but she completely changed that shahid and amrita worked very well together and their relationship <UNK> their characters and they both did an excellent job although i was waiting for shahid to turn into a girl like salman did every time he <UNK> hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when i finished watching this movie it left me so emotionally <UNK> that i decided to watch this movie again right away yes right away i have never ever done that not even with <UNK> but this movie just had something that had to be understood again and again i will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so i can watch and <UNK> the traditions we all grew up with i miss those times where families sat down and had fun when parents had time for their kids and where kids respected what their parents believed in i know a lot of people think that movie does not portray real life but deep down don't we all want it to happen the families <UNK> tradition the love and respect this is what this movie will remind all of us of i can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy i am sure some young people will not like this movie but if you are over 28 i doubt that you will be one of them
<START> the movie follows the events of the novel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> could be translated as the most beloved among humans written by <UNK> <UNK> a very controversial book and movie a novel which became something like the bible or the story of hamlet very popular and hard to get due to its <UNK> <UNK> over the communist regime it represents the drama of the intellectual man the <UNK> in a red world a movie filled with passion fear sexuality all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe one of the greatest romanian movies despite its psychological charge after all it is an european movie
<START> i've seen hundreds of silent movies some will always be classics such as <UNK> metropolis the general and wings but among them my favorite is this film it may not be the best but a favorite yes in fact when i looked it up on imdb i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh darn cute and well made marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph <UNK> mistress br br the story involves a <UNK> from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must see
<START> i watch most movies that nick <UNK> is in because frankly i love the guy even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie long time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick it's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot but then most movies these days aren't exactly original but rick roberts is appealing as the <UNK> husband martha <UNK> is equally appealing as the daughter and <UNK> <UNK> does a good job if that was her goal of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and <UNK> however too much of the plot takes place off screen like motivation prior <UNK> good times and bad times and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience i e me the final scene leaves everything to be desired in the but what about category and overall i can't say that i cared much about any of the characters that being said it was what it was a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon and i still like nick
<START> i love the music of the clash and i love the music of joe <UNK> and the <UNK> i went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that but i came out of the theatre not knowing much more about joe than i already did after reading the entry on <UNK> the movie never really gets through to the person his thoughts and feelings what they did was to collect the little material that they had shaky <UNK> videos and to interview some people about joe <UNK> at a camp fire it turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say oh he was such an inspiration to all of us like <UNK> or johnny <UNK> whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in pirates of the <UNK> it seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart that ever lived <UNK> the person without really knowing enough about him br br sure being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band hearing the <UNK> behind the songs and such but in the end i felt like what remained as the portrait of joe <UNK> could have easily been told in 60 90 minutes br br go see the movie if you are a fan otherwise better listen to some music of the clash or even better the <UNK> unknown <UNK> where joe <UNK> reached the peak of his musical development before his death melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound
<START> jim carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today with his <UNK> <UNK> and his rubber face he can just go crazy and we love him for it he has the ability to make mediocre comedies ala ace <UNK> and turn them into decent comedic <UNK> or in the case of <UNK> <UNK> make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around carrey has also <UNK> himself capable of <UNK> dramas he was excellent in both <UNK> on the <UNK> and 'the truman show ' the guy is remarkable br br then comes <UNK> almighty ' an ideal vehicle for carrey and a premise that should have worked carrey after complaining about god and how his life stinks is <UNK> with god's powers however the script is pure recycled garbage now no matter how bad a script is <UNK> <UNK> alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny the problem is that there are very few opportunities for carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects only some of which are amusing carrey is rarely able to <UNK> because he has to work around the special effects the writers apparently thought that all these special effects and <UNK> sequences were funny because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely <UNK> he seems more like a 5 year yearning for our attention wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny when it's really just annoying br br i have always enjoyed jennifer aniston on <UNK> and she was superb in last year's 'the good girl ' she too has a gift for comedy but with the script as linear as it is she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend she comes across as <UNK> grumpy and there is no chemistry between the two stars br br <UNK> <UNK> should have been a comedy that works but it doesn't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it's making fun of religion a few minor <UNK> his internet is <UNK> but instead it's just turned into a comedic <UNK> comedy not to mention that it's tone shifts from silly to heavy handed and even black comedy at times the movie fails on nearly every level that's not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs but it's close any movie that feels the need to <UNK> scenes of a dog <UNK> to get it's laughs has problems but hey if you find pee jokes funny go for it br br
<START> no this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance but it is brilliant in its own right you have to look at it for what it is a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that he keeps out <UNK> in <UNK> those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden gem as they say and just didn't quite get there i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the 5 <UNK> baby attached to a fish pole <UNK> well yes i don't think a movie with a budget like this could afford good actors or effects so they worked with what they had the guts and <UNK> were actually very convincing the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesn't follow any trend or predictability very good for a laugh
<START> not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing <UNK> there are lots of <UNK> i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the 80's but not for the 21st century
<START> back in the day of the big studio system the <UNK> casting decisions were made good old all american james stewart appearing as a hungarian in the shop around the corner had i been casting the film the part of <UNK> would have been perfect for charles boyer his accent mixed in with all the other european accents would have been nothing stewart had some of the same problem in the mortal storm also with margaret <UNK> br br margaret <UNK> was his most frequent leading lady on the screen he did four films with her but is only this one where neither of them dies <UNK> and her husband <UNK> <UNK> knew stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in new york in fact <UNK> husband was stewart's good friend henry fonda back then br br i think only clark gable was able to carry off being an american in a cast of non americans in <UNK> on the bounty stewart in the mortal storm was german but all the other players were american as well so nothing stood out br br but if you can accept stewart than you'll be seeing a fine film from ernest lubitsch the plot is pretty simple a man and woman working in a department store in <UNK> don't get along in person but it seems that they are carrying on a <UNK> with some anonymous <UNK> which turn out to be each other also <UNK> frank morgan suspects stewart wrongly of <UNK> with his wife br br though the leads are fine and frank morgan <UNK> from his usual <UNK> self the two players who come off best are felix <UNK> and joseph <UNK> <UNK> has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after morgan starts asking people for opinions he makes himself very <UNK> br br and joseph <UNK> who is always good is just great as the <UNK> little worm who is constantly kissing up to frank morgan you really hate people like that i've known too many like <UNK> in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day sad that it pays off a good deal of the time
<START> lame lame lame a 90 minute cringe fest that's <UNK> minutes too long a setting <UNK> with atmosphere and possibility an abandoned convent is <UNK> by a stinker of a script filled with clunky witless dialogue that's <UNK> oh so hard to be hip mostly it's just embarrassing and the attempts at <UNK> horror fall flat a <UNK> of this movie's dialogue after <UNK> her <UNK> fast <UNK> shot to a <UNK> of <UNK> vigilante <UNK> any questions ' <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bad acting idiotic <UNK> jokes and judging from the creature effects it looks like the director's watched the evil <UNK> way too many times br br i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and <UNK> them to ninety wasted minutes they'll never get back what a turd
<START> i had watched this film from ralph bakshi <UNK> hey good <UNK> one night ago on www <UNK> <UNK> and i didn't see anything racial i am not stupid i do admit the character designs are a bit crude and <UNK> today but i think it's a satire and a very very urban retelling of the old uncle <UNK> stories that the black american culture created right down to the main characters and the blatant nod to the <UNK> baby and the <UNK> <UNK> these aren't <UNK> stories mind you but cultural icons created by black americans and me being a white woman read and love those stories and i also found it an interesting time capsule view on the black culture in harlem new york in the 70's br br well to get to the <UNK> gritty of this film this film is a live action animated film which begins in live action with a fellow named <UNK> barry white and the <UNK> charles <UNK> rush to help their friend randy philip michael thomas escape from prison but are stopped by a <UNK> and wind up in a shootout with the police while waiting for them randy <UNK> <UNK> to fellow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as he begins to tell randy the animated story of brother rabbit a young newcomer to the big city who quickly rises from obscurity to rule over all of harlem you know to me rabbit bear and fox are animal versions of randy <UNK> and the <UNK> an abstract <UNK> of stylized animation and live action footage the film is a graphic and <UNK> satire of stereotypes prevalent in the 70s  racial ethnic and otherwise br br so anyway it is another good bakshi movie and should we <UNK> films like this under the <UNK> pretend they never exist hmmm i think that would be a shame i think we should watch these films <UNK> and learn about what goes on back then just how far we come since then
<START> this is widely viewed in australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here and for my money anywhere it's raw gritty the characters are real the situations are believable and it doesn't shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cops and the criminals victims lawyers and other people in their various <UNK> br br this show ran for 2 seasons and was <UNK> because the show didn't sell well overseas we are all sorry for its loss however like <UNK> towers we will be able to <UNK> this as a limited length series of uniformly high quality
<START> after watching this i had lost a little respect for christopher lee this has passed over time this film was utter garbage first they tried to recreate the ending from the first howling with incredibly bad make up then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film from the look of it it was supposed to be dee wallace stone teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves lead by <UNK> <UNK> who seems to be naked all the time br br this is not even worth renting unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity try to catch it on cable instead it would be so chopped up it may actually make sense
<START> this is a great story of family loyalty which thankfully doesn't resort to the usual tricks or at least the ones i'm used to seeing in american and european films of <UNK> or high dramatic tension br br it's very watchable and very lovable it has some beautiful cinematography but doesn't rely on that alone to entertain
<START> a lot of death happens in the wild you don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out but does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary what is with this fascination with gruesome death do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to <UNK> by a pack of hungry lions or a <UNK> grabbing a <UNK> by the throat in slow motion no less i thought this was going to be a family friendly nature film br br and why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film's trailers were the filmmakers afraid of losing money br br then in typical comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent birds of paradise perform <UNK> <UNK> to the most annoying and stupid narration <UNK> possible it was surreal it's as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a <UNK> of first and second <UNK> on a school field trip wow from the mean to the moronic in a <UNK> br br if there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review why not focus on animals actually <UNK> giving birth laying eggs bathing sleeping cleaning each other <UNK> playing emotional displays other than fear and anger unusual <UNK> like mouth brooding <UNK> problem solving skills culture yes many animal species have what humans call culture communication skills <UNK> healing abilities etc in other words stop focusing on violence or <UNK> down beauty and why not be much more well rounded and focus on delight and inspiration instead
<START> purple rain is a great film if you are a 40 something music lover who <UNK> to prince music in the 1980s the story is a much used formula rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional <UNK> to find his audience and self respect prince is a bad actor but his performance especially of purple rain i would die 4 u make it worth sitting through the film he is himself and as a <UNK> as powerful on stage as mick jagger or michael jackson circa thriller <UNK> <UNK> a former prince <UNK> is beautiful and shows some acting talent and chemistry with prince but her script doesn't let her far morris day and other supporting actors provide comedic elements
<START> the character of tarzan has been subjected to so many clichés and so many bad interpretations that those who are hoping for a different kind of version people like me i mean who liked the tarzan books as a kid and have always wished for a movie version that followed the books just a little ought to know how the recent <UNK> stack up some of the imdb reviews address this point but here's my <UNK> br br i am aware of only two count 'em cinema depictions of tarzan namely <UNK> with christopher <UNK> and the disney animated version that try to depict edgar rice <UNK> rather interesting character the son of a <UNK> english noble couple picked up after their death by a tribe of apes who raise him as one of themselves and who becomes lord of the jungle because of his superior human intellect before making it back to england and claiming his other identity rather than the usual hollywood jungle man whose origin remains obscure and whose <UNK> are his famous yell his mysterious inability to speak proper english despite long exposure to people who know the language his habit of swinging on <UNK> his strength <UNK> etc about the only thing these two characters have in common are the name tarzan and the fact that they both have a wife named jane ron <UNK> tv version is something of a compromise like <UNK> character he speaks good english and is <UNK> and suave in both cultures in a sort of <UNK> way but he's no lord <UNK> and there's no jane br br well this film is in a third category of tarzan films and i hope it remains a category of one because it's awful this category uses the character as a vehicle for of all things soft porn jane played by <UNK> bad actress bo derek is in africa looking for her dad the absent minded professor who is <UNK> the jungle looking for something which is never <UNK> though her dad is supposed to have been missing for a long time she finds him effortlessly richard harris as the dad is the best thing here he sees the film is stupid so he has fun overacting and <UNK> in a way that reminds me of peter <UNK> deliberately silly performance in what's new <UNK> dad explains the legend of tarzan some sort of ghost or spirit he says either a steal from or an <UNK> attempt at homage to king kong to his daughter who is at this point unfamiliar with the ape man shortly afterward we hear the infamous cliché of the tarzan yell dad dies which oddly doesn't seem to <UNK> his devoted daughter very much and then br br then tarzan appears but says nothing indeed he says nothing during the entire film he and jane fall in love and they romp around wearing almost nothing as she <UNK> <UNK> love poetry off screen the end that's the plot br br well not exactly there's also a scene where tarzan <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> a most unusual <UNK> since it's the only <UNK> one ever seen jane treats the bite with the aid of a <UNK> who helps by <UNK> out the <UNK> she tears off to <UNK> the wound with i'm not making this up and this is only one of many excuses for her to take her clothes off br br i always like to conclude a review by saying something positive but this time it's hard let's see well it's unfair to criticize this film for featuring an <UNK> even though we all know <UNK> don't live in africa after all the classic tarzan movies all used indian elephants did they not also you have to admit that bo derek is pretty in face and form but in that case why the hell didn't she just make a career as an art model what does it say about a movie when it becomes plain boring to look at a pretty woman i actually haven't decided whether it's a positive or a negative that they never showed her <UNK> but now i realize try as i may i can't end on a positive note br br see this film if you're a bad film buff i'm <UNK> here
<START> and a self admitted one to boot at one point the doctor's assistant refers to himself as <UNK> br br working with the increasingly plausible idea that computers could be used to replace or <UNK> brain functions this movie doesn't spend enough time exploring the premise most of the screen time is split between girlfriend in a coma domestic <UNK> and chasing down the brain <UNK> killer it attempts to be a sci fi drama thriller but fails to deliver on any of the three br br as a frankenstein remake this one is missing everything that made the original good nobody calls the doctor insane or even threatens to kick him out of the hospital the transformation scene consists of a coma victim opening one eye and the amazing computer that makes it happen isn't even shown when the experiment works there is no praise and when it starts going wrong there is little reaction br br any suspense over who the killer might be is <UNK> by <UNK> showing him in the same room with all of the possible suspects finding the killer is as easy as opening one file and <UNK> one person br br san francisco as a setting is both <UNK> and underused the opening sequence <UNK> home the point that this is happening in sf a cable car plays a significant role the leads live in a <UNK> victorian <UNK> <UNK> makes an appearance and the final showdown happens at golden gate park more specifically along ten feet of cliff side at the park just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times once the obvious scenery <UNK> are rounded no other attempt is made to explore the city br br the acting is the only saving grace here <UNK> <UNK> shows a good range and pulls off a couple of genuinely emotional scenes <UNK> love portrays <UNK> from a coma well tony curtis only gets a handful of lines and twice as many evil guy stares with most of the <UNK> explained away by his assistant the little blond kid hits his <UNK> fairly well also br br i also gave it one extra star for the scene where the husband drives south from the bridge it cuts to a u turn in an unrelated parking lot and then he's instantly back on the bridge driving north it takes a whole lot of something bravery ignorance <UNK> to try and slip that one by the viewer during the one single car chase
<START> i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10 br br the final episode of the <UNK> season <UNK> where it would certainly appear that the <UNK> have been killed off in a very rushed unconvincing and very <UNK> fashion left me in disbelief br br from the extremely rushed end of the series it's obvious that many of the story <UNK> were originally <UNK> to occur over at least one more season my guess would be that they rapidly <UNK> these stories to position the stargate sg 1 franchise for the two upcoming direct to dvd moves br br unless the <UNK> return in a future sg 1 movie with a very good explanation of the apparent <UNK> i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean up of loose ends br br poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci fi series
<START> man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film <UNK> class laughed like crazy now most of the rest of the film was okay it had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing yes <UNK> is a great director who made flight of the phoenix and whatever happened to baby jane among others the problem isn't with direction acting or anything technical the movie is just destroyed in the third act why the murders twists turns and characters have all been revolving around nuclear material what the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that the way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest <UNK> ex <UNK> in history for all the complaints about <UNK> planet of the apes the life of david <UNK> or notorious i think this is the worst ending ever what a let down
<START> i went in not knowing anything about this movie and i walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it it was one of worst movies i've ever seen i'm a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie i would probably never talk to them again anybody who likes it <UNK> is most likely to have an extremely dry <UNK> type personality i'm gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too just like the self centered fart <UNK> who do the voices for the movie i know everyone has different types of humor some people may not even like mine but that's okay i don't think this covers any range of humor though this movie is as flat and dull as wes <UNK> mind go in and get ready to walk out it's best to get your money back too
<START> when sabrina first came onto our screens i was about 12 and therefore spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch get into all kinds of weird <UNK> br br it was always one of my favourite <UNK> the <UNK> feeling of sixties sitcom <UNK> but this time the character was <UNK> i always liked sabrina because she was smart she was also friendly and easy going which made her enjoyable to watch the characters at the beginning were great harvey jenny <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and mr <UNK> my personal <UNK> shame he left so early on <UNK> and <UNK> her aunts started off ok but then became irritating br br i liked mr <UNK> too as he was always that little bit closer to discovering <UNK> secret what i loved about the first three series was the original ideas the discovering of the family secret and learning new spells but as it went on it became more predictable too many characters came and left such as valerie <UNK> and brad and then they decided to do sabrina at college which ruined it for me br br sabrina became self absorbed at college there was less magic no spell book no aunts living with her and <UNK> miles and morgan were annoying br br the last series was boring and i only watched to see what happened in the end not having <UNK> and <UNK> seemed wrong somehow and miles was gone just like that the last episode made me feel a lot better though spoiler having sabrina end up with harvey on her wedding day to <UNK> aaron was great overall a great programme if you forget the poor last two or three series which reminded me of so many teen shows magical
<START> i was so disappointed in this movie i don't know much about the true story so i was eager to see it play out on film and <UNK> myself about a little slice of history with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a <UNK> combination well somewhere the screenplay failed them it was so scattered is this movie about his childhood his love life his own <UNK> his speaking ability his passion for the disabled i'm sure there is a way to <UNK> all of those things into a good story but this movie wasn't it i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their <UNK> but because of their personalities other small <UNK> 1 the heavy handed soundtrack it's the seventies we get it already 2 if he's such a phenomenal public <UNK> why weren't we treated to more than a <UNK> here and there and even then mostly in montages
<START> her cardboard lover is norma <UNK> last movie she quit the movies and i think joined the board of directors at mgm that was a good move on her part her cardboard lover was talky and boring in parts it was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey <UNK> br br the story was a good idea about a wealthy woman norma <UNK> hiring a man robert taylor to make her playboy <UNK> george sanders jealous i am surprised that the director george <UNK> did not cut many of the talky scenes between ms <UNK> and mr taylor mr <UNK> served ms <UNK> well in the women but not in this movie br br the best performance in the movie was given by robert taylor during mr <UNK> career he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and when ladies meet in 1941 in 1942 he gave his best comedy performance in her cardboard lover and up to then his best dramatic performance in johnny eager he had a busy year i think of all the actors at mgm mr taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot also mgm gave mr taylor all types of movies to make most of them were successful that is why mgm kept him for 25 years br br mr george sanders was very good as a <UNK> <UNK> he played a similar role eight years later in all about eve for which he won an oscar for a supporting role as for ms <UNK> this was one of her worst performances she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy it is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939 the women and gave her best performance it was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in her cardboard lover also it didn't help that some of her clothes were awful br br too bad she and mr taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together the superb escape the same comments about this movie can be said of another movie personal property that mr taylor made in <UNK> with jean harlow it was too talky boring and the actress looked old ms harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor so in <UNK> she died at age 26 what a waste she was becoming a good actress and getting better roles
<START> spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty nobody should love that <UNK> shepard br br the color purple takes place in the deep south during the early <UNK> and tells the story of <UNK> and <UNK> two african american sisters the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers an <UNK> <UNK> which is promptly <UNK> by the appearance of their <UNK> this <UNK>  innocence interrupted by men  <UNK> the entire film br br the film then <UNK> into a series of short sequences <UNK> is revealed to have been twice <UNK> by her <UNK> gives birth in a dirty <UNK> has her <UNK> child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson a violent <UNK> who rapes her repeatedly forcing her to cook clean and look after his children br br all these horrific scenes are given little screen time and are instead surrounded by moments of <UNK> dust cinematography a <UNK> <UNK> score <UNK> comedy and overly <UNK> camera work the <UNK> effect is like the <UNK> of a disney cartoon and a rape movie a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so <UNK> that he had to turn it off after ten minutes ten minutes he lasted a long time br br the film is often said to deal which racism <UNK> and black culture but this is not true alice walker the author of the novel upon which the film is based claims to be a <UNK> but is actually a closet lesbian her book is a lesbian fantasy a story of female <UNK> and self discovery which paints men as violent <UNK> who <UNK> women for walker the only way out of this <UNK> is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian <UNK> black <UNK> and female independence celebrated br br spielberg's film however re frames <UNK> story through the lens of <UNK> american <UNK> this is a film in which the <UNK> power of christianity <UNK> the natural cruelty of men a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool a film in which all the characters are derived from racist <UNK> shows the cast comprised of <UNK> men always <UNK> with <UNK> smiles and <UNK> <UNK> stereotypical fat <UNK> jazz bands and <UNK> <UNK> br br this is a film in which black people are naturally <UNK> readily and happily accepting their social conditions a film in which black people are over <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dominated by violent passions a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept this is not the old south this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind mgm <UNK> song of the south warner cartoons <UNK> and banned disney movies in other words it's the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv it's all so cartoonish so racist in the way it <UNK> these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes that black novelist <UNK> reed <UNK> <UNK> it to a nazi conspiracy br br of course in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being <UNK> this <UNK> was in <UNK> novel but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story <UNK> with their <UNK> br br beyond <UNK> hate letter to black men and spielberg's bizarre <UNK> of black life we are shown nothing of the black community we have only the <UNK> ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community instead spielberg's camera jumps about desperately fighting for our attention one of <UNK> kitchen <UNK> seems like it belongs in a home alone movie every emotion over played the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by couple this with <UNK> jones' ridiculously white music and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist <UNK> filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith scored by a black man trying to <UNK> john williams br br <UNK> too is the lack of white characters consider this the men in this film aren't portrayed as being rough to each other nor do they dominate women because they are <UNK> by a racist society which <UNK> their <UNK> no they are cruel by nature and the women whether quietly suffering like <UNK> or rebellious and tough like her sister <UNK> and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them a better film would not have focused solely on the <UNK> of women as it occurs among the <UNK> rather it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to <UNK> abuse that <UNK> black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors women unable to support themselves and their children alone br br and so there's a hidden ideology at work here late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't respect his wife she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites the <UNK> is that blacks need to return to their african roots to <UNK> their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites <UNK> crush them ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you won't run <UNK> of the <UNK> white culture br br 3 10 a failure to confront sex and <UNK> inappropriate musical numbers countless sequence loaded with <UNK> visual <UNK> <UNK> comic business <UNK> music <UNK> and wildly hyped <UNK> all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless
<START> i picked up this video after reading the text on the box the story seemed good and it had keanu reeves but after 5 minutes of watching i noticed how horrible his acting was he walks and talks so stupid the whole time it's fake and not convincing it doesn't end there almost all the characters act so badly it's laughable the only acceptable acting was by alan <UNK> david but the guy commits suicide early on and you don't see him again you never even know why he did it everything about this movie screams low quality i can't believe how such a thing gets released i was tempted many times to stop watching in fact i did half way through it i decided to stop watching and turned the thing off came to the imdb to check what other's thought about it i found zero comments not surprised so i decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it the only good thing going for me was the high school rock band theme the occasional guitar playing and singing parts but that's not worth it br br very bad acting and directing terrible movie
<START> beyond dirt cheap this shot on video exercise in <UNK> was difficult to get through it's got the typical gore that you'd expect in a zombie movie but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while br br what's strange is that this is an amateur german video and the version i saw is english dubbed the <UNK> seem to be american fans <UNK> of the germans who can't decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy one character a white german of course is dubbed by a black guy apparently who speaks with thick <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is the kind of film that everyone involved with should be embarrassed over poor directing over the top acting and a plot that <UNK> on with no point other than to show violence i thought when i first saw it that it would be perhaps a satire of the media and how it shows violence but it's not i'm not sure what makes the film worse oliver stone does his worst directing ever from scenes where woody <UNK> face <UNK> for no reason or robert downey <UNK> dreadful performance as wayne <UNK> who is a reporter who seems totally <UNK> this movie is simply a mess
<START> this was one of the <UNK> movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting mainly from the supporting characters the interview with hugh laurie on the dvd was actually more rewarding than the film itself br br hugh laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the <UNK> but the scope of his character only required that he <UNK> himself at the kiddie end of the pool the movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment br br if you have never seen <UNK> or the inside of a british bank this film is for you 2 out of 10
<START> it must have been excruciating to attend the <UNK> as the shooting continued on this failure of a film probably cruise the <UNK> <UNK> saw what was happening and had <UNK> use much much more of the nude footage in the final cut then <UNK> wanted to to make up for the disaster he saw <UNK> maybe cruise even thought of titanic a few items colin farrell can't act his way out of a paper bag but he's one of the <UNK> of the decade a <UNK> darling and one is forced to avoid the embarrassment of watching him by not attending his films he has so many moments of not believing in what he's doing and you can see it in his eyes i think he would have been at his best as a film actor albeit not as rich or famous as he is now playing second banana to dynamic leads who can act the trap of spending a lot of money for period sets costumes cars et al and <UNK> them as if they just came from the dry <UNK> or car wash wax no one seems to want anything to look well worn or dirty is this because the production designer was told by the line producer to make sure they didn't ruin the stuff because then the company <UNK> to pay for the ruined items br br this was a story about the depression thirties folks not a disney broadway musical about that era how about doing it in black and white or better yet given <UNK> <UNK> as your d p have him <UNK> the colors during the mix to suggest some of the actual <UNK> and <UNK> of the times it should have been after all a bit depressing to live so desperately as these folks did in the depression more on farrell did anyone for a moment believe this guy was a writer h l <UNK> on the wall did i see his eyes roll at one point <UNK> and farrell as a sexually dynamic duo sending a boy to do a man's work perhaps in the book which i haven't read the story was about an older woman and a youth i cannot delve too deeply into the middle to latter parts of the film because i <UNK> out early on but the memory of the scenes i did see made me think that someone was doing a not too amusing parody of a noir movie sort of what saturday night live has been like for the past decade not funny in my mind i kept thinking of a guy noir sketch music and all
<START> a meteor <UNK> <UNK> lake hence our title awakening a <UNK> who <UNK> to <UNK> on the <UNK> population in california that <UNK> capital of the world br br there's bad movies and then there's the <UNK> lake monster which somehow managed to escape mst3k featuring grating acting a decent stop motion beast and more this is a dreadful piece of 1970's low budget exploitation monster movie dreck br br while the movie is guilty of many crimes the biggest one is arnie and mitch two obnoxious <UNK> who serve as our comic relief they <UNK> around fight to stock <UNK> music <UNK> women and act like pathetic excuses of humanity the characters are so bad they should count as a crime against humanity
<START> this week i just thought it would be fun to catch up with corey <UNK> with just having seen the two lost boys films last week and all not that i'm a fan boy not by far but i did like those two <UNK> in some films back in my early teen days br br so i prepared myself for three films starring him unfortunately i picked dream machine as a first never seen it before and it was so <UNK> horrible i just decided to lock corey back in my closet and let him sober up again first before i pop in something else of his but i managed to struggle my way through this film first i had the impression it desperately wanted to play in the same league as <UNK> <UNK> day off 1986 but got caught up in its own <UNK> practically the whole film it wants to be a comedy and near the end it hopelessly tries to be a thriller the only good thing about dream machine is the premise a dead body in the <UNK> of a <UNK> all the rest fails so badly it's embarrassing even the most for <UNK> i can dig him being his young enthusiastic self but at least when he comes with some form of directorial <UNK> this clearly wasn't the case in dream machine so we have a perfect car yes that black <UNK> <UNK> perfect girlfriend just a blonde chick who hardly has any lines in the film the perfect murder almost some dude that falls flat on his ass as the villain of the film trying the whole movie to steal the body back out of the <UNK> never really succeeds and then at the end of the film thinks he's michael myers minus the white william shatner mask and mistakes corey <UNK> for jamie lee curtis don't think they could have made this flick any <UNK> if they tried a stupid unfunny film with a story that leads to nowhere directed by a director that doesn't know how to direct his cast great accomplishment br br one last question for mr <UNK> who's idea was it to have you smile directly into the camera in that last shot of the movie yours or the director's so not done
<START> i am stunned at the negative comments that i have read and can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest this is the most moving and real portrayal of joseph smith that i have ever seen it was well acted to the point that at times i forgot that i was watching a movie it brought <UNK> life of <UNK> good natured optimism enduring faith in people and god and ultimate sacrifice to life such in a way that frankly left me speechless and silent in awe if anyone of any christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive way i would have to say it is a reflection of the individual and not the movie i give the movie a 10 and encourage honest souls to view it at the very least it is an extremely heart felt portrayal of man who gave everything he had for what he believed in a world where values and beliefs are <UNK> this movie stands as a enduring reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be no matter what religious beliefs we hold ann <UNK>
<START> i really love this movie i remember one time when i was in 2nd grade my teacher showed it to us on a <UNK> film reel this movie however can be a little frightening for 2nd <UNK> such as the scene where bill murders nancy and seeing <UNK> face for the first time on the screen one of my relatives is sick of seeing this movie because she studied over it in music class if i were a teacher and could grade the people who produced this wonderful film i would give them an a
<START> this is one great movie i have played all the nancy drew games and have read the books and i never expected the movie to be so exciting and funny if you never heard of nancy drew read the first book secret of the old clock so you can <UNK> get used to nancy then you can watch the movie because in the movie they don't really introduce the characters' names fast my whole family enjoyed it and the plot was extremely interesting this is an ultimate come back from the previous nancy drew movies which the nancy drew actor didn't seem to match this movie is much like alex rider <UNK> it's so cool nancy drew lovers you must watch this
<START> john <UNK> deliverance concerns four suburban <UNK> <UNK> who take a ride down the swift waters of the <UNK> the river is about to disappear for a <UNK> construction and the <UNK> of the last <UNK> stretches of <UNK> br br the four friends emphasize different characters a <UNK> sports <UNK> who has never been <UNK> in his life since there is no specific risk in it burt reynolds a passionate family man and a guitar player <UNK> cox an overweight bachelor insurance salesman ned beatty and a quiet thoughtful married man with a son who loves to smoke his <UNK> jon voight br br what follows is the men's nightmarish <UNK> against the hostile violence of <UNK> is also an ideal code of moral principle about <UNK> men falling prey to the dark laws of the <UNK> br br superbly shot this thrilling adult adventure certainly contains some genuinely gripping <UNK>
<START> not to be confused with the <UNK> <UNK> high school film of the same name this is a <UNK> look at hong <UNK> <UNK> gangs called election because a new leader or <UNK> is elected by ancient traditions every two years two candidates are up for the position and through ego <UNK> and past track record the race is tense to say the least expertly directed to introduce you to an <UNK> cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory the asian godfather this is not but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and <UNK> at the violence subtitled volume 1 i think its safe to say there will other <UNK> as we go deeper into the murky world of the <UNK> and all their <UNK> and <UNK> business deals either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right
<START> after the <UNK> of the first <UNK> camp who thought that a franchise could be born <UNK> ii is superior in aspect more inspired killings and just whole lot more fun while that might not be saying much compared to the first movie <UNK> camp ii is worth the rental br br pros entertaining doesn't take itself too seriously like <UNK> i inspired killings cons crappy acting and <UNK> abound br br bottom line 5 10 br br
<START> i see a lot of folks on this site wishing <UNK> would come out on dvd well i bought it on dvd from borders no less while it is great to have this terrific show in a <UNK> dvd form i am upset by the fact that they added very few in the way of <UNK> a director commentary from shaun cassidy on the pilot episode and the episodes are shown in the same order they were put out on tv the missing episodes that were never shown prior to being run on sci fi channel are in the box set but are tacked on the final dvd if you buy the dvd set get the actual order they are to be viewed and you will be happier you will need to <UNK> dvd's in and out of your player to see them in order but you will be glad you did br br s
<START> rented the movie as a joke my friends and i had so much fun laughing at it that i went and found a used copy and bought it for myself now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie i give them sasquatch hunters it needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better no talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are sasquatch repeated in a <UNK> i loved the credit at the end of the movie as well thanks for the <UNK> tom whoever tom is i say thank you because without your <UNK> the movie may not have been made in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at if you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy
<START> i've watched this movie twice and i plan to see it again it is the movie that puts you in the director's place regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in israel it also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was and the horrible murder described there it is really worth watching
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a film which has made brilliant use of closed spaces it is in these dull empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> two leading characters <UNK> mastroianni and sophia loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their <UNK> lives it is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them all men would really feel sorry for sophia <UNK> character all women would surely cry their hearts out at <UNK> <UNK> existential plight disguised <UNK> are also one of the key issues of this somber poignant film most of the characters <UNK> with issues related to their own <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cannot be <UNK> as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual <UNK> mixes well with women this is a film for which italian director <UNK> <UNK> has crafted a fairly good mix of fact and fiction his idea is to show how the arrival of hitler changed <UNK> of ordinary italian folks a word about the courageous <UNK> played <UNK> by great <UNK> mastroianni he acts as a real man who does not beg for pity he happily accepts his fate and <UNK> himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life a true masterpiece of cinema
<START> perhaps not my genre but plot was horrible as was acting by nancy allen and linda <UNK> c thomas also seemed uncomfortable in role of being <UNK> here while on marijuana why did this need to be included this <UNK> plot considerably also <UNK> <UNK> would have been better had she had more respect for a relationship would does movie try to say not much
<START> i first discovered alexander <UNK> 1940 fantasy the thief of bagdad in the early 1950's on a re issue billed as the wonder show of the century both <UNK> technicolor films the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program the music of <UNK> <UNK> enhanced both films the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made as the years passed it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in true technicolor gave way to a <UNK> color process in the middle 1950's both <UNK> and samuel <UNK> <UNK> the film both <UNK> and on video but the <UNK> color <UNK> were more <UNK> in nature and muted the <UNK> of the original technicolor the laser disc release of this title also has the <UNK> look to it nice but not as it should be now comes the m g m dvd 3 <UNK> 2002 issue the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once i watched it a second time the only extras are a spanish dubbed version sub titles in both english spanish and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer thank you m g m for this exceptional dvd release now one can only hope that <UNK> four <UNK> and a restored version of <UNK> jungle book to replace to poor public <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> will soon follow on dvd
<START> well this is probably one of the best movies i've seen and i love it so much that i've <UNK> most of the script especially the scene in the <UNK> unit when jerry lee breaks wind and even with the script in my head i still like to watch it for jerry lee that german shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who's smarter the tag line holds true as well not to mention the acting is great though christine <UNK> sounds different in a <UNK> check filmography under <UNK> if you don't know what i mean it's too bad that this movie only contained the single issue <UNK> and jerry lee had to work with it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that <UNK> and welles had up their <UNK>
<START> this is one of the <UNK> movies i have ever had the misfortune to watch i should have expected it after seeing the first two but i keep getting <UNK> into these types of movies with the idea of maybe they did it right this time nope not even close br br where do i begin how about with the special effects to give you an idea of what passes for <UNK> in this movie at one point a soldier is shooting at a <UNK> as it runs down a <UNK> even with less than a second of screen time the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around bad bad bad bad br br how about the acting if that's what you can call it there is one character who i suppose is supposed to be from the south however after living in the south for six years now i have never heard this way of talking perhaps he has some sort of weird <UNK> the inability to talk normally i find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one br br how about the plot it's pretty basic <UNK> escape people with guns must hunt them down i'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of <UNK> wouldn't they stay outside to hunt prey oh well at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them br br other things let's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating <UNK> running around in it would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better army or marine and then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it how about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the <UNK> split up into groups of two didn't they ever watch any horror movies or at least an episode of scooby doo in short this is one of the dumber movies out there miss it unless you want to <UNK> your way through a movie
<START> with this cast and budget you will expect more br br john cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange yet still work neither he his sister nor sir ben could do anything to save this travesty of trite poorly written garbage br br the movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that the plot goes nowhere the writing is contrived senseless and the characters paper thin if you think of a movie as being three dimensional where the story and characters bring a depth to the imagery this stinker comes across as flat as <UNK> mickey br br dan <UNK> appearance in this brought back memories of another truly awful movie <UNK> nothing but trouble frankly this movie is the type of project that kills careers and gets agents fired
<START> <UNK> <UNK> a big mistake to see you could know director <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and should expect something amusing from him but i guess i have to <UNK> you he made a really really bad movie br br according to the story christopher <UNK> dies to <UNK> as a baby the baby grows up robert downey jr and jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter mary stuart masterson complicated huh br br they fall in love with each other then appears jr former wife <UNK> shepherd and jr falls in love with her too i guess i don't even have to mention that she loves ryan <UNK> br br in one of his first roles robert downey <UNK> on his worst he copies michael j fox br br after the <UNK> shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies br br anyway there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used as <UNK> to insomnia
<START> kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was <UNK> arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed <UNK> town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that <UNK> you <UNK> nonsense what was with the <UNK> relationship out of nowhere after all the <UNK> encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass it's like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa
<START> the performance by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and the whole chemistry comes off nicely along with the <UNK> approach to story telling and direction by <UNK> <UNK> the dialogues by <UNK> <UNK> is also great br br i have not seen another movie like this it is one whole each piece so nicely fit in the plot you cannot not be impressed by this movie br br <UNK> <UNK> comes off as the <UNK> husband and <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain the first meeting of <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> place is <UNK> stunning <UNK> <UNK> does not play a main role but her part is also not distracting from the main plot br br and to add to this all <UNK> <UNK> plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its <UNK> saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble he is also the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and helps him whenever he gets into trouble br br the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of <UNK> in police custody <UNK> <UNK> captures <UNK> and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in <UNK> <UNK> br br a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema
<START> this movie is about a female rape victim comic book writer from new york that decides to get away from all that awful big city <UNK> and move to a dirty run down small town where she finds <UNK> in a single wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of <UNK> and nowhere the <UNK> are mentally ill yet so is she for <UNK> crazy men into her trailer annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous <UNK> after dangerous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> performance was high school at best he's one of those kinda cute young actors with a sweet grin unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature has been right in <UNK> to the previous <UNK> stating that the acting was so real well i agree actually it wasn't acting the two main characters really are pathetic weak and incapable of making mature healthy decisions in brief this movie sucks like no other rent it to laugh at it the real crime scene the atrocious wood <UNK> in the trailer enough to make me commit murder and lastly she's a artist writer so couldn't she afford a double wide trailer and something other than a sun yellow chevy <UNK> for love of god
<START> i wasn't aware of steve mcqueen in 1958 i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film i'd been <UNK> by the movie <UNK> at age seven but i was ten now the 1st scene where the blob <UNK> up the <UNK> <UNK> stick and <UNK> his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater but i stayed and suffered through each of our <UNK> attacks i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor's office poor doc and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and <UNK> a large portion of the audience so many in fact that it <UNK> out of the front doors too huge now to fit through just one it seemed <UNK> and <UNK> in growth potential and when it trapped poor steve in a <UNK> like diner he seemed like a sure dinner to be br br to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description but in the end better icy than <UNK> and mentally <UNK> little kids br br i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick trying to act brave he knew i was in trouble and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room but when i <UNK> up the courage to look down at the floor there the red <UNK> heart like hungry dude sat waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom it took months to recover br br i'm <UNK> years old now i've made it br br of course the blob wasn't destroyed
<START> the movie was very moving it was tender and funny at the same time the scenery was absolutely beautiful peter <UNK> and paul reiser gave award winning performances olympia dukakis was great i understand due to the story line her part had to be brief but i did wish i could have seen more of her she is a true pro you will be able to recall experiences from your own life hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie we were fortunate to see paul reiser at a q and a after the viewing he is a wonderful man clever <UNK> and a real person it was truly an enjoyable night out this is a must see movie you will be so grateful you went
<START> if you're amused by straight faced goings on that are logical within a given illogical situation you'll enjoy this whimsical 8 minute spanish film br br a woman enters a small <UNK> the scene looks ordinary but the <UNK> customers and two musicians seem somehow oddly subdued br br suddenly the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song dancing across table tops with musical comedy gestures the customers at first <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> in badly but <UNK> with phrases from the song read from slips of paper in their <UNK> on and off they jump up and dance <UNK> but <UNK> in choreographed motions like <UNK> singers br br but why the woman wonders the answer is revealed as the <UNK> jacket opens and she sees what's <UNK> across his chest just before the explosive climax br br even if you don't catch the <UNK> probably <UNK> lyrics the situation perfect performances should give you a grin and a chuckle i'd love to see it again
<START> the effects of job related stress and the <UNK> born of a moral dilemma that <UNK> conscience against the <UNK> of a family business albeit a unique one all brought to a head by or perhaps the <UNK> of a <UNK> crisis are examined in the dark and absorbing drama panic ' written and directed by henry <UNK> and starring william h macy and donald sutherland it's a telling look at how <UNK> and denial can bring about the internal <UNK> and misery that ultimately leads to <UNK> and that moment of truth when the conflict must of necessity at last be resolved br br alex macy is tired he has a loving wife martha <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> six year old son sammy david <UNK> a mail order business he runs out of the house as well as his main source of <UNK> the <UNK> business he shares with his father michael sutherland and his mother <UNK> barbara <UNK> but he's empty years of <UNK> this particular trade have left him <UNK> and detached putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist dr josh parks john ritter and to make matters worse or maybe better depending upon perspective in dr <UNK> waiting room he meets a young woman sarah cassidy <UNK> campbell whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember she quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her his whole life it seems has become a <UNK> one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully <UNK> himself without hurting the ones he loves he can deny his age and the fact that he has indeed slipped into a genuine <UNK> crisis but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own he's at a <UNK> and he's going to have to decide which way to go and he's going to have to do it very soon br br from a concept that is <UNK> interesting <UNK> has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and <UNK> and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that <UNK> the audience to empathize and understand what alex is going through he makes it very clear that there are no simple answers that in real life there is no easy way out his characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and moreover within any given family unit the film <UNK> implies that the sins of the father are <UNK> passed on to the <UNK> with <UNK> consequences and effects when you're growing up you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large and often it is years into <UNK> that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral <UNK> established by every individual who walks upon the planet and that the ones set by the father may not be <UNK> to the <UNK> of the son and it is at that point that alex finds himself as the story unfolds <UNK> the <UNK> crisis or more specifically the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape it's a powerful message <UNK> and subtly conveyed by <UNK> with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors br br for some time william h macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business creating such diverse characters as <UNK> kid <UNK> smith in <UNK> ' the <UNK> in mystery <UNK> and jerry <UNK> in <UNK> ' and that's just a <UNK> of his many achievements at one point in this film sarah mentions <UNK> sad eyes ' and it's a very telling comment as <UNK> lies the strength of <UNK> performance here his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed staring off into the darkness in that one restless moment it is clear that he is <UNK> not only with his immediate situation but with everything in his life that has brought him finally to this point in that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt confusion and <UNK> all of which have been successfully <UNK> until now all the things that have always been at the core of <UNK> life only now gradually breaking through his defense <UNK> and finally <UNK> demanding confrontation and resolution it's a complex character created and delivered by macy with an absolute <UNK> that makes alex truly memorable it's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly <UNK> odds will be able to relate it's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around br br sutherland is extremely effective as well his michael is <UNK> sinister in a way that is so real it's chilling it's frightening in fact to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth this is not some pulp fiction or james bond type villain but a true <UNK> of evil hiding behind an <UNK> appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door which is what makes it all the more <UNK> and sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly with a great performance br br <UNK> campbell looks the part of sarah but her performance as is the usual case with her seems somewhat pretentious although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film if only she would occasionally turn her <UNK> <UNK> it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters panic ' however is one of her best efforts a powerful film that in the end is a journey well worth taking 9 10 br br
<START> not on the same level as ring or ring 2 but still a good japanese horror flick nonetheless i wish north american horror producers would take a page out of the japanese horror <UNK> and put more <UNK> and less cheap shocks in their flicks lots of good examples in this one scenes where a <UNK> out face is scene staring behind a young actress photographs on a wall are suddenly <UNK> smiling just for a second and more worth checking out if you like the genre
<START> this is quite possibly the most retarded 80's slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features non stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with <UNK> bodies doing <UNK> <UNK> taking <UNK> and wandering about in tight gym outfits prior to being a horror film <UNK> is a 90 minutes <UNK> video to encourage the use of <UNK> <UNK> and other body stimulating <UNK> products if you'd leave out all the footage of hunky boys <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> girls <UNK> their <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> 80's tunes there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left plenty of time to <UNK> a plot about a <UNK> killer <UNK> young health freaks with a big safety pin <UNK> the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun bathing device several years later people turn up dead in the same <UNK> you don't really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there's a link between the murders and the burning incident now do you investigating the case are a seemingly <UNK> police officer and charles <UNK> look alike and a <UNK> private detective who gets lucky with the <UNK> 80's beauty i've ever seen looking through the credits her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> apparently and she didn't do anything else apart from this turkey and an <UNK> troma movie called surf nazis must die what a wasted opportunity she may not have been a great actress but she sure had two other big <UNK> that would help her move <UNK> in show business the amount of gore and the quality of the make up effects are nothing special neither we're treated to a couple of bizarre <UNK> with a pin and some <UNK> human flesh the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore anyway <UNK> a k a killer <UNK> is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night but nevertheless feel like watching a film it actually would make a terrific double feature with death <UNK> both films have a lot of sexy and <UNK> dressed babes  and both films are pretty dumb
<START> it does seem like this film is <UNK> us you either love it or hate it i loved it br br i agree with the comment s that said you just gotta feel this one br br also early in the film tom cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by <UNK> an <UNK> painter <UNK> style is to paint in little <UNK> so up close the painting looks like a mess but from a distance you can tell what the subject is cruise mentions that the painting has a vanilla sky i believe this is a hint to the <UNK> this movie is like that <UNK> painting it's <UNK> filmmaking and it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting br br this is not your typical linear plot it requires more thought there is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no you're not always going to be sure what's going on but at the end all is explained br br you will need to concentrate on this movie but i think people are making the mistake of <UNK> way too hard on it after it ends is when you should think about it if you try to figure it out as it's unfolding you will <UNK> yourself just let it happen go with it keep an open mind remember what you see and save the analysis for later br br i found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique wildly creative and <UNK> br br but i will not <UNK> the intelligence of those of you who didn't enjoy it it appeals to a certain taste if you like existential psychedelic philosophical thought provoking challenging spiritual movies then see it if you prefer something a little lighter then skip it br br but if you do like what i described then you will surely enjoy it
<START> not only does the film's author steven <UNK> obviously <UNK> michael moore but he also follows in his footsteps by using several of moore's propaganda film making tactics moore has expertise in distracting the viewer from this focus though while <UNK> is obviously less skilled here br br having been <UNK> to all of the issues surrounding moore's speech at <UNK> i was disappointed to see that the major complaints of the community that moore was being paid 40 000 of the state of <UNK> 's educational <UNK> to basically promote john <UNK> campaign and to <UNK> his own liberal movie were pushed to the background by <UNK> while lesser issues were <UNK> br br the marketing methods for this video have been equally biased and <UNK> promoting the film by claiming that <UNK> tried to kill moore not only is this preposterous but it <UNK> a major religion that <UNK> obviously has some personal issues with i followed moore's visit very closely and all of the major news <UNK> noted that moore's visit came and went without any credible security problems or incidents in <UNK> br br <UNK> has <UNK> on this film to jump start his film making career to the point that he has even dropped out of film school to help <UNK> this this seems to have been a severe <UNK> though since moore's visits to roughly 60 other <UNK> and <UNK> across the country in 2004 <UNK> interest for this rather common event <UNK> <UNK> that american audiences would be interested in this film due to the promoted religious and conservative angles doesn't seem to be well <UNK> br br even the name of the film this divided state is somewhat of a <UNK> since <UNK> voted <UNK> for <UNK> re election and thus appears to be more politically <UNK> than any other state the division in the movie title seems more <UNK> of the <UNK> that exists in <UNK> <UNK> differences with his religion and state if anything i find a humorous <UNK> between the religious angle of this supposed documentary and woody allen's hilarious <UNK> in sleeper 1973 that i was beaten up by <UNK>
<START> there is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning and there is also emotion in the inner <UNK> of <UNK> family dealing w his mother's problems and how that comes to bear on their relationship but the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered unless i'm just too dumb to pick up on them why is mathieu in a mental hospital what led to the <UNK> break up and the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first it seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some <UNK> <UNK> thrills or some male nudity but as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying
<START> needless remake and it can't come close to capturing the charm of the original the extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts this version is ridiculously politically correct the film lacks style and mostly it lacks talent not just with the acting but the direction sets costumes etc are all below par it has a blatant disregard for period detail vanessa williams is the only cast member that shows any flair <UNK> <UNK> isn't too bad they should have left well enough alone the singing <UNK> good vanessa williams to poor everyone else watch the original 1963 version and skip this one there is not much here to recommend
<START> like i said at the top four stars just aren't enough it's one of the best films i've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life for the people that don't really like it or understand it you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention span br br even if i haven't seen all his films yet i'd have to say that this is spielberg at his peak it's pretty sad to see that movies as great as the color purple don't come along too often 'cause i think all of us are in desperate need of first class motion picture entertainment in these hard times br br movies like this are more than just movies they're pieces of art that need to be appreciated more br br the idea that it was nominated for 11 oscars even best picture of the year and didn't get one <UNK> is a sign of how blind and stupid hollywood can be sometimes spielberg wasn't even nominated for best director it should have swept the oscars that year br br the film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some people br br if only movies were still this good
<START> so it's really sexist and <UNK> and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change well he certainly changed his tune and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as <UNK> mothers the end of the movie does not make her a hero it makes the whole thing sad and its sad that people think it makes her a hero perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away positive reception reflects <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the social conscience <UNK>
<START> for muslim women in western africa married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard the community may not <UNK> <UNK> such behaviour but equally they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal an attitude which of course <UNK> it to continue fortunately the letter of the <UNK> law promises <UNK> to all and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female <UNK> in the <UNK> legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children what is notable apart from the uplifting central story is how in spite of their <UNK> the <UNK> are actually <UNK> <UNK> if a case is actually bought the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole <UNK> life style which aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases seems amazingly emotional and <UNK> compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america and while i <UNK> that this comment may <UNK> <UNK> on my part this attitude appears to be captured in delightful <UNK> english they speak overall this is a terrific little film and much more fun to watch than you might imagine
<START> i would highly recommend this movie and i certainly shall be personally <UNK> it to my friends and family here and abroad it was with excited anticipation that i have just pre ordered it online i enjoyed it so much it is not out until <UNK> march 2008 but it will be well worth the wait but first go and see it in the cinema if you can there is nothing quite like the cinema experience of a cinema made movie insist that your local cinema puts it on i went to see <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> tonight down here in london and was really impressed it is a marvel a truly beautiful film set in the scottish <UNK> you will laugh you will cry you will be moved in may different ways you will be intrigued and as the story within the stories is revealed you will be amazed at that revelation br br this movie is in scottish <UNK> with english subtitles but do not let that detract you if you are not a <UNK> of the <UNK> i am just starting and my son does not nor did many people there tonight and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means <UNK> do not suffice the photography is superb there is no cgi here and the movie is all the better for that here you have true photography the script is so <UNK> and subtly written the many layered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient <UNK> the music is at times rousing at times haunting but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance and the acting it is to behold and the actors they the true <UNK> of this delightful yet profound film particularly the two main actors <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> a true <UNK> if ever there was who both carried a very heavy load and the direction well watch out richard and the producer responsible for raising funding hiring key <UNK> and <UNK> for <UNK> a task well done i hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our <UNK> abroad and the <UNK> community <UNK> without you it could not have happened we were told that this movie was made on a low budget but you would not know it and i think it might well be because for what they might have lacked in money they more than made up for with the <UNK> of the heart and the warmth and co operation of the local scottish <UNK> community br br a heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making and the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> many thanks from the <UNK> to the world from the world to the <UNK>
<START> well i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or <UNK> in it the entire film felt like it was just the <UNK> with no main course the story line was <UNK> and laughable the characters were one dimensional the realism was out the window and the animation was done by four year olds does that cover it i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation br br to begin the story moved too quickly for someone new to this character and situations i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution i have seen other anime if you could call this one an anime that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them there was nothing set aside for lady death in a few short scenes we see her train with <UNK> and instantly become this aggressive she beast of hell this was hard for me to swallow considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father suddenly she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years this was absurd the presentation of lady death was poor to say the least i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind for me it just didn't work she was nothing more than eye candy for <UNK> boys wanting to <UNK> the mass <UNK> of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with <UNK> oh i felt sick just watching her the same goes for the character of <UNK> who was this random person the explanation they gave wasn't enough and instead i was left with more incoherent <UNK> than actual development it is a very sad day in hell when we <UNK> characters to show more violence and action especially in an animated feature br br next there was <UNK> himself let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive he was weak his voice was laughable and he just didn't represent the image that i had in my mind it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semi pc he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that <UNK> <UNK> he was not the <UNK> of hell but instead just a <UNK> that had a bigger place to live speaking of living or dying how can you die again in hell that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation most of the characters were worrying about dying when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead that is how they got to hell i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me i didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell but that could just be me  or maybe it was because there was no development in this story there was nothing built just preparing br br the battle sequences were hysterically bad the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn why are we america so behind on animation it is huge in asia and it is <UNK> in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination we are cheap and this film shows it br br overall this film was bad the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card the production was horrendous as well as the story nothing was developed leaving huge <UNK> plot holes that nearly everyone fell into the strength of the characters was missing and nothing was explained i wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when death does come you don't find yourself in my state and <UNK> the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbage br br blah br br grade out of
<START> trick or treat is a fine example of hollywood jumping on the backwards messages in metal music <UNK> that <UNK> gore and her washington wives kick started in the mid '80s other less successful entries in this mini genre include the awful black <UNK> and silly the gate i was a <UNK> in high school when trick or treat came out and couldn't wait to see it it seemed to disappear from video stores by the end of the '80s but i finally picked up a budget <UNK> dvd copy a short while ago and it brought back many pleasant metal memories from back in the day any teenage metal nerd could relate to the trials of eddie <UNK> <UNK> marc price of family ties in this film as he is <UNK> by the <UNK> beautiful people in his high school for his heavy metal fashions and musical taste <UNK> favorite rock star is sammi <UNK> who looks a lot like tommy lee of <UNK> <UNK> who is killed in a hotel fire early in the movie eddie is <UNK> till he receives a test <UNK> of <UNK> final <UNK> album from a radio dj gene simmons of kiss in a brief cameo eddie soon discovers that this <UNK> when played backwards allows him to communicate with the undead spirit of sammi <UNK> himself soon sammi is giving eddie advice on how to get even with his <UNK> <UNK> but when the messages <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> all no false metal eddie tries to destroy the album which results in sammi coming back to life via <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sammi <UNK> to the big dance at <UNK> high school and takes the stage to rock the crowd and <UNK> a few unlucky false <UNK> before eddie arrives to save the day and the girl of his dreams sigh no it's not terribly scary in 2006 it wasn't even scary in 1986 but trick or treat is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any 1980s <UNK> and has a kick ass soundtrack courtesy of the cult band <UNK> well worth seeking out if you've ever <UNK> your head or have a taste for b grade horror movies or both like me
<START> the very first image of the movie shows a mountain <UNK> in early morning <UNK> <UNK> and my thought was this is almost too beautiful and it goes on like this images of landscape and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings each of them perfect in every detail even the girl's room her father's car everything is nostalgic romantic beautiful this could seem outdated and <UNK> but it fits a story that is itself of silent beauty happening on the border between life and fairy tale between <UNK> <UNK> and le <UNK> prince i enjoyed every minute of it the extreme <UNK> of the movie having a simple slow story just one actor and hardly any special effects <UNK> a strong magic i therefore find it <UNK> that this <UNK> is given up in the last minutes when suddenly two additional actors the girl as a grown up woman and her son are introduced another <UNK> is the music which is often <UNK> hollywood like and sometimes inappropriate i couldn't bring an english pop song together with french mountain glory i went to the movie together with my two small daughters but i recommend it to adults as well given that they appreciate this kind of movie obviously not everybody does
<START> this movie will kick your ass powerful acting in a story that pushes all of us to live out our dreams jake <UNK> will go places from here and the supporting cast was superb why would would anyone want to stay in <UNK> and develop black lung anyway
<START> i watched this on a <UNK> because it was available and i'd heard the thumb movies were funny this one was not the majority of the jokes were based around <UNK> <UNK> and in turn kate <UNK> i think it's really pathetic of the the <UNK> creators to <UNK> so low to make <UNK> at a respected actress just because she heaven <UNK> doesn't <UNK> herself into the model of ideal modern beauty br br my favorite part was the line that goes something like hey i have a great idea let's swim over to this <UNK> raft that no one else seems to see thirty seconds of amusement out of a 26 minute movie does not redeem its value
<START> very funny film classic film funny eddie murphy of the 80s i saw when i was a child and i have a good memory the classic irony of murphy does not fail the film is funny well done murphy in <UNK> made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous the result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from 1986 up to now have changed the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period a nice movie to see and enjoy <UNK> the taste of ironic murphy an actor who has recently disappeared the final part is <UNK> the likable actor who plays the part of the <UNK> monk that's it
<START> busy phillips put in one hell of a performance both comedic and dramatic erika christensen was good but busy stole the show it was a nice touch after the <UNK> a movie starring busy which <UNK> all that great if busy <UNK> get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster forget <UNK> lisa smile see home room
<START> nick <UNK> aka nick phillips should have left well enough alone when he made criminally insane 10 years before the release of this god awful waste of time and effort the fact that the original criminally insane was less than an hour in length should have <UNK> him into the fact that he had probably <UNK> this storyline for all he was going to get out of it but instead he <UNK> to use tons of footage from the original in this one as well even to the point of <UNK> the original opening credit sequence unfortunately bringing back the rapidly aging <UNK> <UNK> did not save this one what little bit of original footage there was in this flick looks as if it were filmed with a rented hand held camcorder if this film cost more than 100 to make i would be very surprised and i would be equally surprised if it made anything close to that amount avoid this one and watch the original instead
<START> i do miss the company <UNK> they sure had their finger on the pulse of unique and unusual cinema back in the 1980s this is very apparent with the astonishing paperhouse a film that touches me deeply each and every time i watch it br br the idea of a girl <UNK> a dream world with her drawings <UNK> the dream world <UNK> reality and also connecting with and affecting the life of a boy she's never actually met is fascinating and never disappoints charlotte burke at first seems quite <UNK> and yet you warm up to her because by being a bit of a mischievous child it makes it hard for the adults to believe what she is experiencing she becomes very self aware and strong towards the end even finding she doesn't hate boys as she so <UNK> claimed at first through this we are treated to many touching moments and some immensely scary ones all visually stunning with a grand score from hans <UNK> i'm quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on cd when it was released in the united states on <UNK> victor at the time of this writing there is no dvd of paperhouse yet available in the u s only in europe here's hoping one of my wishes will come true as i truly <UNK> this beautiful film and a dvd of it would be very welcome br br it's satisfying watching the girl work out her thoughts like a puzzle game trying to make the dream world work for her and her <UNK> friend marc elliot <UNK> both charlotte burke and elliot <UNK> do a magnificent job throughout i find the <UNK> comment on amazon com about it being hammy acting quite <UNK> i found every aspect of paperhouse to be <UNK> even in minor scenes of brilliance like when charlotte and the girl in the <UNK> are staring at each other through the glass on a door it's quite powerful br br you don't have to be an <UNK> type to enjoy paperhouse just be a person that enjoys a film that <UNK> and has you wanting more there is enough in this film to invite repeated viewings and i'm still in awe of the cinematography and sets for me it's never like watching the same film twice as there are so many details to <UNK> and <UNK> a very emotional experience indeed br br while there are many films i adore there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional <UNK> in me films like paperhouse static <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> when i see so much <UNK> out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain <UNK> all i have to do is watch paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is <UNK>
<START> i personally found this movie to be terrible first it was hardly objective and provided one side of the debate the only people who were presented as the side saying he did exist being a bunch of people coming from a billy <UNK> revival secondly it <UNK> heavily from its supposed topic did jesus <UNK> exist to talking about how violent christianity is and showing scenes from mel <UNK> the passion in the end it has the director con his former principal of a conservative private school into being interviewed and attempts to trap him about teaching the kids there faith oh and also the <UNK> music just made the film harder to watch
<START> i didn't think the french could make a bad movie but i was clearly very wrong as has been said before this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real artemisia <UNK> br br the script is awful pretentious stilted and vapid and its <UNK> of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by <UNK> rather than retelling history along with some fairly decent set design <UNK> <UNK> physical charms are the primary asset of this movie and it's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too they waste no time in <UNK> various erotic sequences which have far more to do with <UNK> than with plot or character development unfortunately the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of <UNK> sexual <UNK> cannot and does not sustain this movie the acting is <UNK> and the score is all too generic despite an interesting <UNK> or two the cinematography is ok and there are some pretty colors but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s <UNK> movie than a costume drama in any event the script leaves the camera <UNK> all too often on <UNK> body and all too seldom on her paintings br br all told a near complete failure it's not intelligent or <UNK> enough to be a serious film and it's too slow and pretentious to work as soft core pornography so the french can fail after all
<START> i had no problem with the film which i thought was pretty good it's the actual <UNK> crime scene video that disturbed me i wonder if <UNK> gate really thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place sorry <UNK> gate this was an incredibly bad idea br br getting back to the film the cast was excellent especially val kilmer as the late john holmes john holmes was a sleaze <UNK> the women in his life lisa <UNK> as his wife kate <UNK> as his girlfriend and he is hopelessly deep into drugs his connection to eddie <UNK> eric <UNK> creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous wonderland murders exactly how much was holmes involved in the murders we may never know the entire truth to the story <UNK> is still alive and a free man but the film does a pretty good job nonetheless
<START> the 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people social <UNK> and <UNK> were <UNK> as people spoke out about their views racial tensions politics the vietnam war sexual <UNK> and drug use were all part of the daily fabric and the daily news this film attempted to <UNK> these historical aspects into an entertaining movie and largely succeeded br br in this film two families are followed one white one black during the first half of the film the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles unfortunately the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family admittedly there are more characters in this family and the story lines are <UNK> but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century br br on the whole the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie the movie is a work of fiction but clips of well known historical figures are used to set the time line br br i enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one sided
<START> well let me start off by saying how utterly hilarious this film is i simply couldn't keep myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity of it don't get me wrong it is well acted particularly by <UNK> but the script is just well the mind <UNK> truly br br the premise is good and up until della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her <UNK> and of course instead of <UNK> it at the guy's head she decides to pull out a <UNK> car jack and finally a <UNK> as in for a sinking ship respectively to kill her victims br br then there is the final line that i promise if it doesn't have you in <UNK> then i will eat my own left foot br br i would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned appalling film making might i also suggest you watch out for the scene in the <UNK> yard with the guy falling from the one foot high <UNK> of wood gets me every time
<START> the film looks like as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorists it should actually be called <UNK> crap br br there is nothing good about this movie even the actors are not worth a penny don't waste your time watching this movie the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie i mean isn't he ashamed of looking at peoples faces after they have seen his movie the <UNK> looks as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut and <UNK> stuff and its the same old story man plays god creates some creature it escapes and is happy eating people and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a <UNK> shirt has to come and kill it <UNK> <UNK> u will figure out the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie
<START> wow what a wonderful film the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by <UNK> <UNK> i hope he has more stories in him br br the acting is sublime <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> was amazing very natural talent and <UNK> <UNK> was a delight very believable as the jaded old <UNK> br br the soundtrack was very effective <UNK> without being overwhelming br br if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect gem
<START> i still liked it though warren beatty is only fair as the comic book hero what saves this movie is the set the incredible cast and it <UNK> a mediocre script i really expected something more substantial in the terms of action or plot but i got very little the main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in hollywood at the time in such an unusual film br br the one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was madonna she did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad the movie at some points just stood still you expected something more and you got nothing al pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good he and beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy br br it is also interesting to see dustin hoffman and warren beatty in a film other than <UNK> i did not see <UNK> but i heard bad things the thing about this movie is it is good but it could have been so much better i liked it as a child because i thought it looked cool and visually the movie is amazing the sets are incredible the writing is only fair and with such a cast in the movie i would expect a little better anyway br br spoiler br br i especially thought the finale was not big enough it was interesting but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere the movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway br br the costumes and makeup were flawless as well the facial makeup for the villains was great beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character still this is a good movie that could have been much much more it is to me better than batman the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross
<START> when will the hurting stop i never want to see another version of a christmas carol again they keep on making movies with the same story falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest but sadly fail to do so as this is not a good story <UNK> old fashioned conservative happy thinking as if people learn the numerous different versions of this film prove that we <UNK>
<START> the story of cinderella is one of my favorites from charles <UNK> with sleeping beauty which was also made into a disney film in 1959 this film is a sweet enchanting masterpiece from disney br br the film has a great soundtrack that's one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack and i love the songs too my favorite song is the romantic so this is love i love the mice from the film too they are cute my favorite scene is the scene after the narration the little birds tried to wake cinderella up in the morning i also love it when <UNK> animal friends the mice and birds fix up <UNK> birth mother's dress so she could go to the ball until <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it to bits the b <UNK>
<START> having not read the novel i can't tell how faithful this film is the story is typical mystery material killer targets <UNK> woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is <UNK> with a fatal disease yes it sounds like a soap opera and that's exactly how it plays the first 2 3 are dull save for the murders and the last 1 3 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its <UNK> conclusion br br acting is strictly sub par though it's hard to blame the actors alone the screenplay is atrocious during the last 1 3 you stop <UNK> because the film actually becomes interesting but that's only the last 1 3 director russell <UNK> is very much in his element but there's only so much he can do with a tv budget and the network censors on his back he's pretty much limited to quick cutting and distorted <UNK> though he managed to squeeze in a couple under the floor shots during the murders in the club <UNK> unfortunately as this is made for tv the cool <UNK> details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found note to producers give this man a reasonable budget and an <UNK> lens when you hire him br br <UNK> it up this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by tv standards watch <UNK> instead if you're in the mood for a film like this i've some excellent <UNK> pick up a copy of <UNK> <UNK> deep red my highest recommendation superb film opera or even <UNK> they're stronger in every category
<START> <UNK> is a love story there is not one romance there are at least three but they all have to do with the same family <UNK> family loretta cher is about to marry johnny <UNK> danny aiello she doesn't love him but he is sweet and good man when he leaves to visit his dying mother in italy loretta meets <UNK> brother <UNK> nicolas cage he and johnny haven't spoken each other in five years and loretta wants to invite him to the wedding of course they fall instantly for each other br br how this story and love stories of <UNK> parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself every seen is a delight to watch with cher as the bright star in the middle of everything she won and really deserved the oscar that year cage is pretty good and goofy as well and olympia dukakis as <UNK> mother and vincent <UNK> as her father are terrific this movie is funny charming and therefore highly enjoyable
<START> warning may contain spoilers my huge problem with this movie is how totally self centered and self consumed the <UNK> wife is after having a one night stand with a slimy psycho she is being stalked by him he calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together he is obviously crazy and very dangerous the problem is she only thinks he is dangerous to her and exposing her secret not for one second did she ever have one thought of concern for her husband did she even for a moment think of him possibly being in danger from this psychotic as soon as she realized how mental he was she should have warned her husband no matter what the consequences maybe there wouldn't have been a movie then but there really wasn't one anyway so what's the difference
<START> a must see for anyone who loves photography stunning and breathtaking leaves you in <UNK> seen it twice once in a cinema and now on dvd it holds up well on dvd but on the big screen this was something else br br took my two daughters to see this and they loved it my oldest cried at the end but she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it at the video shop its simple telling of a child's love for nature and in particular a fox is told well in some ways it reminded me of the bear in its telling a story not documentary <UNK> which works for children very well not being <UNK> to is very important you make your own mind up br br but the star of this film is the <UNK> how did they do what they did amazing just amazing
<START> i am a huge stooges fan but the one and only redeeming quality this movie has is that <UNK> is in it done long before he started drinking heavily he is his classic self in this and <UNK> not bad either <UNK> character is a straight part mostly and this movie would be better named the <UNK> and larry movie not that any of the stooges movies were very good in my opinion but as one <UNK> here said how sad it is that this movie had real potential the casting was good it was well directed filmed and edited but the story line tried to be about something serious with just some stooges antics and musical numbers which i guess were good back then thrown in the best thing you can do for yourself during this movie should you actually believe that it has to be better than <UNK> the lawn and taking out the trash which is subject to debate is to wait for <UNK> larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest of it
<START> this is what we can do to each other this is the sort that <UNK> should see at least once br br it does not <UNK> world it shows that it is the everyday person who is killed <UNK> and <UNK> by war the person on the other side eats sleeps laughs and cry just as we do
<START> i picked this up at the video store because of <UNK> recommendation if you don't like this go f yourself on the box seemed like a <UNK> <UNK> i was expecting something a bit more like death proof not much actual violence in this one tho or plot of character or dialogue br br look at the poster it's all there stunts and rock it goes back and forth a week or so in the life of an la band that does a crappy magic show at a level that you'd maybe see in one of the lesser <UNK> off the strip and an aussie <UNK> new in town finding his feet they work they meet girls they party end of story br br the band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second <UNK> and playing a style that was already dated in 1978 it has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely <UNK> that aussie fellow really is something and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the art i hung it there to see what crazy thing he'd do next just wish he could have found a better vehicle
<START> the devil's <UNK> is my second attempt at a joseph <UNK> production and although i will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and <UNK> swedish <UNK> it is still a little slow and un explicit for my taste br br this one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle that want to <UNK> their previously murdered leader in order to do so the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and <UNK> weird stuff and of course drink some blood too when a doctor and her brother's car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for <UNK> they provide the ideal <UNK> for the horny vampires but they may not be as helpless as they seem br br the devil's <UNK> is a pretty good example of early 70's exploit sleaze lots of nudity including some full frontal some sleazy undertones including incest and of course <UNK> <UNK> but these scenes are still pretty tame by today's standards some pretty hot women in this one would have <UNK> from some more explicit sex but i guess ya can't have it all also would have <UNK> from some <UNK> violence gore being that it is a vampire film but i think the purpose of the devil's <UNK> was more to showcase skin not blood still a little slow and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden but that's to be expected from something from this era and of this budget worth a look to exploit fans others may find it a little too dull for their liking 7 10
<START> i am one of <UNK> witnesses and i also work in an <UNK> care medical facility over the years i have seen people die from <UNK> reactions to blood <UNK> have attended numerous <UNK> on blood born <UNK> and have seen several patients become seriously ill from <UNK> induced by <UNK> blood i have also heard several <UNK> witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field i have never actually seen it happen leaving the question is it really <UNK> to refuse blood <UNK> or is the community at large <UNK> from the battle on this issue the issue for <UNK> witnesses is a moral one you must <UNK> from blood is not an ambiguous statement thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it
<START> this is a film that everyone should watch quite apart from raising hugely important points while south africa is on the road to <UNK> there are still many countries in similar situations now it is superbly directed while denzel washington gives in my opinion the best performance in his career so far kline also gives a good performance although perhaps not as stunning as <UNK> john <UNK> also puts in a good turn as the chief of police br br there are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall down but all of these have been avoided it would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys but attenborough has not done this sure there were some white characters who seemed <UNK> evil such as the captain at the <UNK> <UNK> but to add extra <UNK> to all the characters would make the film <UNK> long some people complain about the length of the film as it is but i think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story for it really is an incredible one br br the best scene in the film is that of steve <UNK> funeral when the whole crowd begins to sing the south african national <UNK> it is probably one of if not the most moving scenes i have seen br br if you haven't seen this film already watch it it may not be comfortable viewing but it's certainly worth it
<START> i've watched it plenty of times and i'm planning on buying the full feature i love all of jason <UNK> comedy it's very different and unique and is very enjoyable i love indie films and this one is just great the plot is strange but very funny this short film is about a talking <UNK> named edward the order of the events are a bit <UNK> making this film very interesting to watch at first you see edward fighting the <UNK> but then the focus changes to earlier in his life this is a silly movie but of course it's still great i highly recommend that you watch this film at www <UNK> com or www <UNK> com it's very funny the humour may not match everybody's taste but watch anyway it'll only take 16 minutes of your time and it's free go watch <UNK> madness
<START> a long <UNK> prison shut down for over 20 years is re opened and ethan <UNK> the late great character actor lane smith once a guard there is put in place as warden as the prisoners are put to work <UNK> the place up they're <UNK> to break into the old execution room this <UNK> a fierce spirit that <UNK> <UNK> havoc upon both guards and prisoners cool as can be low key prisoner burke viggo <UNK> showing real <UNK> in an early role is thrust into the role of hero br br i know it's a no <UNK> to praise the film for its atmosphere it was shot in an actual abandoned <UNK> near <UNK> <UNK> but it <UNK> this horror film to a higher level it's got a great sense of foreboding established right at the outset director <UNK> <UNK> made his fourth directorial effort here it got him the nightmare on elm street 4 directing gig and effectively began an impressive career in mainstream action movies thrillers and horror films br br it may have stock characters but it's got a capable cast bringing them to life <UNK> field as the young woman <UNK> for prison <UNK> lincoln <UNK> as weary veteran convict <UNK> tom everett as restless con <UNK> <UNK> kane as the <UNK> <UNK> tommy tiny <UNK> as soft spoken giant tiny and <UNK> dean <UNK> as captain <UNK> it's also worth noting as an early acting credit for kane <UNK> as the vengeful spirit that helped him land the gig of playing jason <UNK> in the friday the 13th series br br decent special effects moody lighting courtesy of prolific genre cinematographer mac <UNK> spooky music by richard band and christopher stone great visuals the incredibly gloomy location and an overall flashy and intense presentation help to make it quite entertaining it's nasty gruesome and good fun for a horror fan br br 8 10
<START> this film is so incredibly bad that i almost felt sick watching it up until this point the other <UNK> had at least one good thing about it part 1 was suspenseful and gory part 2 was off beat and entertaining part 3 was interesting with great effects part 4 had great music good special effects and a new entertaining freddy krueger part 5 is more boring than anything i've ever seen before alice a much <UNK> blond from part 4 is back with her boyfriend dan at parts this supposed elm street installment turns into a daytime soap the newer characters seem harsh and even that sweet alice has a chip on her shoulder freddy seems to be completely out of this one he looks tired and doesn't seem to be as gruesome his one liners seem out of place and different where as in part 4 they could be pretty funny leslie <UNK> story never gets off the ground and stephen <UNK> direction is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good the whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic it's also confusing and pretty stupid avoid part 5 at all costs
<START> obviously there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely <UNK> the production but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot i mean brutal on the level of <UNK> <UNK> and other great chinese films i first saw this when i was 14 years old i ran home and <UNK> god to forgive me for everything
<START> home room deals with a <UNK> like high school shooting but rather than <UNK> over the <UNK> itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors their trauma guilt and denial br br spoilers the shooting itself is treated as a <UNK> conclusion with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage <UNK> <UNK> after shooting the high school killer the film has three protagonists the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident played by a very young erika christensen and busy <UNK> br br the two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues br br erika christensen though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much <UNK> with her solid and reliable style of acting busy <UNK> three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence this girl was the part br br it's a great movie and it <UNK> to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls gus van <UNK> elephant 2003 though good seems almost superficial and <UNK> compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure so much more a loss for an equally traumatized america br br ten out of ten
<START> diane keaton has played a few heavy parts in her many years on the big screen but she's mostly known for the light and <UNK> stuff with woody allen such as annie hall she deserves an oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort and it doesn't really matter what the competition was the year it was first shown try and find a scene in which she doesn't appear and it was all heavy drama <UNK> in its pace and <UNK> action all at full speed the make up made her as young as possible and she fit the 30s age category even in close ups but she was playing half her age and at a very fast pace the movie overall was fairly well done staged and shot well with a strong supporting cast but keaton carried the load
<START> this film just goes around in circles and the viewer does not know where they are at first i thought <UNK> could be kinda cool movie this but it just drags on and on and eventually you don't know what's going on the lead female is a good actress and played her role well and the psycho <UNK> is creepy but after a bit you don't really care what happens because this film just drags on shame really this could have turned out a lot better br br would say though that the lead female and psycho <UNK> will have a good career ahead of them but will they remember this film for making them known or for being the film they regret they ever made
<START> i have seen bad films but this took the p made no sense and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds oh and i think one has a low <UNK> count its that good a <UNK> plays a <UNK> cockney a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed <UNK> rogue of a <UNK> and some lesser lights play dim <UNK> br br and there are some russian gangsters oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs br br avoid this film like the plague
<START> <UNK> <UNK> in hawaii full of clichés highly predictable unrealistic and sometimes even stupid if you have nothing better to do however it does provide 40 minutes of simple <UNK> entertainment endless looks at great male and female <UNK> and very good photography of the spectacular <UNK> scenery on the other hand if you are looking for anything more than that stay away br br oh and by the way if you have ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running one you have two <UNK> 1 you will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or 2 look at it as science fiction comedy as i did lie back relax and laugh about it
<START> i loved this movie i'm a mexican and was in the least offended by it in fact i think this movie should be shown at police <UNK> all over mexico it's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse it <UNK> me to read in the news how killers <UNK> and other <UNK> go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells we should have someone like creasy denzel <UNK> character a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante kidnapping is <UNK> industry down here at least in the big cities i actually wish real life <UNK> could suffer the same fate as the one's creasy did his fine job upon that would be so marvelous sorry i am that <UNK> man on fire is a gripping film that you can't miss it might be hard on some of you if you aren't used to reading subtitles <UNK> do that all the time while watching american movies but the effort will be well worth it some of the editing is a bit fuzzy kind of like traffic remember another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up <UNK> by the second half i swear you'll be cheering as you watch denzel washington <UNK> the wrong <UNK> his performance is nothing short of excellent the ending no spoilers ok is a bit sad but i'm sure you'll like it anyway man on fire is one of the year's best movies a must own for a dvd collection 9 out of 10
<START> i loved so much about this movie the time taken to develop the characters the attention to detail the superb performances the stunning lighting and cinematography the wonderful soundtrack br br it has a combined intensity and <UNK> of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast paced action flick if we lived in <UNK> days i'd say this movie's a bit like a shakespearean tragedy but since we don't let's say it's more like a drama suspense movie br br the plot is simple but the story is complex the movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored much of the story is shown rather than told which i find makes it more subtle and moving and which also works well for a story based on a comic book or graphic novel at times i felt i was actually there in the 1930s part of this story there was such a realistic yet dream like quality in the style of its telling br br i don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon but in this case i do though i did enjoy the book too i've bought the dvd which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary br br i also took my little cousin who's a little younger than the boy in the movie to see it after i saw it for the first time because he has issues at home and i wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father son issues with him he loved it and the discussion
<START> i have seen this film three times now and each time i see it it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch br br the acting is amazing which is not hard to believe since it is daniel day lewis who is an amazing actor brenda <UNK> is the surprise wonder in it though she captures your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy who is not able to walk or speak until he is in his late teens br br i can't say enough good things about the movie but i will stop here i recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that are based on actual events or just enjoy good dramas in general
<START> i saw this series when it world premiered at the toronto film festival i liked the idea behind the film where two men got together and told a director from each country to direct a movie about <UNK> these directors never met before until the project was complete and they saw how it looked all together warning spoilers ahead all the pieces were very powerful and some were controversial if you are an american then you may not like this as some of the pieces may be found anti american however i know a few americans who enjoyed these series the piece that i found the best was the one from india it was about how a muslim family living in the states had 2 sons and one of them was missing the americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked with the terrorist bombing it captures the mom's despair and <UNK> of these <UNK> so well that it brought tears to my eyes in the end we see that her son had died while trying to save the many victims from the crash of the towers this was a true story and that was what made it so real there were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces and the african piece was one of the best it was <UNK> yet just as powerful as the others a must see for everyone and hopefully america will <UNK> this and let it play in their country
<START> when i was kid back in the 1970s a local theatre had children's <UNK> every saturday and sunday afternoon anybody remember those they showed this thing one year around christmas time me and some friends went to see it i expected a cool santa claus movie what i got was a terribly dubbed you can tell and truly creepy movie br br something about santa claus and <UNK> the magician don't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie fighting satan some joker in a silly devil costume complete with <UNK> the images had me cringing in my seat i always found santa spooky to begin with so that didn't help the guy in the satan suit didn't help but what really horrified me were the wooden <UNK> <UNK> that pulled <UNK> <UNK> when he wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements i remember having nightmares about those things all these years later i still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what i saw my friends were sort of frightened by it too i just saw an ad for it on tv and all those nightmares came roaring back this is a creepy disturbing little christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it avoid this one unless you really want to <UNK> your kids this gets a 1
<START> this movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should among all the stars you couldn't get your kicks from any of the scenes the movie is shot in a dream like middle age set which is embarrassingly cheesy the acting is worse than keanu reeves the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about their kid in college and the dialogue is the worse i have seen in a movie the plot also was worse by ten <UNK> i'd stick to the amateur route the audio commentary was useless since it's a skin flick but even then that was bad too unless your a <UNK> jenna jameson fan there is little here 4 10
<START> the notorious bettie page is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of america bettie page played by gretchen mol was one of the first sex icons in america the type of <UNK> bettie page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a u s <UNK> investigation in the 1950s br br walking out of the film all i could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s you can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot that the footage <UNK> in the notorious bettie page seems almost <UNK> and innocent most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when bettie page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals i find that maybe the <UNK> has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today's pornography it was very <UNK> done br br to be honest i was pretty impressed with the notorious bettie page i found the film to be very well done and interesting the movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in america gretchen mol looks just like bettie page and gives a very fine performance i also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s br br my only complaint about the film was the running time there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been i looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the toronto film festival also the ending was pretty tame and i was expecting a little more from it or maybe some <UNK> to come on the screen to tell the audience more about bettie <UNK> life where the film left off those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid the acting was great especially gretchen and the writing was good br br mary harron who directed american psycho which is one of my favorite films is the director and writer of the notorious bettie page i feel that mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like psycho bettie page is a character study and a fine one at that harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters she is a very talented director who i hope will be around for many years to come br br bottom line the notorious bettie page is definitely worth a look it's a very interesting story that shows how far america as well as the world has come in terms of pornography the film also provides a fine performance by gretchen mol who literally nails the role of bettie page on the head and top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands sadly this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but i think it's worth checking out br br <UNK> final rating for the notorious bettie page is a 8 10 it's an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in american history
<START> i can't believe that steven <UNK> career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with <UNK> rate secondary actors i watched this moving expecting to see him <UNK> the crap out of some people the way he usually does when he is reduced to using a single <UNK> chop between the shoulder <UNK> to take out an <UNK> and the guy falls like a ton of <UNK> something is wrong br br the plot is unbelievable as a movie and even if you excuse the visuals and had read this story as a novel you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book br br steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under <UNK> he shows no effort and no enthusiasm and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all br br i hate to repeat other peoples comments but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the <UNK> in flight is pathetic the condition of those scenes chopped in is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have <UNK> over time the <UNK> film showing president john f kennedy being <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> br br my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie it is not up to the standards of his work in the <UNK> man or exit wounds i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget i must <UNK> br br it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie as no <UNK> theatre owner would play this movie
<START> high heels are <UNK> things they can elevate women or cross dressing men to <UNK> heights put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile <UNK> <UNK> they can be a <UNK> foot pain that will inevitably lead to <UNK> falls and ultimate tragedy <UNK> <UNK> is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high <UNK> br br <UNK> mother daughter drama is stylish for sure but in terms of plot it's a tongue tied and tedious affair full of confusing complex characters that never fully engage or make sense a few moments of comedy aside <UNK> <UNK> just isn't interesting the best bit comes at the beginning in a <UNK> macabre case of <UNK> <UNK> by a child from this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up but then the film comes to a <UNK> br br there's solid enough acting performances and there's some stylish arty direction that you'd expect from <UNK> but otherwise <UNK> <UNK> isn't an impressive piece of spanish cinema with a story of murder <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mother daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge a <UNK> and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic <UNK> instead it's poor high heels stumbles for sure
<START> this movie has it all action fighting dancing bull riding music pretty girls this movie is an <UNK> look at middle america believe me i was there in 1980 lots of oil money lots of women and lots of <UNK> <UNK> too bad they are all gone now the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl back but it is redeemed by the actors and the music there is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie and that includes american <UNK> it is a movie i watch over and over again and never get tired of it every time i watch it i am young again and it is time to go out <UNK> <UNK> the only reason i only gave it a 9 is because you cannot rate a movie zero i do not feel you should rate one 10
<START> as a <UNK> into the church of jesus christ of latter day saints i try to <UNK> as much as i can of my new <UNK> history i was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons the other young men women as well as their families of our ward br br on a beautiful spring evening we drove to <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> historical village located there we were to have had <UNK> at the <UNK> center to view this movie since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries i was intrigued the only full length motion pictures of the <UNK> i had seen was legacy and my best two years both which i thought were very well written and <UNK> br br at the beginning the <UNK> <UNK> passed out <UNK> stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie i thought ok but it takes a lot to move me to tears imagine my surprise when i found myself <UNK> it truly is a very moving inspirational testament to the prophet joseph smith br br see it believe in it's powerful message
<START> scoop is also the name of a late thirties evelyn <UNK> novel and woody allen's new movie though set today has a nostalgic charm and simplicity it hasn't the depth of characterization intense performances suspense or shocking final <UNK> of allen's <UNK> effort match point <UNK> by many including this reviewer to be a strong return to form but scoop does closely resemble allen's last outing in its focus on english <UNK> posh london <UNK> murder and <UNK> this time woody leaves behind the <UNK> murder mystery genre and returns to comedy and is himself back on the screen as an <UNK> <UNK> a magician called sid <UNK> stage <UNK> the great <UNK> who <UNK> some <UNK> <UNK> with i used to be of the <UNK> <UNK> but as i got older i converted to <UNK> following a revelation in the midst of <UNK> standard <UNK> act with scarlett johansson as sondra <UNK> the audience <UNK> the <UNK> pair get drawn into a dead ace english <UNK> post <UNK> attempt to score one last top news story on the edge of the <UNK> joe <UNK> ian <UNK> has just met the <UNK> of one lord <UNK> son's secretary who says she was <UNK> and she's told him the charming <UNK> <UNK> son peter <UNK> hugh jackman was the <UNK> card murderer a london serial killer sondra and sid immediately become a pair of amateur <UNK> with <UNK> deadpan wit and <UNK> <UNK> beauty they cut a quick <UNK> through to the cream of the london <UNK> br br woody isn't <UNK> his young heroine <UNK> as in match point johansson again as in the past this time moreover <UNK> not an ambitious <UNK> and would be movie star she's <UNK> surprisingly into a <UNK> <UNK> but still pretty <UNK> sid and sondra have no <UNK> which is a great relief they simply team up more or less <UNK> to carry out <UNK> wishes by <UNK> <UNK> and watching him for clues to his guilt with only minimal <UNK> sid <UNK> to appear as <UNK> dad sondra who's captivated peter by pretending to <UNK> in his club pool re <UNK> herself <UNK> <UNK> mr <UNK> i e woody keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks but he <UNK> <UNK> with these and beats their husbands at poker <UNK> non stop one liners and all the while maintaining apparently with success that he's in oil and precious <UNK> just as <UNK> has told him to say br br that's about all there is to it or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome at first allen's decision to make johansson a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and badly dressed college girl seems not just <UNK> but an all around bad decision but johansson who has <UNK> and <UNK> as an actress miraculously manages to carry it off helped by jackman an actor who knows how to make any actress appear <UNK> if he desires her the film actually creates a sense of relationships to make up for it limited range of characters sid and sondra <UNK> in a friendly way and peter and sondra have a believable attraction even though it's artificial and <UNK> she is after all going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac br br what <UNK> a bit is allen's again <UNK> over english wealth and class things his brooklyn background seems to have left him despite all his celebrity with a irresistible <UNK> for jackman is an impressive fellow glamorous and dashing his parents were english but could this athletic musical comedy star raised in australia x man's <UNK> really pass as an aristocrat only in the movies perhaps here and in kate and leopold br br this isn't as strong a film as match point but to say it's a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong it has no more depth than a half hour radio drama or a tv show but <UNK> jokes are far funnier and more original than you'll get in any such media affair and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and <UNK> it doesn't matter if a movie is silly or <UNK> when it's <UNK> summer entertainment on a hot day you don't want a heavy meal the whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light <UNK> entertainment without crude jokes or <UNK> effects without vince <UNK> or owen wilson critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the allen decline that <UNK> match point don't believe them he doesn't try too hard why should he he may be 70 but <UNK> he's still light on his feet and his body moves pretty fast too
<START> well let me say that i have always been a steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just don't measure up to the rest this in my opinion is very stupid i did not like it all the biggest reason i don't like it is because it is very flawed and to me does not make much sense the acting is very bad even steven seagal does not do good acting the rest of the actors i can see because they just do direct to video movies it does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it doesn't make much sense <UNK> is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it the special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake so all in all this has to <UNK> worst movie of all so if you want to see a steven seagal movie don't rent this one just pretend it does not exist so just avoid this movie br br overall score out of br br out of
<START> this movie is just lame a total waste of time and money the jokes are predictable the characters are so cliché and the way it talks about <UNK> <UNK> is not funny as well the problem is that the writers seems not to know how a <UNK> game works and most important how to make jokes about this game of course there are a bunch of losers who play <UNK> like freaking <UNK> and total losers but for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game the story doesn't make any sense at all who cares about how long a game is being played the greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors didn't even try to know what <UNK> is about to make jokes about it i felt ashamed by watching this lame movie
<START> too many sources <UNK> <UNK> this thought provoking period drama in part based on historical fact together with the <UNK> similar <UNK> which was a <UNK> in '70s euro trash cinema <UNK> the righteous anger that drives the whole <UNK> perhaps <UNK> it was also director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> attempt at narrative film making outside of many well received documentaries br br safely set within a historical context flavia <UNK> the growing rebellion of an early <UNK> century italian nun <UNK> <UNK> career performance even <UNK> her sterling work in lucio <UNK> devastating don't torture a <UNK> locked away in convent by her not so <UNK> father in a desperate attempt to <UNK> the girl's budding <UNK> nature wondering why women are <UNK> to secondary roles at best in life as in holy <UNK> she is confronted by ways in which male <UNK> can <UNK> female lives inspiring revolt <UNK> by the <UNK> of semi crazed older sister agatha <UNK> portrayed by veteran actress maria <UNK> from marcel <UNK> les <UNK> du <UNK> and more <UNK> by a muslim invasion joining the <UNK> and perhaps <UNK> <UNK> them to do her <UNK> flavia truly becomes the <UNK> she already felt herself to be with expected tragic results br br with its breathtaking widescreen compositions by <UNK> <UNK> who shot <UNK> <UNK> zabriskie point this is an <UNK> and <UNK> account of one woman's fierce yet ultimately <UNK> fight against <UNK> society which <UNK> her no rights beyond <UNK> or <UNK> as sister agatha <UNK> remarks a lengthy drug induced fantasy sequence clearly <UNK> on ken <UNK> otherwise far more flamboyant <UNK> notwithstanding the movie turns out relatively <UNK> in the skin department making something of a mockery out of its semi porn reputation this is a serious work deserving <UNK> and <UNK> of its <UNK> <UNK> reputation
<START> honestly i went to see the movie not because of the actors not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in <UNK> and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category believe me being a movie freak i have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime <UNK> the killer <UNK> <UNK> but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture i have ever seen br br the plot is plain stupid the directing is awful acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so called horror <UNK> there isn't a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie and some of the scenes are really hard to stand especially the scene where you see the <UNK> in the glasses and hear the baby cries horrible i can't understand why the movie was rated 16 in germany where normally the <UNK> are real tough e g kill bill brutal but it made fun of itself and had great <UNK> to asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing even a movie like state of grace is rated 18 no one can call this a horror movie because actually it was more about showing gore than about <UNK> the public showing the <UNK> face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision for me excuse my expression it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies in some scenes you see violence that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything the plot has holes and flaws the dialog is boring honestly i can't mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the british and scottish accent br br if i had something to say i would <UNK> this movie from the theaters i fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap br br i'm looking forward to getting <UNK> to my thread and i'd be happy to discuss about one or the other topic br br <UNK> the dream baby <UNK> the dream david <UNK>

<START> i read that jessie <UNK> was approached and turned down co starring with fred astaire in damsel in distress jessie <UNK> in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any american musical films if they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime event br br it's a pity because damsel in distress has everything else going for it fred astaire story and adapted to screen by author p g <UNK> burns allen for comedy and songs by the gershwin brothers in answer to the question <UNK> by the nice work if you can get it there isn't much you could ask more for this film br br except a leading lady though ginger rogers made several films away from fred astaire damsel in distress is the only film astaire made without rogers while they were a team young joan fontaine was cast in this opposite astaire br br her character has none of the bite that ginger <UNK> parts do in these films all she basically has to do is act sweet and <UNK> she also doesn't contribute anything <UNK> and if i had to rate all the dancing partners of fred astaire joan fontaine would come out at the bottom the poor woman is just horrible in the things are looking up number br br when she co starred later on in a musical with bing crosby the emperor <UNK> it's no accident that fontaine is given nothing musical to do br br the version i have is a <UNK> one and in this case i think it actually did some good the <UNK> lush green english countryside of p g <UNK> is really brought out in this vhs copy especially in that number i mentioned before with astaire and fontaine which does take place in the garden br br burns allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers <UNK> astaire in grand style in the stiff upper lip number the surreal fun house sequence is <UNK> staged br br p g <UNK> <UNK> runs the gamut with <UNK> <UNK> at her <UNK> best and for once <UNK> love as <UNK> father as a nice man on film br br the biggest hit out of a damsel in distress is a <UNK> day maybe the best known song about the british capital city since london bridge is falling down done in the best simple elegant manner by fred astaire it's one of those songs that will endure as long as london <UNK> and even after br br <UNK> the young and inexperienced joan fontaine a damsel in distress rates as a classic classic score classic dancing classic comedy who could ask for anything more
<START> first a technical review the script is so slow it is really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min the dialogue is so flat and truly one dimensional the acting is pathetic they seem to really have lifted <UNK> out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board as for the whole point of the story namely war is bad oh there's a shock is really non existent without out the lets shock 'em and get great publicity scene nobody would be talking about this film it is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the money used this could have gone on believe me i've seen some bad <UNK> new clothes films but the one thing i can say for them is at least they were well shot and well made while the camera <UNK> during two scenes in this read all the other reviews avoid at all costs and don't talk about it
<START> i loved the first azumi movie i've seen ms <UNK> in a variety of her tv appearances and i've seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks i have to say that this movie was much weaker than i'd expected br br given the movie's cast and set up in azumi they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie but instead it was slow plodding in parts and <UNK> with very poor unconvincing and wooden acting br br when they bothered to reference the first movie they did so in a manner that was pretty loose and weak in azumi the title character is the best of a group of superior killers in azumi 2 she seems somehow <UNK> and less impressive br br that's not to say it was a total loss there were a few decent fight scenes and some over the top characters unfortunately the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are not <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the latter two truly captured the manga feel in their screenplay whereas the former never quite got it
<START> well i'll start by <UNK> i'm not a john ford fan i watched the informer only because i'm trying to work my way through a list of the <UNK> so if you are just move along 'cause you're not going to agree with me br br what an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is i will say that there is a good idea for a movie here it made me think about how few films there are about the irish revolution but as usual ford is determined to bury it under over acting and cheap sentiment i suppose it's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less than <UNK> transition that was being made from the <UNK> to the <UNK> the acting styles of some of the principals have that <UNK> quality <UNK> to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue of course title cards would prevent ford from <UNK> every bit of emotion six times what dialogue there is usually has a they're always after me lucky charms quality that is <UNK> by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an irish accent of course as bad as they are the accents are helpful in reminding us we're in ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some german <UNK> piece being filmed on the next <UNK> over it feels as if with an eagle eye you might see some villagers off to torch dr frankenstein in the background br br techniques change tastes change so i won't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day but it's not one of the classics that hold up more just fair warning about the kind of over <UNK> <UNK> to which ford was going to <UNK> his career
<START> after reading several comments i felt i had to add in my two cents as well sorrow lost is one of the most memorable shorts i think i have ever seen i had gotten the chance to see this at the new york independent film festival i felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional the story was beautifully complex especially for such a short amount of time the story is focused on a young girl who is <UNK> by her abusive father she is soon given the choice to stop him by a demon played by <UNK> eric <UNK> having watched the show i was amazingly impressed with how he played such unique and different character i never knew he could act so well his character was deeply complex and he was very <UNK> the acting was absolutely superb by him the girl's was okay and the father's was decent there is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future the effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing i wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this it is rare you get to see such a high quality short the opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable with any major feature film this isn't to say that it's not without its flaws i thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long but this stuck in my head days after watching it there are very few shorts with this level of quality
<START> this movie is not for the faint or weak of heart it couldn't decide if it was going to be porn or <UNK> it was neither one it was just bad there was nothing in this movie to make me want to see anything else made by these people again
<START> i simply give this a three because it <UNK> what my buddies and i hoped it would do entertain br br i wasn't stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of romero or fulci but what i rented it for was a laugh br br if you are looking for a film for amusement or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment go for it this is perfect for junior mystery science theater fans but the only downside is that it is so bad it makes fun of itself br br i personally think it is a shame to relate this to any other hollywood title that we may know because when a film sucks like this it has its own genre
<START> mindless <UNK> about the second coming of christ in the form of a hippie and <UNK> looking sandra locke you have no idea what's happening on the screen with the irritating theme song suzanne being played over and over throughout the movie until when the second coming of suzanne is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing br br this off the wall <UNK> movie maker logan jared martin is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the <UNK> world is willing to <UNK> his project planning to go on his own logan then spots this couple at a <UNK> <UNK> and is fascinated with the young woman suzanne sandra locke who reminds him of someone he knew in another life jesus christ br br with <UNK> assistant and all around <UNK> <UNK> richard dreyfuss somehow getting a <UNK> 000 00 <UNK> from the bank to <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece he starts to work on suzanne by <UNK> her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film this leads to suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist simon paul sand but later simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out br br the movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub plots in it that has to do with a young <UNK> girl dorothy <UNK> <UNK> who's <UNK> of her <UNK> by suzanne after everyone else at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to failed it's not really known what exactly suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of <UNK> or <UNK> there was this supposed to show us in the audience that she like jesus could miraculously <UNK> the sick br br there's also this newspaper <UNK> and big time businessman <UNK> jackson <UNK> gene barry who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid life crisis or has seen a biblical like vision that changed his life forever <UNK> had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it's all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there's all this suffering in the world like this movie that he's in and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on suzanne <UNK> also got some sense knocked into his head when his private <UNK> david mark <UNK> who's gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a <UNK> like drive along the pacific coast br br the movie the second coming of suzanne goes on with a number of unrelated sequences probably to fill or pad in some time by it's director and film editor and then goes to it's final scene in a christ like <UNK> on a hill as logan has all the cameras rolling it turns out that the crazed logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to <UNK> on the helpless and tied up suzanne the actual <UNK> of jesus christ some 2 000 years ago br br hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow the second coming of suzanne puts you through the same kind torture that suzanne is put through by logan and the makers of the film the movie tries to be arty but that's just an excuse to cover up it's brainless and non existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it
<START> a great idea 11 stories about 11 september 11 directors from different countries with different results ken <UNK> talking about an immigrant as usual is just brilliant as usual the frenchman does a very good job also while the <UNK> <UNK> film was a nice surprise however the israel film was a bit boring and the mexican guy well he should quit directing and work in a mexican restaurant 8 10
<START> i suppose all the inside jokes is what made <UNK> a cult classic i thought it was awful though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters it probably could've been a much better and funnier movie maybe all they needed was a real budget br br <UNK> as many viewers have pointed out already is something of a <UNK> parody hence all the references to the movie the movie begins somewhere in <UNK> during an <UNK> dig an annoying <UNK> named paul aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans is <UNK> up with his dad in the <UNK> his dad is an unconventional kind of <UNK> searching the <UNK> not for <UNK> or <UNK> or anything but proof of u f o 's and that's where the <UNK> come into the picture hidden in the <UNK> of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a <UNK> rubber doll with a <UNK> voice they name him arnold <UNK> him in a bag and bring him home so paul's dad can finally show proof of extra <UNK> life br br paul the idiot that he is breaks his promise to his dad to watch arnold a <UNK> he made with his dad if he loses it's off to community college to get a <UNK> career the creepy next door neighbor with the bad <UNK> cecil television veteran harvey <UNK> wonders what his neighbors are up to so he and his lazy son some <UNK> hippie type who looks more like they should've made his character a biker or heavy metal <UNK> to go and snatch arnold why a get rich quick scheme of course and of course even <UNK> son is too dumb to look after arnold and after a few <UNK> and <UNK> at arnold he <UNK> into more <UNK> br br this wasn't even a movie that was so bad it was good it was just plain awful i was hoping that the <UNK> would've mutated and killed the morons that were always after them even paul and his girlfriend at least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really <UNK> up the movie not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets and really bad writing all around it wasn't even funny not even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal <UNK> in your eye like i said <UNK> if they had been given an actual budget and better actors they <UNK> been able to pull off a good parody pass
<START> having decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob <UNK> on the strength of class movies like <UNK> blade a simple plan and the man who wasn't there amongst others it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there what i didn't realise however was that there could be one this bad i'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is the funniest dialogue in it goes like this knock knock who's there the big <UNK> man the big <UNK> man who the big <UNK> man is you yes folks it really is that bad billy bob is only in it for about two minutes i guess he needed the work at that time in his career and the rest of the movie is painful for some reason though although it's undeniably awful i don't hate it that's probably because i save my <UNK> for any high budget special effects laden junk like the fast and the furious and not a no budget flick like this one 2 10 at a push
<START> this is definitely the worst bigfoot movie i've ever seen and quite possibly the overall worst movie i've ever seen in my life the actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed like they were trying way too hard to play their roles as <UNK> tough guys <UNK> know it <UNK> etc and the bigfoot itself was terrible it appeared to be some kind of computer generated image from the days of <UNK> <UNK> at one point near the end of the movie as an army of <UNK> were chasing after the remaining survivors one gets shot and as it's running it looked like a poor man's version of <UNK> kong himself and one gets hit by a bullet and the blood that comes out of it was just awful animation another thing that was annoying was the music way way way too much music classical score or whatever you call it throughout the entire film it was never ending oh yeah the movie is boring too absolutely one of the worst films i've ever seen i highly recommend taking your 3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and spending it on a <UNK> of gas or a value menu somewhere truly awful
<START> as someone else mentioned it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat then the main story a photographer <UNK> and a writer shepard meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains first they spend the night at an <UNK> where the slightly deaf <UNK> gets <UNK> at with increasing <UNK> to the audience by <UNK> once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly <UNK> to strangers <UNK> and <UNK> anyone what happens next i will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because i most <UNK> couldn't now i like <UNK> and this <UNK> been better if only <UNK> writer and director had made some attempt at logical story telling the backdrop <UNK> makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult <UNK> the <UNK> peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them the photography is nice just wish the whole thing made sense you can view this film at archive <UNK>
<START> david <UNK> has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce yes it's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of <UNK> gags but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts the film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more <UNK> kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you'll likely miss them like his previous efforts which include airplane top secret and naked gun the humor flies out almost every second there are so many moments that work it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat what sets this movie apart from other pale <UNK> in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line while others have <UNK> upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies take mafia please this film tells a new story with likable characters it touches upon sports films in general as well as <UNK> the real sports industry instead of <UNK> any specific movies even for people who don't care for south park its creators matt stone and <UNK> parker make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry the film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of <UNK> sports <UNK> and other celebrities especially a hilarious bit with robert stack of <UNK> mysteries by the way stay through the credits for a final joke with bob <UNK> and al michaels all in all <UNK> has achieved in words perhaps <UNK> to the movie's mix of sports a home <UNK>
<START> when you get your hands on a british film you expect some sort of quality and when it comes to acting camera work lighting etc this film does the business it's done by highly skilled <UNK> that alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours but when you look under the layers of <UNK> you don't really find anything apart from making you feel good and <UNK> a drug liberal view there's really nothing there the script is mediocre the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of hollywood in all it's english <UNK> it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another full monty why they made this film i haven't got a clue apart from making money of course
<START> i have seen this film on countless occasions and thoroughly enjoyed it each time this is mostly due to the lovely erika <UNK> a great actress with incredible looks plus any film starring tom berenger and dennis hopper is bound to be entertaining
<START> i thought this movie was very well put together the voice overs were also great i liked how they all <UNK> their conflicts and reached their goals i would recommend this movie to anyone it was definitely worth the time and money to watch it atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh other scenes made me sad and others made me glad it is a movie any age can enjoy from the moment milo is the crazy <UNK> or until he <UNK> the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea after i watched the movie i read the book it was good as well but the movie puts better pictures in your mind it is just like the book but go ahead and watch this movie
<START> i'll admit i've only watched a handful of episodes but each one seemed completely different from the next it seems after the first season the producers decided to completely <UNK> the show drop characters introduce new ones and rewrite the entire show dynamic br br as you have probably <UNK> already the show is about quirky unpredictable teenager holly amanda <UNK> who moves in with her high strung sister valerie <UNK> <UNK> in new york city decent enough premise odd couple fish out of water high <UNK> br br while i miss the sitcoms of <UNK> this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly and it's sad because they have some decent talent br br on top of everything they insisted on changing the show val was living with a cast regular <UNK> one season then he was suddenly gone so she opens a <UNK> what when things change that drastically you get the feeling that even the show knows it's bad i mean completely new sets characters written off and new show <UNK> br br on a side note this is just <UNK> i know this is a television show and not real at all but val and holly end up living in a huge <UNK> <UNK> there are stairs with a <UNK> in manhattan are you serious
<START> i am a big fan of the movie but not for the usual reasons i think travolta and <UNK> performed at higher than average rates i think the sets were representative of the location and the era i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band however i think the photography was amazing since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and <UNK> had low <UNK> perhaps 10 12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to <UNK> a smoke filled bar hung 2 4 feet below the ceiling the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors the bull the bar the women the dancing the low level of light that actually was in the bar what a feat sure there was <UNK> lighting but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar it had to be low light shots ray <UNK> the camera <UNK> was outstanding he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film thanks ray great work
<START> it's been a while since i've watched this movie and the series but now i'm refreshing my memory this was a very funny movie based on the classic series johnny <UNK> and <UNK> william scott were hilarious together bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run <UNK> in the general lee when boss <UNK> forces the dukes off their farm bo and luke sneak around <UNK> local construction site and find <UNK> of coal they soon realize that boss <UNK> is gonna strip mine hazzard county unless the dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin daisy my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn't right for the part of boss <UNK> and sheriff <UNK> p <UNK> was way too serious other than that i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard
<START> the story goes something like this a small town girl katie jessica simpson decides to visit her boyfriend in the big city when she arrives she discovers he isn't quite as faithful as he should be katie then ends up <UNK> into the adventure that is new york filling in as bike <UNK> comedic and charming <UNK> ensues she falls into a hole in the ground and thus meets charismatic good guy ben luke wilson it's not love at first sight at least for her but destiny and ben won't give up quite that easy being just a small town girl and blonde a couple of evil executives at a building firm decides she's the perfect <UNK> for their cunning plan <UNK> with hilarious and sad consequences follow however this is one blonde who won't take it lying down br br people being <UNK> of this film will soon enough be proved wrong the jokes are confident and fitting and the story well developed the relationship between katie and ben feels so natural that it puts anything godard has created to shame the multi talented jessica simpson once again surprises with a strong role only she could pull off simpson really is the marilyn monroe of our day there's even one scene <UNK> her she <UNK> perfectly between vulnerable and <UNK> katie really does show us that you can't judge a book by its cover luke wilson is as charming as ever even if he was covered in <UNK> that man would be as appealing as anyone his light touch puppy dog eyes and laid back manner makes it difficult to resist andy dick plays the role he was born to play one of the two diabolical executives he really cannot be <UNK> the strength of the performance lies in his restraint it's remarkable because most actors would just run away with it and play it for cheap laughs not this guy br br in conclusion director scott marshall has crafted an intelligent and frequently hilarious comedy that is destined to become a classic alongside masterpieces of cinema like epic movie and <UNK> kudos to everyone involved in this especially jessica simpson her sincere smile and whole hearted laughter would make even the <UNK> man break out in a big grin you may be tough but you're not that tough <UNK> recommended to everyone who wants to be swept off their feet and see a romantic comedy that for once feels honest thank you for this film oh and the soundtrack rocks br br now if you still haven't gotten it i'm being sarcastic 1 10
<START> if you've ever wanted to see a film that <UNK> style over substance this is for you to me son de <UNK> is beautiful to see but there's precious little substance unless <UNK> melodramatic manipulative love <UNK> turn you on this may be one of those famous <UNK> <UNK> you've heard so much about br br we're about half way through this film before anything really happens <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> goes out to sea looking for <UNK> and doesn't come back leaving his wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and son to <UNK> for themselves then in a furious six minutes of screen time they bury <UNK> <UNK> gets married again and her son grows into mid childhood this rapid <UNK> is jarring to say the least and very sloppy after 40 minutes of more or less hanging around we're suddenly into a full blown melodrama all in six minutes i think this is called <UNK> narrative pacing br br five years later <UNK> as in the wandering superhero <UNK> get it returns to his <UNK> <UNK> only to find she's married to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an inexplicably wealthy guy what does he do to earn all that <UNK> who inexplicably keeps <UNK> as pets when <UNK> in great anger questions <UNK> about his absence he tells her that he'll take her to the island of <UNK> someday and she'll understand everything br br and here's the thing he doesn't take her to the island of <UNK> the reference just dies somewhere in the script he doesn't really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years he doesn't <UNK> himself as an <UNK> guy and the movie doesn't fill in the plot holes that are staring at us for at least half of the film i can only assume that director <UNK> <UNK> wants us to fill in the story lines with the mystical clues fish <UNK> the sea he offers through breathtaking cinematography and <UNK> dialogue it just doesn't work the narrative <UNK> on this film ends up looking more like a <UNK> <UNK> br br i'm sure <UNK> <UNK> is a good actor but i just couldn't buy his <UNK> as any kind of hero which is what the original <UNK> was supposed to be with <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> a short <UNK> of identical poetry from <UNK> roughly 2 000 times and each and every time it <UNK> <UNK> to explosive <UNK> this guy should be rented out to <UNK> stale <UNK> i'm sure <UNK> would be impressed he didn't get laid that often as i understand it br br this poetic <UNK> figures <UNK> in the film and i had no choice but to assume it was a gender <UNK> of <UNK> famous <UNK> <UNK> i e beautiful <UNK> singing <UNK> to far off sailors who were doomed if they answered the well <UNK> call if this is what <UNK> <UNK> is up to you can see the problem he's offering convoluted symbolism in a snatch and grab attempt at high art once again it just doesn't work at least in my eyes br br <UNK> is a beautiful and <UNK> young actor but she gives us a character here who doesn't seem to have much intellectual or even romantic depth it's beyond me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who sports a for rent sign on his face as in <UNK> <UNK> 1960s style hair that looks more like <UNK> and one of those trendy 21st century <UNK> you know four <UNK> growth no more no less he's supposed to be a dreamy kind of guy i think but those eyes of his suggest he might be suffering more from <UNK> to a preposterous script br br but don't despair this film is great to look at just don't try to connect the <UNK> on the red herrings or think too much about what you're hearing in the way of dialogue you can do a lost of fast <UNK> on this film particularly in the first 40 minutes and you really won't miss much
<START> from the start you know how this movie will end it's so full of clichés your typical <UNK> member will not even like this movie i give it 2 out of 10 only because of the acting of william <UNK> i can't believe people voted 6 for this movie it's so biased towards a <UNK> point of <UNK> once a thief people aren't born bad neither are they born good they are born with a clean <UNK> it's society parents and education what makes them who they are and if they take the wrong turn somewhere down the line it certainly isn't going to be the american <UNK> system that gets them back on track anyway avoid this movie like the plague i bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crap br br
<START> happy go lovely is a waste of everybody's time and talent including the audience the <UNK> of the old hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is <UNK> forgivable very few people watched these movies for their plots but they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots not here they usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs not happy go lovely and vera ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it and instead she was called upon to carry the movie and couldn't do it the scottish locale was wasted usually automatically <UNK> <UNK> scottish <UNK> is absent the photography was pedestrian the musical numbers were pedestrian <UNK> romero gives his usual professional performance chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part in the type of producer role <UNK> frequently by walter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> david niven is just fine and no one could do david niven like david niven at the end of the day if you adore niven as i do it's reason enough to waste 90 minutes on happy go lovely if not skip it
<START> i can't believe how awful this movie turned out to be i feel <UNK> even referring to it as a movie the acting was flat the editing was terrible and the plot leaves many major questions unanswered the premise was ok if unoriginal a small group of aliens is living in the us and trying to slowly take over humanity but it goes rapidly downhill from there how could they convince a human to accept an alien as his wife in order to make they alien human hybrid they require they show a <UNK> alien but never show what it does they have a plastic surgeon that can produce perfect looking skin on an industrial scale they throw in the obligatory huge alien monster with teeth the ending was almost too painful to watch i suppose that i'm mostly disappointed that bruce <UNK> would have anything to do with this how could he say to the huge alien monster with teeth get away from him you son of a b <UNK> with a straight face it's a long fall from his <UNK> 5 days avoid this at all costs
<START> lol not a bad way to start it i thought this was original but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong i never saw king kong until i was 15 i saw this film when i was 9 the film's funky disco music will get stuck in your head not to mention the film's theme song by the <UNK> this is the worst creature effects i've ever seen at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b movies memorable quotes take a <UNK> and go to bed put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power i remember seeing this film on movie <UNK> <UNK> by elvira there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl who was falling also around that year was another kong clone mighty <UNK> man 1977 which came from hong kong there is a lot of traveling <UNK> scenes and <UNK> body parts this film will leave you laughing it is like i said just another king kong clone rated pg for violence language <UNK> elements and some scary scenes
<START> this movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history horribly inaccurate this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of dutch british chinese american and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that the sadistic japanese killed and tortured to death the bridge was to be built over the bodies of the white man as stated by the head japanese engineer it is disgusting that such <UNK> horrors committed by the japanese <UNK> is the source of a movie where the bridge itself isn't even close to accurate to the actual bridge the actual bridge was built of steel and <UNK> not wood what of the survivors who are still alive today they hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent their friends were <UNK> tortured and murdered by cruel <UNK> those that didn't die of <UNK> <UNK> or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times
<START> you know this movie isn't that great but i mean c'mon it's about angels helping a baseball team i find the plot line to be hilarious anyways this kid's dad says he'll take him back if the angels win the <UNK> because he knows they won't kid <UNK> to his fake god to help the angels win god helps the whole time via the angel christopher lloyd rip and in the end his dad doesn't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face it's hilarious until danny glover <UNK> it and it's friend br br i guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her <UNK> projects and her stories the real winner here though is god because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows br br as a kids movie it gets a 7 as a movie about the mysteries of blind stupid faith and the nature of god it gets a 10
<START> what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has <UNK> down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica alba br br unfortunately the powers that be over at fox decided that they needed to fine tune the <UNK> within 3 episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new <UNK> were <UNK> the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she <UNK> couldn't sleep br br the moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works don't screw with it br br <UNK>
<START> 13 days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james <UNK> played the part of jim <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> greene sam <UNK> were too old br br <UNK> julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity <UNK> to the professional soldier who after all won the battle the scene where he <UNK> his officers for failing to <UNK> a guard and prevent a <UNK> is one the <UNK> did not understand failing to keep watch is a major <UNK> in the military santa anna was within his <UNK> to be angry <UNK> julia <UNK> carried poor writing through the scene br br kathleen york was an impressive <UNK> dickinson a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage however kathleen york might have been reminded that as <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> they <UNK> <UNK> not sound very <UNK>
<START> a <UNK> little <UNK> whose <UNK> minute length doesn't seem a second too short my name is julia ross <UNK> back to an english tradition of things not being what they seem hitchcock's the lady <UNK> is one example out of work julia ross nina <UNK> finds a dream job at a new <UNK> agency in london whose sinister representative seems very anxious to <UNK> if she has living relatives or a boyfriend after <UNK> to duty she wakes up having been drugged in a vast <UNK> like pile on the <UNK> coast supposedly as the <UNK> in the <UNK> wife of george <UNK> who displays an <UNK> interest in knives and ice picks his <UNK> <UNK> mum is the irresistible dame may <UNK> this time a model of <UNK> <UNK> on the other side of good vs evil than she occupied in the lady <UNK> the nightmare vision of this tale unfolds <UNK> we know what's going on but are <UNK> to tell poor julia this movie curiously is regularly <UNK> a place of honor as one of the earliest and very few british films <UNK> i think it's closer to the gothic old dark house tradition than the american one of wet <UNK> and urban corruption it does however <UNK> a more modern <UNK> cast of mind whatever you call it it remains a <UNK> satisfying thriller
<START> the problem with this movie is that it is shot on the worst possible camera and the film is <UNK> and grainy maybe it's just the fact that whoever was holding the camera couldn't hold still because they were having a <UNK> or something there is also way too much <UNK> and vomit in this movie there is someone <UNK> every twenty minutes and it makes me think that this was made by some <UNK> or something it was disgusting then there is the annoying high pitched screaming that goes on and on and on and doesn't stop until the credits roll i also didn't like when all her friends were being shot or not i don't know and she goes in the van and puts band aids on that was just really really stupid to even have that in a movie how much gas can a person <UNK> to get a van going it must be a whole lot because they don't run out of gas for the rest of the movie it was a terrible movie and i would highly suggest not ever seeing it in your whole entire life
<START> this is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made although i've only seen forty <UNK> of it and i must say this is a good movie the plot if funny and because there's sex around pretty much every corner of this movie it's really funny and i don't see how anyone could not like this film i really really really want to watch the rest of the movie it has one slightly sick scene in it trust me it's not very pleasant but apart from that this is a great movie i rate this movie an 7 8 for comedy 10 10 for sexual content and 10 10 for the plot please if your a fan of american pie and you want to watch a movie where there's pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie it will please you br br 10 10
<START> would that more romantic comedies were as <UNK> executed as this one i never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement margaret <UNK> makes a marvellous <UNK> and she and james stewart always brought out the best in each other this movie sports what i think is frank <UNK> most winning performance and with the wizard of oz and <UNK> flat under his belt that is saying a lot the way he finds a christmas dinner partner left me <UNK> with joy director <UNK> lubitsch might have thought trouble in paradise his favorite but this one he must surely consider a triumph with some of the <UNK> dialogue american movies of the 30's has to offer
<START> to me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low budget sci fi as a kid in the 50s thats all there was in 1957 i saw the first man into space in a movie theater with my dad it had marshall thompson starring and some other poor <UNK> who got the title role it is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a <UNK> killer scared the good plenty right out of me the memory of those <UNK> <UNK> still lives within me the incredible melting man is almost a re make only in full glorious color that is wherever the scenes were well lit just gotta love it for what it is a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes disgusting noises and that eerie music bravo
<START> but just as entertaining and random love it or hate it but don't expect a sophisticated plot or nail biting cliffhanger think of it like seinfeld but without the follow through and repeat performances of wacky characters well so far i have a feeling i will develop favourites as the season continues br br creature <UNK> is not for the faint of humour it's meant to be enjoyed with the least amount of effort on your <UNK> part which is why this show <UNK> everything i need in a program when i get home from work in the evening superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of cute to the characters for me to enjoy when i eventually look up from the computer to see what i'm missing br br funnier than most of today's sitcoms <UNK> than an evening at <UNK> just the right mix of dead air and <UNK> can't wait for the next one
<START> a give this movie a 10 10 because it deserves a 10 10 two of the best actors of their time walter matthau george burns <UNK> with neil simon and all of the other actors that are in this film director herbert ross and all of that makes this stage adaption come true the sunshine boys is one of the best films of the 70's i love the type of humor in this film it just makes me laugh so hard br br i got this movie on vhs 3 days ago yes vhs because it was cheaper only 3 i watched it as soon as i got home but i had to watch it again because i kept missing a few parts the first time the second time i watched it it felt a lot better and i laughed a lot harder i'm definitely going to re get this on dvd because i have to see the special features br br it's very funny how that happens two people work together as <UNK> actors performers they get along well on stage but really argue off stage they can't survive another minute with each other then some 15 years later you want to reunite them for a tv special you can find that in this film matthau burns were terrific in this film it's a damn shame they died george burns deserved that oscar he gave a strong comic performance he was also <UNK> when this movie was filmed so far he's the oldest actor to receive an academy award at an old age jessica <UNK> breaks the record as the oldest actress richard benjamin was also fantastic in this he won a golden globe for best supporting actor he deserved that golden globe although many people might disagree with what i am about to say everybody in this film gave a strong performance this comedy is an instant classic i highly recommend it one more thing whoever hates this film is a <UNK>
<START> i generally like watching burt <UNK> films especially when he is needed to go nuts with his <UNK> screen presence like in elmer <UNK> however his greatest strength his <UNK> was occasionally also his greatest weakness as he rarely if ever <UNK> anything and it is this lack of subtlety that really <UNK> the <UNK> now i understand that his character was meant to be a sort of <UNK> but how <UNK> hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable she is supposed to be smart but doesn't seem so when <UNK> <UNK> is being thrown about the screen in addition to this the story is perhaps one of the most <UNK> looking films i have ever seen and it is way too obvious that this is a movie based on a play it just looks like it was mostly filmed in a sound stage instead of in the great wide open west like it was supposed to be br br overall a very overrated film
<START> a story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely <UNK> whose beauty is the very ticket to her own <UNK> demise placed at the beginning of <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> walks a thin line in being a full on silent film which is still is at heart and <UNK> with sound and sound effects the effect is a little irritating for anyone coming into this film because the recorded audio is extremely <UNK> and just doesn't help it at all hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach for example is as part of the movie as the actress who <UNK> louise <UNK> dialog and in doing so <UNK> the audience of a fine performance other than that the movie rolls along more or less well with little jumps in continuity here and there something quite common in films from this era and has that vague <UNK> up feel typical of <UNK> in a way this is an experiment of a movie and closer to the style of <UNK> <UNK> in visual presentation and near intimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level louise brooks here plays a character less <UNK> than what she was known for she's a <UNK> who on a <UNK> decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely <UNK> boyfriend her role is quite thirties and contemporary for its time the last of the <UNK> jazz baby roles were being shown on screen and now with the <UNK> of female independence women as professionals were being represented in film that <UNK> character decides to leave her boyfriend even if she does <UNK> with him later is also a little ahead of her time however her character's fatal flaw is its willing to believe what isn't there that her boyfriend wants her to succeed and this is what leads to her end at the movie theatre this final sequence looks like something straight out of hitchcock in its <UNK> suspense seen in the man who knew too much and cuts from brooks her image on screen and the murderous boyfriend even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing live brooks with the now dead one a chilling effect to a chilling powerful movie
<START> the garden of <UNK> was one of the first feature length 3 strip technicolor films to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature after disney's 5 year <UNK> deal was <UNK> <UNK> sharp which was a costume drama that used the color for it's <UNK> color costumes br br the garden of <UNK> looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life unfortunately the film does not stand up to the cinematography that being said the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat
<START> since i first saw anchors aweigh in 1945 viewing it on <UNK> holds a lot of nostalgia for me at age 15 it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great mgm technicolor musicals now i am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players though sinatra had done a couple of <UNK> films soon after his <UNK> after his <UNK> days as a solo singer this was his first major film appearance as another viewer noted this seems almost to be a warm up for on the town sinatra may have had to work hard at it but his dance with kelly is credible and he would do better in their next <UNK> however <UNK> his <UNK> it's easy to see why he was <UNK> as a string bean who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat though gene kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film his <UNK> performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force almost the iconic figure for mgm musicals where he developed a style of dance <UNK> to that of fred astaire finally it was strange to see the fresh faced dean <UNK> and remember that he would later play a thrill killer in <UNK> based on the leopold <UNK> murder from the 1920s an additional note one reviewer praised the performance of betty <UNK> as sinatra's love interest she later played opposite him in on the town but pamela <UNK> was featured in this film
<START> after having red the overwhelming reviews this film got in my country i but wanted to see it but what a disappointment to see a bunch of one dimensional characters in a plot that lacks of originality is not worth the money and the time to spend i sometimes wonder about the <UNK> in switzerland
<START> i saw this feature as part of the asian american film festival in new york and was horrified by the graphic <UNK> <UNK> child pornography that i witnessed the story line is hidden beneath way too many graphic sex scenes and not one is in the least bit erotic sick is the more the feeling the director seemed to be going for shock value rather the exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this see it if you can stomach it i still have flashbacks
<START> i wonder who was responsible for this mess the jokes wouldn't have worked for <UNK> island if this had gone to series would there have been jokes about <UNK> or would eva have to replace her <UNK> only to have <UNK> suggest the kind that seats 50 another post compared this show to i love lucy the problem with this is that lucille ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situations and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence br br after the damage the <UNK> did to england and the number of people they killed i would think the very concept of a comedy about hitler would seem <UNK> and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced
<START> my comment would have been added to the release date section but i couldn't find a place for it i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the u s in <UNK> 1955 i saw it in a first run theater in washington d c in march 1958 wonder if it was re released or some problem in my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters john <UNK> does a bang up job as a corrupt judge <UNK> thief walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier and in my opinion james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again the photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty six minutes
<START> i watch bad movies br br this movie is not good enough to be a bad movie not an ounce of humor not an ounce of talent throughout br br i am lazy br br usually i see a bad movie and curse this was so bad i actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess i fell victim to br br i am <UNK> my copy of this movie br br it's too lame even to use clear a room so boring watch <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> shock <UNK> for absolute crap that has some merit as entertainment this <UNK> looks awful is awful and whoever made it should feel awful
<START> this is a typical 70's soft core sex romp in the russ meyer genre though perhaps less outlandish than some of <UNK> work this film has higher <UNK> <UNK> than many of it's <UNK> suggesting a larger budget it's plot writing and acting are straight out the b zone though of late this film has become a <UNK> of b movie channels such as drive in classics in the 500 channel universe if soft core is what you are in the mood for this is as good as anything else in the b range don't expect polanski though <UNK> is just <UNK> nothing more nothing less jennifer welles performance as the mother is perhaps the best of the cast none of the actors in the film went on to greater fame <UNK> <UNK> of a young american housewife is far from the worst example of it's kind it is watchable if this is your type of film 30 years ago this would have been an avant garde and <UNK> film you can see more or less the same kind of thing on showtime hbo series these days and in prime time
<START> note to george <UNK> and others the mystery science theater 3000 riff is i don't think so <UNK> br br my favorite riff is why were you looking at his <UNK> simply for the complete absurdity that and right well did not over all i would say we must give credit to the mst3k crew for trying to <UNK> this tv movie you really can't make much fun of the dialog bill s was a good playwright on the other hand this production is so bad that even he would <UNK> it a junior high school drama club could do better br br i would recommend that you buy a book and read <UNK>
<START> jewish newspaper reporter justin timberlake as joshua josh <UNK> is puzzled when a courtroom <UNK> <UNK> thank you to <UNK> officer ll cool j as <UNK> deed as he leaves the witness stand in the opening sequences of this film you are given the explanation you will see mr cool <UNK> <UNK> detective partner dylan mcdermott as frances <UNK> <UNK> decide not to murder <UNK> <UNK> wayans as <UNK> charles the cops in the city of edison are so corrupt they shoot their suspects steal their money and <UNK> their <UNK> whether he's out to impress his girlfriend <UNK> called <UNK> or win a <UNK> the city's corruption does not sit well with the noble mr timberlake br br timberlake decides to investigate the corruption which reaches both unexpected scope and life threatening levels of danger writer director david j burke keeps the film above water but just barely ll cool j beats timberlake in the pop star to movie star <UNK> aka the <UNK> to actor progression mr mcdermott has fun with his role <UNK> <UNK> to the proceedings are <UNK> supporting actors morgan freeman as <UNK> <UNK> and kevin spacey as <UNK> wallace f r a t means first response assault and <UNK> but it's more important to know that edison force stars justin timberlake and ll cool j not morgan freeman and kevin spacey who seems lost br br edison 9 17 <UNK> david j burke justin timberlake ll cool j morgan freeman dylan mcdermott
<START> romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe how to lose friends alienate people the underlying romance in the plot is for the most part <UNK> by a far more interesting <UNK> to <UNK> tale although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed in several screen shots it does have a sense of getting the <UNK> gritty out of the way focusing on those key relationships which make office politics and using those almost irrelevant scenes used purely for comic effect yet it works so well especially with pegg in the front seat the film is ultimately very clever playing well on the <UNK> atlantic relationship pegg shares with his co stars and <UNK> the cross between the high and low life society quite well and quite <UNK> in a storyline that despite predictability is somewhat of a unique journey the different characters in the film are presented well and casting is definitely a plus point on the film both the <UNK> places relationship between pegg and huston and the love hate relationship between pegg and dunst do work so well in a story that is for want of a better word charming even fox whose main asset is of course sex appeal shocks with what turns out to be quite a dark character and acts that bimbo role all to well its one of these films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work from <UNK> <UNK> to an amazing soundtrack it all <UNK> nicely into what can only be described as clever comedy
<START> gorgeous bodies gorgeous colors and camera work pretentious dialog banal plot the name of the <UNK> donna <UNK> and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from <UNK> novel la dame <UNK> <UNK> the movie <UNK> starring garbo and i think robert taylor and last but not least <UNK> opera la <UNK> beautiful not too <UNK> young ladies social <UNK> for one reason or another loved split up reunited just in time to die of <UNK> in the last scene one <UNK> banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera but why waste <UNK> don sutherland a beautiful rendition of la in the 30s a <UNK> ex <UNK> <UNK> that conveniently kills the other woman and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there isn't even any beautiful singing
<START> frank <UNK> 'the home <UNK> is one of the more lifeless private <UNK> shorts a series of cartoons made as <UNK> films for the military rather than have <UNK> take some <UNK> actions leading to disaster 'the home <UNK> instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too <UNK> realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy it's a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead <UNK> plays the <UNK> card more heavily extended jokes involving <UNK> and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief the result is a well meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical <UNK>
<START> have i ever seen a film more shockingly inept i can think of plenty that equal this one but none which manage to <UNK> it the cast are all horrible stereotypes <UNK> with flat dialogue i am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot but by the <UNK> that this project could easily <UNK> their career even the many charms of ms diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this avoid it's obviously a style of film that americans haven't really got a grasp of watch the final result if you must and you'll see what i'm talking about but don't say i didn't warn you
<START> that was great fun i never read those <UNK> <UNK> comics but it's not necessary to know them maybe there were some inside jokes i didn't figure out but what the eye doesn't see the heart cannot <UNK> over this is such an ironic colourful film and the actors are good <UNK> all together the setting is similar to that in the <UNK> movies but not as dark and grey okay the story is not so original but there is a plot which is not self evident and a more or less surprising ending br br with this movie you could play an interesting game if you watch it with friends don't watch the credits at the beginning and then look who's the <UNK> to find out who are the famous actors under their make up
<START> what a delightful romp  a very competently made film that has so much charm and a <UNK> factor that a lot of romantic comedies lack einstein is brilliantly acted by walter matthau while meg <UNK> catherine is unforgettable  better than i have seen her in those films opposite tom hanks  as the young <UNK> struggling to be recognized br br you don't need to be a young woman to understand <UNK> struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through <UNK> tim robbins mind in pursuing his true love there's universal appeal in these emotions even if i q keeps it all light fun and tied up nicely br br sure it's not heavy but if you look there are some <UNK> people remember albert einstein as a scientist yet he was a great <UNK> his <UNK> such as something along the lines of <UNK> it is not impossible then why do it ' suggest he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond one's immediate grasp in this film there are questions of what an accident really is  such as whether albert and his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> catherine away from stiff upper lip <UNK> james stephen <UNK>  who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you cannot help but feel for his lack of feeling counts how much <UNK> happens in our lives that we do not see and comes across as <UNK> br br and of course we'd like to think in real life despite what we often observe of the people we know that we <UNK> get the <UNK> and <UNK> have to learn how to <UNK> the <UNK> in their <UNK> how nice to know that it might work out in i q 's innocent and <UNK> exclusively <UNK> <UNK> era land of make believe
<START> a mock documentary about a pair of canadian producers bobby myers matthew <UNK> and paul <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> trying to make their first film in the late 1970s hollywood north is the comic tale of their struggle to pull everything together despite a number of <UNK> threads br br hollywood north works as a film in a way very similar to why this is spinal tap 1984 works so well namely although exaggerated in some ways it is very close to the truth and the truth consists of behind the scenes facts that are very different than the public face of the industry it isn't easy to make a film and it must have been especially difficult in canada in the late 1970s films involve <UNK> if not hundreds of people many have <UNK> desires motivations and personalities especially crucial are the <UNK> and the on screen talent as if either drops out or becomes <UNK> at any stage while the film is in production it could <UNK> the whole affair either <UNK> extensive <UNK> or <UNK> the film altogether br br so it's not surprising that hollywood north focuses on those kinds of relationships the result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time the script is flawless and the performances are top notch this is a must see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of film making it should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a <UNK> of intelligence and a sense of humor br br a 10 out of 10 from me
<START> this was a strange kind of film about a low <UNK> in new york city and <UNK> around a main character the title name played by brad pitt who thinks <UNK> a ricky nelson type musician except he has no real talent br br it's kind of fun to watch until a <UNK> tough new york city type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over that ruined the film for me it must have been catherine <UNK> who usually plays tough and garbage mouthed women br br the <UNK> on pitt an exaggerated <UNK> was fun to look at i can picture johnny <UNK> playing this role better one last note it odd to hear a film made in 1992 other than woody allen's with just <UNK> sound
<START> i have had the chance to watch several movies in <UNK> and <UNK> dvd this movie stays to it's wonderful action and great story although if you are looking for a movie with an excellent picture this one is not it not having this movie on dvd helped make the purchase easier i have always enjoyed the intense action and the excellent acting which don't always go together overall that is what makes this an excellent fun film to watch now on the <UNK> ray scale in many <UNK> ray movies you either get two things a picture that is almost crystal clear with no <UNK> or a movie with grainy <UNK> picture i was disappointed when i made this my first <UNK> ray movie i almost began to think that this was a <UNK> ray standard although after watching other movies i know better i don't believe they spent as much time as they should have <UNK> this movie over to <UNK> that is generally the problem with some movies and for the price of <UNK> ray players and the blue ray <UNK> you should only have the best picture so i only consider this a worthwhile investment for people who have either never seen the movie or have not bought the dvd version
<START> spoilers the film sniper is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary us marine sniper carlos <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> soft spoken mister rogers look alike who ran up a score of as much as 300 confirmed and <UNK> <UNK> and north <UNK> military kills during his two <UNK> in <UNK> which shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is br br tom berenger is cool <UNK> and deadly as sgt thomas <UNK> who's at the end of his career as a top us marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a <UNK> will be pointless since there's nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the us marines unless he decides to become a mob hit man <UNK> reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country br br the story of the film sniper is focused on sgt <UNK> with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver <UNK> and us government agent richard miller billy zane being sent deep inside the <UNK> jungle the two <UNK> are to take out rebel general <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> drug king pin <UNK> <UNK> carlos <UNK> who's supporting him in a planned a military take over of the country br br we see earlier in the movie sgt <UNK> scope and take out a rebel leader which i feel was the best scene in sniper for it shows step by step how sgt <UNK> with the help of his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> young does his job there's also a sub plot that was later <UNK> in the movie about a rebel sniper <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who was stalking <UNK> and who later killed <UNK> as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter you would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would <UNK> when the movie ended but sgt <UNK> had no trouble at all in <UNK> <UNK> early in the film by using an unsuspecting miller as bait br br what hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a rambo like ending with sgt <UNK> and agent miller fighting off an entire <UNK> of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a london fog br br sniper is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been <UNK> in war movies a <UNK> killer who kills with the <UNK> and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished <UNK> and who does it in total <UNK>
<START> i loved this movie when i saw it on <UNK> 3rd i knew i had to buy it it comes out to buy on july <UNK> it has cool deaths scenes hot girls great cast good story good acting great slasher film the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls see this movies
<START> i usually check out the mtv movie awards to watch a witty entertaining show that delivers a unique award show <UNK> winning a life time achievement award as example so this year was no different while i'm not a fan of justin timberlake <UNK> william scott has always been funny <UNK> stupid to me i've laughed at <UNK> in both american pie movies and even enjoyed him in dude where's my car but the mtv movie awards were simply horrible nothing was <UNK> humorous or entertaining justin timberlake should stick to singing and dancing he sure as hell can't act br br i'm curious as to who the writers were for this show last year's performance by jack black and sarah michelle <UNK> was <UNK> funny the lord of the rings parody alone was worth watching the entire show but this year was <UNK> different did anyone understand <UNK> comments regarding luke wilson and kate hudson they're staring in a movie together but have never met here they are where was the joke kate and luke just went into their lame dialogue never making a reference to the joke by timberlake and <UNK> was <UNK> wasted as a talent not even causing me to smile yet alone laugh and what was the point of harrison ford's one liners did they make any sense to anyone perhaps the mtv writers figured the young viewers would only know the aging ford as han solo <UNK> jones or the president from air force one i'm <UNK> and would someone tell me the deal with adrian <UNK> how old is this guy and how old does he think he is the guy looks 30 trying to act 19 again give it up show some class like in your best actor academy award speech and act your age br br i give this show 1 star out of 4 simply because of the speech by <UNK> for best visual performance this was very creative extremely well done and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening
<START> this film should have been fun a young <UNK> thompson a young <UNK> phoenix and terry <UNK> in space but it dragged on had <UNK> characters and had no target audience br br some kids go to a space camp and are accidentally launched into space by a robot friend of theirs named appropriately <UNK> the space scenes are then long repetitive the same accident happens twice and either cheesy or frightening depending on your point of view adults will be bored and <UNK> out kids might be scared as the way this was filmed really leaves an eerie sense about it br br there is a budding romance but unlike the <UNK> this never takes off why it is included in the first place is unclear except maybe to add extra tension between the characters but it failed if that was the idea br br a young <UNK> thompson should be quirky and attractive right i mean back to the future is great but no she was irritating and average looking not someone you'd want to date have as a friend or even consider as a role model <UNK> phoenix he's really lucky he ever appeared in movies again this performance maybe he can act like <UNK> in the life <UNK> commercials but he doesn't seem to know how to be a normal boy he doesn't fit in on screen and i don't think we can identify with him at home i actually would have been happier if he had never returned to earth br br i don't recommend this film to anyone
<START> first a quick <UNK> up ' to those saying this movie stinks you can't go to every movie expecting <UNK> <UNK> this was actually a fun movie jason lee is good in everything he does the only flaw in this movie is i don't think there was enough <UNK> between lee and julia stiles they should have <UNK> more on that other than that the movie is good fun <UNK> blair needs to eat something she's worrying me but she still looks beautiful so yes i recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun go see br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> it's possible that a man called <UNK> might have been done <UNK> damage on the cutting room floor maybe someone will demand a director's cut one day but i seriously doubt it br br james garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in doing so brought a whole lot of americans over to fill the cast out folks like dennis weaver claude <UNK> john <UNK> and of course we have <UNK> <UNK> who both wrote and directed this film br br garner always gets cast as likable <UNK> because he's so darn good at playing them but he has played serious and done it well in films like the children's hour and hour of the gun he can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully but a man called <UNK> can't be counted as one of his <UNK> br br he's got the title role as <UNK> <UNK> notorious outlaw with a big price on his head after partner tony young gets killed in a saloon and garner takes appropriate eastwood style <UNK> he's followed from the saloon by john <UNK> br br <UNK> spent time in the nearby <UNK> prison and it seems as though gold <UNK> are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks <UNK> the stuff on a regular run garner gets his gang together for a heist br br here's where the movie goes totally off the wall usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of <UNK> planning certainly that was the case in the war <UNK> which some other reviewer <UNK> but in this one garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake us <UNK> dennis weaver and cause a <UNK> at which time the gold will be robbed br br that was just too much to swallow if taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before but i will say for those who like the blood and guts of italian westerns during that prison break there's enough there for three movies br br that's not the whole thing of course the <UNK> fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends but by that time the whole film has lost a lot of <UNK> br br the great movie singer of the thirties allan jones is listed in the credits but for the life of me i can't find him in the film maybe a chorus of the <UNK> <UNK> might have made this better br br couldn't have hurt any
<START> how truly friendly charming and <UNK> is this <UNK> old serial i <UNK> in seeing old lugosi it is <UNK> friendly and lively it's the document of a <UNK> craft the best tv series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials <UNK> is deeply deeply optimistic and <UNK> it <UNK> the mind it's not stupid stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work <UNK> has an irresistible sense of simple <UNK> and friendly fun br br without giving away too <UNK> is an <UNK> <UNK> who goes also by this eastern name and who also loves and <UNK> his niece against a <UNK> of killers br br <UNK> <UNK> his supernatural gifts in a rather <UNK> and <UNK> way br br as to the quite sexy niece <UNK> she is kidnapped by the priest of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the poor sexy girl is in fact <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> after being sent asleep with a flower almost kidnapped from a boat by a phony policeman the temple of <UNK> and its strange creepy <UNK> resemble the king kong <UNK> are a <UNK> mockery of the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br would you protect a girl as <UNK> as <UNK> does br br lugosi looked like an old <UNK> and quite heartless mean drunk and this only contributed to his performances he is the <UNK> mean drunk uncle mischievous and cunning and <UNK> this might sound like a rather crooked homage to <UNK> <UNK> biopic of wood left me this impression about lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the <UNK> actor i enjoy <UNK> fancy performances br br this serial is <UNK> <UNK>
<START> raising victor vargas is just a bad film no amount of denial or ad dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact br br maybe peter <UNK> saw he didn't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that <UNK> apes the <UNK> of current edgy film making maybe he just doesn't know any better it's hard to tell br br what's not hard to tell is the result except for a few viewers who will <UNK> the bad film making into an attempt at pseudo realism few will enjoy it br br i know i didn't br br do yourselves a favor and pass on this film
<START> mel <UNK> braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film but it left a sour taste in the mouth rob roy by contrast is slightly less polished but a better film by far this is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values whereas braveheart put a gross and unpleasant <UNK> <UNK> on an ancient tale what makes this film is the cast liam neeson plays the hero in a role he basically <UNK> in a watered down fashion in the phantom menace the character is heroic but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover admirable yet human he <UNK> the screen against him are set a selection of equally human <UNK> including tim <UNK> cunningham obnoxious but brilliant and john <UNK> morally <UNK> <UNK> also to praise is jessica lange as <UNK> <UNK> wife also strong and noble but 300 years away from a modern heroine which is only as it should be this is not the most original film you will see but it has the courage of its own <UNK> and the strong performances make you care
<START> <UNK> to lose friends alienate <UNK> is a superb film a hilarious film from start to end a lovely entertainer enjoyed it <UNK> up br br performances jason is fantastic he's a treat to watch him from start to end jeff bridges is excellent as the boss he's a legend <UNK> fox looks amazingly hot and deliver a good performance but dude she's so hot man anderson is delightful she doesn't look old at all still hot indeed <UNK> dunst looks lovely and does a pretty good job others are also pretty good br br <UNK> to lose friends alienate <UNK> is a excellent entertainer don't miss this flick
<START> once in a while a movie will <UNK> along that <UNK> you draws you in <UNK> you and in the end leaves you with a <UNK> belief in the human race from the artistry form this is not it this is an action movie that lacks convincing action it stinks rent something else
<START> <UNK> high is a cartoon comedy it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that <UNK> <UNK> satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the <UNK> to survive <UNK> the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately <UNK> at high a classic line inspector i'm here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to <UNK> high i expect that many adults of my age think that <UNK> high is far fetched what a pity that it isn't
<START> now let me tell you about this movie this movie is my favorite movie this movie has excellent combat fighting this movie does sound like a silly story line about how jet li plays a super hero like spider man or etc but once you've seen this movie you would probably want to see it again and again i rate this movie 10 10
<START> deeply emotional it can't leave you neutral br br yes it's a love story between 2 18 years old boys but it's only the body of this movie and it's been removed you only feel what happened with these boys you feel the soul of the movie with of course some action some sex but this is no pornography too many feelings br br it was only a summer story and it became from love to hate almost to death the most important time of their lives i loved it you will too whatever your feelings are
<START> i came across an <UNK> nightmare while looking for offbeat independent films and glad to say it did not disappoint this crazy half hour ride had me wondering all the way through and the ending was excellent one of those <UNK> moments that really stays with you i've shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree hands down the little <UNK> girl was very talented and i think her performance stole the show she <UNK> the heck out of me i can say that much <UNK> did a great job putting this short together all the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she's a great writer from what she did with this script so well written it's undoubtedly the strongest part of the film the directing was great and the acting was enjoyable but the most important factor here is the strength of the screenplay good job to this girl i can't wait to see more
<START> this film <UNK> from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesn't it's flat self conscious unimaginative and tedious br br a series of set images and backdrops don't make a film they make a <UNK> this kind of pitiful <UNK> pseudo drama documentary it's true it really happened not only fails to entertain it fails to convince so it doesn't even function as social history clichés co <UNK> with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional never developing to the extent that one feels for them the director's ego is the largest character in this film
<START> what you were not aware that scooby doo <UNK> zombies well you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by victor <UNK> who had also directed white zombie four years earlier that would probably make it the second zombie film made br br no don't go looking for dorothy stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie films and don't even look for any brains being eaten this is 1936 you know br br so what you will see is typical of the period lots of talking br br you do get to see dean jagger twelve <UNK> high and bela <UNK> eyes but that is about it zombies in cambodia indeed
<START> when i was a kid i totally loved both bill ted movies the other night bogus journey was on and since it was at least 5 years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years <UNK> <UNK> is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the <UNK> are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way plus it features the coolest <UNK> of death ever in a movie <UNK> totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station
<START> i don't understand your <UNK> to this movie it is a taut thrilling <UNK> of the character created in basic instinct the only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic is the fact that sharon <UNK> character is still alive and not in jail at this late date br br spoiler alert as the movie progresses we are presented with three theories of what is going on 1 sharon <UNK> character is killing all these people because she's crazy risk addicted 2 david <UNK> crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame sharon <UNK> character 3 david <UNK> <UNK> is killing these people for revenge what <UNK> most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever <UNK> as the real story although the <UNK> is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop the only killing that occurs on screen br br i think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of 2001 a space odyssey who cares what is real the blonde really is crazy the cop really is crooked and the <UNK> really wants revenge what's important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story like real life everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie get over it
<START> big s isn't playing with <UNK> or forcing an agenda like say <UNK> or <UNK> though i like them both she states the obvious in subtle near <UNK> remarks her show won't change the world nor is it meant to but along with the hilarious brian <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ex boyfriend jay <UNK> of mr show fame this is one mean show with an <UNK> for destruction my <UNK> were thoroughly <UNK> by the first episode look i love this woman and like her famed boyfriend jimmy <UNK> she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run with it the best kind of comedy around <UNK> anything and anyone like mary <UNK> in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense this one is highly recommended but only for those who still have a funny bone and didn't lose it in their most recent <UNK> <UNK> treatment or <UNK> job
<START> this extremely low budget movie is compared to the great classic silent night deadly night since it is labeled as a slasher flick first let me say that i think that even silent night part 2 is better than this that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie christmas evil tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insane a strong word slowly very slowly he is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of christmas and at work he can't stand how the <UNK> toys are made with such lack of quality and love dressed up as santa he finally goes on a killing spree also a strong word since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects no tension no thrills no gore no cast for one exception that is jeffrey <UNK> is in it he is best known for playing aside tom hanks as one of the guards in the classic the green mile he still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role he truly is the only one who really can act his supporting role is better than the main lead who also isn't that bad but if you're overshadowed by a little supporting character you're not great either and what about that strange ending you have to see it to believe it christmas evil is downright boring nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading this is not a slasher you wanna see a real christmas slasher check out the all time greatest silent night deadly night
<START> this movie was the worst i've ever seen br br it doesn't seem to have a plot but the time you realize this is far beyond the beginning of the movie so you have to watch the shut for a long time to recognize the total incompetence of the director aka the <UNK> that plays the <UNK> chick in the movie and we do not believe the willem dafoe in this movie he's a clone because the real dafoe like we know from apocalypse now and the <UNK> <UNK> saints would never agreed to such a script br br duh da <UNK> wrote this bill shut together with his twenty years minus baby this movie starts with the credits of the two main characters dafoe and <UNK> and then the two script writers dafoe and <UNK> and then the director <UNK> br br <UNK> the story widow meets guy guy <UNK> widow widow <UNK> <UNK> with guy who <UNK> her br br title in <UNK> the black widow different title same <UNK> br br do not watch this movie it's a total <UNK> of time
<START> this film is one giant <UNK> load paul <UNK> is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay and his directing is about as <UNK> as it can be without his actually having been <UNK> during the process br br the worst though is woody <UNK> whom i <UNK> like when he's properly cast he plays the walker a homosexual man in d c who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite he couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and <UNK> around in front of the camera on a <UNK> stick his southern accent is that off the rack version that <UNK> from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers as though the heat and <UNK> of the south is still <UNK> him of every ounce of energy he has it is monotonous but his is not the worst accent in the movie his boyfriend played by <UNK> <UNK> attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him he is incapable of rolling his <UNK> in spite of the fact that in real life he is german and speaks several languages one of them being italian that's kind of a good reason to cast someone else don't ya think br br from the story to the screenplay to the directing to the camera work to the performances by the leads this movie is bad from beginning to end the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses lily <UNK> lauren bacall and <UNK> scott thomas only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in <UNK> in fact all three are excellent in spite of being trapped in a really bad film <UNK> no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws if you like these three actresses watch them in something else this movie is not worth your time
<START> spoiler alert this movie zero day gives an inside to the lives of two students andre and <UNK> who feel <UNK> and hatred for anyone and anything associated with there school br br they go on a series of self thought out missions all leading up to the huge mission which is zero day zero days <UNK> are not <UNK> until the middle to the end of the movie the viewer knows its serious and filled with hate but is never quite sure until the end br br now we all know if the movie is based on the <UNK> massacre the ending is pretty obvious and the ending is no different than any other movie about the attack they go and kill many of their fellow students in the end br br i have seen a lot of movies on this attack and this movie by far is my favorite and most respected it gives the viewer and inside look to the lives of these two teens who hate life and honestly it gives the viewer some what of an understanding and a closure on the horrible event br br being only 7 when the events played out i never knew the seriousness of the shootings until my english class was assigned an <UNK> or story on a defining moment in our generation well i knew everyone was going to pick the twin towers but i wanted to be different because of course the twin towers was tragic and very defining but i didn't think it was the right choice for me because there was really no way of relating to that because i was only in the 3rd grade and i had no idea what it all meant but the shootings did leave and effect i remember the interviews the sky views of the school and the hurt and terror in the eyes of thousands of people br br this movie is a compelling down to earth and horrific masterpiece and i would <UNK> it to anyone
<START> <UNK> there ain't <UNK> in room <UNK> but you ain't got no business <UNK> in there anyway so stay out you understand stay out br br never has there been such a feat of psychological horror as this film achieves this is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so jack nicholson is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances in cinema br br its about a family moving to an isolated and deserted hotel for 5 months over the winter then the father jack becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel br br <UNK> direction is nothing short then perfect the tense tracking shots <UNK> music mystical messages and <UNK> plot makes this the best horror film ever made br br throughout the film there is constant references to danger death and horror red is used in every scene is the red <UNK> put in by kubrick of course br br this is a definitive kubrick classic and this is the third of his films i have given 10 10 he is a <UNK> in his direction and you can see it in all his films he loves to <UNK> his <UNK> in everyone of his films br br i will be talking about this film for months to come it has <UNK> depth br br in conclusion this is the <UNK> of horror and tension a masterpiece of terror 10 10
<START> after watching two of his silent shorts <UNK> and her men 1956 ' is my first feature length film from french director jean <UNK> and i quite enjoyed it however i didn't watch the film for <UNK> but for star ingrid bergman who  at age <UNK>  still <UNK> <UNK> beauty <UNK> and charm throughout the early 1950s following her <UNK> marriage to italian <UNK> <UNK> bergman <UNK> fell out of public favour her next five films directed by her husband were <UNK> in the united states and i suspect that <UNK> latest release did little to enhance <UNK> popularity with english speaking audiences however she did regain her former success with an oscar in the same year's <UNK> 1956 ' she stars as <UNK> <UNK> a polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere before promptly <UNK> them while working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished general <UNK> <UNK> jean <UNK> she finds herself falling into a love that she won't be able to walk away from this vaguely political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy as long as you don't take it too seriously it's purely lighthearted romantic fluff br br filmed in vibrant technicolor <UNK> and her <UNK> looks terrific as well a <UNK> of bright colours characters and costumes <UNK> polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self absorbed not in an unlikable way but hardly a woman of high principles and <UNK> she is <UNK> by a team of bumbling government <UNK> to convince general <UNK> to stage a coup <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his love for her in order to satisfy her own <UNK> as a guardian angel perhaps the film's only <UNK> <UNK> character is <UNK> de <UNK> mel <UNK> then audrey <UNK> husband who ignores everybody else's selfish secondary motives and <UNK> <UNK> for love and love alone this <UNK> proudly suggests is what the true french do best <UNK> and her <UNK> also attempts with <UNK> success to expose the <UNK> of upper class french <UNK> through the clumsy <UNK> of <UNK> jacques <UNK> who can't make love to his servant mistress without his <UNK> walking in on them for these sequences <UNK> was obviously trying for the <UNK> sort of humour that you might find in a marx brothers film but the film itself is so relaxed and laid back that the energy just isn't there
<START> well i like to be honest with all the audiences that i bought it because of <UNK> sex scenes but unfortunately i did not see much of them all sex scenes were short and done in <UNK> manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other b movies it just doesn't look much like two people having sex there is a tiny bit of plot toward the end <UNK> new lover is a killer <UNK> how shocking why don't we <UNK> this movie for oscar award i can't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were r rated mine is <UNK> from uk rated 18 conclusion put it down and walk away so <UNK> won't end up with being a moron like me br br score 2 10
<START> given the low budget and production limitations this movie is very good it is plausible realistic and shows how the <UNK> hungarian <UNK> who lived on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their lives to save a <UNK> american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis we are drawn into strong feelings for the young <UNK> yet highly courageous boy who <UNK> the american pilot if you're looking for special effects superman heroes and magical endings this movie is not for you if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the <UNK> amoral nazis and their lack of compassion then you will be enthralled by this movie i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses dogs and humble helpful people who value freedom and those who <UNK> to that end this movie will be one you'll remember for a long time
<START> just watched it on sky tv missed the first half an hour i did wonder if it was a true story so watched it to the end there was no brief at the end to say what happened to everyone it did remind me of speed but at the end of the day i don't suppose it was released at the cinema as we did see the following error the goof that we saw was that they remove the <UNK> hood and then later on there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the <UNK> is back on it did have me on the edge of my seat especially when i thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge wasn't going to be <UNK> and then it was i'm afraid i did burst into tears so it wasn't that bad
<START> sort of like a very primitive episode of general hospital set in a <UNK> ward and one for tough cases at that this fast moving <UNK> has a satisfying emotional impact mainly because eric <UNK> as the <UNK> young husband in the main plot is so <UNK> a wreck and with such good reason his <UNK> wife loretta young is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20 year prison sentence for <UNK> a <UNK> who probably had it coming to him ms young as always doesn't do anything to <UNK> audience sympathy and she's a little too good to be true though sympathetic and lovely to look at of course her difficult <UNK> and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie and the outcome not an entirely happy one feels right <UNK> <UNK> one of the <UNK> few perfect actresses in the apt words of film <UNK> david <UNK> exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse and glenda farrell as a none too willing new mom of twins gets to <UNK> frankie and johnny as a drunken <UNK> frank <UNK> figures in another subplot and he gets to show more range than <UNK> usually <UNK> him it's <UNK> and paced <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> dad panic stays with you for days this sort of part was often played for laughs but he's a terrified young kid in trouble and very <UNK>
<START> i remember when this piece of trash came out all the <UNK> were <UNK> about how it had taken barbra streisand years to get the film made well it couldn't have taken that many years the play only opened in 1975 eight years previously it made a broadway star of the great actress <UNK> <UNK> who probably should have been cast in the film but <UNK> the great star barbra had to do it her way and with music no less this film is a total disaster from start to finish for one thing barbra was forty years old when she made it and she looked every minute of it there was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study <UNK> and then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy i get the impression that streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make up she is <UNK> as a boy than she is as a girl and as if that is not bad enough she gets involved with both her <UNK> <UNK> mandy <UNK> whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end and his fiancée amy irving who does her usual <UNK> routine a bit of <UNK> the poor woman always <UNK> to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing <UNK> even goes so far as to marry the girl i won't even bother to mention the wedding night scene br br then there is the music nine totally forgettable songs all sung by streisand via voice over presumably as a look inside her mind and each one as <UNK> and irritating as <UNK> on a <UNK> br br i won't say that streisand does not show a <UNK> of promise as a director here some of the visuals are lovely <UNK> <UNK> especially and she has a good eye for balance the problem with this movie is that she won't get out of her own way i did not believe her for one second in the title role she should never have added the songs and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes i was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty five minutes br br awful awful awful
<START> oh this is such a glorious musical there's a bit of <UNK> frank sinatra is sorely miscast as the jewish nathan detroit though it only becomes evident on sue me which is a distinctly jewish song sadly the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show marry the man today and replaced it with an inferior sinatra <UNK> with these two flaws in mind the movie is otherwise magnificent jean simmons shines as sarah brown marlon brando can't sing worth <UNK> but pulls it off anyway <UNK> <UNK> wonderfully <UNK> his broadway role it was written for him damon <UNK> language and pacing and humor come through quite well this is on my see it every chance i get list
<START> a nightmare on elm street the dream child the fifth installment in the nightmare on elm street series and the worst sequel ever in the series even worse than a nightmare on elm street 2 i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street dvd box set for my birthday and i watched all the sequels the dream child was the worst without a doubt i was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels but i guess they just lost the charm the story was just <UNK> and i wasn't happy with where it went alice just became more annoying she's not nancy or kirsten so her carrying this film on her own didn't work for me freddy is also <UNK> his scare this was just getting a bit silly br br alice is back and she's carrying a child she couldn't be happier with her life but freddy is also back and he's not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie but anyways he wants her child and to be born into the world again did you ever wonder if freddy had parents too well that's what a nightmare on elm street the dream child <UNK> and alice soon finds out what freddy's childhood was like and that maybe that's the one thing that can defeat him br br a nightmare on elm street the dream child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series i don't think anyone could be happy with this sequel just the story was really silly i mean it could have possibly worked but once again it was just executed the wrong way i know that if you're looking to see the sequels for the nightmare on elm street series you should watch it but i really wouldn't recommend it it's not worth it at least in my opinion br br 3 10
<START> this film was not nearly as much of a chore as i expected it to be there are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore <UNK> conspiracy paranoia fest most of the acting is mediocre but fairly typical for 1970s style stuff <UNK> with pregnant pauses a photographer and a model witness some strange goings on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings on flying <UNK> are spotted more people disappear but is it the aliens or our own <UNK> ultra secret group of cover up guys soon enough a reporter and a <UNK> apparently <UNK> on the character of the writer director are drawn into this <UNK> fiasco and become the target of the ultra secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless then the fun really begins br br the movie predictably makes about as much sense as the average <UNK> conspiracy theory but should be <UNK> for taking itself so seriously the camera work is ok for a low budget film the pacing is pretty good the script is silly and absurd and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for what are the few seconds of brilliance i mentioned honestly i can't say much you without writing a spoiler suffice to say that the end of the film is at least worth fast <UNK> to if you can't take the middle
<START> i saw the movie last night here at home but i thought it was too long first of all second the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before the things isn't funny in the movie fiancé hitting his girlfriend <UNK> the movie was way too long talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture like the lady singing i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here come on perry you can do better then this
<START> i think micheal <UNK> acting career must be over if he has to star in this sort of low <UNK> crap surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish br br this movie could be far better if it had a good budget but it shows repeatedly through out the movie there is one scene at a <UNK> which looks like its outside the front of a <UNK> station and i bet it was br br there is one scene which made give this movie a 3 and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake surrounded by <UNK> this was well done but the rest of the movie forget it br br there is another scene which looks like a <UNK> plant which i bet it and does not look like a space <UNK> as the character say it is br br this movie is stupid has a serious low budget makes no sense and god help micheal <UNK>
<START> somewhere buried very deep inside this film is a half way decent movie trying to get out the only <UNK> are a few early scenes in los angeles in a bar and a graveyard and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design like i say buried very deep one of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react <UNK> in unbelievable situations annie <UNK> reaction to being told that her sister presumably dee wallace from the first movie is was a werewolf is if i recall along the lines of oh really not one of the better <UNK> to said challenge the non <UNK> continue as the story moves to <UNK> in search of <UNK> the apparently self <UNK> queen of the werewolves as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the two best things in the movie yes even better than the werewolf group sex scene <UNK> <UNK> acting and the oddly <UNK> looking werewolf suits the end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory at least until the <UNK> finds them on youtube check them out to see why and remember the whole film makes about the same amount of sense if you happen to catch this on us television the credits have been re edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of <UNK> ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot of her ripping open a cloak only this time she has some kind of top on underneath it's a sort of absurdity <UNK> on top moment which defies satire
<START> interesting hardly the <UNK> <UNK> the movie provides for its point which is <UNK> that jews are a cancer is so stupid and lame it's almost laughable if we didn't know what happened in that era br br important <UNK> i can't imagine germans even at that horrid time would like or believe this movie compare it to <UNK> <UNK> des <UNK> now that was i movie i was impressed with this is just silly garbage br br <UNK> part is a scene from m one of my all time favorites where the jew as the <UNK> so <UNK> keeps reminding us lorre plays a child <UNK> and murderer in the eyes of these film makers only a <UNK> mind can do so uh huh didn't know m was hitler's favorite movie right br br no it's just plain stupid even for it's nazi propaganda genre 2 10
<START> this movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete <UNK> of perspective so i was hooked by the time the title came on the theme of this movie is that everyone is acting trying to re <UNK> themselves but not in a <UNK> way like identity or the usual suspects but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting the scenes in the chicken <UNK> are spectacular at one point <UNK> who owns the chicken farm <UNK> a <UNK> in laughing where he's the worst student his <UNK> at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself the movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most <UNK> people i see every day there's not a lot of plot here guessing the old man's secret is pretty easy but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out this movie <UNK> to me in the same way that <UNK> did although the characters couldn't be more <UNK>
<START> this movie is awful at the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can't get back the twist ending is very contrived the character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion ninety minutes of <UNK> with the premise that the rob lowe character will die on christmas eve is explained away in literally ninety seconds of no we were just <UNK> you then the rob lowe character is not even upset about it i will forgive you if you can forgive me is as upset as he gets if someone took weeks to convince me i was about to die and then said no sorry just <UNK> you i would raise some serious hell i don't feel bad about giving away the spoiler because i might be able to save some of you out there from watching please save yourself and don't watch this movie
<START> disney goes to the well one too many times as anybody who has seen the original little mermaid will feel blatantly ripped off celebrating the birth of their daughter melody ariel and eric plan on introducing her to king <UNK> the celebration is quickly crashed by ursula 's sister morgana who plans to use melody as a defense tool to get the king 's <UNK> stopping the attack ariel and eric build a wall around the ocean while melody grows up wondering why she cannot go in there br br awful and terrible is what describes this direct to video sequel little mermaid 2 gives you that feeling everything you watch seemed to have come straight other disney movies i guess disney can only <UNK> itself do not tell me that the penguin and <UNK> does not remind you of another duo from the lion king br br other disappointing moments include the <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> the royal chef they terribly under played it the climax between morgana and everyone seemed to be another disappointment br br i will not give anything away but in 75 minutes everything seemed incredibly <UNK> and too much to handle an embarrassment to disney little mermaid 2 is better left to rent and laugh at then you can prepare for the rest of the other sequels disney is going to <UNK> you in later on
<START> this was the worst movie i've ever seen in theaters it was just a <UNK> of recycled material people getting hit in the head is not funny people getting kicked is not funny after the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audience member was laughing anymore it just got tired fast br br i went with my younger sister she actually laughs out loud at king of the hill but this cinematic masterpiece bored her i'm not surprised the story is pretty lame a midget thief steals a big diamond in what was definitely the <UNK> heist in hollywood history then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby i know it sounds exciting but that's the whole story say those two lines over and over for 1 5 hours and you'll get the picture there were predictable jokes <UNK> i really felt ripped off after seeing this i wasn't expecting much and i was still disappointed i wish <UNK> would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and or his next script this was even worse than white chicks if that is possible i've seen high school plays that were better and cheaper br br there wasn't anything positive about this movie i don't like my entertainment to be <UNK> down
<START> this incredibly formulaic flick from the walker texas ranger squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a tv movie in addition one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get go however it's a fun little movie that gets the job done it entertains that's all it was meant to do and it does so the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn't half bad the acting is also decent which isn't much of a surprise because everyone knows that chuck norris is no steven seagal if you're a fan of the genre and of walker texas ranger you will definitely love this if not then don't waste your time 8 10
<START> things to come is an early sci fi film that shows an imagined world or <UNK> through 100 years you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts the film <UNK> from 1940 to <UNK> and is mainly about how this <UNK> or the boss wanted to get the <UNK> to fly in <UNK> again after <UNK> was bombed and war broke out br br this film only has about 3 faults it's audio is <UNK> and video had some quirks the characters aren't deep at all and the overall plot isn't altogether solid the plot is lacking something that i can't put my finger on it just seems a little <UNK> but if you love sci fi and are interested in what h g wells though might happened in the next hundred years this is a must see it's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was <UNK> a long drawn out war because they were just about to go to war with germany and there was a threat of <UNK> weapons and everything br br things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once
<START> 'the fox and the <UNK> is the new film by french director luc <UNK> who brought us the oscar winning documentary <UNK> of the <UNK> ' it focuses around a young girl wonderfully played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and her <UNK> friendship with a fox br br there are some truly mesmerizing moments here <UNK> <UNK> about a <UNK> chasing the fox through a snow <UNK> forest one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times however there's simply not quite enough of them br br beautifully shot the cinematography is dazzling the <UNK> kind of look of the film is wonderful it's undeniably a very lush production br br the english version is narrated by kate <UNK> but what little dialogue there already is has been very poorly dubbed the score is also far too <UNK> or at least it is for my liking and the screenplay while subtle seemingly jumps from one scenario to another ultimately leaving me almost <UNK> br br while there's a nice moral at the heart of the film and the rather quiet performance from <UNK> <UNK> is quite lovely the real star is the fox those captivating moments focusing solely around our <UNK> little friend are tremendous however again there's simply not nearly enough of them br br to keep up to date with all the latest in film including reviews news discussions and more be sure to visit www <UNK> com <UNK>
<START> i have no idea what on earth or beyond could have possibly made sam <UNK> believe that this would have been a worthy project to <UNK> ben arthur is one of the worst movies ever made in fact i see no reason why it should not be at 1 on the bottom 100 for although i have not seen for example <UNK> baby geniuses 2 5 at the time of this <UNK> i would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this <UNK> wound because even in its vapid <UNK> at least baby geniuses 2 was <UNK> made by contrast everything and i do mean everything in this film is completely <UNK> br br the movie is intended to be an attack on the christian <UNK> supposed <UNK> and hatred toward gays and i do emphasize intended not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose it also leaves an ugly <UNK> instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay <UNK> struggle against a society that largely <UNK> them it creates tired crass stereotypes of each party involved ben and arthur the <UNK> couple are portrayed as two crude sex <UNK> and hopelessly romantic cardboard <UNK> who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so this meets with the opposition of ben's brother victor a christian minister who like all christians as this movie would have us believe is loud <UNK> stupid and violent he tries to kill ben and arthur after his <UNK> with them get him kicked out of the <UNK> just like in real life and if you think that's dreadful it is you haven't seen it all br br the actors here manage to completely destroy any <UNK> of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were <UNK> a youtube home comedy video but not even daniel day lewis and marlon brando as the title characters could have saved this <UNK> for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote for example in one scene victor tries to complain about not being able to have <UNK> or <UNK> because of his brother's homosexuality but instead of portraying this idea clearly he <UNK> out the stupid utterly confusing whiny sounding line you know what i'm never going to have any <UNK> or <UNK> okay because you're so f ed up br br even more glaring is the complete lack of production values yes i know this ain't the dark knight but even amateur film makers should know some <UNK> about special effects and editing for example six <UNK> of red cake <UNK> do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds people do not <UNK> across a room between takes and objects do not fall forward when shot br br do not waste your money on ben arthur i don't care if you're 7 17 or <UNK> i don't care if you're gay straight <UNK> or <UNK> i don't care if you're just curious i don't care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dung heap stay away far away this movie's only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a <UNK>
