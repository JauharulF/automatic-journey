<START> when i was a kid in the 50's and 60's anything connected with disney was by definition great what happened they are able to get any actors and actresses they want the best of their time but somehow disney manages to screw things up in spite of their <UNK> resources br br disney can afford the best writers the best producers and directors but still they screw things up this movie is crap the sad thing is that i suspect disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad br br it is only due to the talent of the actors that i can even give it a 3 of 10
<START> this one is a little better than the first one it still relies on a lot of its humor which basically keeps saying that the old bond movies were not realistic that wears thin after so many parodies the girls were more interesting in this one br br there is a tremendous amount of total gross out humor hopefully one day real comedy will come back
<START> bill buddy rogers is sent to new york by his uncle richard tucker to experience life before he <UNK> <UNK> his uncle has paid 3 women <UNK> kathryn crawford <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and pauline carole lombard to <UNK> him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold <UNK> one such lady <UNK> <UNK> mitchell turns up on the scene to the <UNK> of the women we follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their <UNK> role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that bill is in new york while bill meets with <UNK> and another woman at the end love is in the air for bill and one other br br the picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film the story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and kathryn crawford has a terrible voice rogers isn't that good either he's pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or <UNK> there is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver <UNK> <UNK> and the film is just dull
<START> saw this movie at the <UNK> <UNK> you may question some decisions of the maker like choosing a <UNK> form for such a sensitive and horrible subject but this movie sure hits you in the gut especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch hope it gets the distribution it deserves
<START> well now this was certainly a surprise episode in this anthology science fiction series with all of this alien beings extraordinary <UNK> and many <UNK> with the <UNK> this episode would certainly rate as unusual its seemingly insignificant settings apparently not <UNK> any <UNK> at story's end or does it kicking off with the silent movie form no recorded dialog but having musical <UNK> in this case it's on the sound track not <UNK> the playing of <UNK> or piano by an on sight musician this part of the episode along with the ending section also made liberal use o title cards just like the old time movies while these titles are a bit exaggerated and overdone they are made so intentionally and with an affection for rather than any contempt for the silent film br br veteran comedy film director norman z <UNK> was the man in the chair for this half hour installment he had been the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time featuring people like the marx brothers w c fields harold lloyd and danny <UNK> he was no stranger to to tv as he had done a lot of work on television series br br it doesn't appear that he and mr keaton had ever worked together before as i cannot find any evidence of this ' but judging by the outcome of the film they succeeded in doing so with flying colors anyone who directed keaton was aware that buster was also a fine comedy director as well as a comedy player he was just as comfortable behind the camera as he was in front of it their short <UNK> must have been a <UNK> one with <UNK> and <UNK> about how to do things it is apparent that many of the gags were keaton's <UNK> from his own silent picture days for example the gag of putting the pair of pants on with <UNK> stanley adams assistance was done by keaton and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in one of the <UNK> 2 <UNK> the garage <UNK> that was a clear example of his craft in a nutshell br br buster knew that we film our world with a camera rendering it a two dimensional image this one fact is at the bottom of so many of gags it is a <UNK> rule for his film making br br the cast was small and once again just chock full of veteran talent stanley adams was <UNK> and served as mr keaton's straight man jesse white the old <UNK> <UNK> man' ran the fix it shop that fixed the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> veteran of rko short comedy series was the <UNK> cop james <UNK> george e stone harry <UNK> warren parker and <UNK> parsons all rounded out this largely silent cast br br without <UNK> the <UNK> let's just say that yes there is probably a lesson to be learned here if not the one already mentioned the grass always looks <UNK> on the other side of the fence then how about be careful in what you ask for because you just may get it
<START> fifteen years later and paris is burning is still <UNK> this is a classic in black gay films right up there with the other <UNK> black gay films the color purple and <UNK> this <UNK> work captures underground and <UNK> i e <UNK> black and latin gay culture and community like no other work before or since including all the sentimental harlem <UNK> gay <UNK> and <UNK> they're good but this is the best dare i say the only real film you'll find on the subject it's <UNK> <UNK> the classic house music invention comes to hollywood non stop hilarious camp like only we do it and dead on social critique all this by a white female director who obviously must have been a sister <UNK> or <UNK> thing in a former life i could go on but i think you get the point by now i love this movie
<START> quite possibly the worst movie i've ever seen i was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes the only people laughing in the theater were the <UNK> don't get me wrong i love silly stupid movies just as much as the next gal but the whole premise writing and humor <UNK> it seemed to me that they were going for a <UNK> dynamite feel strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience instead it ended up being forced awkward and weird br br the only bright light was <UNK> fisher and i just felt utterly awful that she and sissy <UNK> had signed up for this horrible thing br br thank gosh i didn't pay for it
<START> the korean war has been dubbed <UNK> forgotten war so many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50 thousand men who died there occasionally we are treated to a play or movie which deals with that far off ghostly frozen graveyard here is perhaps one of the finest it's called sergeant <UNK> the story is of an american soldier named sgt paul <UNK> lee marvin who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer his task is to <UNK> to the north <UNK> and offer his services against united nations forces so successful is his cover he proves <UNK> to the enemy and given the rank of major however he is thereafter captured by the americans put on trial as a <UNK> and spy stating he was ordered to <UNK> he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence he is convicted and sentenced to hang however his conviction is <UNK> by capt young <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> convincing commanding gen <UNK> <UNK> lloyd nolan of his doubts he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed the courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes peter graves murray hamilton and norman fell as sgt max <UNK> korea was a far off place but the possibility of <UNK> a communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the 1950's due to its superior script and powerful message this drama has become a courtroom classic excellent viewing and recommended to all
<START> i would have left the movie halfway through if i hadn't been with people who liked it the movie is based on real incidents but it's so over the top it didn't feel real at all i have some psychological background hang out with a lot of <UNK> and have known seriously crazy people so it's not that i think people like this don't exist but in the film the only characters who seemed consistently human were <UNK> father alec baldwin and the young <UNK> jack <UNK> although <UNK> rachel wood was an intriguing <UNK> very sexy with a wicked sense of fun there were a few amusing moments but the overall tone of the movie was grim bizarre and nasty what a waste of an outstanding cast as i watched them go through their turns i just felt like i was watching an acting class this was brought home during the credits when a couple of people were shown just sitting there not acting not talking those few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours
<START> i do not know if this movies problems are more the fault of direction or script as you will see in many reviews the editing style is way overdone it is absolutely distracting and without substance which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie i do not write many reviews here but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment movies like this <UNK> at movie making as an art form movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them people <UNK> there craft there 5 senses and there business sense <UNK> there own inner life however i do not put blame on them it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age <UNK> by films like this one but by <UNK> these <UNK> i would dare not call artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen <UNK> it to everyone a story of bounty hunters guns guns and more guns heavy handed <UNK> of sex for the oh so popular actress did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her over <UNK> over exaggerated one liners non linear plots all different and yet all the same annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat a story a development of character or just <UNK> missing information revealed at the end to create the effect of a story as if one took place it altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety it is a caricature of stereotypes and genre where are the films with awareness what about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there what about the depth of a look what about editing with a point about mind and consciousness yes even in action films this can happen sure they have <UNK> a craft but what use is it without soul or wisdom of insight into the human condition can the people who commented and said that this is an <UNK> of art or compare this to <UNK> and others i say put this next to gandhi or the godfather even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings then look me in the face and say it again it is a good crew but they need some help with depth and story i hope they get it because i like the <UNK> previous work better luck next time
<START> <UNK> befriends jennifer a thin intelligent girl at her new school <UNK> parents have just split up soon <UNK> tells <UNK> of her eating disorder and the two begin <UNK> and <UNK> together they both are in the <UNK> <UNK> ball team <UNK> mum becomes aware of her daughter's illness as she is losing lots of weight <UNK> is admitted to hospital she is <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and is made to gain weight her father visits her in hospital and orders a feeding tube she is better and is allowed out of hospital and she tells her mum that <UNK> has <UNK> this leads to the two falling out as <UNK> mum tells <UNK> mum her <UNK> br br at a party <UNK> is hit by a car and because her heart is weak it kills her <UNK> condition <UNK> as she blames herself for her best friend's death
<START> horrible film with bits of the ramones <UNK> about your worse than average 1970's 80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan this movie is terrible the plot consists of a girl who enjoys the ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration forget this movie and watch something like wild zero starring guitar wolf if you want an entertaining b movie terrible acting terrible writing terrible plot with the <UNK> of <UNK> of the ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie that is the only logical thing i can think of because this movie blows
<START> <UNK> it was definitely one of those <UNK> nights where i <UNK> the channels and <UNK> into this stinker of a movie for some of the names in the cast i'd expect a much better movie i'm almost embarrassed to see oscar winner f murray abraham being reduced to such a horrible part i hope the money was worth it and the students they talked about <UNK> like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster i mean i've <UNK> it's a fun sport but i've never been that intense the only reason i even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the <UNK> and i was too lazy to get it back
<START> first of all this movie reminded me of the old movies i used to have to watch in religion class in school that's not a good thing basically it's just a preachy and pretentious piece of filth just like the terrible left behind series i'm not offended by religious movies but i am offended when these religious movies just happen to be extremely awful i would just like to be able to say nice things about a christian movie but it doesn't look like that will happen any time soon i bet if you gave the bible <UNK> a decent budget they still wouldn't be able to come up with anything good just avoid this one also the fact that the american family association basically <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about this film on their website is another reason to make me hate it in fact after i viewed this i went home and watched my copy of david <UNK> <UNK> 17 rated crash forgive me father for i have <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this isn't the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirky insane robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over <UNK> mixed with <UNK> new love of the thriller but this isn't a thriller per se this is more a mystery suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper br br also starring sandra oh and <UNK> culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until <UNK> character gets close to achieving his goal br br i must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide <UNK> or <UNK> it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to <UNK> to the premise of the story br br all in all it's worth a watch though it's definitely not friday saturday night fare br br it rates a 7 7 10 from br br the fiend
<START> this movie fails miserably on every level i have an idea let's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east maybe if we're lucky they'll all be shot and killed and we won't have to ever have our time wasted by them again did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life my god i can't think of anything i've ever seen that was this bad i'd rather watch <UNK> 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film i'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless that's my two cents
<START> primal species 1996 <UNK> jonathan <UNK> br br international terrorists get a surprise when their <UNK> turn out to contain living dinosaurs the army <UNK> team now have to think fast if they want to prevent the <UNK> of the human species instead of the <UNK> br br you look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film that is pretty much it the acting is only just acceptable from a few characters the story is poor with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs this film came out three years after <UNK> <UNK> instead this film looks to have come out 13 years before <UNK> <UNK> the dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made and i do mean costumes there are obviously people dressed up and this film makes no attempts at hiding this a scene when a dinosaur runs down a <UNK> is created in a way in which it looks like someone is riding the creature the is one good thing which comes out of this film the short running time at only 1 hour and 15 minutes it doesn't waste too much of your life but still try to avoid it altogether br br it's like a friday the 13th nightmare officer brian <UNK>
<START> james j corbett <UNK> champion of the world from <UNK> to <UNK> turned out to be errol <UNK> favorite role possibly because he didn't have to <UNK> a sword or be in a western he grew tired of the <UNK> and he said in his autobiography that he felt he was miscast in westerns and couldn't understand why people liked him in them it is an enjoyable film but hardly does tell the real story of james j corbett br br as portrayed corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the <UNK> division a man who used brains and speed more than <UNK> strength to win he defeated john l sullivan and lost to bob <UNK> the <UNK> crown he was also a <UNK> <UNK> and in that was a lot like the man portraying him of course that was not shown on the screen the character that <UNK> smith plays the <UNK> daughter who falls for him has no basis in reality corbett was in fact married twice and was <UNK> <UNK> with both of his wives br br also though after he lost his title and after the events of this film are <UNK> he suffered a great personal tragedy his father in a moment of depression probably over <UNK> because he lost heavily <UNK> on his son to beat bob <UNK> shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself the murder suicide hardly <UNK> with the happy clan that alan hale <UNK> over br br one thing though that i did like about gentleman jim ward bond got the career role of his life in playing john l sullivan director <UNK> walsh got a great performance out of bond as the <UNK> but lovable sullivan even given some of <UNK> bad points that don't make it to the screen like <UNK> racism <UNK> portrayal is the quintessential john l and the best thing about gentleman jim br br speaking of racism one thing that should have been told was the fact that sullivan while champion refused on grounds of race to meet peter jackson who was black and from australia and probably the best <UNK> of his time i say probably because as a <UNK> corbett met him and fought him for <UNK> rounds to a draw that fight more than any other created a demand for a sullivan corbett title match of course when corbett was champion he refused to give jackson a title shot maybe he didn't want another <UNK> round marathon with someone who may have been better on that particular day br br gentleman jim is not jim <UNK> story it is a movie of errol flynn playing at being james j corbett but corbett had he been alive in 1942 no doubt would have loved the movie and loved <UNK> portrayal of his life it's as he would have liked to have been remembered
<START> gods where to start i was only able to stomach about the first 10 minutes before i turned it off in disgust aside from the actor playing robin hood himself the rest were just terrible and i can only stretch my suspension of disbelief only so far br br from the very opening of the first episode i lost count of how many errors plot holes and horrible costumes there were it began with some poor <UNK> trying to hunt for a deer to feed his family all well and good however the poor <UNK> must have been mostly deaf because a handful of soldiers in full <UNK> on <UNK> were able to sneak up on him to within about 10 feet br br then as he's running away he goes from having them 10 feet behind him to a shot where you cannot even see them at all immediately followed by them about 20 feet behind him again then he runs into some <UNK> and is immediately <UNK> by two of the soldiers who just mere seconds before were <UNK> on <UNK> dozens of feet behind him br br the <UNK> on the soldiers is so painfully obviously cloth which they tried to make look like <UNK> and miserably failed not to mention the lead <UNK> <UNK> being about 5 <UNK> too big for the poor fellow seriously he looks like he is a small child wearing his father's over sized <UNK> finally robin manages to fire about 5 perfectly aimed shots all around one <UNK> hand in the span of about 2 seconds from what appears to be a <UNK> bow no human alive could make those kinds of shots in that short amount of time with a <UNK> rifle much less a bow br br after that they escape the soldiers and stop to help an amazingly well dressed and clean <UNK> with digging a <UNK> something that all <UNK> were willing to do all the time right how this sorry excuse for a series ever got a second season is beyond me the production costs at least for what i saw must have <UNK> in the dozens of dollars or <UNK> br br seriously i think a <UNK> drama class could have put on a better rendition this was so bad even that terrible kevin <UNK> version of robin hood was better br br i highly suggest you skip this monstrosity and go rent or buy the mid 80's robin of <UNK> series much better written acted <UNK> and produced br br for shame bbc for shame
<START> i don't usually comment but there are things that need to be said where to start br br the acting on jeremy <UNK> part was horrible i didn't think he could be so bad the plot could have been good had it been well directed along with a good solid performance from the lead actor unfortunately this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining but get disappointed from the start br br well at least i got good laughs i wouldn't waste my time if i were you
<START> oh how we have a misfire here a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since d w griffith referred to the chinese character in broken <UNK> as 'the yellow man' characters so unimaginative and un engaging that it's difficult to watch as well as a narrative that <UNK> along at such a slow stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film br br <UNK> honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post modern disaster in every which way possible the film is a messy and senseless disaster that has john huston directing kathleen turner and jack nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that <UNK> on a phone now and again or <UNK> with a main character <UNK> honor is a film that falls into a genre of neo noir comedy romance action gangster and overall crime  this <UNK> with its director and cast should be enough to <UNK> it through some sort of a story some sort of a sequence of good scenes some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no  what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all br br i'll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is firstly the film thinks it's a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time of my time <UNK> <UNK> nicholson is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in new york and yet he resembles his character out of one flew over the <UNK> nest more than an international hit man he meets and falls in love with irene walker turner who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out it appears all is not right i read that the plot for this film is a professional hit man and hit woman fall in love only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other well yes that's true but that actual revelation doesn't happen until about twenty minutes to the end nicholson plays <UNK> like someone with an iq of 60 he walks around seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin  one really poorly shot assassination early on that actually happens off screen is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard <UNK> best of the best international hit man br br so with a main character who is un likable and un realistic we move to the script the first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest <UNK> of life merely poor conventions <UNK> <UNK> around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again do i marry her do i love her what is love what do i do and it gets so repetitive it's not even able to act as good humour this <UNK> with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone a girl called <UNK> <UNK> huston played by director john's daughter which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with <UNK> and loved it  that got me thinking was this supposed to be funny should i be laughing the film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding <UNK> the godfather and <UNK> scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters police men and <UNK> were introduced into the film but what we get is something very very different br br the second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot right the love and romance is dealt with  maybe the film will kick start i was so very wrong with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a <UNK> way we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office this scene sums the film up everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy we do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music perhaps they have to get through security to get to the <UNK> maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the <UNK> occurs  the scene isn't even edited correctly some suspense some drama do i shoot or don't i maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it's too late  anything but how it was actually executed <UNK> honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into <UNK> oblivion as it <UNK> its climax it's a film where cameras reflect in windows lights reflect in sides of cars and <UNK> <UNK> blink when <UNK> <UNK> honor is a <UNK> and messy film that will try the patients of any film goer and don't say it was a comedy because i didn't laugh with it  at it is another matter the film is repetitive drawn out and <UNK> in its vision and scope for originality there is no honour here
<START> for some reason tv guide gave this two and a half stars plus faye <UNK> is in it so it definitely looked like something to see my oh my this may be the worst film i've ever seen ever from its horrid acting every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him i <UNK> to the tv i can't act when she asks what he needs i yell i need acting lessons to the unbelievably bad dialog give me back my organs br br and the brian <UNK> wannabe ending too it was all just beyond awful i wanted to like it <UNK> is one of the best actors ever and the production values were pretty good br br but <UNK> this had me laughing laughing most of the time br br don't even bother out of curiosity that was my first mistake staying with it was definitely my second and third and fourth
<START> watch on the <UNK> is one of the best anti nazi propaganda films made during world war two paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was i would recommend this film to those interested in that era and of course the fabulous films of the late great ms bette davis
<START> a stupid rich guy circa about <UNK> wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients despite an initially hostile response he is soon <UNK> invited in and given a tour by the good doctor and as the doctor shows him about he talks and talks and talks and as he talks <UNK> run amok here and there doing nothing especially <UNK> while there is some action here and there and some of it quite disturbing it's amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is lacking life and energy which is odd for a horror flick even a guy who thinks he's a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome the further this tour takes the guest the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their <UNK> yet again despite this twist the film is amazingly lifeless in many places particularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell starving does the film have any real impact considering this plot it sure is hard to imagine making it boring but the people who made this cheap <UNK> film have now with the same plot and competent writing acting and direction this could have been an interesting and worthwhile film br br you know now that i think about it this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original star trek tv show you know the one with lord <UNK> master of the universe and kirk and spock are held prisoner by this madman and his crazed followers br br a final note the film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene so be <UNK> it's not for kids in fact considering how worthless the film is it isn't for anyone however with the version included in the 50 movie pack chilling classics the print is so incredibly bad that it's hard to see all this flesh due to the print being so very dark
<START> as a south african it's an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense br br despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original <UNK> <UNK> mini this addition to the series is appalling the original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great <UNK> leader and warrior a man who played a large role in <UNK> the history of local <UNK> in south africa br br the plot of this film however is nothing but <UNK> <UNK> from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the mid nineties br br while omar <UNK> and henry <UNK> are good actors what is david <UNK> doing here <UNK> drowning slaves with his red <UNK> and <UNK> smile br br i kept expecting blond <UNK> women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits for no apparent reason not that this would've been any more bizarre than the <UNK> plot line that was probably <UNK> up after 10 <UNK> of beer at a fancy dress party where someone's <UNK> costume inspired the writer to return to an african theme for his next blockbuster
<START> people are being too hard on the film sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without attempting to review it br br the whole thing comes together when hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his target still goes down then the fun begins as everyone about him also go down br br just think <UNK> and all the people associated in any way with his assassination who's lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you'll appreciate what is implied in this film br br i think it's an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred though the exact story line my not have been followed <UNK> here after reading jim <UNK> <UNK> but it's what is implied that is of interest br br i'd love to get a copy of it to view it again in light of what is known today the domino principle is right on
<START> this movie will confuse you to death furthermore if your a denise <UNK> fan don't even think of renting this movie besides getting top billing by being on the cover and about 10 minutes of air time if that she has nothing to do with the movie or the many messed up plots
<START> even though we know how the story ends this is a gripping fly on the wall film that plays almost like a political thriller during the calm before the storm we meet hugo chavez as a charismatic larger than life man who has an <UNK> connection with the <UNK> who make up 80 of the population but have previously been shut out of <UNK> political process and its oil wealth he seems as devoted to them as they are to him he travels the country at a <UNK> pace reaching out to the <UNK> addressing huge crowds <UNK> and kissing ordinary people accepting letters on <UNK> of paper and hearing <UNK> for help the people are excited that one of their number has made it to the highest office in the land there is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better is coming to the <UNK> <UNK> br br but not everyone is happy with the situation the pure blood <UNK> <UNK> elite who are a small minority but previously controlled all the wealth are full of <UNK> and <UNK> one of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in the film is when an ann <UNK> <UNK> at a <UNK> meeting in an <UNK> <UNK> community complains of the <UNK> they have no concept of struggle or sacrifice minutes later a <UNK> tells the meeting to beware of your domestic servants they could be chavez supporters duh of course they are br br in a late night interview alone with the film crew chavez reveals something of his soul as he tells the story of his grandfather he can be a sensitive poetic person though with an <UNK> even <UNK> sense of humor like we saw when he addressed the un and called bush the devil br br then the storm starts to gather force as the coup <UNK> call for a mass protest and <UNK> manipulate their supporters into changing the route at the last minute and <UNK> on the presidential palace knowing it is surrounded by chavez supporters and violence is inevitable br br another element of the plot falls into place as <UNK> on <UNK> begin to fire on the chavez supporters some of whom fire back the local equivalent of fox news shows this return fire and claims that chavez supporters are <UNK> <UNK> then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no <UNK> the street is empty the <UNK> took a different route needless to say the footage of the empty street was edited out by the <UNK> anti chavez private tv stations who had been airing a constant <UNK> of propaganda calling chavez mentally ill and sexually <UNK> on <UNK> castro immediately after the coup we see the <UNK> and their media propaganda masters openly <UNK> on tv about how they had manipulated the situation with reckless disregard for the lives of supporters and opponents alike br br the filmmakers continue to be at the heart of this chaotic fast changing situation as the military coup <UNK> the palace and threatens to bomb it chavez eventually <UNK> to avoid bloodshed but refuses to <UNK> and is <UNK> away to an <UNK> island where a plane <UNK> to take him where the us how can the remaining <UNK> members avoid arrest and defeat this heavily armed conspiracy of right wing <UNK> and ultra wealthy <UNK> who are closely linked to the bush administration watch the movie and find out br br if your only knowledge of hugo chavez and <UNK> is from the us media then you know nothing he is not an <UNK> <UNK> and does not rule by <UNK> he is enormously popular having been elected and re elected several times with over 60 of the vote something george bush junior has never achieved and the devotion he <UNK> in ordinary <UNK> people is ultimately the reason why the coup fails br br this is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation the skill of the filmmakers is in being <UNK> and letting the story unfold through the voices of <UNK> at every level from the <UNK> to the presidential palace the <UNK> scenes the chaos and confusion out of which a coherent whole emerges that is tense riveting and moving not to be missed
<START> another chapter in the ongoing question whatever happened to mel <UNK> sense of humor it starts out nicely enough with mel as <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you can call me god who accepts a bet that he can't live on the streets for 30 days but the moment the movie hits the streets it turns into a pathos laden mess with occasional funny bits <UNK> mel sees a black kid break dancing for money and tries to do a vaudeville buck and wing <UNK> <UNK> leslie ann warren is nothing short of wasted the worst part is this movie's musical number in which brooks and warren do a silent dance to cole <UNK> easy to love <UNK> musical parodies are usually the highlights of his movies here he plays the whole thing straight like a dancing <UNK> from an aging guest star on the carol <UNK> show on which <UNK> <UNK> this film's co writer began his career go rent charlie <UNK> the kid which covered the same ground 70 years before and did a lot
<START> extremely interesting and intriguing movie the similarities to david lynch who is even <UNK> literally by the presence of red <UNK> in the film and the novels of <UNK> <UNK> the house keeper in this film is called mrs <UNK> as is the one in der <UNK> are clearly present but in this case are accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of <UNK> in africa the exact content of the movie i can not clearly describe this <UNK> is an important part as is the inability to cope with such a past but the personal memories of the main character are a central issue as well and his quest for social contact and love these are the symbolic themes i <UNK> from the movie but in fact they're no more than impressions br br but even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds you still will discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid imagery beautiful close ups of beatles <UNK> and other nasty insects are <UNK> with great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere lends the film extra style maybe you can say that i didn't quite <UNK> the film but i have been watching like <UNK> for 1 5 hour deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating <UNK>
<START> not good rent or buy the original watch this only if someone has a gun to your head and then maybe br br it is like claiming an elvis actor is as good as the real king
<START> a police officer robert <UNK> in a crime ridden city has his wife attacked and young son killed after she <UNK> to stand up to a thug at a <UNK> station after the murderers get off <UNK> free thanks to a corrupt judge and he himself is <UNK> for 30 days for contempt of court he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of <UNK> led by a <UNK> looking fred <UNK> these robin hood types sort out any criminal that the law is unwilling to <UNK> and with their help he attempts to track down those that <UNK> him br br this film is nothing but a big bag <UNK> the only thing out of the ordinary is the on screen <UNK> of a two year old boy which was pretty sick otherwise it's business as usual for this genre e g involves lots of car chases <UNK> and shootings mixed in with plenty of male <UNK> i could have done without the prison fight in the shower involving all those bare a ed inmates though also did they run out of money before filming the last scenes i mention this because it ends very abruptly with little closure if anyone knows give me a bell actually don't bother br br to conclude file under forgettable nonsense next
<START> it's all very simple jake goes to prison and spends five years with the con and the chess masters they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his <UNK> of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks they decide to give jake the ultimate freedom from his <UNK> fears from what he believes to be himself for that they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear all the pride all the hope to be <UNK> as true master of his will br br it's a clever movie about the journey of <UNK> about the <UNK> <UNK> and games that we do with and within ourselves 10 10 no doubt
<START> everyone knows about this <UNK> <UNK> event what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were they showed their life for about a year throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do and that gives me the chills cause i felt guilty to be <UNK> by their comments and i just thought cal was a sweet guy even though i knew what was gonna happen you know even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off of course i was i got to like them they were wicked maybe but i felt like they were really normal guys that they didn't really realize it but i knew they were br br that's imo the main force of this movie it makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we won't even notice it this movie as good as it was made me feel bad and that's why i can't go to sleep right now there's still this little feeling in my stomach <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> brothers andy apparently has his act together and hank clearly doesn't have his act together need money andy comes up with a scheme to get some <UNK> that will have consequences for the whole <UNK> family br br this film delivers this is a layered full blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing as a crime drama thriller i would happily compare it to <UNK> country for old men ' while both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills <UNK> is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> and <UNK> film that you can really admire while <UNK> is a bit more enjoyable there is definitely less violence in <UNK> than <UNK> country ' the acting delivers as well ethan hawke sometimes wooden in the past brings the <UNK> <UNK> and the deer in the <UNK> look to the <UNK> hank philip seymour hoffman as andy has the film's hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor who you believe can do anything br br there's really not much wrong with this film it jumps back and forth without being confusing events spiral out of control but the film never does the writing from first <UNK> kelly masterson directing veteran sidney lumet and the editing stay as tight as a drum in many categories this is award caliber stuff though maybe films like 'the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this one out of the <UNK> if you liked those you'll like this
<START> you can never have seen either film and still know that the jerk too is a disaster the question is not how did it get made because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film they will do so br br no the question is why oh why did steve martin allow it to be made i think he needed the money to fight a <UNK> <UNK> and was determined it not cost him anything he knew the sequel was going to be so <UNK> that out of pride he wouldn't even count it's <UNK> as <UNK> br br the only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had carl <UNK> and steve martin revive the <UNK> favorite poor black family br br and <UNK> aka mark <UNK> it's just <UNK> obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the <UNK> lone <UNK> as an imdb user comment i was praying for you to <UNK> over into satire but alas you were really making an effort at spin why not 10 stars
<START> a <UNK> has escaped from a nyc mental hospital and soon teachers start getting <UNK> at st <UNK> university new teacher julie <UNK> forbes has to deal with the mess of red herrings despite a <UNK> minute running time this cheap o slasher drags on and on until the lame finish where the person you suspect is the killer from the get go is revealed to be as such director richard haines barely breaks a sweat with some lame stalk n slash staging but delivers the <UNK> the early 80s audience was probably <UNK> for all of our amateur <UNK> out there this was filmed in new <UNK> in early 80s so you can check out all of the culture beliefs and practices of living people from that far away place the film does get some credit for <UNK> the final girl you rarely see that also always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer <UNK> <UNK> not trust the <UNK> my beloved film industry thankfully this one is only a phony priest and he gets caught he is still working the moral high ground angle though
<START> i just watched holly along with another movie about <UNK> and child sexual exploitation called trade at film by the sea international film festival i have to say that holly blew trade out of the water br br holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels from purely an artistic and cinematic perspective it is amazing the sound mixing camera angles directing and acting are all spot on br br additionally the way it handles the subject matter is <UNK> and non exploitative it presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate the filmmakers paid an exquisite amount of attention to detail truly capturing the nuances of the <UNK> of child sexual exploitation and <UNK> too often when dealing with a subject matter of this kind it is <UNK> to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into that typical hollywood trend br br i've had the pleasure of seeing holly at two separate film festivals once in the us and once in <UNK> i can honestly say that i have never seen audiences more moved just listening to conversations after the screening people are asking what they personally can do to fight child sexual exploitation br br i highly recommend it to everyone both for its cinematic value and its subject matter
<START> everyone has a first love and though it is hard to define that feeling when you're younger it is there <UNK> inside you that is what <UNK> filmmaker <UNK> ahmad aims to prove in her fourth feature a movie where that most complex of emotions is <UNK> in a <UNK> simple straightforward fashion br br such an approach is especially convenient in this case as the love story at the film's core involves two twelve year olds and would therefore make any attempts at deeper analysis seem contrived and pretentious that they don't is also testament to the astounding performances given by the leading non actors <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the former plays <UNK> already seen as an adult character in <UNK> previous picture <UNK> a lively almost rebellious girl who perhaps influenced by her british upbringing her mother studied in england <UNK> playing with dolls <UNK> to play violent sports with the boys then one day she meets <UNK> <UNK> who has come to spend the holidays at his <UNK> house and all of a sudden she changes her <UNK> goodbye <UNK> hello bike riding and tree climbing but what does this mean are they just friends or is something more implied something neither of them is yet ready to understand let alone accept br br given the young age of the protagonists answering those questions borders on impossible and so like in several smaller films lost in translation comes to mind there is no real closure a choice that leaves a bittersweet but ultimately satisfying <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> acting especially <UNK> gets to the heart almost immediately and a strong supporting cast <UNK> family most of all helps keeping the <UNK> narrative fun and <UNK> the down to earth approach isn't always that effective the hilarious subplot regarding an <UNK> neighbor is dropped way too early and it is hard to justify the bizarre pulp fiction reference at the start of the feature but the emotional strength of the teenage romance is enough to make this an interesting piece of independent asian cinema
<START> there isn't much to say about this film it is horrible br br the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid <UNK> is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there br br cgi is something you wouldn't like to see it so amateurish that it makes me vomit br br the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras the gag reel everything else just waste of time and money i hope <UNK> will buy this this is not even worth renting br br just stay away of this
<START> i cant believe blockbuster carries this movie it was so bad i was totally fooled by the box art don't be fooled its not worth your time i promise you i don't know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what i am so disappointed br br the description on the back of the box doesn't even match the girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper the synopsis on the back says she is only 17 did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be if anyone actually liked this flick then i've lost all faith in humanity br br and don't even get me started on the story compared to the title or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations or that the cops didn't even have close to real uniforms why would i even say that who cares about the cops uniforms compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on br br this movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans
<START> this crew versus <UNK> has been done a hundred times sometimes better this one was pretty slow moving only the <UNK> <UNK> was really worthwhile attempts at character developments gets <UNK> by routine yeah routine is the word went straight to video in france no wonder
<START> this series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by <UNK> and other <UNK> it brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author's subsequent <UNK> collapse br br diamond himself comes off as <UNK> and caring not just a <UNK> or <UNK> academic this series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to <UNK> or <UNK> as the saying goes about <UNK> but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects why you white people got so much <UNK> and we have so little because he respected the intelligence of the <UNK> and his community diamond looked for an answer that didn't insult that intelligence or that community i like to think of his answer in a very simple way in the same spirit as south <UNK> blame canada blame <UNK>
<START> i am not sure why i like dolph lundgren i guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent that is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent some of the other reviews point out how dumb <UNK> is but many neglect to point out the <UNK> br br any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed can't be all bad why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens aren't there any other kind of teens does every group of teens have one angry black guy one genius nerd that nobody likes one <UNK> girl who is very friendly and in this movie pregnant one disturbed anti social white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented but what is the talent and one laid back black kid who is in tune with the universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him then add a couple of generic <UNK> teens of any color they don't say much but get shot at some point br br <UNK> would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school preferably with the writers inside the dialogue is bad and the plot is worse when the bad guys and girl finally <UNK> a van full of drugs then they sit inside the van making out they drive the van to the school because they want to re paint the van at the <UNK> paint shop but they never get around to re painting the van by the way it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without <UNK> the police van they also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score br br for some reason they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher dolph lundgren even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours the handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles so why go after them br br anyhow the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns and they keep finding the teens including a guy in a wheel chair and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed for every time someone gets shot there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss the stunts are pretty bad br br i read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of 10 million and i am amazed when i saw the movie i figured maybe lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher like maybe this movie was their end of the year <UNK> it was a test to watch it but i passed
<START> i'm a big fan of movies that make you think i'm still thinking long and hard about this one fully seven minutes after the credits have rolled what's really <UNK> my <UNK> is the attempt to <UNK> the relevance to the plot of the naked <UNK> <UNK> her slick <UNK> body made extra tacky by being filmed on cheap video this happens three times and i was certain it would be explained in the end i put my trust in the film makers that this lurid attempt to lure viewers would be justified it was not br br the movie has to be the most <UNK> i've come across in the genre the sets look like a cross between a 1970s dr who set and someone's ill formed idea of a <UNK> painted living room the lighting is unimaginative if your sets are going to be that bad at least film them in semi darkness to hide the <UNK> and create some ambiance of the <UNK> <UNK> the girl stands out as being particularly lame but none of them is given a personality the <UNK> plans for world <UNK> are just plain silly all they need is a birth control <UNK> and their problems are solved most of the movie consists of people running down corridors yes it really is that exciting the ray gun special effect is curious to say the least what use is a weapon that takes a 15 second concentrated blast to kill and even then the guy comes back for more the script is like a bad episode of the a team and the <UNK> <UNK> come from the same era so they look like school teachers instead of an advance team of murderous alien <UNK> when we finally get to see what the aliens really look like they're in suspended animation and never even get out of their boxes the resolution of the story <UNK> alien simply has a few words with <UNK> fleet commander and without a second thought he heads home is truly the sign of a writer who's never had an idea more complex than a saturday morning cartoon i mean the bad ones with no plot action or characterization in his or her life br br but seriously what is with the naked chick was it really just so they could justify putting flesh on the dvd cover to boost sales
<START> the brain that wouldn't die was considered so <UNK> in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in <UNK> today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959 the thing is both lurid and <UNK> but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly <UNK> sort of way br br the story of course concerns a doctor who is an eager <UNK> in <UNK> limbs and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab with the aid of a few <UNK> <UNK> a couple of <UNK> and what looks very like a shallow <UNK> pan he brings her head back to life but is she grateful not hardly in fact she seems <UNK> <UNK> off about the whole thing particularly when it <UNK> that the doctor plans to <UNK> her head to another body br br as it happens the doctor is <UNK> about this new body he wants one built for speed and he takes to <UNK> <UNK> women on city <UNK> haunting strip <UNK> visiting body beautiful <UNK> and hunting down <UNK> models in search of <UNK> that will raise his <UNK> but back at the lab the head has developed a <UNK> induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet can they work together to get rid of the bitter and <UNK> lab assistance wreck revenge upon the doctor and save the woman whose body he <UNK> for could be leading man jason <UNK> plays the <UNK> doctor as if he's been given a massive dose of spanish fly virginia <UNK> the unhappy head <UNK> and <UNK> in spite of the fact that she has no <UNK> and maybe not even any vocal <UNK> <UNK> babes <UNK> to incredibly <UNK> music actors make irrational character changes from line to line the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot and you'll need a <UNK> to add up the continuity goofs on the whole the brain that wouldn't die comes off as even more unintentionally funny than an ed wood movie br br director joseph green actually manages to keep the whole thing moving at pretty good clip and looking at the film today it is easy to pick out scenes that influenced later directors who no doubt saw the thing when they were young and <UNK> and never quite got over it the cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost but the cuts made for television have been restored in the <UNK> release and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with br br now this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious depending on your point of view so it is very hard to give a recommendation but i'll say this if your tastes run to the likes of ed wood or russ meyers you need to snap this one up and now four stars for its cheesy <UNK> alone <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> it's a shame that deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for <UNK> <UNK> even people that have seen the film can't get their mind off of that rape scene it's not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction it's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie people tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous <UNK> scene br br the acting plot cinematography and soundtrack of deliverance all lend a hand to it's brooding charisma the <UNK> it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are <UNK> down that river right along with them br br the thing that <UNK> this film from others is the <UNK> sense of dread that it <UNK> not many films can make you feel this <UNK> out bottom line this movie is a classic i can't really say much more than that
<START> ok i overrated it just a bit to <UNK> at least one of those grumpy reviews but i did enjoy it i didn't laugh out loud but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point the story built yeah you knew it would have an happy ending this genre always does meantime it was quirky with sight gags you could miss so pay attention when you watch stiller and black delivered expertly yet again good team they should work together more don't know that it will be a cult classic but it was certainly a fun ride not as good as what about bob or dirty rotten <UNK> but what is it is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie
<START> pickup on south street is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself <UNK> in the activities of a group of <UNK> the action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing the use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and <UNK> samuel <UNK> style of directing and the cinematography by joseph macdonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere br br ace <UNK> and repeat <UNK> skip mccoy richard widmark gets into deep water when he steals a <UNK> from a young woman named candy jean peters on the new york subway she was being used by her ex boyfriend joey richard <UNK> to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist <UNK> and unknown to her she was carrying us government secrets recorded on <UNK> two fbi agents had been following candy and witnessed the <UNK> one of the agents continues to tail her back to <UNK> apartment and the other <UNK> willis <UNK> visits police captain dan tiger <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> explains that the fbi has been following candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the <UNK> of a communist group br br in order to identify the <UNK> tiger calls in a <UNK> called moe thelma ritter who after being given a precise description of the <UNK> method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects once tiger sees <UNK> name on the list he's immediately convinced that he's the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him when skip is brought into <UNK> office <UNK> tells him about the <UNK> and tiger offers to drop any charges if he'll co operate with the investigation skip is <UNK> and arrogant he clearly doesn't trust tiger and <UNK> all knowledge of the <UNK> on the subway br br joey orders candy to find out who stole the <UNK> and then retrieve it candy pays moe for <UNK> address and when skip returns from being <UNK> by tiger he finds candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money when she <UNK> skip demands <UNK> of 25 000 for the <UNK> she tells joey about <UNK> demand and <UNK> boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the <UNK> by the following evening br br skip and candy are attracted to each other and it's because of their uneasy developing relationship that a means <UNK> by which they are able to shake off the <UNK> of the police it soon becomes apparent however that <UNK> matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action br br the depictions of skip candy and moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling br br <UNK> work as a police informer is <UNK> on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time she appears to be cunning and <UNK> but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as an old clock running down and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an <UNK> cemetery in long island her belief that every buck has a meaning of its own leads her to sell any information regardless of danger friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal thelma <UNK> performance certainly <UNK> the oscar nomination she earned for her role br br skip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past lives under the constant threat of being <UNK> for life if convicted again despite this he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely is merely philosophical when moe betrays his <UNK> and then later he even <UNK> that moe receives the type of burial she <UNK> so highly candy is an ex hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a <UNK> side gradually becomes more evident widmark and peters are both perfect for their roles and like ritter portray the different <UNK> of their personalities with great style and conviction
<START> this is probably <UNK> at her best apart from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also gives out his best without even trying the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag especially when <UNK> comes in the picture what really made me like it were the performances of the leads the dialog delivery as well as the story for what it was it could've been directed better and edited the supporting case was even great including <UNK> mother in law even though she just had one shining moment it was great to watch her br br the sets were also pretty good i didn't really like their portrayal of a canadian family but once they step in india it's as real as it gets br br overall i would give it a thumbs up
<START> possible spoiler in some way how to alienate friends is the loser learns to <UNK> becomes successful and finds out that something else matter more type of story <UNK> in the celebrity business end of spoiler br br i don't know the original book but this comedy delivers several good moments though i do think the ending is flawed it felt too fast and too abrupt as if something was missing besides i'd say the movie isn't able to keep a high level apart from this you'll find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities until now i've never seen pegg any different still he is a very unique type though on the screen he sometimes might seem a little more tedious than necessary fox proved she is capable to play a hot <UNK> with her head in the clouds don't know whether it was a hard thing to do but her performance was hot and way better than during transformers okay probably that's no tough match kirsten dunst is very much kirsten dunst again and you may like it as i do or find it annoying on the other hand you'll see anderson who proved her acting skills and jeff bridges who is fine but perhaps he could have acted a little more powerful they all fit their character well enough br br conclusion i think it's a nice <UNK> comedy with some more and some less funny <UNK> a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending
<START> as was to be expected a <UNK> film made in the 70s would be counter culture sympathetic towards the hippies and have a lot of hippies in it and naturally it is <UNK> anti <UNK> e g the scene on the mexican border when sutherland <UNK> a <UNK> officer by showing little respect and then <UNK> the latter of making him open his <UNK> only because he sutherland has long hair the constant left wing <UNK> could have gotten on my nerves had i not been prepared for it beforehand sutherland <UNK> <UNK> to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film and most of these ideas are either about blacks or indians needless to say he would be welcomed with open arms in today's hollywood one of his movie ideas is about a black <UNK> in beverly hills a race war so to speak in the middle of l a this is the kind of nonsense that <UNK> thinks about when writing scripts for his movies fortunately some of <UNK> hippie friends make fun of this black revolution premise and the resulting dialogue isn't bad a little later the jewish guy makes a crack about sutherland making a movie about masturbation and the black problem when the latter starts talking about masturbation another funny moment is when <UNK> older daughter performs some pc crap on stage with her white school mates and they all say we the black people of the republic of south africa br br there is always a certain amount of self <UNK> when hollywood makes a movie about hollywood especially when it's hollywood making a movie about hollywood discussing hollywood doing movies now that's very very self indulgent indeed the scene with fellini playing himself is more amusing than annoying though <UNK> throws in the standard flower children and anti vietnam <UNK> into the soup and also <UNK> fun at corporate hollywood but he was is just as much a part of the phony hollywood lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment as anyone else i am pretty sure that he too makes phony small talk in beverly hills parties and <UNK> <UNK> while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesn't know or like but whose money he wants badly for his next left wing project as for his hair he has the worst hair i've seen in a very long time on film or elsewhere it's sort of like the kind of long hair that a middle aged <UNK> would have if he grew it long the film remains relatively interesting in spite of its <UNK> but it <UNK> down somewhat into tedium in the last third if you'd like to read my parody biography of donald sutherland and other hollywood actors contact me by e mail
<START> for starters i have always been a fan of the batman cartoons because the theme is so universal <UNK> everyone alive has an alter <UNK> this is true in the mystery of batwoman while the overall story is good i'm disappointed that they haven't really done much for the franchise with this br br throughout the movie you are trying to find out who the identity of batwoman is unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website so if you haven't seen it already don't go there i was sort of disappointed that they didn't make the movie longer 75 minutes is way too short for any movie the secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie sort of <UNK> and becomes anti climatic afterward because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as batwoman will disappear after the movie is over br br i'm also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie i love the <UNK> new characters but there should be some more detail where detail is called for some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it grabs your attention right away <UNK> your attention away from the storyline i also didn't really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is batman similarly we should've gotten to know more about <UNK> personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with bruce wayne also i think the fight with <UNK> should have been done better in typical children's fashion the bad guy meets his demise too easily either by <UNK> falling getting <UNK> or doing something dumb that works against them come to think of it there wasn't even one drop of blood <UNK> in this movie either br br bottom line its a good entertaining flick and i recommend anyone who's a batman fan to watch it it has good storyline universal appeal and even great acting to top it off i just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making batwoman stay to make things more interesting not just introduce her and then kick her off once she's done i'd also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally to have some other than batman solve the mystery and fill him in later with the details br br i hope there are more animated movies to come and look forward to the time when we will actually be able to see the <UNK> between bruce wayne and barbra <UNK> he's been <UNK> her along forever and doesn't even like her and i can't believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older i also want to see the time when tim drake leaves because he is getting sick of the old man in short i want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in batman beyond otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story br br
<START> well done giving the perspective of the other side <UNK> <UNK> captures both the cost and the <UNK> of war excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of <UNK> to present <UNK> <UNK> ordered struck the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for <UNK> us minds who'd probably prefer some silly speeches and senseless <UNK> like 14 points or the league of nations real americans might appreciate the story line and the action for all the action and intrigue <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> u <UNK> to <UNK> ladder
<START> what was franco <UNK> thinking was hollywood responsible for this travesty or can i take comfort in the idea that someone who didn't speak english as a first language just completely missed the point of charlotte <UNK> classic i don't think i can improve on a comment i read below so i'll just <UNK> it jane eyre is a great great book the screenwriter should read it sometime it's true that this movie's two leads were sadly miscast but pity the actors because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes the dialog that makes you understand the jane and rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun deleted from the script the marriage <UNK> the fortune <UNK> gone the <UNK> half joking half sincerely felt to jane as a fairy <UNK> from <UNK> england come to rescue rochester in his despair eliminated br br it is unfortunate that <UNK> felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and jane's interactions with the rivers family but it is unforgivable that he has <UNK> removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written br br do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 mini series with timothy dalton
<START> i first saw this when they showed this around <UNK> time 1993 4 and didn't think much of it then i bought this on dvd last summer when i started getting into michael jackson i liked his music before and enjoyed it more now i am older it is a good film but it won't be this classic film like the sound of music west side story the wizard of oz etc michael jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members there were a disturbing scenes like the little girl katie getting slapped by the gangster frankie <UNK> who was played by joe <UNK> the scene that frightened me when i was younger was when michael turns into a robot my favourite song on the film was smooth criminal i think it was better than thriller in my opinion
<START> superb cast more please br br if you can catch just about anything else written by <UNK> or starring these wonderful actors for anyone who doesn't know <UNK> has a real feeling for jazz my recommendation is to see the <UNK> trilogy whenever you can br br there's three kinds of jazz hot cool and <UNK> time does the tune start '
<START> a really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualities br br it starts off with pregnant linda blair who runs down a <UNK> to flee what might be monsters or people with <UNK> i'm not sure she jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant the degree to which she is pregnant <UNK> widely throughout the movie br br she and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies on the island already are david <UNK> and his german speaking virgin girlfriend you know how germans are said to love <UNK> he's taking photographs and she's <UNK> an <UNK> german book about witches i think br br also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman i thought was their daughter evidently she was an architect and linda blair and the boy are the older <UNK> children i guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed <UNK> br br the hotel seems neat certainly from the <UNK> but it isn't used to any great effect an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and <UNK> something in german sometimes which he eventually records on his <UNK> street tape <UNK> br br people start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something some of these gore scenes are ok but not enough to recommend the movie though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose <UNK> explode really seems to have been cut much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots since we're not seeing anything ourselves the <UNK> scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy looking wound of a mouth rapes someone he looked particularly nasty there's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave exorcist behind her except for the <UNK> horror conventions br br in the weird largely italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also aka la <UNK> 4 and <UNK> 2 that is it is supposedly a sequel to <UNK> 3 <UNK> la 1988 it's not that's also a better movie than this one la <UNK> 1 and two were the evil dead 1981 and evil dead ii 1987 again unrelated to <UNK> and la <UNK> 3 and much better than those there's also a <UNK> 5 la 1990 aka house 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la <UNK> series and the series house house 1986 house ii the second story 1987 the horror show 1989 aka house iii and house iv 1992 <UNK> the horror show fit in there it doesn't really it claimed to be a sequel thus <UNK> the real series entry to <UNK> itself to cause less or more confusion oddly the horror show is also aka horror house and la <UNK> 5 is also aka horror house 2 does your head hurt yet
<START> terrible story poor acting and no humour at all apart from the final joke at the end br br some sort of ugly angel is sent to earth to save a boy and his mum from being thrown out of their home supposed to be a <UNK> movie but even they will not be amused by this terrible film
<START> when i saw it for the first time i was really impressed the director made such a mysterious atmosphere especially in the end through all the story <UNK> can expect that richard will really kill thomas or he will do it first but the main point was not conflict but friendship older and mature one <UNK> himself to save the younger who has the whole life to life it is amazing every time i watch it i enjoy of course it is pretty violent like every action movie but i think it is acceptable thanks a lot louis <UNK> and tom berenger amazing film i advice everyone to see it i am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time
<START> this was a delightful presentation <UNK> blood as a greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity arrogance <UNK> <UNK> and innocent wonder the quote or scene i recall vividly is when <UNK> <UNK> of all this <UNK> you haven't learned my secrets at all and threatens to storm out the scientist answers him in a single word <UNK> salt water which <UNK> the fiction writer but <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood br br such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning
<START> i am normally a spike lee fan it takes some time to really get into his <UNK> but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart lee is a genius unlike the <UNK> hour or <UNK> two of my favorite films of his there was no clear story in this film i was able to understand the struggle between washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others but for some odd reason lee was never able to get the true feeling out washington did a decent job with what was handed to him but you could tell that this was not lee's favorite film not only did lee direct this film but he also wrote it you could tell the camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the <UNK> of the film this film was coming full circle and it wasn't going to be pretty lee was not 100 behind this film as he was with do the right thing of all the films i have seen lee direct this was the <UNK> and more modest of his films it was almost as if he created a hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own i don't know if he saw the money from do the right thing and ran with it or what  but this film did not demonstrate his true talent br br for anyone out there that has seen this film and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by spike lee afterwards due to this film i suggest you give him a second chance don't get me wrong i see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you but lee does grow up his work becomes more of his own and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films it took me awhile to watch the <UNK> hour but when i did it was sheer brilliance perhaps it was the actors perhaps the story but lee crafted an amazing film out of one man's journey into the unknown i guess that is what i was hoping <UNK> better blues would turn out to be this really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up but instead all i got was denzel being denzel he really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation and i do consider him the sydney <UNK> of cinema but this was not the film to showcase his talent br br another issue that i had with this film was the use of <UNK> sister playing one of the love interests i don't know about you and your family but i do not think that i could have filmed a sex scene with my sister i don't care who the actor is or how much money i am getting paid i would never do it it is just something that i never wish to see but apparently that is different for spike he went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any <UNK> it was sad and it even made me <UNK> also i need somebody to answer me this what was flavor <UNK> doing introducing this film so i am sitting there on my couch ready to start the film when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film then he <UNK> himself that did not build for a strong remaining of the story again i felt that lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent perhaps that is how he could afford both denzel and wesley in the same movie without any explosions br br there were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end don't get me wrong this was a very bad movie but there is always a diamond in every <UNK> the scene when <UNK> accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing he continually went back and forth <UNK> truth to confusion in a way that proved that lee was actually behind the camera it was a <UNK> scene that was probably lost in the <UNK> due to the remaining poor scenes the other scene that was worth watching was the way that lee introduced and ended the film by keeping the same pacing and direction he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life other than these two moments the rest of the film was pure rubbish not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind br br grade out of
<START> this is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial just read the other comments on this film apparently you either love it or hate it and it seems most people make that distinction based on whether they believe the <UNK> and end times will happen as portrayed in the movie br br basically the film and its sequels were made for about 1 30 each the production values are right down there with plan 9 from outer space and the acting is about on the same level as <UNK> or glenda my apologies to ed wood putting aside the religious message the story is as scary as they come add in even the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that might happen in the future and it becomes even scarier br br this movie and its sequels didn't try to bring in the reasons why the <UNK> happened when it did left behind and the <UNK> code tried to get in everything thief did and to explain all the politics and <UNK> in the middle east leading up to it the net effect was thief did a much better job on the scary part of movie instead of <UNK> itself too thin trying to explain what was happening in the middle east at the same time br br forget the politics and watch this movie and its sequels for what they are horror stories that they may be horror stories told <UNK> by god makes them just that much more frightening if it makes you think about the subject it has done its job even if you never believe
<START> this documentary makes you travel all around the globe it contains rare and stunning sequels from the wilderness it shows you how <UNK> and how fragile our planet can be the polar <UNK> future is <UNK> at the beginning and at the end of it after all its bleak future is closely linked with the consequences of global warming this documentary is however a simplistic approach of such a serious <UNK> issue it can nonetheless be easily seen by young children since it mainly remains <UNK> scientists might well be disappointed as it is not a remake of al <UNK> documentary an <UNK> truth but frankly what a description a question may then <UNK> isn't it worth <UNK> our world's beauty because this documentary proves that in 2007 such a beauty still exists despite the different <UNK> by living in towns and cities we tend to forget that we are part and <UNK> of this nature all things considered this documentary reminds us that we own a common treasure called earth
<START> considering its <UNK> this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is even with a lip <UNK> collection of <UNK> in the cast what <UNK> would not eagerly <UNK> a movie which brings together lemmon <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the entire event is <UNK> paced <UNK> shot and more often than not witless br br kim <UNK> gifts were not essentially comic as she went on to confirm in kiss me stupid james stewart was a fine comedian as he <UNK> demonstrated in movies from ranging from the philadelphia story to harvey i think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does except maybe the cat
<START> this film actually works from a fairly original idea i've never seen <UNK> that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway however the way that it <UNK> this idea isn't original in the slightest we follow a bunch of kids that for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest the fact that the forest is inhabited by these <UNK> make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by <UNK> <UNK> zombies etc but really the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme many films of this <UNK> don't have a single good idea and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one the only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they're beautiful women that the characters lust for rather than being hideous <UNK> that they want to run away from this is good up until a point but it soon gets boring and the almost complete lack of any back story surrounding the central monsters <UNK> that the film is never going get itself out of the <UNK> <UNK> category br br it's been years since the evil dead made the <UNK> a prime horror location and in spite of films like the blair witch project it still makes for an excellent horror setting this is one of the film's major <UNK> as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown the only problem is that forest of the damned doesn't ever seem to have much up its <UNK> the death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination and the fact that all the characters are clichéd in the extreme doesn't help as you're more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away the cast is made up of kids mainly but there is a role here for tom <UNK> who unfortunately doesn't get to have fun in the special effects department the only real highlight the film has where <UNK> are concerned comes from the <UNK> themselves the naked ladies tend to look great and if it wasn't for them this film would get very boring very quickly there's nothing to recommend this film for really but if you want a <UNK> little horror film that <UNK> back to the style of eighties <UNK> flicks you might find some enjoyment here
<START> it seems evident from this adaptation that he did not not only did he leave the plot behind he made up his own the things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that i was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel the plot was <UNK> inconsistent and choppy to say the least i don't want to say anything mean spirited about the actors but they can't act dickens is difficult of course but this is pathetic <UNK> was nothing more than a mid <UNK> century kramer and the less said about <UNK> <UNK> the better if you want to see the real <UNK> watch the wonderful 1999 bbc adaptation as for the screenplay writer i think he read the <UNK> notes
<START> being a genre film fan a child of the 80's and a fan of hard rock music this movie holds a special place in my heart it has everything you could want in a supernatural movie action great special effects for 1986 and a guitar <UNK> <UNK> rock soundtrack it certainly was the movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time i didn't see this at the cinema because it was never released <UNK> over here but it's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties <UNK> it's cult status and eventually led to a sadly mediocre dvd release in 2002 if you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn't your cup of tea but trust me there are worse films of this type out there and despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations trick or treat is most definitely a <UNK> riff above the usual horror fare you'll never look at your <UNK> the same way again or should i say <UNK> player br br trick or treat trivia marc price eddie played geeky <UNK> <UNK> on the popular long running comedy sitcom <UNK> ties ' after a string of direct to video <UNK> including <UNK> <UNK> tomatoes eat <UNK> and 'the <UNK> he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand up comedy recently he has been considering a tv comeback br br <UNK> morgan roger is now a major hollywood producer screenwriter he has written and produced several major films and tv series including <UNK> above and <UNK> x <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and most recently <UNK> destination <UNK> br br tony fields sammi started his performing career as a dancer on the tv series <UNK> <UNK> he appeared in several low budget films and tv shows before landing his <UNK> role as the <UNK> sammi <UNK> in <UNK> or <UNK> sadly tony passed away on <UNK> <UNK> 1995 of aids related cancer br br doug <UNK> tim is probably best remembered for his <UNK> role of homosexual <UNK> matt <UNK> on the popular sitcom <UNK> <UNK> since then he has had a long and varied acting career appearing in such films and tv series as 'the <UNK> crime scene <UNK> and the short lived <UNK> <UNK> sci fi series <UNK> currently he can be seen as tom <UNK> on the smash hit series <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i'm not usually one to <UNK> a film i try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones but in this case there are almost no good points in my opinion if you're going to make something that bad why bother part of the film is take up with shots of <UNK> face while she <UNK> deeply and <UNK> music plays in the background the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting rupert <UNK> jones is <UNK> jennifer <UNK> plays <UNK> younger sister with modern mannerisms anne is portrayed as being meek and self <UNK> which is fine at the beginning but she stays the same all through the film and you see no reason for captain <UNK> to fall in love with her overall the production lacks any sense of period with too many mistakes to be overlooked such as running out of the concert kissing in the street running about in the streets with no hat on why was this scene in the film at all the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written to sum it up a terrible film very disappointing
<START> five years on from the <UNK> survivors returning home and from <UNK> double edged well that's that br br it's now 1950 reunion time the <UNK> all here marion <UNK> <UNK> kate dorothy christina <UNK> and <UNK> maggie and alice the story that unfolds is a <UNK> as perfectly written and acted and as thought provoking and moving as the original series br br all the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here from <UNK> family to <UNK> health centre everything has changed in five years and not everything has changed for the best br br a trip to <UNK> plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge of the seat tension there's a real sense of tragedy and disaster as once again fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives <UNK> finally shows her true colours and there are some shout at the telly moments of drama br br lush location filming in <UNK> and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends it's such a shame that this really is the end i could watch it all over again perfection
<START> is rich <UNK> elizabeth taylor <UNK> the angel of death on her island <UNK> in the <UNK> or is she just <UNK> or more precisely overacting as usual actually both are <UNK> in director joseph <UNK> wandering meandering mess called boom appropriately titled since <UNK> in the lush <UNK> setting are nearly ready to explode richard burton climbs <UNK> mountain <UNK> she dresses him in a <UNK> <UNK> complete with <UNK> though great looking in widescreen the picture is otherwise quite deadly a failure even liz <UNK> dick <UNK> should <UNK> the <UNK> collective what the hell attitude to their late '60s film careers reached an ego mad <UNK> here pointless confused and <UNK> boom is a catastrophe although screenwriter <UNK> williams who adapted his own <UNK> play the milk train doesn't stop here anymore was said to be quite fond of it from
<START> i saw this movie when it was released and my <UNK> for it has stuck with me all these years br br here's why br br <UNK> goal seems to be to take every literary image in the <UNK> and make it literal if a character were to say my heart takes flight we'd be shown an actual human heart with <UNK> wings attached <UNK> across the screen br br this process makes for some lush <UNK> but ultimately it's a <UNK> exercise and it becomes deadly boring br br i don't <UNK> the pleasure other viewers found in this movie but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was <UNK>
<START> when i first saw this show i thought it looked interesting i watched it saw how it <UNK> around sarah like the character sees the world revolving around her i got it but wasn't laughing very much br br <UNK> and in her show she's racist crude <UNK> and hugely self centered i didn't get her at first and took it all at face value then i got to see her movie jesus is magic i think that served as a sarah silverman <UNK> for me explaining to me just what <UNK> she's speaking she's like marilyn <UNK> working so hard to give us a <UNK> of horrible ideas and images but you eventually realise it isn't an assault it's a statement and once you understand that you find you're glad someone's finally giving it to you straight br br i don't mean to suggest only smart people will understand or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy while i like a lot of <UNK> shows i still to this day do not see the humor of <UNK> your enthusiasm i get the impression that it's good but i just don't get it many people will never get the sarah silverman program but i'm glad i eventually came around br br the creators of this show do work hard every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot but with songs or dream sequences production numbers these people aren't putting together something to fill a time <UNK> and please <UNK> they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together if i was to predict the future of this show i'd say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks <UNK> it will get canceled before it's time and live on in <UNK> hearts and on dvd but take heart <UNK> creators your audience is out there and we'll be watching for as long as they let you make the show
<START> the lion king is without a doubt my favorite disney movie of all time so i figured maybe i should give the sequels a chance and i did lion king 1 1 2 was pretty good and had it's good laughs and fun with timon and <UNK> only problem i feel sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create plot holes and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation well i would highly recommend this movie for lion king fans or just a night with the family it's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first so hopefully i'll get the same with the third installment to the lion king series sit back and just think <UNK> <UNK> it means no <UNK> br br 8 10
<START> watching david <UNK> is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to sunday school despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining the studio system had its faults but it <UNK> no expense when a lavish production was called for peck portrays king david as a <UNK> but tormented poet who commits what is <UNK> to murder to bed a sexy <UNK> susan <UNK> raymond massey as the prophet nathan delivers his usual <UNK> and <UNK> performance look for the silent screen star francis x <UNK> as king <UNK> and a young <UNK> <UNK> as a dancer <UNK> for the old testament and hollywood
<START> i remember parker posey on as the world turns before she became the queen of the independent movies in this film posey shows her potential as a top <UNK> actress in this film with supporting cast that includes omar <UNK> as <UNK> a <UNK> immigrant who works as a <UNK> salesman on the street who <UNK> to become a teacher the supporting cast features a wonderful actress who plays her <UNK> and only family relative as judy the <UNK> who is old fashioned dedicated and <UNK> posey as mary learns that she has to grow up and mature losing her <UNK> clerk position makes her realize how much she misses it as a place in her life <UNK> life is surrounded by friends in the lower east side village of new york city before it became <UNK> with <UNK> this film is quite good for an independent and i have come to enjoy parker posey as mary as well as other characters in other films
<START> yesterday was earth day april 22 2009 in the us and other countries and i went to see the full feature movie version of earth by <UNK> i guess like the auto <UNK> disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet maybe they really do care about the planet i don't know but i don't think it <UNK> a special unit with the word nature in it i do know that my youngest daughter loves mickey mouse and who am i to tell a one year old my personal feelings about disney br br aside from incredible cinematography it was a typical disney disappointment for me <UNK> by a half dozen disney movie trailers <UNK> with disney cliché circle of life falling with style over dramatic music recycled footage disney claims 40 new footage i was even starting to think that james earl jones narration is getting a bit boring i like james earl jones but his work for disney and morgan freeman doing every warner brothers narrative starts to wear thin i really think that disney bought some bbc nature photography that was so spectacularly done they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some <UNK> music and recognizable sound bites on it br br and what is disney's obsession with showing <UNK> chasing and killing baby animals there were a half dozen such scenes complete with <UNK> youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out i think disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents i was also <UNK> of how disney stopped well short of <UNK> that man had anything to do with the climate change are they so afraid of the tiny minority of <UNK> that they think it's still a controversial subject br br i recommend skipping this one and renting the blue planet dvds on netflix nature films seem to be best done by the british at the moment
<START> this movie had some <UNK> <UNK> but it's an old story that simply could never happen navy <UNK> could never break down that much that a crew much less an <UNK> could ever go that far against the captain i'll take dr <UNK> any day if i wish to see this plot <UNK> the us navy did not support this film
<START> it has said that the movies and baseball both <UNK> during the great depression it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the <UNK> a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball br br likewise an occasional <UNK> of 2 or 3 hours into the <UNK> <UNK> of the cinema the presence of a radio in just about everyone's house hold kept depression era america at once <UNK> to world's events and provided many a drama and especially comedy shows for a pleasant <UNK> from harsh reality br br the literature of the time also <UNK> at all levels the juvenile reading <UNK> helped to create the comic book as we know it what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures but the comic book just did not magically appear all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages all by itself there were <UNK> that were <UNK> to them obviously the newspaper comic strip was one parent providing the visual narrative method of story telling br br the other direct <UNK> was the pulp magazine the <UNK> <UNK> story <UNK> that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going though not necessarily <UNK> tales the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice <UNK> tarzan and <UNK> <UNK> zorro the 1930's brought forth a <UNK> crop as feature characters like the shadow the <UNK> <UNK> battle <UNK> and the spider master of men all found their way to the news stands among many others br br one other was doc savage a full blooded super hero of the written story the covers of the <UNK> had perhaps the only picture of the hero <UNK> extraordinary strength super keen senses and a <UNK> genius class intellect doc was the prototype super hero br br he also assembled 5 of his former army buddies into a small free <UNK> team of <UNK> each of them was an expert in a given field so we had a top rated <UNK> lawyer construction engineer <UNK> engineer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc br br the doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930's and <UNK> and were published into the middle <UNK> then they went into a <UNK> for a good 12 15 years then the <UNK> came about to <UNK> the old novels in new <UNK> the <UNK> book a fresh look to the cover art was introduced featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc with a <UNK> ripped shirt br br the re introduction proved to be highly successful with the <UNK> of a title a month and for a while more soon there was a <UNK> of a doc savage movie but when by what producer well the <UNK> man of <UNK> was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together it was veteran stop action animator and producer of top special effects films <UNK> pal who did the film along with warner brothers br br when doc savage man of <UNK> arrived in the movie houses it <UNK> of a well casted team of actors albeit a largely no name as far <UNK> with the viewers with former tarzan of tv ron <UNK> nearly perfect casting in the lead up and coming beauty of a <UNK> pamela <UNK> in the female lead and veteran character paul <UNK> as the villainous captain <UNK> no other name would have been recognized and just maybe that was a plus in this case br br the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience <UNK> with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going use of narration by paul <UNK> and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story br br from the very start there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of <UNK> camp humor as the batman tv series some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual <UNK> are thrown toward humor by the paul <UNK> narration and the unexpected unlikely <UNK> for example an experiment of <UNK> with a <UNK> rocket missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish a small one at that the whole story unfolds like that hitting the viewer with a little <UNK> every so often as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously we are also puzzled about mr george <UNK> being the producer his last he who had been so well known for special effects surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci fi action setting of the pulp character's world br br i can remember seeing it quite vividly mrs ryan deanna was in the hospital just having given birth to our 2nd child michelle <UNK> 14 75 our older girl jennifer was visiting her grandmother so after visiting hours were over in the <UNK> ward it was straight over to the old <UNK> theatre <UNK> <UNK> here in chicago br br having seen it and being a guy with a good <UNK> with doc i was sort of let down by the final product i could accept a little of this <UNK> business but would not have <UNK> if mr pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and <UNK> to give it all a little more pulp comic serial type excitement br br and yet the cast headed up by mr <UNK> and the others made the whole film likable if not lovable the sets and locations were as far as we can see very much like those of a <UNK> serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone br br and maybe that's just what they were trying for with this doc savage man of <UNK>
<START> the gangster genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody in retrospect the series is a <UNK> of previous clichés that have been <UNK> in it's genre thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it the sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it's content with psychological depth that is <UNK> with subtle nuance humor and <UNK> violence the key protagonist tony soprano is perceived as a <UNK> general <UNK> of fear and moral values by his crew however tony is of two <UNK> one which is <UNK> while the other is conflicted with guilt and <UNK> with out any <UNK> or <UNK> i still <UNK> believe that the sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory all things considered i could make an elaborate statement on the series but i won't if ever there is a visual <UNK> in global <UNK> search for these <UNK> vital ambiguous <UNK> epic <UNK> and the sopranos <UNK> <UNK> will be smiling right back at you
<START> sadly this is not 'the best british gore film since <UNK> though the dvd cover claims this which is what tricked me into buying it it is however an homage to many of the great horrors of old films from most notably the <UNK> stable br br cradle is shot on mini <UNK> which though we all know has more of a tv feel than a movie can be done so much better every scene set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way standard key fill rear setup which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece the gore content is quite frankly laughable from the opening shots where we see a man's obviously <UNK> rubber head torn apart through to tacky cheap prop <UNK> the creature effects and the terrible cg there was nothing in there that impressed me at all br br the acting is <UNK> from the near <UNK> detective to the <UNK> dwarf via dani filth the least convincing horror movie bad guy i have ever witnessed each of the <UNK> is more formulaic than the last and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs look out for the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside and the most bizarre and not in a good way padded cell i have seen br br it took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering <UNK> running away at any available opportunity i actually found myself <UNK> at one point while the film was running br br it does however mark one of the last known appearances of emily <UNK> breasts which i guess is one um two things it has going for it once that's out of the way though it is all downhill br br i've heard people say good things about alex <UNK> and i would love to believe them but on this evidence i'm not likely to if you want a decent homage to <UNK> avoid this and go for the league of gentlemen christmas special instead br br currently battling it out with blair witch 2 book of shadows for the title of worst film i have ever seen
<START> this movie is <UNK> of the omen title it is so bad that it has actually damaged the classic nature of the first three it never should have been made they ought to change the title br br they don't even spell <UNK> <UNK> name correctly and there are no <UNK> the most important element of all the omen films pull it from the shelves and burn it
<START> visual creative epic of <UNK> style br br this film may neither have the most alternative <UNK> nor the most artistic acting but who <UNK> to say this film is no art i'm not a <UNK> of the idea that an important film must be serious non commercial or bothering me with questions even there are a lot of films <UNK> to this attributes that i like br br bogus journey for sure is not one of this films what you get is pure excessive creativity with a very positive charged <UNK> energy this film doesn't reflect reality its friendly naive and <UNK> imagine the world of the future described by <UNK> for me it would be a pretty nice time place combination to live in except of that music br br technically bogus <UNK> is very well made i always liked the cinematography and the <UNK> of this movie especially in this point bogus journey tops its prequel by far also the effects are good and i think most of them very made without cgi i generally prefer the good old effects in big budget movies sure its <UNK> another hollywood <UNK> out of some peoples view but i think it is this in a very charismatic way br br a short word to the soundtrack all the band and <UNK> music fits very well into the film also the sound design has no lack i am not a big fan of rock music but i had to get this track by <UNK> from the scene <UNK> builds the bill and ted robots in the van i love the <UNK> camera work at its beginning br br let me conclude saying this br br this film is very naive and very imaginative it is way better than <UNK> <UNK> the godfather <UNK> or <UNK> the wrath of god it is absolutely superior to citizen kane apocalypse now or chris <UNK> sans <UNK> it is even better than total recall no way yes way br br bill and ted's bogus journey is simply the best movie ever made br br who <UNK> to disagree makes himself guilty of <UNK> <UNK> behavior or likes terminator salvation what is the bigger self <UNK> br br ps part 1 is not the better movie so bogus <UNK> is a superior sequel not even terminator 2 is a superior sequel its not
<START> years ago a movie going friend and i went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred john cassavetes for the <UNK> john <UNK> was an actor screen writer and director married to actress gena rowlands nominated for oscars three times who wrote and directed a variety of good low budget films using his <UNK> as an actor to keep himself <UNK> up until seeing the <UNK> we did not understand that john cassavetes <UNK> was made from any movie that was offered to him had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether but we did not walk out at the time my friend and i <UNK> <UNK> it was the worst movie ever made now frankly this is not true i have seen many poorly made films on friday nights on <UNK> did i just say that out loud that are far worse than the <UNK> almost any movie starring brian <UNK> is by definition a worse movie than the <UNK> certainly santa claus <UNK> the martians is a worse movie than the <UNK> however i have since consistently used the <UNK> as a <UNK> below which i do not want to fall when talking to this friend about a movie i may have seen i will always remark that it was better or worse than the <UNK> br br http <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> <UNK>  whether written visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters readers and viewers after all can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who this is especially true in film i think simply because we cannot easily go back to <UNK> our memory in a cinema viewers like myself however don't have that problem because we see all our films on dvd or vhs br br a year ago i was introduced to audrey <UNK> a french actress whom i first saw in the fabulous destiny of <UNK> <UNK> 2001 and later in a very long engagement 2004 both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters this earlier offering <UNK> the others in both ways more characters and more complexity br br now other directors have used those techniques before robert altman with the player 1992 short cuts 1993 <UNK> park 2001 and others paul thomas anderson did the same with <UNK> 1999 stanley kramer did it with a mad mad mad mad world in 1963 a comedy of almost epic proportions the difference with this film is first the director lets us <UNK> inside the head of some of the characters and second some scenes are repeated as means to <UNK> the viewer's memory as the story flip <UNK> between different time periods br br the basic  the core so to speak  story concerns a young woman irene <UNK> who is told by a fellow <UNK> on a train that she will meet her true love on that day this occurs in the first few minutes of the film the clever irony at this point is that irene doesn't realize that the young man opposite gilbert robin may be that <UNK> true <UNK> and nor does he br br they go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter however chaos results throughout the rest of the day not only for the two young people but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and <UNK> vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere and yet br br if the story were simply that it could tend to be boring and even quite predictable not so the script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too <UNK> but which are turned into believable extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again for example the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours consider your <UNK> two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before irene and her man of destiny meet again or what about a stone chip flying onto your <UNK> consider again what would happen br br all of that is interesting enough what was more interesting for me was <UNK> each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was the one for irene or whether it was in fact the young man on the train that kept me guessing for a while br br i'll let you think about that should you see this delightful romp br br recommended for all
<START> that's right you heard me this movie is a <UNK> abomination first off the band who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called the naked brothers band not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians they can't even play anything also the lead singer sounds more <UNK> than <UNK> lee and even more his voice is horrible not only are they terrible musicians but they're terrible actors led by a crappy director and thin plot this has got to be the dumbest movie ever i wish this website would let you use a vote of zero or below out of 10 because giving this filth a 1 10 is being way too generous br br i'm not sure that you can call this a comedy film if you're looking for comedy with music go to that weird al <UNK> guy 'cause he does it a whole lot better than these <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i have been waiting for this movie a long time especially because <UNK> <UNK> is in this she's a great actress br br this movie contains six stories it's a new concept flew over from hollywood so it's not a new item br br 1 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a dancer she wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news <UNK> be interested in her but then <UNK> salman khan appears and he claims to be her boyfriend br br <UNK> <UNK> is still not a good actress when she yells i get annoyed salman khan cannot play comic roles but in his serious parts he is marvelous br br 2 <UNK> anil kapoor is married to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he gets in a <UNK> crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman with forgetting what he really has in life his wife and kids br br anil kapoor en <UNK> are natural born actors actresses they are great but this story is to thin for them br br 3 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is going to get married to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off br br 4 <UNK> <UNK> abraham is married to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she gets an accident and suffers a memory loss now she doesn't know that she loves her husband anymore br br 5 <UNK> govinda is a cab driver he meets <UNK> shannon <UNK> who is a white woman who is in love with an indian male but he is about to get married with an indian woman <UNK> has to bring <UNK> to that man but falls in love with her br br i never liked <UNK> movies he is very annoying not funny but in this movie i liked him very much like he has been growing up the last years br br 6 oh yes there is <UNK> khan he plays ram <UNK> who is just married to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he want to get some serious action with her but every time her family comes in between br br <UNK> khan is not a handsome actor but he is funny i like his movies br br now here's the problem all these stories aren't interesting to make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting here and there the stories touch each other but is not significant for the characters br br my conclusion <UNK> cannot act loose that woman in the bollywood industry <UNK> khan should make more movies this role for him was too small salman khan cannot act comic roles but real serious movies that's written on his life as an actor this movie sucks and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like anil kapoor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and john abraham br br it's just like you have the ability to make a movie with amitabh bachchan and you only let him sing a <UNK>
<START> wow this was a great italian zombie movie by two great director's <UNK> fulci zombie and bruno <UNK> hell of the living dead lucio started this movie and was ill so the great bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than i expected it to turn out so if you have seen hell of the living dead directed by bruno <UNK> and if you saw zombie directed by lucio fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great zombie make up witch equals great looking zombies has a funny zombie flying head and zombie birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a zombie that only <UNK> to two people but they are mainly just the great toxic zombies like in bruno <UNK> hell of the living dead so if you like italian zombie movies or just zombie movie's in general than check this one out its a great italian zombie movie
<START> it was a decent movie i actually kind of enjoyed it but the ending is so abrupt there is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends what happens after the concert what happens with her boyfriend does she hook up with grant does she come <UNK> in the next <UNK> and what about angela obviously <UNK> performance would knock angela down a few <UNK> but nothing is shown to indicate how she <UNK> there is so much left up in the air and it's very unsatisfying i don't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke i was very disappointed
<START> this movie is an embarrassment to film making i can't believe it was even listed as a comedy not funny not only was the script atrocious but the casting people should be shot <UNK> <UNK> is just a great actress but beyond that 99 of the rest of the cast <UNK> pretty much everyone else wow it is hard to even wow here is the number one rule about comedy don't try to be funny there are a lot of very talented actors in canada who can do drama and comedy none of them were used in this film canadian <UNK> and casting directors are helping to <UNK> bad film making in canada i realize this is technically a us film but look at the director actors location etc i just saw this on bravo they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film again there are a lot of great films out there that can't get <UNK> and they show this crap
<START> after the initial shock of realizing the guts of mr branagh to film this i was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic just ahead of me i was not disappointed so true to shakespeare and yet so accessible it blew my mind i always enjoy seeing or rather listening to branagh and it made me wonder is this movie dubbed in other countries that would be like painting a <UNK> on the <UNK> lisa
<START> you may say to yourself don johnson as elvis can that work is it possible seems like an terrible choice to me but perhaps i should have an open mind maybe i'll be surprised maybe he can pull it off br br not br br don johnson is not a bad actor but he is an awful elvis he's too short too weak voiced too <UNK> featured well you've already imagined how bad he would be add to that a hokey black wig and heavy handed eye liner and <UNK> and it's a big fat embarrassing mess br br the best i can say is that since <UNK> acting is decent and since his <UNK> is so far off after a while you don't even think of him as elvis anymore you see him as some other crazed pop star instead then on that level the movie becomes watchable br br stephanie <UNK> is also not <UNK> cast as the tall beauty queen linda thompson but she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty <UNK> and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles there may be too much intelligence in her performance you have to be kind of a <UNK> to stick with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br there's nothing new to this story we've heard it many times before if you've looking for new info or insight you won't find it it's told as a love story an <UNK> one linda for elvis and elvis for drugs
<START> i remember a certain <UNK> the morning of 18 6 <UNK> to be exact i was <UNK> off trying to convince myself to get out of bed when a horrific explosion was heard i went to the kitchen where i have a view of several <UNK> in the southern <UNK> and saw a <UNK> of smoke rising from a distant point the sight of the smoke was followed a minute later by the <UNK> of <UNK> i remember <UNK> to my bedroom taking out my <UNK> racing back to the kitchen and <UNK> the image of a glass <UNK> bus the bus was still near the pick up station where a terrorist <UNK> on it and with a single click on a <UNK> device murdered 25 passengers many of whom were on their way to school the wife of a good friend of mine sat on the bus at the back row a seemingly <UNK> and meaningless decision that saved her life br br i'm sure that every israeli has at least one terror related memory he wishes he never would have had and it was only a matter of time before someone made a film about it as it turned out the movie was about to become a repressed memory of its own br br the film is about a play write on a dry run <UNK> <UNK> portrayed by hmmm <UNK> <UNK> who also wrote and directed the film that spends the better part of his day <UNK> staring <UNK> with his blank word <UNK> page in the meantime his girlfriend a field reporter for the israeli commercial channel decides to make a piece about a debt ridden ex army officer <UNK> bored and a bit paranoid due what is <UNK> known as the what on earth this hot babe is dating me syndrome asks a private eye to conduct a <UNK> on his girlfriend br br as the detective progresses in his investigation his observations are <UNK> into the play and later on to the lives of its actors in the meantime the play <UNK> from a comic play into an <UNK> against the <UNK> of the israeli society as for the movie well the movie becomes an exercise in frenzy editing <UNK> in its petty cardboard characters and <UNK> dialogs while <UNK> miles away from the subject it was supposed to deal with in the first place br br when i say cardboard characters i refer to the characters that under the writer director's obsession for a meaningful film were devoid of any genuine dialogs and any shred of <UNK> i won't elaborate too much about it suffice to say that i'm sure that homeless <UNK> male prostitutes rarely go the theater with the intention to see a play that is br br this movie according to <UNK> <UNK> himself is the first part of a current agenda trilogy i sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from the experiences like the one i wrote about in the beginning of my review as opposed to the secluded world of characters that are anything but existent and a plot that is anything but compelling br br 4 out of 10 in my <UNK> br br p s this movie was a landmark in <UNK> it was shot in ten days all the cast worked for free and the entire cost of the film was about 12 000 no i didn't <UNK> a zero or two twelve thousand dollars makes you wonder why it took <UNK> 000 to complete blair witch project
<START> <UNK> tells the tale of a young waitress named <UNK> <UNK> armstrong who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend mary <UNK> <UNK> is killed by a werewolf you see werewolves actually exist in modern day america there is even a special <UNK> within the police force to fight the werewolf threat headed up by detective steve <UNK> ryan <UNK> who has the difficult task of telling <UNK> that she is in fact a pure blooded werewolf herself that a so called <UNK> <UNK> werewolf kane <UNK> wants to mate with her create a new breed of pure blood werewolves that will take over the entire world or something like that understandably <UNK> has a hard time believing it that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes it's up to werewolf cop steve to save <UNK> the day the world br br co executive produced directed richard <UNK> i thought <UNK> was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn't really do anything for me the script by geoffrey alan <UNK> starts out <UNK> enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show then there's a werewolf attack which leaves someone <UNK> everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it's pretty much down hill all the way i'm afraid for a start it's slow going it's dull it's predictable it's populated with highly annoying character's who come out with lots of bad dialogue do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the werewolf they don't i have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead the script is dumb doesn't explain itself why has <UNK> never turned into a werewolf before is she really the only one why can't this <UNK> <UNK> find another female werewolf there are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half way through but you get the idea anyway as a whole the film <UNK> along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is <UNK> to say the least br br director <UNK> lights the film quite well with bright <UNK> but this is noting new or original doesn't really improve the film as a spectacle now let's talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in <UNK> are far from special the werewolf transformation is achieved using cgi it's among the worst looking cgi i've ever seen seriously a <UNK> would be embarrassed about these computer graphics it's easily the worst werewolf transformation i've ever seen an american werewolf in london 1981 was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light years ahead of the ones seen in <UNK> who says special effects have improved over the years the <UNK> puppet effects aren't much better either although at least there's something <UNK> on screen the gore isn't up to much after a gory opening kill there's some blood splatter plenty of dead bodies but not much else <UNK> a fair amount of female nudity if that's your thing but don't get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it is it really worth it br br technically <UNK> is alright apart from possibly the worst cgi effect ever it's reasonably well made it at least seems to have production values the acting is what you'd expect really br br <UNK> is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that <UNK> video shop shelves clutter the <UNK> of obscure cable tv stations i didn't think it was as bad as some but it's like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said done they're both horrible still
<START> the brothers <UNK> are directors judging by conventional thought should have stuck to making short films i myself actually really liked their first feature <UNK> <UNK> but judging by their <UNK> effort the piano <UNK> of <UNK> i'm willing to agree they don't come close to <UNK> their past genius at feature length piano <UNK> is without a doubt a gorgeous film to look at and often to listen to unfortunately it's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and <UNK> pace reading the plot synopsis it sounds like a pretty good story but the brothers fail miserably to bring it to life one thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future dialogue my god it's awful here a huge bust
<START> this would be the worst film i'd ever seen hmmm ok maybe tied with boogeyman then awful truly awful br br i had low expectations and it failed to meet them i honestly cant think of one good thing so here are the worst points br br 1 the acting 2 the plot 3 the cgi <UNK> <UNK> has better graphics seriously 4 the plot 5 the dialogue and finally 6 the plot br br there are so many unanswered questions did they make a 2 <UNK> hour long movie then realize they hadn't put lex luthor and superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than <UNK> son and the henchman he kills br br was half the budget spent on <UNK> kevin spacey to do it br br when superman goes to hospital why don't the doctors ask what the f do you want us to do he's a f ing alien we don't know jack about his <UNK> br br what happened in the 5 years superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years br br where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie br br and finally why just why br br btw for those of you wondering how come superman could lift an entire continent of <UNK> i think i've figured it out br br since superman is <UNK> by the <UNK> till he sees something green in the rocks it is clearly all in his head therefore the continent thing is just him <UNK> his fear of shiny green rock br br either that or the writers are slack <UNK> half wits who didn't think that was a fairly obvious mistake
<START> as a popular sport surfing was liked by many people just after watched the documentary i realized how dangerous it could be in fact the surfers also scared of big waves even somebody got killed by it but they still kept on surfing and enjoyed themselves only brave people can do it br br according to what the surfers said we can clearly knew what they felt when the big wave came at them you have to <UNK> to your best and avoid direct strike from the big wave when you win it that will obviously bring you huge satisfaction br br the amazing cinematography cannot be overlooked that is absolutely visual enjoyment br br an excellent sports documentary 8 10
<START> wow this movie was so horrible i'm so glad i didn't have to pay money to see this horrible movie it was like a history nut went on a coke <UNK> the previews of it made it look decent but it was really bad i will say the idea sounded decent but come on it was really really bad if u sat down and thought about it you would also realize it was unrealistic come on back in the day u think they had all that stuff to work with it wasn't like ben franklin sat down one day and made a damn <UNK> it was completely ridiculous and it you want to see a bad movie then by all means go see this one all and all horrible movie it might actually be on my top 10 worst films i've ever seen
<START> i am so glad that i got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie i saw it at an independent film festival so don't expect it to come to your town anytime soon during the film i noticed about 10 people get up and walk out too bad for them down here in the south folks don't like having to read subtitles the movie starts out slow but is so rich in dialogue that i never felt bored when the action finally arrives i found myself glued to the screen as if i were riding a roller coaster br br i also got a big kick of the chapter titles appearing before the chapters especially the ones that introduce the characters as they appear on screen it reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> of time when you face level bosses br br if this is the future of video game comic book movies then i welcome it
<START> a wonderful film to watch with astonishing scenes and talented actors such as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> after 15 minutes of watching your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting what the destiny will bring to the characters this film makes you leave your position as a standard audience it takes you in it makes you a part of the story costumes and settings are brilliant especially the district of the <UNK> is <UNK> built it is definitely not very <UNK> kurosawa however it still gets a lot from the master especially the <UNK> story telling tells us we're in a distinguished land of cinema which is quite far from <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a pale shadow of a great musical this movie suffers from the fact that the director richard attenborough completely misses the point of the musical needlessly opens it up and <UNK> the thrust of the play the show is about a group of dancers <UNK> for a job in a <UNK> musical and <UNK> their drive desire to work in this demanding and not always rewarding line of work attenborough gives us a fresh faced cast of <UNK> assuming that they are trying to get their big break in show business rather than presenting the <UNK> mix of characters created on stage as a group of working <UNK> living show to show along with a couple of <UNK> the film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of <UNK> down to the 16 17 on the line depending on how you count cassie who is <UNK> kept out of the line in the movie anyone who can catch a local <UNK> light opera production of the play will have a much <UNK> experience than seeing this poorly conceived film
<START> barbara stanwyck as a real tough cookie a waitress to the working classes and prostitute at the hands of her father who escapes to new york city and uses her feminine <UNK> to get a <UNK> job moving on to <UNK> and <UNK> and later as assistant secretary to the second in command at the bank dramatic study of a female character <UNK> to be <UNK> has lost none of its power over the years with barbara acting up a storm portraying a woman who learns to be a first rate actress herself <UNK> a little <UNK> philosophy into her messed up life this lady <UNK> out sentiment all right but she never loses our fascination our awe she's a plain spoken hard boiled broad but she's not a bitch nor is she a man eater or woman <UNK> this gal is all out for herself and as we wait for her to eventually learn about real values in life her journey up and down the ladder of success provides <UNK> sexy entertainment john wayne with thick black hair and too much eye make up does well in an early role as the assistant in the file office though all the supporting players are quite good from
<START> although bette davis did a wonderful job as mildred i felt that the film wasn't the best i had seen at the end of the movie i was left feeling like there was something missing in it br br bette davis did a perfect job though and she made me hate her and pity her all the while leslie howard did very good as the <UNK> philip carey and i so <UNK> him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame it's such a sad thing when one finds him herself in love with a bad seed and especially if it's someone like <UNK> carey who is a sensitive person though pathetic br br in the end the acting was what came through and not the plot the ending scene was particularly good but i am not one to give it away although others may find this movie good i was one who found it so so i should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person
<START> this movie was charming an <UNK> wants more from life than the <UNK> conventional success what makes it work so well and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really isn't about becoming great it is simply about finding a way to express one's self the big triumph at the end is not the winning of a contest not the discovery of a whole new life style but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life no one is discovering their passion they are finding their quiet soul br br the japanese background makes the subtle <UNK> and secret life of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal we can all see ourselves in the <UNK>
<START> the thief of bagdad is a treasure first and foremost it is a good story though my four children's primary exposure to this tale the most famous of the stories of the <UNK> nights comes from the disney corporation the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end the story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability <UNK> who plays the young thief abu also <UNK> up to any of today's teen actors in appeal judging from the number of times i heard my oldest daughter say he's c u t e br br in 1940 the film won oscars for cinematography and special effects today of course those effects seem very dated look it's <UNK> flying through the air <UNK> my daughter at the sight of the genie flying yet they fit into the story well the film is after all over 60 years old the effects fit with the script furthermore what ones sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state of the art for the next twenty five years one need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 star trek episode to see this in that it was quite an achievement br br this qualifies as a family film though there are a few <UNK> near the end the acting is so obvious and the wounds so <UNK> as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation br br all in all a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment or for the historical value of the effects i recommend it
<START> the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film it is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements take for instance the switch between black white and color if done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a <UNK> and only <UNK> from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's the ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was <UNK> everything had to turn out right in the end i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time i'm glad i watched this in class and not on my own time i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob <UNK> music those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick i hope you take my advice and stay away from this
<START> i admit that i am a vampire addict i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten i was very impressed by the original john carpenter's vampires and when i <UNK> there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it this movie does not <UNK> quite the same rules as the first and it is not quite so dark but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original br br jon bon <UNK> was very good as derek bliss his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives one of my favourite parts was just after he meets <UNK> and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems his comments are beautifully <UNK> and yet <UNK> practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds br br the other cast members were also well chosen and they <UNK> nicely to produce an entertaining and original film it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme br br if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else
<START> i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen king's books this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable br br i have just finished <UNK> it for about the <UNK> time and i still find it heart wrenching as well as scary br br the scene where gage is on a sure <UNK> course with the monster truck is one which stands out and the no fair <UNK> by little <UNK> hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance br br
<START> the best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect it's like watching a professional wrestling match or a day time soap opera or a jerry springer show you immediately can follow the skimpy plot identify the cardboard characters and watch in satisfaction while all the cliches are being <UNK> however at times the director does something real unexpected it may be something extraordinarily stupid or something weird or something insightful the director <UNK> is up there with the best camp directors and this is his best movie br br in <UNK> <UNK> everything seems to come together there's nothing good about it but still manages to be a coherent whole not once does the movie slow down the action flows on and punches keep on coming br br the <UNK> thing is that there's no sense of time some characters seem to take months doing something while other characters have only spent one hour at a bar this is partially due to <UNK> summer where the sun never sets so you don't experience the day turning into a night at all br br finally there is a plot there somewhere you may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it though
<START> i've been going through the <UNK> list of the top 100 comedies and i must say that this is truly one of the worst not just of the 90 movies on the list i've seen but of any movie i've ever seen <UNK> are funny sometimes dudley isn't <UNK> almost made it worthwhile but alas just go watch arrested development if you want to see her in something good seriously dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny i would highly recommend almost any other movie on the <UNK> top 100 comedies for more laughs than this if you want to see a funnier drunk try the thin man funnier movie in general any marx brothers movie will kill especially if you're as drunk as arthur
<START> the film picks up after last years remake with the military setting up electronic <UNK> equipment in the desert where the attacks in the first film happened the crew is killed not long before a group of soldiers on a training exercise show up to find no one around you can fill in the rest br br this is a paycheck picture all around there seems to be no passion in anyone's performances nor in anyone behind the camera this is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else on some level this should have worked it could have been a more horrific southern comfort where national <UNK> run <UNK> of some people in the <UNK> but instead its not much of anything in large part you can blame the script written unbelievably in part by wes craven which hits the same old targets again and again add to the mess the fact that the direction is dull and the set up of sequences is so lack <UNK> as to remove any inherent tension in any scene br br its not bad as such but badly made and dull let me put my feelings into context the reason i saw this film was because a local <UNK> screwed up and ran this film instead of the kids flick the last <UNK> and i wanted to see what caused the out cry i mean the films have so much in common he says <UNK> i'm convinced that this film will only scare those who like the last <UNK>
<START> my interest was raised as i was flipping through and saw the name <UNK> my name is <UNK> so i thought ok lets see what this is i am so glad i stayed on the channel what a wonderful wonderful story drama sadness some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had i watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over give <UNK> a try and i hope you will enjoy it as much as i did i have even gotten my children 27 25 20 and 17 to enjoy it it starts slow however the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story watching this lovely film made me want to <UNK> myself in more greek tragedy and pathos
<START> bette <UNK> <UNK> performance is such that it is hard to remember the other female players they were as perfect in their parts as davis was in hers they just didn't have as much to do some of the reviewers felt that the book was so much better it was but to give the film it's due to <UNK> a <UNK> page book down to <UNK> minutes is no mean feat the first part of the book didn't even make it to the screen it told of <UNK> childhood then moved to germany and paris where phillip had gone to try to make good as an artist it also chronicles his first romance with <UNK> price who kills herself when she realises phillip cannot return her feelings of love it is a wonderful book but rambling and i think that anyone who does not think too highly of the film should read the book and will realise how good the film is br br after <UNK> that he will only ever be a mediocre painter phillip carey leslie howard comes back to england hoping to take up medicine when out at a <UNK> he meets a <UNK> waitress mildred bette davis even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like dirt phillip is obsessed it is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any <UNK> in this vicious <UNK> in one scene she promises to meet him in a second class <UNK> waiting room when they almost miss each other she <UNK> him with why would i wait in a second class waiting room when there is a first class one available you just want to shake him the only time she is pleasant to him is when she tells him she is going to marry another man a coarse sales man <UNK> miller alan hale with mildred out of the picture he meets nora kay johnson a lovely woman who writes romantic novels under a male <UNK> she jokes about the popularity the books enjoy among servants in the novel he had seen mildred reading them nora gives phillip all the love and confidence he needs but he is incapable of returning her love when mildred returns miller didn't marry her and she is having a baby of course he takes care of her and helps her with the baby in the film it is treated as an object always called baby never given a name or gender she <UNK> him by running off with his best friend br br at the hospital he meets sally <UNK> frances dee who is visiting her sick father he begins to visit her home and for the first time in his life gets a sense of family then surprise surprise mildred returns like a bad penny and surprise philip takes her in but he has changed and feels only disgust when she tries to show <UNK> the only way she knows how then follows one of the most vicious verbal fights on film with phrases such as you <UNK> you dirty <UNK> i only <UNK> you because you <UNK> me and when you went i wiped my mouth i wiped my mouth in the book a lot of <UNK> stock phrases such as you're a gentleman in every sense of the word i don't mind and mr high and mighty were associated with prostitutes and when phillip meets her for the first time he is struck by that br br the end of the film shows phillip being truly free of mildred in the only way possible now free to love sally again in the book sally tells phillip that she thinks she is having a baby but that just makes him more sure of his love that ending like <UNK> sickness could not be in the film even a pre code one br br kay johnson was always called on to play sensible believable women which she played to perfection as she was obviously sensible herself her nora was the woman philip should have stayed with frances dee was one of the most beautiful of screen <UNK> she was obviously being <UNK> for stardom with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face the silver <UNK> and blood money but when she married joel <UNK> her career started to peter out her sally did not push her talent to the limits apparently leslie howard was not very helpful to bette davis on the set he was annoyed that an english actress was not given the part he used to throw her her lines whilst reading a book off camera he did start to take an interest when a newspaper reported the kid was running away with the picture br br highly highly recommended
<START> such a long <UNK> movie but it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day from the trailers it looked like a action movie but it turned out to be a out out comedy a bad comedy but one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors they've done their part of the movie very well good acting but i don't think that can save the movie india has been shot beautifully <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were all <UNK> with color alright nevertheless the way the <UNK> beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when i could go there br br action sequences were shot very <UNK> no one could make out head tail of the stunts they've used <UNK> akshay kumar very well but could've been done much much better br br animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies 90's movies had better animation scenes i guess initial scene where the car is falling off <UNK> should be better <UNK> the road into lake br br and the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins just to make sure audiences don't forget the movie name i guess
<START> viewing de <UNK> man aka the fourth man is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience it's a very tight and intense psychological mystery thriller from <UNK> paul verhoeven he directed this film just before he got big with his free ticket to hollywood movie flesh blood in a lot of user comments on this site i noticed the mentioning of alfred hitchcock indeed this movie might very well be <UNK> but i also noticed touches of early <UNK> the visceral <UNK> of david lynch surreal story linked visuals and even roman polanski plot wise set up funny thing is that the movies by those directors i was thinking of while watching de <UNK> man weren't made until after 1983 the year of release of the fourth man so go figure br br very much credit indeed must be given to the story of the original novel by gerard <UNK> this movie is based on gerard <UNK> is also the fictional name of the main character a tormented writer played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the dangerous line of a severe <UNK> now has anybody stopped and thought about the fact that the word <UNK> is french for dream and the film does feature a lot of dream like nightmarish sequences often to that <UNK> that you don't always know for sure if gerard is awake or dreaming himself could this be coincidence maybe it's just me but i don't think so <UNK> <UNK> is pretty amazing as the leading lady in a rather demanding role she sometimes seems to be guilty of over acting in a subtle way but that aspect was clearly intentional to portray the character she plays since as this movie progresses you become unsure about what to actually think of this lady and her intentions proves again what an excellent actress she is i might add that the movie contains also several scenes portraying full frontal male female nudity as well as some rather explicit sex scenes and you will even notice that some scenes and aspects clearly were the <UNK> of scenes later to be shot for verhoeven's basic instinct br br another aspect this movie has is a lot of symbolism and biblical references images which supposedly made the film thoroughly hated by some conservative catholic movements at the time of its european release either way it makes the movie worthy of a second viewing now someone recently told me he had grave <UNK> about de <UNK> man one of them being that the film supposedly <UNK> itself into a position where it needs the divine <UNK> of the virgin mary to resolve itself i myself have big issues with the way <UNK> has been and still is sometimes portrayed in many movies in any genre so not only when it comes to <UNK> themed horror movies but surprisingly i had no <UNK> whatsoever when it comes to the fourth man although the virgin mary aspect in the plot did make me scratch my head at one point i also had fun with it in a way i think the <UNK> as to why it didn't bother me at all is <UNK> because this movie works on two levels although <UNK> <UNK> might have resolved the plot line from the <UNK> point of view on the other hand the movie implies that all this might have been the delirious <UNK> of a raving madman and that's the fun part you never know for sure and then there's the question could it be that gerard <UNK> was somehow receiving distorted visions of things to come like receiving <UNK> at one point in the movie gerard even tries to fool christine into believing he is <UNK> the way he is playing christine in that particular scene is exquisite to behold br br so with its compelling story convincing acting performances and adequate direction de <UNK> man is a very much recommended viewing indeed especially if you enjoy a solid european psychological horror film but make sure you see the original dutch version not the dubbed one
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a fine actor writer and director but maybe a <UNK> misguided to take an <UNK> credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the <UNK> when <UNK> was still learning that it's <UNK> before <UNK> except after <UNK> but like i said <UNK> is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to i'm also gradually <UNK> an <UNK> to charlotte <UNK> who also turns in an accomplished performance if you absolutely insist on knowing the <UNK> is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single this doesn't sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an <UNK> with the sister of a colleague to pose for fifteen thousand <UNK> as his new girlfriend allow the romance to come to <UNK> with a wedding and then <UNK> him thus getting him off the hook naturally they wind up together but along the way there's some sub <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and all things considered it's a pretty <UNK> ninety minutes and performing so well at the french box office that a sequel may not be out of the question
<START> i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister instead i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not scared in many ways still a <UNK> story but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience
<START> <UNK> again from the darkness insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist how strange for most of us to see someone who must work no matter the conditions else his reason for living <UNK> to see <UNK> <UNK> come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely <UNK> this artist creates because he must not for money or fame it is his <UNK> when you see his failures energy seems to <UNK> from his body like a burst hot air balloon it is not the dread of beginning again it is that he takes his energy from his work watching him create just to have nature <UNK> and recall his work is somewhat painful but nonetheless breathtaking he <UNK> flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same when he says he needs the earth but it does not need him i beg to <UNK> only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best
<START> now either you like mr <UNK> humour or you don't me myself and irene had audiences both walking out in <UNK> and on the other hand cheering and <UNK> in <UNK> of <UNK> bruce almighty is a bit more mainstream but you have been warned br br if you're not sure watch the trailer i saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when i saw the film if you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the <UNK> funny don't bother with the movie br br carrey a reporter stuck in a <UNK> covering <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> god when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot god takes up the challenge and asks carrey if he can do better carrey gets into the swing of having all of god's powers by making his girlfriend jennifer aniston 's breasts bigger getting himself promoted and answering everyone's <UNK> by single stroke computer <UNK> br br this is not a <UNK> movie or even that memorable but it is very well made within it's very limited intent provides almost continuous laughs to carrey fans and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be <UNK> to all but the most narrow minded god <UNK> and anti god <UNK> br br on the more thoughtful level the film <UNK> us to <UNK> about <UNK> own career stuck in his <UNK> <UNK> he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two golden <UNK> his most accomplished <UNK> role the man on the moon is less well known that his comedy <UNK> or the truman show on which the academy <UNK> three nominations whilst <UNK> carrey
<START> police story brought hong kong movies to modern day cinema br br jackie plays a policeman who tries to catch some drug dealers and at the same time take care of a young woman from the bad guys and still take care of his relationship with his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> lin br br the movie features plenty of stunts not only from jackie but also from other actors who are now in <UNK> stunt club br br three of <UNK> stunt members went to hospital during filming on the film br br the movie also have some incredible fights scenes like <UNK> car park <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fight ranks as one of <UNK> finest br br the movie also won award for best movie and best action design by jackie chan at hong kong film awards br br everyone who loves jackie chan and or martial art movies <UNK> see this
<START> kalifornia came out in 1993 just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006 this is a nice psycho thriller that should appeal to all david duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent <UNK> that find their ways into his work like with most of his episodes of the x files playing god and red shoe <UNK> br br people who were put off by the heavy southern accent from brad pitt and juliette <UNK> characters obviously have never spent much time in the south for every brian and carrie in the south there is an adele and early and in 2006 that's the real horror of this flick br br aside from that i think the film was written with a cult film intention like with <UNK> photography it's not suitable for mass <UNK> but if you have a copy of this in your personal library i think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies
<START> i saw this film without to know what about were i'm a fan of branagh even more his <UNK> films and in the beginning i saw it only for this and i finished with tears in my eyes because the great great <UNK> values affect and brave philosophy about life of <UNK> girl recommended to people who are bored with tv programming in spain at least
<START> i saw this movie yesterday on turner and i was unable to stop watching until it was over even though i sort of could guess what would happen farrell was great in her role and everyone else did a super job some of it seemed to stretch the limits but all in all i loved it if you get the chance to see it please do i actually cried at a few scenes but then i guess if you are a mom you would loretta is beautiful and i was just in <UNK> at the very idea of their being <UNK> <UNK> there it seemed ahead of its' time i say watch it if you can and don't listen to criticisms as they say i laughed i cried i thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> i f you thought sam <UNK> first film the much <UNK> american beauty was a movie with style to spare wait until you see his highly anticipated second effort the <UNK> grim 30's gangster melodrama road to <UNK> some critics have <UNK> this new movie as a worthy <UNK> to the godfather a <UNK> judgment made by several reviewers taken with mr <UNK> extraordinary technical <UNK> if the <UNK> of movie making are what make a picture great then yes road to <UNK> is a distant cousin to the godfather in terms of what it achieves in cinematography editing music <UNK> and sound what it doesn't have is a <UNK> that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over as with american beauty there is a cold <UNK> feel to this movie despite some very tense scenes involving <UNK> love loyalty and betrayal br br this story of a hit man tom hanks and his relationship to a surrogate father figure who is also his boss an elderly irish mob leader paul newman seems to have been <UNK> from <UNK> gangster movies of years past the father son <UNK> that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for <UNK> the entire enterprise has been very carefully <UNK> and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great <UNK> this is obviously a gangster film hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of only in scenes involving a young boy driving a <UNK> car in a <UNK> edited montage is there any sense of <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> sense of doom br br that being said i have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film indeed it is not an <UNK> to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies i have ever seen veteran cameraman conrad hall will very likely win another oscar for his work here the production 's sets and costumes are just as <UNK> in fact the entire film is a technical marvel mr <UNK> continues to <UNK> with his vivid use of color and he and mr hall again make very dramatic use of red blood <UNK> against pale colored walls all the more effective and <UNK> due to the <UNK> of blacks blues and <UNK> that dominate the movie's color scheme br br if i have failed to <UNK> note the acting it is not because the actors do not <UNK> themselves <UNK> everyone in the film is top notch with special mention going to the two <UNK> bad guys daniel craig is the classic man you love to hate the spoiled <UNK> son of <UNK> gangster father and an almost <UNK> jude law as an especially slimy <UNK> who goes on pursuit of hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half but acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the <UNK> fireworks on display here if a rolls <UNK> was a movie i've no doubt it would look like road to <UNK>
<START> stan ollie become <UNK> at sea when their <UNK> little boat is <UNK> by a vicious murderer br br the boys are wonderful in this feature which starts out with one of their most hilarious set pieces the horn factory always a few steps out of sync with the rest of creation laurel hardy inhabit a world where icy <UNK> <UNK> billy <UNK> are the rule not the exception with its brief length the film is more in style with their classic short subjects which explains its episodic nature br br only the boys get screen credit but movie <UNK> will recognize other familiar faces james <UNK> appears as a loony doctor richard <UNK> does full justice to his bad guy role sweet mary gordon plays the <UNK> <UNK> neighbor that's charlie hall as the apartment house desk clerk and silent screen comic ben <UNK> portrays a most peculiar <UNK> br br one of the film's script writers was silent comedian harry <UNK> br br stan ollie are the main focus however watching hardy go <UNK> at the sound of a horn or <UNK> antics with <UNK> for instance reminds the viewer why these <UNK> remain absolute cinematic giants
<START> this movie came and went in the theaters due to the nature of it you can see why it wasn't well received it was unfairly <UNK> because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself higher learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in america racism br br plot story higher learning is mostly centered around <UNK> played by omar <UNK> a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough and a stern professor played by laurence fishburne he befriends <UNK> ice cube as well as a gorgeous lady named <UNK> <UNK> banks later on they end up having to deal with some <UNK> on campus <UNK> play by michael <UNK> is confused kid who ends up <UNK> some local <UNK> on campus once they <UNK> their views on him he becomes as racist as they are br br opinion higher learning is not without its flaws character development is <UNK> okay performances by omar <UNK> <UNK> banks and the leader of the <UNK> whose name i forgot <UNK> <UNK> doesn't fit in this movie at all plus women turning gay after being abused by men was <UNK> before this film so you know i didn't like that part of the film with <UNK> <UNK> other than that this movie wasn't half bad laurence fishburne was good as professor <UNK> even though i could do without the accent <UNK> was ice <UNK> best performance and michael <UNK> was good as the confused <UNK> all in all it was one of john <UNK> best movies and is one is one of the reasons i <UNK> on the rubbish he puts out now cinema needs more movies like higher learning <UNK> burning and american history x and less movies like baby boy 2 fast 2 furious and a very pointless remake of <UNK>
<START> this review comes nearly 30 years late nevertheless it has to be mentioned that i <UNK> by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight i just had to write about it i got smitten and forgot anything else existed once i saw this movie how ironic it is to see <UNK> <UNK> male protagonist portrayed by the <UNK> man yet what a welcome irony it suited me perfectly and more so because timothy dalton did full justice to his role he delivered an astounding and <UNK> performance i have never seen anything like it all the other actors are very good too the whole movie was put together beautifully i don't care what anyone says about this movie i just love it and love it it made me happy and satisfied it <UNK> me a bit to say this but i prefer jane eyre 1983 to a <UNK> p j which i believe is the ultimate mini series br br the <UNK> from jane eyre <UNK> me a little back in school i never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy the scenes and mr <UNK> voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously which of course is a masterpiece bravo to the whole team and especially to mr dalton this movie is now a part of me br br i give it 10 10 rating
<START> when discussing a movie titled <UNK> on a <UNK> we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot br br what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy they crawl they <UNK> these snakes do nothing of the sort they <UNK> along like they would in a video game they are cartoon snakes i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major <UNK> against real snakes would not find these ones scary br br why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures why not rely on suspense the whole <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> or better still why not just make them look good in the first place and then maybe still use them <UNK> br br take one look at john <UNK> 'the <UNK> here we have real <UNK> and gore of eerie proportions 20 years go by and we get this pile of <UNK> <UNK> crap <UNK> on a <UNK> when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee special effects are going backwards br br sure you could say but the movie is a joke get it sure i'm with that idea but do it well in addition to the above this movie has crap dialogue and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way br br i could handle every other actor being part of this movie except for jackson what was he doing there the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago is this career progression are you offering people value for money no i'd like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie br br the current generation seem to have very low expectations and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want on leaving the cinema i saw a number of <UNK> for some truly horrendous looking future releases including <UNK> dead or alive another cgi animal film called <UNK> <UNK> and another crap looking comedy named <UNK> in addition to that i saw some awful trailers including one for another crap british horror comedy i've truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time br br expect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for <UNK> in 6 months time and if you're expecting to see a black comedy with <UNK> of great looking snakes and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l <UNK> lips forget it
<START> i got this movie out of blockbuster in one of those <UNK> were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks i'd have to say i got my <UNK> worth on this one i had expected horrible dialogue crappy monsters and shaky cameras well as <UNK> said two outta three ain't bad br br the acting is bad though not as bad as some movies i've seen or maybe i've watched so many low budget movies recently i've lost perspective there are some bits were the acting is downright terrible but for the most part it's of at least high school play level br br the cg for the sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part the first thing i thought when i saw it and i noticed another reviewer agreed with me was that a man in an ape suit would have been better clunky stop motion animation would have looked better br br so you may be asking why i call the cg the second worst part that's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects they are loud annoying and constant i've been camping i know what insects sound like in the woods at night and while they can be loud they're not <UNK> like the <UNK> in this movie usually when the background sounds <UNK> out the movie's dialogue it's a bad thing but from what i caught of the dialogue of this film i wasn't missing much br br the action was <UNK> and boring the tension was non existent as was any sense of empathy with the characters speaking of the characters they were all cookie cutter and bland the only mildly engaging <UNK> was between actually i can't think of anything there was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile but that was about it br br the cinematography was decent a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this however it still had that home movie quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a <UNK> br br if you're like me and get a kick out of <UNK> budget genre flicks and you see this one in the dollar bin think about grabbing it otherwise stay away at all costs
<START> that song keeps <UNK> in my head not the greatest song but it's the 80's this movie is about a lead singer who <UNK> gets killed while being accused of murders as he stalks his girlfriend who sings <UNK> <UNK> in his band the lead singer <UNK> name is billy eye yeah right is dead after two years and his band comes back for a concert only the <UNK> <UNK> is the lead singer this time billy stalks her and eventually goes around killing all these people and terrifying the girl and <UNK> people around her think <UNK> something wrong with her and that <UNK> imagining things she finally decides to go to a <UNK> and dig up his grave to see if he's still there she sees that he's dead but still <UNK> and hears his voice during the end of the movie we find out the reason behind all of this billy has a brother named john right again and john admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those people to get back at him and place the blame on his brother and then take his girlfriend and <UNK> her because she called him crazy the ending is very <UNK> and the acting is very lame and wooden but i like it anyway i watch it for the song i wish i had it
<START> i have been a huge <UNK> peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow 2004 where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest role br br <UNK> as i'm sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driver br br unfortunately other than <UNK> amazing performance i'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much going for it br br oh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like you son of a gun you son of a witch shoot and well forget you br br o k bye br br p s does anyone know where i can get another <UNK> peterson poster
<START> this movie is once again one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a moron my advise would be to take two not one but two hits of very strong acid and at least you'll get a visual thrill out of it although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid being that this comment requires 10 lines of info let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie <UNK> garbage <UNK> waste of talent movie is ice with paper on destination with <UNK> clouds on a sunny dive in the <UNK> sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair now explain that to me
<START> i saw this kung fu movie when i was a kid and i thought it was so cool now i am 26 years old and my friend has it on dvd br br we got a case of <UNK> and watched this classic it lost none of it's original kung fu <UNK> if you are a fan of kung fu karate movies this is a must see the dvd is available i believe this movie is also called pick your poison br br watch it soon
<START> a most <UNK> film of the year 2002 after three and half years of <UNK> <UNK> has acted in this movie the hype for this film was <UNK> high br br this is not a typical <UNK> film in this film he gives some spiritual messages also but it also includes typical <UNK> actions style songs etc its a good entertaining movie and gives good messages also br br i will rate this movie as good instead of excellent because of the screenplay its a must watch movie dont miss it
<START> some have compared this film to deliverance i believe of mice and men is more appropriate our leading man <UNK> definitely loves spike it is irrelevant and <UNK> whether that is a sexual love it is the reason <UNK> does not leave spike he needs him they need each other as brothers as family as their only connection to humanity the setting scenario minimal cast all add up to a fine film frankly i did not care what happened to the characters but i did care about what the film maker did with them he did well with them i spent some time wondering how the ending would resemble of mice and men the soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing
<START> are we really making <UNK> <UNK> again in the <UNK> of a digital wide screen big budget remake of <UNK> this is quite a ride unfortunately there is a bit too much story and at times this becomes like a <UNK> as our heroine <UNK> the sleaze spots of paris <UNK> and <UNK> i am however being rather <UNK> for the <UNK> scenes including everything from hot wax harsh <UNK> and rough sex to drowning <UNK> and some these scenes are <UNK> and it's a pity bruno and his budget couldn't stretch to make all the many <UNK> creatures introduced become more than simply caricatures
<START> since i watched it for the first time <UNK> is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures i actually could watch over and over again the great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women all of them somehow <UNK> with deep understanding and sensibility <UNK> <UNK> achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut and proves himself as an efficient actors' director br br not that all performances are excellent though of all leading ladies they range from average <UNK> <UNK> to very good <UNK> <UNK> but the standing <UNK> should be directed to newcomer <UNK> <UNK> who convincingly plays <UNK> san <UNK> retarded daughter <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> charming as the girl's male nurse and there are nice small turns from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the director himself <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> is beautifully written and filmed when i watched it i got so moved that i couldn't stop thinking of it for days i highly recommend it
<START> the unlikely duo of zero mostel and harry <UNK> team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in the angel <UNK> it's one interesting twist on the themes from it's a wonderful life br br zero is married to <UNK> <UNK> and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly jewish poor in new york mostel used to be a <UNK> and proud of his trade but his back and <UNK> have prevented him from working <UNK> is mostly <UNK> he's reduced to <UNK> for <UNK> in desperation like jimmy stewart he cries out to god for some help br br now maybe if he had gotten someone like henry <UNK> things might have worked out differently but even stewart had trouble accepting <UNK> but <UNK> had one thing going for him he was over 100 years off this mortal <UNK> and all his ties to <UNK> things were gone god sent mostel something quite different the recently deceased harry <UNK> who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignment br br <UNK> hasn't accepted he's moved on from life he's still got a lot of issues he also has a wife gloria foster who doesn't know he's passed on hit by a car right at the beginning of the film you put his issues and <UNK> issues and you've got a good conflict starting with the fact that mostel can't believe in a black jew named <UNK> br br this was the farewell performance for polish jewish actress <UNK> <UNK> who got a nomination for best actress in the shop on main street a few years back the other prominent role here is that of irish actor milo <UNK> playing a nice jewish doctor remembering <UNK> <UNK> from the verdict i was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctor br br the angel <UNK> raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society it's brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer bernard <UNK> make sure to catch it when broadcast
<START> there are many different versions of this one floating around so make sure you can locate one of the <UNK> copies otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing some versions also <UNK> most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there the cut i saw has the on screen title witchcraft evil encounters and was released by <UNK> show who maintain the original us release title <UNK> for the dvd release it's a nice looking print and seems to have all of the footage but has some <UNK> aspect ratio issues in italy it was released as la <UNK> 4 witchcraft the first two la <UNK> releases were actually the first two evil dead films <UNK> and the third la <UNK> was another film by the same production company <UNK> which is best known here in america as <UNK> to make matters even more confusing <UNK> was also released elsewhere as <UNK> 2 except in germany where <UNK> 2 is actually the ogre demons 3 ok i better just shut up now i'm starting to confuse myself br br regardless of the title this is a very hit or miss horror effort some of it is good some of it isn't i actually was into this film for the first half or so but toward the end it became a senseless mess a large <UNK> hotel located on an island about 50 miles from boston is the setting as various people get picked off one by one by a german speaking witch <UNK> <UNK> photographer gary david <UNK> who wants to capture witch light and his <UNK> writer girlfriend leslie <UNK> who is studying witchcraft are <UNK> up at the hotel without <UNK> along comes real estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who's showing off the property to potential <UNK> rose annie ross and <UNK> robert <UNK> brooks also <UNK> along are their children pregnant grown daughter jane linda blair and very young son tommy michael <UNK> as well as <UNK> architect linda sullivan catherine <UNK> <UNK> wife at the time once everyone is inside their boat driver is killed hung and the boat disappears so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the lady in black br br so what can you expect to find here plenty of <UNK> one of the characters has their lips <UNK> shut and is then hung upside down in the <UNK> and accidentally slow <UNK> by the rest of the cast there's also a <UNK> witches eating a dead baby a <UNK> through the head someone set on fire a possession a <UNK> street tape <UNK> the virgin getting raped by some demon a guys <UNK> <UNK> and exploding thanks to voodoo doll <UNK> and some other stuff from a technical standpoint it's a nice looking film with pretty good cinematography a decent score and good gore effects the hotel island setting is also pretty nice blair particularly at the end and ross both seem like they're having fun and <UNK> is great as the evil witch even though people like to <UNK> <UNK> these days he's not bad in his role either br br on the down side despite all the gore the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour the supernatural themes are muddled and confusing too when characters are being swept into the witches <UNK> to be tortured and killed the filmmakers <UNK> decided to <UNK> the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral <UNK> effect that looks <UNK> cheesy and the witch <UNK> itself is <UNK> and cheaply designed with unfinished <UNK> and while most of the cast is at least decent a few of the performances particularly the actress who plays <UNK> girlfriend and the kid are so bad they're constantly distracting
<START> being that i am not a fan of <UNK> <UNK> as an actor that made me even more anxious to check out this flick i remember he was interviewed on jay leno and said that he turned down a role in the big budget adam sandler comedy the longest yard to be in this film so obviously <UNK> was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops i'm not going to <UNK> <UNK> for his performance in the <UNK> there are certainly better <UNK> actors like <UNK> <UNK> who could've done more with his role but the point is <UNK> did a good job he can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal <UNK> but that's something even jack nicholson has a problem doing the point is i found him convincing in the role and the tension between him and dylan <UNK> character captivating mcdermott by the way gives the best performance in the film though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by <UNK> not so subtle acting being a big reader and aspiring writer myself i couldn't help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating it did <UNK> me how <UNK> character would constantly ask mcdermott to read his work and <UNK> him for <UNK> it but you know what i'm sure a lot of writers are like that his character was supposed to be flawed as was <UNK> in his own way my only mild criticism of the film would be its ending for some reason it just felt too rushed for me though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters rather than plot
<START> my brother is in love with this show let's get this straight i completely agree with the people who said it was <UNK> off of <UNK> lab and fairly odd parents br br i've never really liked fairly odd parents i mean some things did make me laugh but most of the time it's downright annoying and not cute at all this is almost the same way i feel about johnny test except nothing makes me laugh on that show the gags are so stupid and pointless and to tell you the truth maybe it's just me but kids don't dress like that yes i do think <UNK> hair is awesome but c'mon br br and <UNK> lab that used to be one of my favorite shows and i still don't mind watching it which makes me disgusted and ashamed of johnny test making an absolute joke out of that wonderful show br br one more thing the dog is so annoying he is more loud and obnoxious than johnny and the gay accent what the <UNK> i hate the dog to death and i hope he dies because that would be better for kids to see than listening and watching the obnoxious crap that goes on in that show and picking up a gay accent br br unless you want you <UNK> to burn into <UNK> flames and your brain fried from this show don't watch it
<START> sadly imdb does not allow me to rate judges lower than 1 what a shame this ghastly movie is so bad that i actually turned the damned thing off well before the ending the script had a few bright moments but the directing editing acting audio quality and especially timing on line delivery was so <UNK> as make judges utterly unbearable br br judges was advertised as being like a modern day comic book style western but in reality was nothing of the sort what it is most like is dog <UNK> on the bottom of your shoe you can try to pretend it is okay but it just keeps on <UNK> br br why video stores think it is okay to carry this kind of crap with constant gaps in the audio and worse than high school drama class acting is beyond me we rent movies in order to see something better that what is on television but judges is worse than the most pathetic scifi channel original i intend to demand my money back from hollywood video
<START> <UNK> is a <UNK> she marries a rich guy named <UNK> and they have a child she then catches him cheating on her and <UNK> him but lets him keep the kid she claims to love back then in the early 1930s she would have been entitled to <UNK> <UNK> and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy with no support what a <UNK> later when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good he turns out to also be a cheat wow does she have a hard time picking men br br as a result of these bad relationships <UNK> changes now she's a wild party girl doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck suddenly many years pass <UNK> daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions haven't changed one bit an old friend of <UNK> yes it's another evil man is now pretending to be the daughter's friend but he has <UNK> designs on her <UNK> promises him that if he touches the girl she'll kill him take a wild guess what happens next br br overall the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess a bit like <UNK> x but much much less focused so often <UNK> motivations and actions seem to make little sense and the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it so long as it <UNK> the notion that all men are pigs unusual but not particularly good
<START> i sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of hitchcock's lesser known films because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden hitchcock gem or a true hitchcock great or some other generic if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great hitchcock film just as much as vertigo north by <UNK> psycho rear window etc so that being said i would just like to say that if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great hitchcock film just as much as vertigo north by <UNK> psycho rear window etc br br now that may be <UNK> a little bit the ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above but compared to the other films that hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s i really think that the ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them as an almost brand new director there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why hitchcock was <UNK> so much attention early in his career br br granted the film does start with among other things the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer and i use idiot in the definitive manner the way stephen king so often does having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the <UNK> looking white people i suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such <UNK> and people were back then but i think it is one of the most off putting sequences in any hitchcock film i've seen br br the main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round but when he meets his match it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife's finger so begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman who seems to <UNK> from one man to the other effortlessly and <UNK> br br spoilers there is for example a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and just before going into the building she is <UNK> back to the car for a kiss this kiss is never explained and there is also the fact that even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband or at least ultimately chooses him they look into each other's eyes but do not actually kiss br br the film is certainly beautifully photographed even more so than several films that <UNK> released in subsequent years there is also a performance by gordon <UNK> as one round jack's <UNK> who in his stone faced <UNK> reminds me quite often of the brilliant buster keaton <UNK> leaves it a bit ambiguous but this is a great <UNK> of his early work
<START> this movie was not very entertaining certainly no where as original or as good as a christmas story the characters except the youngest try to <UNK> the <UNK> actors and they fail the <UNK> neighbors come out of nowhere as they weren't a part of the first movie this really sucked might have been good with the original cast then again maybe not because the story is so weak skip it
<START> jim carrey can do anything i thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie and it totally was not it was so incredibly funny for everyone adults kids i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres and now it's finally coming out on dvd this <UNK> and i'm way to excited as you can see you should definitely see it if you haven't already it was so great br br liz
<START> after having seen deliverance movies like pulp fiction don't seem so extreme maybe by today's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently br br when i started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until i got to the <UNK> <UNK> scene in that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible as i watched drew <UNK> cox <UNK> go head to head with a seemingly <UNK> young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get when you think that the kid has a small <UNK> which he could of probably made by hand compared to <UNK> nice expensive guitar you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are br br as the plot goes it's very believable and never stretches past its limits but what really <UNK> this film about four business men who get more than they <UNK> for on a <UNK> trip is that director john <UNK> <UNK> breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes so as the movie goes into full horror and suspense i really cared about all four men and what would happen to them br br the acting is universally excellent with jon voight midnight cowboy enemy of the state and burt reynolds boogie nights <UNK> leading the great cast jon voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable unlike reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start <UNK> character transforms over the course of the movie ned beatty life is also good in an extremely hard role come on getting raped by a <UNK> while <UNK> cox turns in a believable performance br br one thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any i had ever seen bill <UNK> and herbert cowboy coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the <UNK> br br overall deliverance was excellent and i suggest it to anyone except for people with weak <UNK> and kids 10 10 see this movie
<START> we know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie a waste of time the premise was not too bad but one <UNK> idea interaction between real <UNK> and russian mafia is not followed by an intelligent script
<START> brilliant kung fu scenes loads of melodrama peculiar <UNK> symbolism and an unhappy end makes <UNK> kid an unforgettable film br br one of the <UNK> subtitles i've seen
<START> i don't know why the critics <UNK> this movie i hardly ever agree with them anyway br br the movie could have been a little scarier i don't usually go to horror movies i even had to <UNK> myself up to see it in the daytime i <UNK> have bothered the cinema was full of kids too <UNK> liam was great as always i also liked <UNK> zeta jones theo and <UNK> taylor <UNK> <UNK> br br the house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way the special and sound effects were awesome i also loved the music score particularly the gentle tunes for <UNK> and her journey to save the children how she grew out of her <UNK> routine and life and finally gain her power peace and freedom
<START> <UNK> accused <UNK> chasing <UNK> john wayne as john scott and eddy chandler as kansas charlie change identities to become <UNK> smith and jones mr wayne becomes john jones mr <UNK> is supposed to be <UNK> smith but wayne calls him dr smith at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis pete duel jonathan harris or ben murphy although wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them career wise pretty blonde mary <UNK> as anne grown up from her days in our gang is a lovely interest for wayne she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne if you're not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the 1930s this movie won't make you one
<START> <UNK> obsession with <UNK> smith is despicable leave the child alone with all the constant attention she'll most likely grow up psychotic depressed or worse think of princess diana and how she <UNK> for <UNK> now poor little rich girl ashley <UNK> just wants to be left alone no wonder greta garbo became a <UNK> and said i want to be alone how much does et make off this little girl does et not have anything better to report on i bet there's lots of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and <UNK> were by the way i never heard that anna <UNK> ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance who is paying for the lifestyle of larry howard and little <UNK> could it be et
<START> well i guess i know the answer to that question for the money we have been so <UNK> with cat in the hat advertising and <UNK> that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie i admit i thought the trailers looked bad but i still had to give it a chance well i should have went with my instincts it was a complete piece hollywood trash once again proving that the average person can be <UNK> into believing anything they say is good must be good aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long it obviously started with a <UNK> eaten script it's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor and awful <UNK> <UNK> it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction this is then <UNK> with yes i'll say it bad acting i couldn't help but feel like i was watching coffee talk on snl every time mike myers opened his mouth was the cat intended to be a middle aged jewish woman spencer <UNK> and <UNK> fanning were no prize either but mr myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another austin powers movie f no stars 0 on a scale of 1 10 save your money
<START> i remember seeing <UNK> for this show before it appeared back in 1993 i was 8 at the time and now at the age of 22 it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it the 90's all of a sudden seem so far away what a great decade anyway i used to watch <UNK> all the time as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films it was like the 90's version of <UNK> theater if mst3k can get dvd's why not joe <UNK> show at least <UNK> was more interesting and informative a lot of joe <UNK> comments and info on the films were just hilarious most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion <UNK> of ray <UNK> many were oddball flicks that you wouldn't see anywhere else like the the japanese sci fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell with the new decade of film <UNK> and more independent minded directors i think <UNK> would be a good show for <UNK> to pick up since they already have a hit with the <UNK> <UNK> house show i'm sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day i guess will have to wait and see until then thats great television
<START> firstly i really enjoyed this movie and its message which is about daring to live life to the <UNK> very poetic with heartwarming and funny and sad scenes very lively it was a pleasure to watch here are my exceptions though the movie was way too long and at some point it kept adding more and more additional conflicts so that it started to lose the main story line i disagree though with another comment that its unrealistic to have so many people with strange problems in such a small village i think this was absolutely realistic there are incredible dramas going on everywhere we just don't know this about people we meet only <UNK> i disliked the ending which was so loaded with symbolism and extremely forced it left a bad taste as it was just too much i did not like it that so many big issues were dramatically mentioned in the group when some accused others in front of everyone else of major things people would just be more ashamed to voice everything so personal in front of everybody even if those people are a group one is closely working with and defending <UNK> is a human beings strongest instinct so why on earth would daniel let himself be beaten and never fight back not even to defend himself i mean he was not weak he could at least try to defend himself when attacked but it just drove me mad to see him do nothing it was as if the <UNK> tried to <UNK> bring across a message like violence is not needed but the way he chose to do this was not good i am also against violence but the character loses credibility when he stays <UNK> despite all the attacks and <UNK> why on earth would a woman who has spent years with a man beating her up go to that man when he gets arrested and say i do not wish you any harm you have just done your best like all of us oh really this spoiled so much was she going to be a saint or what it would be normal for her to be bitter but not so almost holy and therefore not human was her work with daniel and the music so great that it made her forget all of the s t that happened to her oh please so these were the spoiling moments nevertheless i still think this is a delightful movie all in all which is amazing enough given my <UNK> with quite a few things watch it
<START> lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful tv series that have never done and so is if you lovers of mysteries intrigue and adventure this is the series for you in the first season since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move forward until you get to the second season in the second you lose a little its cocktail of mystery and expectation and pushes very on and reveal the various mysteries that the island hides the third season is perhaps the second most beautiful because <UNK> suffered since the first episode with the pace and <UNK> of the first season the fourth also not let pass <UNK> and tends to reveal a little mysteries but not as the second season but at a somewhat different for the fifth season expects
<START> the movie deserves 2 10 1 5 stars for the girl i'm sorry i'm biased i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies and 0 5 for the fact that it is shorter than azumi 1 i watched azumi 1 and 2 in 1 <UNK> i amazed myself being able to sit through it br br lets talk about the plus points of the movie the girl <UNK> <UNK> is cute thats all there is to salvage the whole movie the fact is if the main character was male i am sure that most people including me would not have touched the movie at all br br now lets talk about the minus points firstly it is real <UNK> with lots and lots of repeated scenes scenes of <UNK> and azumi keeps coming back it seems more like a drama way of shooting typical japanese dramas love flashbacks and this movie too secondly the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting i do not mind unrealistic movies but this movie is like a poor way of showing <UNK> by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider <UNK> etc it reminds me of <UNK> though <UNK> is a movie with a fantasy setting moreover to portray i don't know what effect the director films people dying with blood <UNK> literally all around people not realizing their head was cut off etc etc etc too many of these <UNK> the show it seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie it <UNK> the show greatly <UNK> isn't azumi supposed to be an assassin she seems more like an one man army to me just that she is a female i don't think you see <UNK> <UNK> into army camps the only time i felt she acted assassin liked was when she killed the <UNK> <UNK> at the end of azumi 1 lastly the plot was thin in both movies its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way
<START> la <UNK> <UNK> aka werewolf woman of 1976 is a film with a highly promising title but sadly the film itself is pretty far away from being a must see for my fellow italian horror buffs you won't hear me say that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> film is entirely bad it has its stylish moments and the first half is actually great fun to watch though the fun is unintentional the film also <UNK> from an exceptionally <UNK> leading actress <UNK> <UNK> however the film which has no real plot at least no linear one often makes no sense at all and it drags incredibly throughout the mostly superfluous second half br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has strange dreams about a dancing around naked in the night before turning into a werewolf woman since she was a raped as a girl <UNK> is afraid of men then when her sister cult <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> comes to visit with her husband <UNK> suddenly feels attracted to the husband and subsequently turns into a werewolf woman herself or something the storyline really doesn't make the slightest sense which makes the film a lot of fun to watch throughout the first half the leading character <UNK> is some <UNK> mixture of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who occasionally turns into a werewolf woman director <UNK> <UNK> chose to make up for the plot holes with a lot of of female nudity which works fine for me there are also some pretty well done gore moments the film is never even slightly suspenseful or creepy but it is very entertaining in the beginning also there are no attempts to hide that this is a slice of sleaze the camera often does close ups on the miss <UNK> private parts for the simple heck of it i'm not complaining then for some reason <UNK> <UNK> chose to make the film longer by completely changing the direction in which it was going while <UNK> is at first a typical werewolf who cannot help but follow the <UNK> of her curse this suddenly changes when she meets a guy howard ross who was in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> boss of 1973 suddenly she goes back to normal again and the subsequent part of the film does not at all go in hand with the first half it gets pretty damn boring after a while all things considered it probably would have been better for this 99 minute film to be only 70 minutes long at the end they even want to make us believe that the absurd story if one can call it that is based on true events werewolf woman has some redeeming qualities my fellow <UNK> horror fans can give it a try however if you wanna watch italian horror exploitation cinema from the 70s there are hundreds of films that you should see before seeing this one
<START> there are few really hilarious films about science fiction but this one will knock your sox off the lead <UNK> jack nicholson take off is side splitting the plot has a very clever twist that has be seen to be enjoyed this is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all make some popcorn and have a great evening
<START> i saw this in the theater when it came out and just yesterday i saw it again on cable this i was able to <UNK> myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is the whole bunch of characters are self absorbed <UNK> <UNK> worst of all it <UNK> every negative stereotype about 20 something dating even as it <UNK> to celebrate people finding themselves the nice guys finish last the jerky guys make out great the <UNK> guys do best the girls are all boy toy <UNK> only one character wendy is seen doing anything remotely useful to society and she <UNK> with her long saved virginity in a throwaway one night stand with a <UNK> in a <UNK> filmed scene that we're supposed to think is romantic what this really is is hollywood's concept of young america <UNK> detached <UNK> <UNK>
<START> national treasure is about as over rated and over hyped as they come nicholas cage is in no way a believable action hero and this film is no indiana jones people who have compared this movie to the indian jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rocker br br i can't really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for maybe the pre teen audience will like it but i found it to be absolutely ludicrous i also can't imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film simply put it's just ok at best br br national treasure is <UNK> and uninspired <UNK> what it does have from the da <UNK> code i would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006 and passing on this nonsense br br the whole idea of being able to so easily steal the <UNK> of independence and run around all over washington <UNK> and philadelphia with it while never <UNK> it once while fighting the bad guys and experiencing what is supposed to be non stop action is absurd i particularly loved the scene with the <UNK> <UNK> in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars <UNK> by it without <UNK> it oh brother br br reminded me of that episode of the brady bunch where they go to the amusement park and mr brady loses his <UNK> plans except that episode of the brady bunch was much better than this whole film br br the idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the us is outlandish literally there are thousand of <UNK> priceless items in this treasure <UNK> yeah right ridiculous br br even worse the speed and accuracy of which cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be tough clues to these ancient <UNK> are pre <UNK> oh the humanity br br the performances by cage voight and the other actors in national treasure are as stiff wooden and flat as they come however when you're working with such lousy dialogue it's hard to fault the actor's 100 for that br br national treasure is an ok film to see once i can't recommend it beyond that and would definitely not purchase this over the top outlandish <UNK> hunt of a mess br br rent it if you must see it first
<START> did anyone who was making this movie particularly the director spare a thought for the logic of the story line these are not mere plot holes but plot graves that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight that is if you are kind enough a viewer to <UNK> ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave hole plot or boring and unlikeable or in the case of <UNK> <UNK> characters apparently superfluous in <UNK> the reason for existence of <UNK> character's significant screen time in the movie i decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily <UNK> his screen time <UNK> as the director didn't change anything else about the script he actually needed to or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the <UNK> of bad plotting i'll leave you to guess which one it was to be br br i had to keep checking the cover of the dvd to confirm that this really was made by credible talents i cannot understand why robert altman would take this job surely he has some power to pick and chose actually i can't understand why anyone would take this script on except a first time director looking for the experience br br i suppose robert downey jr needed the money for his habit i suppose kenneth branagh wanted to try a southern accent i suppose robert duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing these are the only motivations i can see that would <UNK> good actors to take on roles in this movie as for robert altman plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic i found myself <UNK> how he had framed such and such a scene or used the bright orange <UNK> <UNK> in another scene to draw the <UNK> movements or <UNK> a beautiful <UNK> to create a particular mood i do not typically notice such things in movies since most movies i bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story telling and interesting characters with understandable motives i watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that dvd cover and being convinced that due to the talent involved there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie br br nice direction but that's not why i watch movies
<START> underneath the dense green <UNK> of computer graphics there <UNK> the astounding art and skill of <UNK> <UNK> alas it got lost in all the goo the scenes of old <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> and acting in the <UNK> <UNK> were all exciting and engaging taking you back to an interesting and rich era the action on the <UNK> stage in which <UNK> excels and <UNK> was more <UNK> than any of the absurd high <UNK> that followed the skill the energy in the audience the colors of the sets were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance what a wasted opportunity one of the best <UNK> actors alive and he gets lost in the dreck
<START> this is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director <UNK> with more evidently elaborate sets  though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them witness the giant bats and <UNK> on display it also <UNK> a surprising number of american actors joseph <UNK> playing the <UNK> scientist looks ill at ease and <UNK> but then his character is supposed to be <UNK> years old an <UNK> richard <UNK> is the photographer hero while as chief villains we get <UNK> romero and patricia <UNK> both essentially campy as i've often said i grew up watching english language films dubbed in <UNK> hearing hollywood actors in japanese is another thing entirely br br <UNK> zero feels like a juvenile version of a typical jules <UNK> adventure and is fairly entertaining on that level indeed it's <UNK> to <UNK> low brow variations on the monsters on the rampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the set up in this case the plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by romero  he was intended to establish himself in the underwater <UNK> advanced city <UNK> by <UNK> to which the world's foremost minds are being <UNK> we're treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival <UNK> but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on romero's cave  in fact <UNK> doing <UNK> and <UNK> off men in rubber suits via flames and laser <UNK> from his <UNK> must surely count as the <UNK> of his acting career the other elder in the cast romero is more in his element  after all he had been the joker in the batman tv series and movie of the 1960s <UNK> has a scantily clad blonde <UNK> on his team and is <UNK> by a <UNK> asian romero on the other hand is <UNK> by an oriental femme fatale  who however ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts the girl's brain is eventually <UNK> into a hybrid of lion and <UNK> is among the <UNK> looking creatures you ever saw apparently a 2 disc set of this one from media <UNK> streets on this very day
<START> this god <UNK> film is about three dumb <UNK> who gather a bunch of people to play a deadly game and the winner gets a million dollars first of all the acting is terrible and the movie makes absolutely no sense at all it is not scary in the least bit it is so stupid that it made me laugh which is why it earned that 1 star the movie is not violent at all but is pretty sleazy and focuses mostly on the women's breasts the whole time and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny plus the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that it just makes you want to throw something at the screen last but not least the ending is terrible i don't want to give it away in case you actually are strange enough to see this piece of junk avoid at all costs br br not rated but should be r for nudity profanity and mild gore
<START> i've been <UNK> and <UNK> by fellow christians for stating my disappointment with this movie i get <UNK> by statements like these i can't believe you didn't like it it was made totally by christians everyone <UNK> their time and no one was paid for the movie it was made by a church and not hollywood we should spend our money on movies like this they only used 100 000 to make the film this is by a real church and christian school in georgia a preacher wrote and directed it so apparently the reason i should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is was made by christians that is all that is needed for me to love the movie br br look i got the movie without knowing anything about the background of the film i had never heard of it and had no idea other than football what it was about i watched it like i watch any other movie and was disappointed i was disappointed in the lousy editing and lame script i was very disappointed on the resolution after the climax don't worry there have been other cheap movies and other <UNK> made movies that have earned less respect from me it isn't about the making of the movie it is the end product br br the writer <UNK> that god doesn't say yes to everything we pray for in the way we want but he wanted to show by having faith god changes our lives that is true however god can change our lives and we're still <UNK> god can change our lives and we don't get a raise from our job god can change our lives and our car is still an old <UNK> god can change our lives and our house is still <UNK> why didn't he portray that in the movie others voiced their concern to the writer director over the matter but apparently he was <UNK> br br i did not think the acting was horrible nor many of the landscape shots i like the idea of going to god and <UNK> his awesome power and our weakness br br the writing and directing were very weak it is easy to <UNK> this because many of the characters have no development all we really get from the <UNK> wife is she is not pregnant well until the end of the movie it seems as if there was only ball player that had the potential to have an interesting character and that was chopped to bits into i have a <UNK> father and i can't play football well but i'll kick the winning field goal even though i've never kicked a real field goal before another problem was the christian school itself <UNK> i have worked for two christian schools went to one myself and have had many <UNK> and <UNK> in other christian schools all in all i've had some pretty close connections with about ten different ones none of the problems that i have seen in all of these schools were addressed i saw this as totally surreal in the movie about their school and wished they had shown the human factor it would have been nice to see a dose of reality and how god can work br br i will close by stating that every work either written or drawn or played on an <UNK> shares the <UNK> world view the world view that was shown to me in this movie consists of people who pray the right way win ball games get new cars <UNK> when they couldn't get a raise and get their house fixed all within a short time span i know i should love the movie simply due to the sincerity of the people who made it i think i should love the movie because it was well done and for no other reason
<START> but it'll make you wonder if we had any in the first place this movie is just as bad as any of today's horrible horror a man goes around <UNK> semi clad ladies trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body one scene involves a man <UNK> around and <UNK> all over the set for a full three minutes <UNK> everything what what must be well over ten <UNK> of blood the movie also attempts to create a sense that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature but the movie is so badly done it's impossible for the audience to <UNK> up any feeling of shock or outrage <UNK> dark and <UNK> sinister this movie can't even get its own title straight the beginning credits say the brain that wouldn't die but the end credits list it as the head that wouldn't die
<START> the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery this movie was long and boring the minister should have retired from the <UNK> the time his son paul <UNK> from the <UNK> he <UNK> how many times can his boys take the <UNK> name in vain in this film being from a <UNK> background it doesn't fit i wished paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly <UNK> selfish story of paul brad pitt so norm becomes a teacher and paul becomes a <UNK> <UNK> who norm wants to rescue but doesn't so what it's very uninteresting we see the <UNK> whites being stood up to by paul because of his native american girl that was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real <UNK> <UNK> what we only see is a sleepy town where the two <UNK> sons have nothing to do but 1 norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2 paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of <UNK> and tie a lot of flies i'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again which will be never
<START> i watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of david lynch's twin peaks a show which i adore the show quickly starts introducing us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is to me the best of the lot its extremely dramatic and really gets out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season my one biggest criticism is i felt a little let down by the show probably not through its own fault as it got cancelled after a mere 1 season it seemed to display show much potential and it deserved a lot better treatment than it got the acting is excellent and this show has some of the best characters good and evil in it i have ever seen that are well developed in a short space of time there is the odd cheesy effect for the first 5 or ten shows which are a bit overly dramatic but this is <UNK> as the season progressed well worth a watch definitely something out of the ordinary
<START> fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest br br the <UNK> are very good for a movie of its age and the stunt <UNK> actually looked like the actors even down to body type a <UNK> in movies of this vintage br br a <UNK> movie with splendid <UNK> even when chopped down to pan and <UNK>
<START> the invisible maniac starts as a young kevin <UNK> kris russell is caught by his strict mother marilyn adams watching a girl tracy walker strip through his <UNK> cut to <UNK> years <UNK> kevin <UNK> <UNK> peters is now a physics professor who claims to have discovered a way to turn things invisible using a <UNK> <UNK> serum however during a <UNK> in front of his fellow scientists it fails they all laugh at him <UNK> goes mad kills a few of them is locked away in a mental <UNK> from which he escapes jump forward <UNK> weeks <UNK> a group of summer college students discuss the tragic death of their physics teacher when the <UNK> mrs <UNK> stephanie blake as stella <UNK> says that she has hired a replacement yes you've guessed it it's <UNK> the student don't take to him treat him like dirt however <UNK> has <UNK> his <UNK> serum uses it to satisfy his perverted sexual <UNK> his desire for revenge br br co written directed by adam <UNK> wisely hiding under the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i wouldn't want my name to be associated with this turd of a film either the invisible maniac is real bottom of the barrel stuff the script by <UNK> sorry <UNK> tony <UNK> is awful it tries to be a teenage sex comedy horror hybrid that just fails in every department for a start the sex is nothing more than a few female shower scenes a few <UNK> shots not much else i'm afraid the birds in the invisible maniac aren't even that good looking the comedy is lame every joke misses by the proverbial mile this is the kind of film that thinks someone fighting an invisible man or having henry jason logan a mute man trying to make a phone call is funny the invisible maniac makes the police academy 1984 1994 series of films look like the <UNK> of sophistication as for the horror aspect that too is lame it's also an incredibly slow it takes over half an hour before <UNK> even becomes invisible dull predictable boring has highly annoying unlikable teenage character's br br director <UNK> or <UNK> or whatever does absolutely nothing to try make the invisible maniac an even slightly enjoyable experience there's no scares tension or atmosphere as a whole the film is a real chore to sit through he does nothing with the <UNK> angle just a few doors opening on their own is as adventurous as it gets there is very little gore or violence a bit of <UNK> blood a few <UNK> the only decent bit in the whole film when someone has their head blown off with a shotgun unfortunately he was invisible at the time we only get to see the <UNK> <UNK> afterwards br br the budget must have been low i mean really low because this is one seriously cheap looking film <UNK> laboratory is basically two <UNK> on his <UNK> <UNK> when he escapes from the mental institution he has all of one dog sent after him the entire school has about a dozen <UNK> two teachers the invisible maniac is a poorly made film throughout it's 85 minute duration i spotted the boom mike on at least one occasion lets just say the acting is of a low standard leave it at that br br the invisible maniac is crap plain simple i found no redeeming features in it at all there are so many more better films out there you can watch so there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time on this rubbish definitely one to avoid
<START> it's hard to criticize this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but jennifer <UNK> is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic <UNK> employee the rest of the cast have their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole <UNK> exercise a real <UNK> few hours of film <UNK> hannah spends most of the movie <UNK> too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry
<START> usually i don't really like emma roberts so much but after watching nancy drew it kind of changed my mind the actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny most of the time when you watch a mystery movie you can solve it before the middle of the show but in this movie it's like you are actually there the clues have to all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime i am still amazed how she found it out the whole movie was really clever and the people who watched it with me loved the movie too the clothes were my favorite part of the movie it was so cute i don't think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out i give it a nine because the popular girls didn't really seem to have the part just right but they still make me laugh it was a really great movie and a great mystery i definitely recommend watching it
<START> i can sum this movie up using 20 words or less way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face see 19 words however i didn't completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to <UNK> it up to two stars due to the fact that julie <UNK> is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the dvd right out from the machine and blowing it up with an <UNK> my advice take the 4 00 rental <UNK> you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck or you may want to send me the 50 00 replacement <UNK> you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as <UNK> shooting practice
<START> <UNK> has given us a powerful movie <UNK> bar in the past his next film page 3 was one of the worst movies of all time it apparently tells the story of some high class people in india after seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to star in a movie i felt like spitting and breaking the dvd <UNK> i did the reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and <UNK> i literally <UNK> and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children very disturbing stuff there was no need to show the children fully naked one of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people british men in this movie i am shocked to know this film was a hit in parts of india otherwise super flop in uk usa and australia i'm from uk and this kind of stuff makes me sick shouldn't of been released in uk
<START> for a low budget movie this was really good i put this well above your average action b movie sean and <UNK> delivered in this movie and they didn't seem camera shy watch out for the cameos of <UNK> and jared i didn't think that the producers would even consider that but the runner ups deserve that much br br i'll be looking forward to more of sean and <UNK> involvement in the movie entertainment industry <UNK> character seemed very genuine and sexy <UNK> character was pretty hard <UNK> and on point she connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence it was a great idea to cast billy zane as the smart and witty villain his charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch the chemistry between zane and <UNK> character was pretty good the action sequences weren't cheesy and seemed to connect throughout the movie of course there were flaws but that comes with the territory br br overall this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for tv sean and <UNK> did a good job considering that they are <UNK> to the game i hope that <UNK> jared and the rest of the next action star cast get their chance to also join their co stars in entertainment success br br final judgment
<START> being from canada i cannot say whether this film is original in the context of danish cinema unfortunately we here do not get to see many danish films in a year i also cannot comment on <UNK> acting in the context of his other roles i personally found him quite believable a touching monstrosity of a man this <UNK> as for the actor who played kenneth why would his participation in a tv show rule him out as an actor aren't we over such <UNK> attitudes international viewers unaware of his big brother participation will find him a fair actor br br in spite of the movie's faults the writing could have been <UNK> in some instances i do <UNK> to what one could call the <UNK> of the film namely <UNK> essential role in everyday life art as healing force art as <UNK> said <UNK> the lie <UNK> <UNK> die <UNK> it is a holy lie the wedding scene is fabulous in this sense a theatrical not religious wedding celebrating love and life as play
<START> may contain spoilers br br i bent over backwards to be fair to this film i knew it starred madonna i knew it lasted a whole week in theaters i knew it got a lot of bad reviews i wasn't expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class culture and sexuality like we got in the italian original the benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes br br madonna plays a rich pretentious <UNK> witted <UNK> who goes on vacation with her <UNK> husband and <UNK> friends the brunette woman is as bad as madonna <UNK> some really dumb facial expressions <UNK> <UNK> plays the <UNK> first mate who the madonna character <UNK> in <UNK> and treating like dirt in every scene they have together why is she such a bitch to him simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get <UNK> on a deserted <UNK> island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for two thirds of the movie br br swept away is a silly simplistic superficial movie from beginning to end madonna gives a typically wooden performance there are many dumb scenes madonna singing and dancing <UNK> at the demand of <UNK> a fantasy scene with madonna and a lot of scenes where he <UNK> her and kicks her in the butt guy ritchie does his stylish editing which is laughable here the film contains some of the worst dialog i've heard in a major movie in several years the ending is sappy and implausible it's basically the blue <UNK> meets overboard minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter br br maybe <UNK> ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress please give it up <UNK> for our sake as well as yours this isn't her worst movie though that distinction still belongs to shanghai surprise she hasn't made anything worse than that yet
<START> when the bourne identity arrived five years ago i have to confess that i didn't think much of it at the time i was eleven years old so perhaps i was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario two years ago when the bourne supremacy arrived i thought it was a better movie than identity but still didn't think it was as good as i expected it to be judging by the trailers over the past two years i had been told numerous times that the bourne movies were amazing many a time i had to bite my tongue and not say what i really thought about the movies until two months ago i couldn't have given a damn about the bourne ultimatum i really had no intentions of watching it but then i decided to go back and re watch the first two before i came to any abrupt decisions so i went out and bought both the original movies and what a surprise it was to me when i was <UNK> by them identity i found the superior of the two but supremacy isn't far behind they're both slick action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that i have watched numerous times since i bought them because of this i was first in line today to see the bourne ultimatum and boy did bourne ultimatum not disappoint br br matt damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the bourne movies i'd seen him in the talented mr <UNK> but i never thought much of him in general however it appears he was born to play bourne <UNK> the pun throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes in this movie we see matt damon at his very best even better than he was in the <UNK> and i thought he was one of the best things in the <UNK> you really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything matt damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable the supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding joan allen was one of my favourite things in bourne supremacy here she excels herself her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie julia stiles turns up again as <UNK> and finally we learn a bit about her character julia stiles is a very underrated actress and i think she deserves a lot more roles well decent roles than she gets david <UNK> is a newcomer to this series as <UNK> <UNK> he's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels he's definitely the <UNK> character we've met and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty <UNK> <UNK> the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie special mention must also go to albert finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time i will not say anything about the character that's best left as a surprise but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie br br the bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences this isn't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences good god no there's loads of them <UNK> all throughout the movies but running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline this storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie as i watched supremacy the night before i saw ultimatum it was nice because i could notice certain little parts that very final scene in supremacy in new york a lot more important that i ever imagined at the time won't spoil it for people but i recommend checking up on supremacy before you see ultimatum unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see ultimatum purely because of the action sequences this is the part where i should <UNK> such people and say they should see it for the storyline but i'd be lying if i didn't say that my favourite parts of the bourne series as a whole are the car chases the mini car chase in identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time well the action in ultimatum has to be the best of the bourne series in fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in <UNK> so in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups all very violent and shockingly brutal a bike chase that is absolutely amazing many foot chases which are even more amazing a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable and oh so much more but the highlight for me has to be the scene in <UNK> station won't ruin it but for some reason had me <UNK> br br so any flaws for the movie in my eyes no but if you are not a fan of the bourne series or have not seen the previous two then i wouldn't recommend ultimatum for you the movie doesn't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top the bourne ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007 as a james bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the bond movies and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that while bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the bond series it is definitely nearly its equal
<START> during 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that lily powers barbara stanwyck would do anything to obtain great wealth and power <UNK> father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a <UNK> which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on lily as the story progresses lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president it is great to see a very young john wayne jimmy mccoy jr who was only 25 when this picture was produced and jimmy did not even get to first base with lily not even for lunch a very young george brent <UNK> <UNK> stars along with barbara stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances this is a great film from 1933 which was produced by <UNK> f <UNK> and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen this film is rather mild compared to what we view on the hollywood screens today but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of film enjoy
<START> an italian american co production co starring linda blair and david 'the <UNK> <UNK> how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat br br well based on the <UNK> extremely tedious and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so i would have said <UNK> <UNK> thankfully however things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy a <UNK> of nudity too unfortunately my copy was <UNK> edited to remove such offensive material br br the <UNK> stars as gary a photographer who <UNK> his beautiful girlfriend leslie leslie <UNK> to a run down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project a book about witches whilst there frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by <UNK> leslie of her virginity br br his plans for <UNK> are <UNK> however by the unexpected arrival of property <UNK> <UNK> and rose brooks robert <UNK> and annie ross their pregnant daughter jane blair son tommy michael <UNK> pretty <UNK> architect linda sullivan catherine <UNK> and estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who have come to <UNK> the <UNK> hotel br br after explaining their unexpected presence on the island gary and leslie are welcomed by the <UNK> new owners and when a violent storm suddenly picks up making it <UNK> to return to the <UNK> everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building unfortunately <UNK> to the <UNK> new guests the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch <UNK> <UNK> who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life one by one victims are pulled into a <UNK> red <UNK> which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs before meeting a terrible fate br br none of this makes much sense and the acting is atrocious <UNK> as tommy is particularly bad whilst <UNK> proves to be one of the better performers which speaks volumes about the others but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore rose has her lips <UNK> together before being <UNK> alive in a <UNK> jerry is <UNK> and burnt alive linda is tortured by <UNK> and <UNK> on a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> of blood and gary gets stabbed in the back br br oh and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed again
<START> the late 80's saw an inexplicable <UNK> of supernatural horror films set in gloomy <UNK> settings <UNK> <UNK> superbly gritty and moody prison got the whole haunted <UNK> ball rolling it was immediately followed by the <UNK> inferior the chair john <UNK> <UNK> trashy death house the passable psycho picture <UNK> and this <UNK> <UNK> exercise in hopelessly <UNK> tedium br br your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student <UNK> lead by <UNK> <UNK> tormented <UNK> alex the hugely unappealing nicholas <UNK> go to <UNK> island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up and coming rock star sammy mitchell <UNK> played by toni basil of hey <UNK> fame <UNK> brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious <UNK> us civil war <UNK> <UNK> and goes on the expected killing spree thus forcing <UNK> alex to overcome his <UNK> and make a stand against this <UNK> <UNK> br br although <UNK> photographed by nicholas von <UNK> with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere the film was shot on location in the dismal rusty <UNK> ruins of <UNK> island <UNK> rock nonetheless just doesn't cut it as a solid effective fright feature this is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable <UNK> <UNK> characters a <UNK> <UNK> bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing the flat acting from a <UNK> <UNK> cast hurts matters all the more with <UNK> playboy <UNK> and <UNK> blonde <UNK> pie <UNK> supreme hope marie <UNK> doing an especially irritating <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the token <UNK> <UNK> bimbo <UNK> <UNK> direction displays a <UNK> of flashy visual style but the tone is <UNK> pitched between grim seriousness and goofy <UNK> <UNK> silliness and most <UNK> ted <UNK> sloppy inconsistent overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far fetched story even remotely plausible in other words this stinker sadly succeeds in making a <UNK> 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn out cinematic jail sentence
<START> if like me you like your films to be unique and unlike the majority of other movies then i wholly recommend that you check out the beast the film is a grotesque erotic fantasy fairytale that <UNK> around a <UNK> <UNK> that is <UNK> to wander the grounds of a french mansion and <UNK> after women the film is very daring with it's subject material and that is something to give it credit for the theme of <UNK> is a definite taboo and for good reason i might add but the film conveys it straight and to the point like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre the beast could have gone around it and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps but <UNK> didn't do that and he is brave in that respect especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms but the fact that he went ahead with it in my view means a big thumbs up for the guy br br the film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse <UNK> a female this opener puts an <UNK> mark on the film and <UNK> the audience in some ways for the incredible tour de force of <UNK> that they are about to see the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking and are bound to offend many people hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years but these scenes are not merely an excuse for <UNK> to shock the viewer this film has a defining point as said during the film the only difference between man and beast is intelligence both man and beast have instincts only man knows how to control them the beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears <UNK> the control of human desire and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast the film has strong themes of the age old story of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> into it and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust but not without a moral br br many <UNK> the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring but these scenes are important to the film's story without these scenes we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast and most importantly the story of <UNK> and the <UNK> would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience and as that is one of the key elements of the film it would be a real shame besides that <UNK> keeps his audience entertained through these scenes not with shocks but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family along with the beautiful shots of the <UNK> ground would not be seen and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either br br overall the beast is a shocking film it's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone however if you can get over the film's shock and embrace the beast what <UNK> is a <UNK> and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance
<START> this self indulgent mess may have put the <UNK> on mr branagh's career as an <UNK> of shakespeare for the cinema released 4 years ago not a <UNK> of an adaptation since i just finished watching this on cable holy god it's terrible br br i agree with the sentiment of a reviewer below who said that reviewing something so obviously and sadly awful is an <UNK> act that comes across as shrill that being said i'll take the risk if only because <UNK> <UNK> lost is the perfect reward for those who overrated mr branagh's directorial abilities in the past branagh has always been a pretty lousy director <UNK> literal minded star struck <UNK> <UNK> to his fellow actors he loves his american stars but loves himself more making damn sure that he gets all the good lines br br along those lines the sad fact remains that <UNK> <UNK> lost is <UNK> worse than the interminable ghastly <UNK> hamlet from 1996 in fact this film may be <UNK> if only because it's about 1 3 the length branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of shakespeare's to the <UNK> of cole porter george gershwin fred astaire <UNK> <UNK> so he sets the thing in 1939 leaves about an <UNK> of the text intact in favor of <UNK> interpretations of <UNK> standards wait till you see the actors <UNK> up on <UNK> toward the ceiling during i'm in heaven and casts actors not known for their dancing or singing himself included the result is a disaster so surreal that one is left <UNK> that they just didn't call a horrified stop to the whole thing after looking at the first <UNK> i don't even blame the cast to <UNK> hamlet the <UNK> the thing no one could possibly come off well in this <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fare no better than alicia <UNK> who could possibly act in this thing br br branagh's first mistake was in thinking that <UNK> <UNK> lost was a play worth filming trust me it isn't it's an <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> written <UNK> for an educated <UNK> of <UNK> not the usual audience for which he wrote hence there's a lot of precious and tedious word play references to contemporary <UNK> nonsense parodies of <UNK> <UNK> in other words hardly the sort of material to appeal to a broad audience hell it doesn't appeal to an audience already <UNK> to shakespearean comedy the play cannot be staged without drastically cutting the text and desperately <UNK> it with any gimmick that comes to hand which begs the question why bother br br branagh's second mistake was in thinking that shakespeare's cream pie of a play could be served with a side order of <UNK> <UNK> clearly the idea or hope was to make an <UNK> <UNK> exercise <UNK> for modern audiences by <UNK> nostalgic american pop culture down their throats at the same time but again this begs the question why bother br br
<START> for all of the has <UNK> or never <UNK> or for the curious this film is for you ever played a sport or wondered what it felt like after the lights went down and the crowd left this film explores that and more br br robin williams jack <UNK> is a small town assistant <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> whose life has been plagued by a <UNK> in a big rival high school football game 13 years ago when he dropped the pass that would have won over <UNK> their arch rival that takes great pleasure in <UNK> the <UNK> rockets season after season kurt russell reno <UNK> was the <UNK> in that famous game and is the local legend that now is a van <UNK> <UNK> whose life is <UNK> into <UNK> like the town of <UNK> itself br br williams gets an idea to remake history by <UNK> the game he meets with skeptical resistance so he goes on a one man terror spree and literally paints the town orange yellow and black to raise the <UNK> of the residents to recreate the game after <UNK> the players from that 1972 team reunite and try to get in shape to practice which is hysterical the game is on <UNK> is loaded with all of the high tech <UNK> game <UNK> and sophisticated training routines <UNK> is drawing plays in the mud with sticks stones and bottle <UNK> what a riot does <UNK> overcome the odds does robin <UNK> <UNK> the demons from his <UNK> does kurt russell rise from <UNK> watch the best of times for one of the best viewing experiences ever br br one of robin williams best understated performances the chemistry between robin and russell is magic and who is kid lester br br holly palance and pamela reed give memorable performances as the wives of williams and russell succeeds on many levels a 10
<START> a group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick up truck <UNK> is obviously inspired by spielberg's duel and craven's the hills have eyes still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore the film's gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg <UNK> together around a tree and then having his limbs <UNK> when the chain is pulled by a truck there is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk and slash sequences the acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak but the film is fast paced and shocking b g <UNK> who plays the villain is fairly threatening the desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong overall if you like low budget horror films give this one a look 8 out of 10
<START> revolt of the zombies has no redeeming features i'm tired of people arguing that it's not that bad and that the effects must have packed more of a punch in 1936 i suspect this isn't true it's not like <UNK> have <UNK> <UNK> in the last 7 decades the average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today why just try watching the first scenes and count the pauses between things happening the awful choice of when to cut to close up the <UNK> editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue i'm going to make some tea go outside read my book now are you yes i am that sort of exchange happens several times normally i would love that being a huge fan of bad movies but watch the <UNK> actors <UNK> their trite and tedious lines and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away this sort of <UNK> pot <UNK> time <UNK> is far worse than energetic imaginative mind <UNK> like plan nine from outer space or santa claus <UNK> the martians those who claim that this is better than those more interesting movies have a backwards idea of entertainment this movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in <UNK> it's bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom which is far worse
<START> i found the documentary entitled fast cheap and out of control to be a fairly interesting documentary the documentary contained four mini documentaries about four interesting men each one of these men was extremely involved with his job showing sheer love and enjoyment for one's job br br the sad part i must say would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked studied they were interesting for about five minutes afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long br br the video was filmed in a very creative way though i very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another it played out excellent and also <UNK> nicely with the music
<START> this was a quite brutal movie there were huge <UNK> and a silly script bad acting etc br br the only reason to watch this movie is that from time to time some quite impressive sets of breasts were exposed
<START> the film notes describe the main role family as turkish immigrants which living in <UNK> however it is so clear to understand that the fact is the behavior and the culture point the family is absolute <UNK> similar social <UNK> and even cultural murders keep going on turkey today on <UNK> <UNK> societies what a worry br br it is widely accepted issue in turkey today the <UNK> immigrants living in european countries today which have moved from turkey at 70's are <UNK> connected to the <UNK> moral laws system by growing daughters and women under pressure are giving harm to the turkish international image also as same as widely accepted another issue is the turkish or <UNK> immigrants on these countries are the reason negative aim about the community europe <UNK>
<START> director spike lee is famous for making films pointing out racism in many of films such do the right thing most of the white people are all brutal <UNK> in this movie <UNK> marriage is the subject with racism once again being the entire issue br br what lee does however is once again demonstrate his <UNK> against christianity it's amazing the double standards that exist in the film world if lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be <UNK> but christians hey it's open season on them br br <UNK> davis a <UNK> in this film shoots his son and then puts the <UNK> gun down on top of his bible they zoom in on that for another <UNK> just in case you missed it hey folks here's another bible reader and look what <UNK> like lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes br br he shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing however lee <UNK> it in this film as he has in his other films his obvious <UNK> toward white people doesn't help the situation it only adds fuel to the fire br br hey spike start doing the right thing and leave your prejudices in the closet better yet get over it br br this is too bad because the subject matter could have made for a thought provoking film if it had been done with <UNK> and intelligence
<START> this could be the most underrated movie of its genre i don't remember seeing any <UNK> or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didn't do so well at the box office however <UNK> is an excellent and a truly original horror movie i rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list br br movie begins with <UNK> of photos and news <UNK> telling us about a killer who calls himself god's hand and then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case during that trip the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began <UNK> and adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who one day claims that he has received a divine message from god asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings he receives from god a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission br br this is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat the tension runs high innocent people or demons get killed and religious experiences are <UNK> it has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end if you like this genre i highly recommend <UNK> for you i own the dvd and it is one of my all time favorite horror thrillers
<START> your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video not film the story is convoluted and the production is amazingly sloppy note for example that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in <UNK> where they've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees their ceremony in <UNK> takes place in a garden of <UNK> plants including <UNK> which wouldn't last five minutes in the new england climate on yet another airplane trip the establishing shot depicts a <UNK> <UNK> plane taking off presumably they could only afford to travel in <UNK> as for the plot this movie expects you to believe that victor the <UNK> christian brother of arthur is kicked out of his church when the <UNK> learns that his brother is gay not only that but the <UNK> eventually sets victor up with a hit man to have ben and arthur killed to <UNK> their souls of sin apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the ten <UNK> were it not for jamie brett <UNK> who is surprisingly effective as arthur this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all
<START> i cannot believe that this movie was ever created i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation the best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished again to <UNK> other user comments the voodoo <UNK> are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all it is never explained
<START> miike makes a children's adventure film not unlike the <UNK> story it's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films even the worst miike is better than a good many films though and the great yokai war has a lot in it that's worth <UNK> it's at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it the dvd includes an english dub but like all of miike's films it can tend to move very slowly that means you've got kind of a weird <UNK> where sometimes there's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters <UNK> the story itself isn't very good either and miike's <UNK> flaw of <UNK> <UNK> its ugly head most of what i liked came from the technical side of things this has to be miike's most expensive movie and it looks fantastic yokai are japanese spirits and they come in all different <UNK> forms and the costume <UNK> special effects crew and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job i've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on yokai monsters <UNK> <UNK> and the cheesy rubber suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable <UNK> using state of the art makeup and special effects i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys or girls in this case <UNK> who sports dark eye shadow a tight white outfit a white <UNK> <UNK> and a whip she's played incidentally by <UNK> <UNK> whom you might remember as lucy <UNK> teenage <UNK> in kill bill <UNK> 1 the hero of the film is played by <UNK> <UNK> who provided voices for miyazaki's spirited away and <UNK> moving castle
<START> today <UNK> arthur died so i was <UNK> around the imdb web site and somehow wound up on a show called gloria all in the family was a brilliant show for its first four or five years and i bet i watched every episode more than once however i swear that i did not know a show named gloria existed maybe that's a good thing maybe it means i had a life as a young adult rather than watching television br br on the other hand it is pathetic that the all in the family franchise had <UNK> so much that it <UNK> a show i never heard of and one that is rated very poorly by the previous reviewers br br i rated the show a 1 for two reasons the system did not allow me to register a no vote and writers and tv <UNK> should be condemned for starting a show that had no business being on the air and <UNK> the memory of one of the greatest shows in tv history br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the shining you know what's weird about this movie this is the movie that everyone for people who claim to not like horror films will always say that the shining is a terrific film this is stanley kubrick's classic vision of stephen king's horror tale of madness and blood this is just an incredible film and <UNK> you have seen it or not you have heard of it know a few lines from it and know some of the classic images who could forget jack's here's johnny who could forget all work and no play make jack a dull boy who could forget that chilling ending this is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is kubrick's best work i know there is a lot of argument in that department a lot of people say it's 2001 a space odyssey or clockwork orange or even dr <UNK> but if those film <UNK> film making then the shining <UNK> it this is the tale of isolation madness terrifying images and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin br br jack <UNK> jack's son danny and jack's wife wendy arrive at the overlook hotel on closing day the elderly african american chef dick <UNK> surprises danny by speaking to him <UNK> and offering him some ice cream he explains to danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift they called the communication shining danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel particularly room <UNK> dick tells danny that the hotel has a certain shine to it and many memories not all of them good and <UNK> him to stay out of room <UNK> under all circumstances <UNK> curiosity about room <UNK> finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened danny shows up injured and <UNK> traumatized after jack tells wendy that he loves his family seeing this wendy thinks jack has been <UNK> danny jack wanders into the <UNK> gold room where he meets a ghostly bartender named lloyd danny starts calling out the word <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it on walls he goes into a <UNK> and <UNK> he now says that he is tony his own imaginary friend jack <UNK> the hotel radio cutting off communication from the outside world but <UNK> has received <UNK> <UNK> cry for help and is on his way wendy discovers that jack has been <UNK> endless pages of <UNK> repeating all work and no play makes jack a dull boy <UNK> in various ways horrified jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat <UNK> him in a <UNK> locker in the kitchen jack <UNK> with grady through the door of the locker which then <UNK> releasing him danny has written <UNK> in <UNK> on the door of <UNK> bedroom when she looks in the mirror she sees that it is murder spelled backwards jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters here's johnny and jack's legendary image is born br br the shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares jack <UNK> performance is timeless and unforgettable but one i also feel is extremely overlooked is shelley duvall her scene of finding jack's rant all <UNK> is incredible that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad also another incredible scene is when jack sees a ghost woman in the <UNK> it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema the reason this film is so well known is because it's a film of perfection it's been on the simpsons it's been shown in other films and it's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it trust me br br 10 10
<START> i q in my opinion is a sweet charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you if you ask me james stephen <UNK> really was a dull guy to me ed tim robbins was more suited for catherine meg ryan than james was anyway everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job now in conclusion i highly recommend this sweet charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any tim robbins or meg ryan fan who hasn't seen it you're in for lots of laughter so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
<START> dark angel is a cross between <UNK> brave new world and <UNK> love in the ruins portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order both in the worst sense of the word once one <UNK> the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a <UNK> by the pulse it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters max the dark angel bike <UNK> and logan the rich rebel it seems uneven perhaps a result of a variety of authors but is held together by the energetic beautiful and charming jessica alba who seems both strong and <UNK> yet vulnerable and sensitive i think that fox has done it again
<START> i was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming <UNK> jim carrey with <UNK> powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me as a huge fan i was sure he'd be <UNK> in his element with such a promising premise and what could go wrong yesterday my bubble got burst big time boys and girls because i saw the movie br br the first act where it's set up that he hates his life he's a disgruntled employee and a <UNK> unhappy <UNK> with an <UNK> to <UNK> against god is <UNK> the second act where he's <UNK> by god via <UNK> and receives powers almighty is great carrey gets to have fun with his new <UNK> and it's a pleasure to watch really funny but the third act is wretched beyond belief br br the <UNK> starts setting in after the dinner scene between bruce and his girlfriend grace jennifer aniston who comes off exceedingly well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device even her name <UNK> of <UNK> she thinks he's gonna pop 'the <UNK> but instead he tells her on <UNK> <UNK> yet that he's finally getting his news anchor job and isn't it so exciting br br she doesn't think so she wants him to marry her see so she winds up leaving him see even though she still loves him very much see and the rest of the film is spent <UNK> us over the head with one pathetic beyond heavy handed spiritual sounding cliche after the next until by the end i was praying too for it to be over br br i didn't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts one example in the 2nd act after he gets his powers bruce <UNK> into the room singing what if god were one of us just a <UNK> like one of us blah blah blah and i was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of <UNK> being <UNK> at us for <UNK> morgan freeman a k a god tells bruce he can't <UNK> anyone's free will but he does this a lot those choices were forgivable this is a jim carrey comedy directed by tom <UNK> it <UNK> the remains of the day br br or rather it was supposed to be a comedy when the script writers lose track of that in the <UNK> act 3 and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of gag message movie what we get instead is hell on earth bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways he realizes that grace is his saving have to say it grace and that his <UNK> in life had been severely <UNK> all this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy handed way however the film didn't have to go into the <UNK> to make these points unfortunately the writers and <UNK> apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever light handed way so they went the bang 'em over the heads route in hopes that we wouldn't notice they even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out takes at the end in the further hope that this would <UNK> the bad taste it didn't work for me
<START> we gave up at the point where george <UNK> character has his finger nails <UNK> we were not <UNK> having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like to say this film was incomprehensible boring pretentious <UNK> would be to over praise it how did people manage to sit through this confusing slow depressing <UNK> corner of a film let alone <UNK> it for an oscar clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him what was he thinking oh and what was with those subtitles did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that sentences left hanging in mid air the film was hard enough to follow without that as well i pity the cast who obviously did their best with the material available
<START> simply one of the <UNK> movies i've ever seen it's a parody of crime life parody of everything that represents the chicago 1930 there is no <UNK> need to <UNK> this movie because rating is under 5 its a opinion of a mass and mass is <UNK> who decide to watch it it will regret who decide not to watch it will regret more
<START> an <UNK> bold film weaves the seemingly <UNK> <UNK> with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the <UNK> effects of the crime and corruption of the <UNK> underworld on 2 naive young brothers from the southern city of <UNK> br br film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the seductive erotic dancer <UNK> working in the nightclub owned by the face of the new mini wave in <UNK> film production <UNK> <UNK> the elder brother played <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> is easily convinced to become <UNK> lead henchman after a night at the <UNK> to celebrate younger brother <UNK> juan <UNK> miranda <UNK> birthday from the establishing shot of this opening scene the film explodes into neo noir exploration of everything the outside world doesn't usually expect to see in this country so <UNK> conservative and catholic br br <UNK> charms of seduction attract the three men like <UNK> to honey although the <UNK> narrative of the three way fantasy romance revolves around the linear portrayal of major international drug deals between <UNK> men and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> power relations become a vital theme as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a mini family the prostitute holds an exotic spell over all the <UNK> men in the film <UNK> from her ambiguous position in the <UNK> of society and is seen as holding the key to all three men's <UNK> the relationships between <UNK> and <UNK> become important as the <UNK> parents are <UNK> by their absence one assumes they still live in <UNK> therefore it is <UNK> el <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> and effectively <UNK> <UNK> as a man in the city miranda rapidly becomes the desperate <UNK> as his <UNK> on his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> becomes increasingly strained by jealousy over the beautiful <UNK> however miranda remains trapped by the <UNK> of still being in school he is <UNK> on <UNK> who is <UNK> on <UNK> for the money to survive <UNK> in turn is under the thumb of the <UNK> and his wealth has been <UNK> through drug deals and well as his strip <UNK> the figure of <UNK> acts as a time bomb viewed as a beautiful <UNK> she <UNK> a web of beauty inside the <UNK> but the strain can only lead to one climax br br as the tensions of these power relations come to head <UNK> remains <UNK> <UNK> the viewer is never sure which male figure she will commit to the film concludes <UNK> and <UNK> in a shoot out which <UNK> power relations and <UNK> half the major male <UNK> the final shot of <UNK> beaten face <UNK> down the <UNK> highway is <UNK> powerful the boy has been sucked in by the lure of the city's underworld yet has lost his only visible family and his woman who is his only friend in the film he has nothing the <UNK> <UNK> are bold and brave this is a gangster film in <UNK> the notions of family no sex before marriage etc are <UNK> and instead the harsh realities of the other side of <UNK> <UNK> are displayed in all their savage glory <UNK> beats <UNK> brutally <UNK> and miranda make love in a cinema reel room a whore having sex with a minor she barely knows the <UNK> are seen to have a financial hold over this small latin american nation but not through the <UNK> mines through the illegal path of drugs br br <UNK> triumph is in his presentation of this dark underworld which raises so many social questions more perhaps than the record <UNK> successful <UNK> con <UNK> within a slick smooth <UNK> of a film which place this film firmly alongside <UNK> con <UNK> taxi <UNK> <UNK> and el <UNK> sentimental as cinematic evidence that <UNK> is well and truly artistically alive and kicking in the post transition period 15 years after the censorship of the military regime
<START> as a kid i loved computer animation although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost nonexistent this movie as i sat in awe and watched the amazing images and almost hypnotic music shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer this is a whole package deal between the music and the video that really packs a one two punch if you know any child that wants to get involved in computer animation this is a must have br br i still almost 20 years later rate this movie as one of my top 3 favorites the originality i think is still <UNK> by most of today's <UNK> that hollywood <UNK> out i am currently wanting to see if i can re make it on my own if imitation is the <UNK> form of <UNK> then this movie deserves a ton of imitation
<START> a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident when the wife is left in a <UNK> <UNK> state the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to <UNK> revenge on him and those around him br br this comes to us from director rob <UNK> who made wrong turn a film i have not seen with only one horror film under his belt and not a particularly notorious one at that i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode expecting <UNK> to be a master of horror in only the most liberal sense my apologies to him for my <UNK> as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season this was actually the best one yet br br the issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device however this is only the foundation on which the story revolves once the horror elements show up the film goes from decent to spectacular great acting great plot great dialogue great suspense i was a little <UNK> out at times which is good and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance i read a review of this episode prior to watching it where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of <UNK> in this through the first part of the show i had no idea what they were talking about then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of <UNK> 2 however i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film i can see no other way to create the effect that was created and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than <UNK> 2 br br some plot twists show up later on and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look i didn't watch it a second time but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had not that it's confusing the subplot with the dental <UNK> is also nice and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him he's somewhat of an anti hero to the whole story if you will i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist but he's completely <UNK> br br while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i'm excited about the <UNK> episode i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine when legends like john carpenter let me down again i get a bit worried about the <UNK> future but then a fresh face like rob <UNK> comes along and gives me hope this one is a keeper and please bring <UNK> back for season 3
<START> this is the result a piece of trash movie that doesn't deserve to even be classified as a movie it's just a bunch of stuff on a film reel that makes no sense whatsoever well back to the actors which from the get go seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a little amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror film well it's a great horror anyway <UNK> being a film there's plenty of horrific acting in hobgoblins but the worse is the main guy named richard who is just way too much of a <UNK> to even sorta root for well when you cast a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary on a less than <UNK> budget no less this is what will happen oh well at least the mst3k version was hilarious but this is still a horrid movie that deserves all the bashing it gets 9 for the <UNK> version
<START> if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldn't make it through from beginning to end i can't believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a <UNK> in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing <UNK> shows zero emotion even when she's being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing <UNK> mom is laughable i'm from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment
<START> although i use this site quite frequently to see how other people rated what i think are challenging or just plain enjoyable films after watching this movie on film four last night i felt compelled to write something down even if it just helps <UNK> me once again br br the film was possibly the <UNK> experience i've ever had the main characters played by danny <UNK> 23 you sure and gillian anderson who will always be <UNK> as leonard <UNK> will always be spock had no real substance about them i'm not sure if the first half hour of the film didn't make the final cut but surely in a revenge movie you would like some empathy with the victims here i couldn't care less in fact the only character i did seem to care about was the dog with the <UNK> coming a close second and both animals out acted dire <UNK> and <UNK> who were quite frankly terrible i guess though you're only as good as the script you are given and i'd like to <UNK> thank the writers the producers the director and all of the cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity
<START> i don't know why i picked this movie to watch it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different every once in a while its good to try a film that's slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero thriller flick and this film certainly was different right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but i couldn't figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end i think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer <UNK> of the actors br br at the <UNK> of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being and are left with the <UNK> are going to be <UNK> type of a feeling i'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance
<START> as low budget <UNK> go you will usually find that you get what you pay for and let me just say i didn't pay much for <UNK> br br writer director david r williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park <UNK> by the vengeful spirit of a <UNK> serial killer not a bad premise but executed with a <UNK> of low budget mistakes the camera work tries to be too <UNK> for it's audience by constantly using shaky quick cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us this becomes evident right off the bat as we are introduced to the would be killer and soon realize that the acting is the scariest thing happening after a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times yet the acting remains the same <UNK> does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun house but with an extremely long running time it can't save the film from it's below average indie hell br br there is some mediocre nudity but not much for gore which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies br br fans of really bad b movies might find something of interest here otherwise don't spend a lot of cash
<START> until today i had never seen this film its was filmed on the sets of the old dark house and frankenstein and concerns a small <UNK> village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers br br frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that won't quit lionel <UNK> dwight frye faye <UNK> and <UNK> douglas playing a character named <UNK> which is of interest to me since that was my great <UNK> maiden name br br this is a carefully <UNK> film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time only going <UNK> when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up from that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that <UNK> it br br leonard <UNK> and imdb list a running time of <UNK> minutes and warn of shorter <UNK> the trouble is that imdb and <UNK> can be wrong and in this case i think they are since a source i trust more says the full running time is <UNK> minutes the overlook film <UNK> <UNK> about this i know is insane but since most <UNK> that are available tend to run around 60 <UNK> minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only <UNK> minutes long personally i think it won't matter that much since its at most five minutes and i doubt very much it will make or break the film br br what ever the running time if you like <UNK> old films do by all means do watch this movie its a great dark and <UNK> night film
<START> yep this is <UNK> up there with some of the worst of the <UNK> movies but i have <UNK> seen worse think <UNK> rated r well anyway i met rick sloane at some sci fi convention that amazingly he was <UNK> at it was one of those really low budget conventions where everything goes an everyone brought in something if you want to see crap you should have of seen what some friends and i brought in br br he seemed like a very nice guy he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins and he even told me not to take it seriously and said he loved the mst3k version br br all in all rick sloane knew what he was doing and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks so i guess i'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5 and <UNK> all my fellow <UNK> sorry guys
<START> well were to start this is by far one of the worst films i've ever paid good money to see i won't comment on the story itself it's a wonderful classic but here it feels like a soap opera to start with the acting except for eric <UNK> is soap opera quality i've always been a fan of brad pitt but here every actor on the bold and the beautiful puts him to shame the camera action doesn't help either how it <UNK> on him when he's thinking it just takes me back to brooke <UNK> days in the lab peter o'toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery or he is desperately in need of one either way he looks more like linda evans than linda evans and to end my comments diane <UNK> is a cute girl but she sure is no helen of <UNK> peterson should rather have chosen <UNK> <UNK> for the role since elizabeth taylor would be rather miscast by now
<START> the trouble with the book <UNK> of a geisha is that it had japanese <UNK> but underneath the <UNK> it was all an american man's way of thinking reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music sets and costumes yet performed by <UNK> animals dressed in those <UNK> far from japanese ways of thinking were the characters br br the movie isn't about japan or real geisha it is a story about a few american men's mistaken ideas about japan and geisha <UNK> through their own ignorance and <UNK> so what is this movie if it isn't about japan or geisha is it pure fantasy as so many people have said yes but then why make it into an american fantasy br br there were so many missed opportunities imagine a culture where there are no <UNK> hang ups no <UNK> of sin about sex sex is natural and normal how is sex handled in this movie right like it was dirty the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has <UNK> <UNK> up her nose and <UNK> with <UNK> for five seconds as if the man trying to <UNK> her had dropped a handful of <UNK> on her <UNK> br br does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie nope one character is said to be <UNK> but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty such typical american <UNK> has no place in a movie about japanese geisha br br did <UNK> enjoy her first ravishing by some old <UNK> after her <UNK> was <UNK> off nope she lies there like a cold <UNK> of meat on a <UNK> block of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it and that is what i mean about this movie why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy why does all the sex have to be <UNK> and wrong br br behind <UNK> the <UNK> was <UNK> secret <UNK> and as such he was behind the <UNK> of her virginity he could have <UNK> the <UNK> and won her himself <UNK> didn't even <UNK> so why did the <UNK> let that old <UNK> win her and <UNK> of old man stink get his fingers all over her naked body would any woman ever really forgive a man for that br br let's try to make sense of this by being behind <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> geisha training in order to <UNK> his <UNK> the <UNK> had <UNK> sold to dr <UNK> through <UNK> the <UNK> sold <UNK> sexual <UNK> to that old <UNK> so that the <UNK> could make some money out of her the <UNK> wasn't her <UNK> he was her <UNK> some romantic love story br br yes the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive <UNK> <UNK> whose voice appearance and every touch are thrilling but under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret under the <UNK> appearing japanese surface of the film <UNK> the ominous secret that the heart soul spirit and core of this film is entirely american and male not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie <UNK> and terribly wrong br br some <UNK> between japan and <UNK> br br japanese style  <UNK> elegant simplicity <UNK> style  <UNK> opera br br japanese geisha  hair swept up <UNK> geisha  loose hair which surely must have gotten all <UNK> up in the thick <UNK> of white makeup br br japanese <UNK> ice japanese are rather strict about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ice is strictly a summer treat <UNK> <UNK> ice the <UNK> buys <UNK> the young <UNK> played by the marvelous <UNK> <UNK> this treat during <UNK> <UNK> viewing season the thought made my entire body <UNK> with cold br br japanese geisha  trained and skilled <UNK> <UNK> geisha <UNK> br br japanese wind <UNK> used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes thanks to the <UNK> japanese people feel somehow <UNK> <UNK> wind <UNK> a door bell if a person stood in front of <UNK> house and made noises with a wind <UNK> they would be considered a lunatic not gain entrance br br japan  emphasis on human relationships group oriented <UNK>  i want a life that's mine american <UNK> br br japanese traditional dance  <UNK> <UNK> an almost <UNK> and mechanical <UNK> <UNK> dance  martha graham freaking out on <UNK> while wearing a not very <UNK> white japanese funeral <UNK> performed by a geisha down a <UNK> in a place that looks like a strip club ha ha ha is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha br br japan house fire  setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community fires can rip through those wooden <UNK> towns and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people <UNK> house fire great <UNK> to a fight scene but there are zero <UNK> and because it is no longer needed the out of control fire miraculously puts itself out technically the movie ended here because at the very least <UNK> would have been <UNK> and joined her sister among those never heard from again which is where both arthur golden and rob marshall should be <UNK> br br enough the movie stinks
<START> tom <UNK> <UNK> brilliantly observed <UNK> novel of life among new york <UNK> gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served the film suffers not merely from the <UNK> of <UNK> tom hanks as an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doll <UNK> griffith as a manipulative southern belle and bruce willis as the darling of new <UNK> <UNK> the most serious <UNK> was in the director's chair robert altman might have <UNK> life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting but brian de palma for all of his visual sophistication has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience the resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of <UNK> in favor of status honestly if a satire does not make the viewer angry what is the point
<START> i am a very big fan of jenna jameson but this movie is horrible at the time jenna jameson was married to brad armstrong and he was the director of this film and jenna was the <UNK> porn star ever so of course brad tried to make as much money as he could off her by making this big budget porn film now i know why they don't make big budget porn movies anymore in a fantasy world porn stars could act but this is the real world and they can't act that's why there porn stars if a women as beautiful as jenna could act then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star a fine example of this is <UNK> <UNK> when she was a teen thru her <UNK> she was one of the most beautiful sexy women on earth she made her move into low budget mainstream films and couldn't act where is she now i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because jenna is so hot but there are better movies she has made then dream quest come on jenna we don't want to hear you talk as much as we want to see you have sex also you jenna would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you would have done <UNK> on film
<START> i <UNK> a few times during this movie i laughed out loud during the <UNK> of the <UNK> company <UNK> pun intended br br there are three segments in this movie the first one is supposed to be a spoof of woman <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> career movies the <UNK> box was the funniest thing in this segment most of the cast members aren't listed here on imdb they are the lucky ones few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers br br the second segment is a spoof of <UNK> woman sleeps her way to the top and <UNK> control of huge industry movies robert <UNK> has several funny moments all physical humor including the aforementioned <UNK> after his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as <UNK> <UNK> rises higher and higher by the time she becomes first lady i wanted to rip the cable out of the tv and watch snow i switched to <UNK> music videos instead i don't understand <UNK> or whatever language the videos were in it was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull story br br then came <UNK> with the big stars half of them on screen for less than a minute elisha cook jr christopher lloyd <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> julie <UNK> richard widmark and <UNK> benson it's supposed to be a spoof of young cop teams with hardened substance <UNK> older cop who needs retirement badly movies the <UNK> flash bar on the police car is very impressive it was interesting seeing old <UNK> <UNK> and a shell gas station sign and an american <UNK> sign none of them are around anymore <UNK> never stop anywhere you might have to get out the car made me smile <UNK> then they discuss how boring the young cop is a lot back and forth about how boring he is that was as boring as this description of how boring it is <UNK> law number four never go into a music store that's been cut into with an <UNK> torch made me think that the music store is a real business at the actual location the <UNK> gave thinking about that was more interesting than the set up for the gag which followed young <UNK> benson gets shot a lot he becomes a hardened cop like <UNK> the segment keeps going on and on and on it won't stop it rolls relentlessly <UNK> no matter how many times you wish he'd just die already so this thing will end it doesn't it goes on and on and on then a buffy the vampire <UNK> episode which i've seen four times already comes on thank god this abysmal movie ended while i went to get the mail
<START> this movie is a farce names are grossly <UNK> and the plot is twisted and <UNK> into something <UNK> by any literature <UNK> and they have the <UNK> to give beowulf a ridiculous cannon <UNK> weapon beowulf doesn't need a weapon like that in the poem he rips off <UNK> arm with his bare hands and i can't believe that the <UNK> did such a thing the way grendel is portrayed is impressive however that and the cast are the only positive points of the feature my english teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination unless you are a die hard fan of the epic poem beowulf avoid this film at all costs and even then i wouldn't recommend it
<START> seriously what is this hooper has made such classic films like texas chainsaw massacre then he made this god awful film what happened did he <UNK> into the crack a little too much this film is about some dude named sam who has the ability to set things on fire <UNK> anyone the acting was <UNK> the plot was rubbish and the special effects were extremely rubbish they looked like something from the 70's van damme should be pleased that <UNK> is no longer the worst film ever and what was with the ending he started glowing blue turned into a glowing blue blob sucked out his girlfriends fire and the film ended what was that huh when the film ended i hoped the dvd would <UNK> <UNK> to save me from my pain br br stay away from this film br br don't think <UNK> you'll thank me later
<START> turkish cinema has a big problem directors aren't interested in global cinema they are local and <UNK> but want to be international this brings <UNK> results such this movie br br film has jokes translated to spanish from turkish and they don't have any meaning for non turkish audiences even for turkish audiences after 10 years br br players even <UNK> <UNK> have a worse acting than average they act like puppets br br movie was shot in cuba but nothing includes about cuba so cuba is thought like a banana republic br br waste of money waste of time

<START> beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena <UNK> gives a stunning performance of a <UNK> actress dealing with success aging loneliness and alcoholism she tries to escape her own <UNK> ghosts <UNK> by the death <UNK> of a young girl acceptance of <UNK> of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling it's like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that top quality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to <UNK> and <UNK> feelings one of the best dramas ever 10 10
<START> villa rides 1968 turns out to be something of a big disappointment and even though sam <UNK> had a hand in the screenplay along with robert <UNK> it still emerges as a <UNK> written movie <UNK> directed by the <UNK> buzz <UNK> firstly top billed <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> villa is wrong for the part he's not charismatic enough to play the great mexican revolutionary his one note performance lacks the fire and gusto anthony quinn or gilbert <UNK> could have brought to the role <UNK> simply looks like a russian aristocrat dressed up like a mexican <UNK> who is in the middle of the mexican revolution instead of the russian one also second billed robert mitchum is totally wasted in the picture his part as a <UNK> flying ace <UNK> home made bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written <UNK> role that could have been played by any minor star mitch hasn't a decent line in the entire movie and brings to one's mind his other mexican revolution picture the far superior <UNK> 1956 which unfortunately nobody seems to have any interest in releasing on dvd besides lacking any kind of style villa rides also suffers badly without the presence of a female star there is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a young mexican girl who gives mitchum the glad eye but her casting is merely <UNK> someone like <UNK> <UNK> or jean peters could have perhaps added a couple of badly needed <UNK> to the <UNK> story line br br there are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes do not a movie make and the less than perfect <UNK> picture quality plus the over repetitive maurice <UNK> theme tune doesn't help matters br br as is <UNK> wont there are no extras not even a trailer <UNK> a disappointing movie and dvd presentation that could have been and should have been a whole lot better
<START> fast paced funny sexy and spectacular cagney is always terrific <UNK> charms you with her wit and energy it's obvious that this is a pre censorship film by the innuendo in the script the costumes and the way they touch each other and <UNK> before there were <UNK> this is no holds <UNK> fun for everyone i don't understand the john garfield issue though does it matter whether or not he's in this film if he is he screen is so short that he's basically a prop you need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if he's there i'm a big cagney fan but had never seen this one before i found it on turner classics i found it by wonderful accident sit back and enjoy the ride
<START> it is a real shame that nearly no one under 30 knows the over the top writing of michael <UNK> magazine <UNK> and snl skits that were genius for the time and so it is a true shame that anyone who may take the opportunity to research his work will no doubt take the easy way out and watch videos thus leading them to mr <UNK> <UNK> video br br this movie has clever elements that never fully connect to the funny bone the viewer experiences such things as cat diving swimming with the man who thinks he's found <UNK> happiness by <UNK> these <UNK> into a pool which the camera follows in slow motion and montage sequence then we are taken to an island to where all past <UNK> are retired <UNK> <UNK> pet rocks <UNK> dread <UNK> etc then we enter the music world punk was a new variety of music at the time of this film where d rate bar performer <UNK> slim performs boogie till you <UNK> in his own lazy style of dirt and <UNK> sleaze now the real beauty of all this is the back ground music in many different styles with many different <UNK> the sound of <UNK> plays and <UNK> for those who don't understand <UNK> was the first american satellite launched into space and the theme was created to celebrate mans genius and triumph mr <UNK> seems to have been meant as a <UNK> of societal <UNK> ridiculous wastes now one thing the theater offered that the video release does not was a live performance of sid vicious ex sex pistol not the wrestler singing my way his version is very different than <UNK> as one might imagine but frankly i feel it is very much worth the listen it's good that is the sad part in the vhs release paul <UNK> refuses the rights of his song and the viewer is forced to experience 3 1 2 minutes of silence with an explanation rolling across the image of the singing dead sex pistol br br i would give the theater release a 5 or 6 the video is closer to a 4 and now that so much is <UNK> i can see where many people would give it a 3 or 2 5 if you want to see a good <UNK> script watch <UNK> it is a better tribute to the mans insight and talent
<START> i get to the cinema every week or so and regularly check out this site but never before have i felt compelled to comment on a film br br to my all time list of shockingly bad films last man standing <UNK> the bone collector i can now add the drivel that was <UNK> man' br br from the awful opening titles a ridiculously over long run through of cast and crew put together with <UNK> spaghetti through to the insulting finale a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema this film is dismal and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end br br this isn't just my opinion it was that of my friends and everyone around us when large sections of an audience are laughing and <UNK> during and after a serious thriller its clear that the film is hopeless br br not only that it was sick too the director took the action beyond the <UNK> of realistic fare for a violent film and into the <UNK> of an over the top blood <UNK> b movie it's difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man because the extent of the invisible man's <UNK> out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a <UNK> mind if made invisible but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved it hardly makes entertaining cinema br br spoilers follow br br get past the films sick exterior and things are even worse whilst kevin bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as <UNK> man' the rest of them perhaps handicapped by a dire script do an even better job of being hollow cast one long time member of the team is found <UNK> in a locker by the invisible man he's finally <UNK> <UNK> one colleague without a hint of emotion this is par for the course and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting they pad their way through the lab corridors terrified guns <UNK> but then seconds later one of the crew <UNK> happily off back down the <UNK> to get blood for a hurt colleague the lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he's insulted and abused her and there seems to be little reaction to his <UNK> even after he <UNK> the <UNK> chief he drowned in his pool last night reports the same female spectacularly failing to put two and two together br br the script is <UNK> with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue and the rest is just an a z of film cliches which get laid on <UNK> and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end br br the <UNK> moment at the computer the female <UNK> at the window the <UNK> security video the list really is endless the predictable disregard for strength in numbers the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of <UNK> impending death and leave them to their own devices the almost dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman the bomb and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes the falling lift which just stops before hitting them and more than anything else the <UNK> of the bad guy br br the invisible man is burnt to a shred with a <UNK> flame <UNK> <UNK> whacked round the head with a bar which had just <UNK> straight through one of the lesser actors and then having apparently survived the explosion <UNK> and total destruction of the <UNK> has more than enough life left to climb up through the <UNK> for one last pop at the films heroes by which stage the <UNK> audience are cringing and looking at their watches br br that this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one which should be avoided at all costs
<START> <UNK> yes the all star blockbuster take a so so concept stuff it into a script and load it down with every single <UNK> special effect that the <UNK> of <UNK> can <UNK> up then round up the usual suspects hot up and <UNK> has <UNK> wanna <UNK> and never <UNK> and stick 'em all in ensemble roles of various <UNK> in front of the <UNK> eye of the cameras and hope to <UNK> that some of them aren't too old to remember their lines br br leave it to the <UNK> of box office to apply the concept to horror films at last as was the case with the post exorcist thriller the sentinel novelist jeffrey <UNK> decided to try and one up ira <UNK> rosemary's baby scenario of creepy and ultimately satanic neighbors in a new york <UNK> the result was a controversial best <UNK> that some claimed <UNK> on the <UNK> and an equally controversial top heavy star laden vehicle co written and directed by death <UNK> michael winner but for many <UNK> different reasons br br <UNK> raines <UNK> plays successful model alison parker who is pretty much over <UNK> and over worked i won't add <UNK> i mean she is a model so that would be redundant not just by her 24 7 schedule by also by her <UNK> <UNK> get married right <UNK> boyfriend michael chris sarandon of dog day afternoon and the classic <UNK> i g movie <UNK> one of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place a big beautiful <UNK> in manhattan which she's able to get dirt cheap that should've been the big red flag cheap real estate in new york from the mysteriously <UNK> <UNK> miss logan golden age screen vet <UNK> <UNK> fresh from the storm drain in <UNK> br br things seem fine at first but ah yes then comes the noises and the loud <UNK> from the apartment upstairs at night and what about the really strange neighbors like <UNK> sylvia miles and sandra a very early beverly <UNK> the nice single friends read lesbians living together and kindly old mr charles <UNK> a nicely creepy burgess meredith who seems maybe a little too concerned with <UNK> <UNK> and that's not to mention other <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you'll never hear the phrase black and white cat black and white cake again without wanting to laugh milk through your nose and possibly vomit simultaneously especially the old blind priest living in the <UNK> br br things really start to go downhill when an <UNK> laden nightmare of <UNK> <UNK> into a grisly murder in one of the movie's most underwear <UNK> scares and both alison and michael with some assistance from <UNK> <UNK> jennifer deborah <UNK> begin to piece together the puzzle that reveals the <UNK> dark origins as well as the murderous agenda of its other <UNK> inhabitants not to mention <UNK> connection to them which as it turns out is anything but <UNK> br br although there's nothing controversial about the <UNK> cast which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time arthur kennedy jose <UNK> martin <UNK> eli <UNK> john carradine and even early appearances by christopher walken jeff goldblum and <UNK> visitor winner and company went back to <UNK> <UNK> and pulled a <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> real life physically challenged actors to appear in the <UNK> climactic everything and everybody goes to hell sequence which i guess any <UNK> director would do finding himself unable to access linda blair and a case of green <UNK> soup it does definitely leave you with <UNK> fingers playing your spinal <UNK> like a <UNK> knowing this <UNK> little <UNK> of info as you watch and it does feature a technique to which filmmakers have only begun to return very recently live on set makeup and special effects that don't involve cgi which was pretty much non existent back then br br the sentinel has that <UNK> late seventies cheese factor but does manage to <UNK> itself from time to time with some gasp inducing moments like the one mentioned above not to mention that <UNK> feeling of dread that horror writers find it easy to play upon of isolation and things that go <UNK> and <UNK> in the night after all what living single in the big city person hasn't <UNK> in bed in the dark and listened <UNK> to the sounds of what they hope is the building <UNK> br br <UNK> followed up the sentinel with an inevitable sequel the guardian not to be confused with the william <UNK> supernatural thriller <UNK> that was never adapted for the screen sigh of relief
<START> the prophecy ii what's there to say about it they've completely abandoned the originality of the first film and simply made a chris walken splatter film it's not even written by the original writer br br if you've seen <UNK> 1 don't watch <UNK> 2 it's a real disappointment br br if you haven't seen <UNK> 1 don't watch <UNK> 2 go see <UNK> 1 to experience something original and fun
<START> one of the better vance films succeeds more on interesting plot and <UNK> direction by none other than michael <UNK> this time around a generally hated <UNK> is found dead shot in the head in his locked and <UNK> bedroom on the upper floor philo vance hearing of the situation while about to set off for italy decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is a murder and what everyone else is considering a suicide william powell is as <UNK> a philo vance as you will find he never seems to press and is always very smooth in what he says and does powell is aided by a host of very talented actors some first rate character actors and actresses like mary <UNK> as a niece that hated her uncle ralph morgan as the dead man's secretary paul <UNK> as a rival dog <UNK> arthur <UNK> as a mysterious butler helen <UNK> as the next door kept blonde and two really good performances by james lee as the chinese cook and <UNK> eugene palette as a wise cracking police detective add into the mix a wonderfully comedic turn by <UNK> <UNK> as a public <UNK> always missing his meal it is this depth of suspects and a story that has many plots twists and turns that make the <UNK> murder case a fast moving fun mystery
<START> zabriskie point 1970 this was especially interesting to me on a personal level since it takes place under identical circumstances with identical peers in my own life  the counter culture movement of the late 60's early 70's on and off campus we follow two unrelated young people in separate stories who are slowly woven together one is a young man in los angeles tired of all the endless pseudo revolutionary <UNK> in the <UNK> and <UNK> of his campus and the other a young woman driving to phoenix to see her father <UNK> and take on an establishment job the film is full of our italian director's <UNK> antonioni visual <UNK> of america and the confused <UNK> of that <UNK> self righteous we know it all we'll change everything for the better youth just who is the revolutionary what does that really mean do you dress like one and march around <UNK> do you fly in under the radar but give advance notice of your arrival do you keep your plans to yourself and go about the business of change with no need for group <UNK> zabriskie point is definitely a period piece full of <UNK> uniforms somewhat surreal film moments after all this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing blow up of 1966 and the <UNK> <UNK> but it is more it presents <UNK> for cultural revolution and going by antonioni who does seem to be supportive of it the youth are too self involved to see what is needed for radical success because of this it becomes a powerful frightening film that applies to anyone any time any place
<START> despite the other comments listed here this is probably the best dirty harry movie made a film that reflects for better or worse the country's <UNK> political feelings during the reagan glory years of the early <UNK> it's also a <UNK> action movie br br opening with a liberal female judge <UNK> a murder case due to lack of <UNK> evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate <UNK> the scene which <UNK> the famous go ahead make my day line sudden impact is one non stop roller coaster of an action film the first time you get to catch your breath is when the <UNK> inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood it gets only better from there with an over the top group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a <UNK> with a mysterious past superb direction and photography and a at times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the <UNK>
<START> one of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so <UNK> far in it ends much to soon than were left looking at the screen like no they didn't lol good performances all around the acting is marvelous with emily blunt simply outstanding i knew she would give a solid convincing performance catching young victoria's <UNK> temper and vulnerability through out the entire movie also the production is outstanding in every way style substance and sensitivity a remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in <UNK> history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as queen later marrying prince albert than ending with the birth of their first of nine children it had a well written screenplay and flawless editing rupert friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young prince albert <UNK> to win the young <UNK> attention than <UNK> her love before lord melbourne paul <UNK> was engrossing to watch just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage victoria and her mother which was fury at times as with her mother and king william whom also disliked her mother the acting and scenes were captivating highly emotional br br i would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era and indeed anyone who loves a compelling true romance story
<START> it does come out of left field and really isn't what you're expecting but i love that the most memorable movie experiences come from being surprised if you ask me if you haven't been <UNK> off about the mysterious thing that makes these brothers so odd you're in for a treat br br the cast is fantastic but not <UNK> so much that it's <UNK> the special effects come out of nowhere seriously it's like an oddly dark romantic comedy until they do then wow and they're great the overall cinematography is easy on the eyes the editing and sound are very good quality and the twisted story unfolds without clichés while none of these aspects <UNK> make it a blockbuster the what the hell factor alone makes it a film treasure br br the people who bash this movie make no sense it's one of those often overlooked flicks of the 90's that you've either never heard of or love so much you jump at the mention of its title br br i'm in the latter group
<START> it's utterly pointless to rate this film it's as if you would <UNK> or praise the newly born for his future life instead look at it as a powerful <UNK> at what could have been and what has been in the past 100 years one hundred and eight years of the <UNK> what has become of the babe i like to contemplate on what would have <UNK> happen if europe wasn't interrupted <UNK> twice by the great wars of the <UNK> century on her ruins the bogus <UNK> castle of the non creative and <UNK> circus named hollywood <UNK> itself before <UNK> french italian and <UNK> cinemas were leading the way both <UNK> and of course <UNK> french film in particular was already <UNK> some very original and creative <UNK> that could have if not interrupted possibly altered the medium history in some <UNK> ways one wonders what the film history would look like today if it wasn't <UNK> and <UNK> by the <UNK> and cheap political agenda of the hollywood's 80 years of what <UNK> might define as the <UNK> of greed and <UNK> be it as it might please at least become aware of la <UNK> as the key or at least one of them to the kingdom thus the <UNK> of cinema <UNK> brothers factory <UNK> france the date march 19th <UNK> there's also a <UNK> reel shoot in the summer of <UNK> so if you notice summer lights and the <UNK> lighter clothing that was the version shown to the very first people who ever saw the moving images louis <UNK> creative ideas cinematography direction it was all <UNK> own <UNK> because <UNK> took care of the rest money first film <UNK> were all fifty seconds long the camera le <UNK> the <UNK> le cinematographer having only <UNK> fifty seconds to make things happen apparently le <UNK> <UNK> has managed to <UNK> around <UNK> of these first films executed mostly by an <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> travelling <UNK> <UNK> crossing the globe so all the stars in <UNK> heavens and a minute of silence for perhaps the most magical invention in human history so far
<START> i'm probably not giving this movie a fair shake as i was unable to watch all of it perhaps if i'd seen it in a theater in its original presentation i might have appreciated it but it's far too slow moving for me br br i read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory this did not help the film as it's something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of events br br this is really four linked films or a film in four parts and was i believe intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation i found part i to be enjoyable enough but it was all i could do to sit through part ii which drags <UNK> reading <UNK> <UNK> is one thing if you get a good translation or can read it in the original his brilliant writing far <UNK> any issues one might have with the pace of the story on film however it's hard to <UNK> without being <UNK> br br i have other issues with the parts of the film that i saw it's very <UNK> with a lot of hey ma look at this camera work that calls attention to itself instead of serving to advance the story br br clearly i'm missing something but i just couldn't <UNK> the enthusiasm to <UNK> up parts iii and iv

<START> how can anyone argue the fact that urban cowboy was and still is the best document of texas life for the time period consider the following men beat their wives get drunk at bars <UNK> get married to settle a fight commit adultery and compete on mechanical <UNK> try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly they dont make them anymore it seems current films are always about people with lots of money they live in huge homes drive expensive cars and don't work this movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for <UNK> sake br br anyway i watch it at least once a week no kidding i have <UNK> this movie from end to end feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary consider the following scenes bud sees sissy they are split up he <UNK> <UNK> and waves she <UNK> him the bird he returns half the peace sign <UNK> his horn to add impact then tears off br br <UNK> mom calls him <UNK> 18 hours after he gets into town on a sunday to see if he has a job yet all he has accomplished is getting drunk and laid <UNK> with help from his uncle and aunt who cover for him br br you all live like pigs think about why this scene is needed think about it was it necessary could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink god i love that br br sissy allows wes to help her ride the bull only a few days or possibly the next day after wes just kicked the crap out of her husband steve asks hey sissy remember wes oh yeah didnt you beat my husband up the other night so let's get this lesson <UNK> to make no mention of the fact that she seeks <UNK> in him later during one bud and <UNK> many fights which by the way all take place in public in <UNK> br br the wedding reception picture taking session oh the humanity could they at least <UNK> or move the <UNK> out of the way my legs are <UNK> <UNK> br br in conclusion you don't put scenes like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology it is a documentary of real life br br i only wish there was a director's cut

<START> i am quite the mitchell <UNK> fan so it was a great anticipation that i rented this movie but the print i got was extremely bad so worn down from use and <UNK> seemingly beyond <UNK> the movie was so dark so dark that in certain scenes that are <UNK> in the dark you can't see a single thing that said i believe i share the same opinion as the first review of this movie it starts out unusually and does not <UNK> the lines and <UNK> of your typical hollywood 30's movie heck not even your typical <UNK> movie of any era it seems the director has been influenced by the europeans because there is a certain <UNK> realism to the proceedings from the opening shot which is so crafted in camera movement and placement as maggie carole lombard and <UNK> fred macmurray meet you half expect them to start singing make believe from show boat it starts with a few laughs and poor anthony in a one scene role where he speaks not a word of english gets slapped around by <UNK> <UNK> is a bum who doesn't care that he's a bum that's why he signs up in the army where he can hide from the world he's just been released though and in a set of screenplay <UNK> she misses her boat for new york this is when the movie kicks into high gear and we begin to get those french movie of the sixties <UNK> to the whole proceedings the scenes are so well acted by lombard and cecil cunningham the movie <UNK> a pulse macmurray is good too as he and lombard fall for each other as she <UNK> his talent for the <UNK> then the <UNK> arrives in the form of dorothy <UNK> enough with plot the movie has fantastic montage sequences that <UNK> me they are very good and lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half a bit more is called of <UNK> and he fails to deliver the goods with a heavily melodramatic ending and an actor you don't believe the movie falls short but since it is not your typical movie in structure set design and direction it is worth a look for what is what it was one of the <UNK> hits of the 1936 <UNK> season i don't know its exact rank though
<START> dick tracy is one of our family's favorites the actors are great the art direction is exceptional the music is magic it's not supposed to be to kill a <UNK> it's a fun experience br br stephen <UNK> songs are stellar back in business is energetic sooner or later is just right what can you lose is haunting even tunes like live alone and like it add to the story br br got to love the <UNK> over the top performances of al pacino dustin hoffman glenn <UNK> charlie <UNK> mandy <UNK> james <UNK> dick van dyke supporting villains the list is far too long and yes even madonna and warren beatty are awesome written with a smile a minute how many times have we looked at each other and said wait a minute i'm having a thought it's gone br br however one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer so if you haven't already why not give dick tracy a chance accept it for what it is a sunday comic strip brought to life and in a wonderful way
<START> <UNK> romantic drama directed by clint eastwood about the loving relationship which grows between a <UNK> hippie kay <UNK> and a los angeles real estate agent in his golden years william <UNK> surprisingly <UNK> within this highly <UNK> <UNK> the script is slight but not without some thoughtful <UNK> still the scenario is such a middle aged cliché by now that most of the picture comes off as <UNK> it may have worked much better with different leads <UNK> and <UNK> don't match up well her stature is so slight he seems to tower over her making their intimate scenes less stirring than simply uncomfortable dated <UNK> romantic and mostly <UNK> from
<START> the world of the 1973 sci fi drama soylent green is what we could be seeing if we aren't careful it is a world in which new york city's population has topped the 40 million mark in the year <UNK> <UNK> air <UNK> year long heat waves and food <UNK> are the rule the only hope comes from a food product called soylent green but what is this particular food stuff really made of that question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film based on harry <UNK> 1966 novel make room make room charlton heston stars as <UNK> an <UNK> detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive joseph <UNK> as it turns out <UNK> was on the board of directors of the soylent corporation the people responsible for all those food <UNK> that the people have to <UNK> in <UNK> of the real thing heston believes that this wasn't just a garden variety murder that <UNK> was <UNK> off for a reason he gets a lot of help from his slightly <UNK> but very <UNK> book edward g robinson in his <UNK> and final cinematic appearance and a few <UNK> <UNK> of what the world used to be like what robinson finds out about soylent green shocks him beyond all imagination but before he can tell heston all of what he knows he has himself <UNK> and when heston does indeed find out the secret of soylent green well that part has become <UNK> into cinematic history br br under the very professional <UNK> hand of director richard <UNK> the boston <UNK> fantastic voyage soylent green is a fairly grim but thought provoking look at a <UNK> future that humanity might be living if we don't <UNK> our tendency to strip our planet of its natural resources indeed this was a project that heston himself had had in mind for filming as far back as 1968 after he had struck gold in the sci fi genre with planet of the apes a fact that probably gets lost whenever his ultra conservative political philosophy comes up in conversation after all soylent green is hardly a <UNK> for <UNK> capitalism robinson as always is the <UNK> professional in his last role the sequence where he is <UNK> as he looks at video of the world from a better era set to the music of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> is quite simply heartbreaking the film also benefits from solid supporting help from chuck <UNK> as a very convincing heavy <UNK> peters as <UNK> superior and leigh taylor young as the woman who tries to help heston in his <UNK> br br it must seem easy these days to dismiss soylent green for being dated but those who do it ought to think twice for this film's world may end up becoming <UNK> in <UNK> if we don't watch what we do with what we have today

<START> this is definitely one of <UNK> best efforts few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can the action is rapid fire and special effects <UNK> for intensity purposes as a result it may take americans a little off guard a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film i feel that it is an excellent introduction to <UNK> work and look forward to further masterpieces especially fist of legend making it into the us market a nice mixture of <UNK> and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick <UNK>
<START> rented this one accidentally it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting didn't find out until i got home watched it anyways absolutely fantastic a wonderful movie and one of my top three favorite of all time i recommend it to everyone br br the story is enjoyable and easy to follow this could have been easily messed up but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together br br the actors themselves are fantastic displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job br br gotta find a copy somewhere
<START> set during wwii <UNK> and <UNK> is a fun filled fantasy adventure for kids starring angela lansbury as an apprentice witch who with the help of three <UNK> children and a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> a nazi invasion br br brilliantly inventive with loads of laughs this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters exciting story and catchy tunes lansbury is perfect as <UNK> the not quite perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime and her three young co stars cindy <UNK> roy <UNK> and ian <UNK> are equally impressive as the cockney <UNK> who aid in battling the nasty <UNK> br br the special effects are somewhat dated but let's face it kids don't care too much about these things so long as they are entertained and entertained they will be with some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect and more genuine movie magic than a hundred harry <UNK> it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic <UNK> in fact only a rather drawn out musical number set in <UNK> road mars the film's perfection but with so much else to enjoy that can easily be forgiven br br and besides any film featuring uk television legend bruce <UNK> as a <UNK> harry style <UNK> is guaranteed a good rating from me
<START> brendan <UNK> is the absolute best character in the sopranos he died by getting shot in the eye this was the best and well <UNK> scene ever in the sopranos brendan <UNK> is too good brendan <UNK> shall haunt uncle junior in his dreams until uncle junior can't take it anymore brendan <UNK> is the best character brendan <UNK> was killed in episode 3 denial anger acceptance but his legacy will live on forever brendan <UNK> is the best character on sopranos brendan <UNK> is the best character ever i recommend this show to anyone who likes drama and wants to see good death scenes and great directing and producing because it doesn't get any better than this series brendan <UNK> is the best
<START> this film is available from david shepard and <UNK> on the before hollywood there was <UNK> lee <UNK> although that is a <UNK> version with just the behind the scenes movie sections i'm not sure if <UNK> films only had a film print of these parts or they edited out the other scenes the original <UNK> version was <UNK> a movie romance the complete feature does survive but the <UNK> for this version had some <UNK> <UNK> and a couple of sections looked bad so that may be why <UNK> version was edited br br directed by maurice <UNK> the film has <UNK> playing himself or more likely a caricature of himself supposedly director <UNK> <UNK> and future director joseph von <UNK> also can be spotted br br country <UNK> mary doris <UNK> <UNK> for a romantic man to <UNK> her off her feet she dreams of a <UNK> that will woo her but is constantly interrupted by the only available local boy johnny <UNK> br br meanwhile a film company from new york actually new jersey is filming a western in the countryside mary sees an indian in full <UNK> and raises an alarm spoiling a scene that the movie company is filming she is immediately attracted to the dashing film star kenneth <UNK> robert <UNK> he encourages her to leave her home and try to become an actress in the big city br br when she arrives at the studio she discovers that everything about the movies is fake the doors and walls are just <UNK> that are <UNK> assembled for the set that <UNK> walk of the western hero or the happy skip of the heroine are just acting too the sets are on a big revolving stage so the angle of the sun can even be manipulated the black attendant at the studio signs all the movie <UNK> <UNK> photos the signs on the wall say positively no smoking but everybody <UNK> anyway even the titles of the film which are illustrated nicely emphasize everything fake about the movie making life br br movie star <UNK> is just as <UNK> with the ho hum of everyday film making he makes a temporary split from girlfriend vivian june <UNK> to pursue this exciting country girl his plans are <UNK> when <UNK> screen test is a stinker we don't get to see the actual film but only the audience's <UNK> reactions to it br br mary is <UNK> but she doesn't want to admit to everyone back home that she was a failure so she continues to see <UNK> and we she has lunch with him in the studio <UNK> along with other extras dressed as policemen soldiers <UNK> etc br br mary decides to stay with <UNK> at a party with their movie friends she agrees to marry him although there is not much love between them surprisingly her mother appears with a cake especially for <UNK> birthday this causes mary to re <UNK> her future br br this film has all kinds of fascinating scenes of studios movie sets dressing rooms editing rooms etc if you've always wondered what went on behind the scenes when a silent film was being made this movie <UNK> behind the curtain
<START> having not seen the films before and not being able to stand matt damon i was reluctant to go see the bourne ultimatum when we were asked to see it for as film studies br br however i was pleasantly surprised that even a film with damon in it could be enjoyable br br fast fight scenes crazy <UNK> chases and big explosions were what threw you out of your seat in <UNK> the near misses between the cia and bourne kept you on your <UNK> and <UNK> entertained br br nevertheless several things really <UNK> my cheese br br firstly the fact that the film was just a series of bourne cia bourne cia bourne cia this sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull although damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the cia i was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of bourne he crashed a car and got out as if he had <UNK> it or something very unrealistic br br and secondly inevitably the shaky camera it was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class even the <UNK> <UNK> we were told by the <UNK> that if we ever used that in a film we made in class it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a <UNK> fair enough if <UNK> wanted it to look like we were there watching damon and stiles holding a conversation but surely we wouldn't be shaking our heads that violently br br but all in all <UNK> is an enjoyable film and worth a watch but i didn't think it was the best film of the year despite being an entertaining piece of cinema br br 8 10
<START> my original review of this film was simply the word sh t written 2000 times over although this was a very accurate critique i felt my review should be a little more <UNK> br br i will start with the lead actress her facial expression doesn't change once in this film she doesn't show fear happiness or depression her skills in body language pretty much come down to <UNK> her eyes left and right and looking like she don't know jack she is an <UNK> <UNK> who i'm guessing has had too much <UNK> her lack of facial expression through out the film is <UNK> however by the <UNK> love affair with the lead actor which seems to spring out of nowhere and has them making out on a beach and falling in love within a couple of hours of meeting one another the lead actor whose hair demands more attention than he did was mediocre at best and did not once make me feel like he was genuinely in peril br br the only thing that tops the hideous acting is the directing storyline and inaccuracies in plot i have seen <UNK> ads with more structure than this movie the is no development in character they just seem to say and do things that i could never believe a real person would br br this film would not have been bad if it was trying to be crap on purpose like snakes on a plane but it was trying so hard to be a serious action flick that i couldn't even laugh i believe i now have a brain <UNK> from watching this film and thinking up all the different ways i could have used that budget and cg team to create something far superior if i bought this on dvd i would smash the dvd to pieces burn it then <UNK> it in <UNK> acid for good measure don't watch this film
<START> once upon a time there was a director by the name of james he brought us wonderfully thrilling science fiction such as terminator and aliens these movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era br br and then it happened 1997 countless awards obscene amounts of money outlandish <UNK> of advertising maximum profit <UNK> titanic was here br br i have never ever been one to jump on the <UNK> and be overly critical for the sake of it in fact i have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going titanic however was a film i only took one single positive out of that of kate <UNK> being absolutely gorgeous throughout br br quickly the dialogue was like something out of beverly hills <UNK> the acting was more wooden than my <UNK> tree house images meant to <UNK> were actually comical man falling from ship and hitting <UNK> historically false don't even get me started because there's too much it had dire theme music up there with the bodyguard for cheese and the pointless love story was so tedious self absorbing and pathetic that it <UNK> the plight of everyone else involved i was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not br br it was <UNK> obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to mtv watching <UNK> chewing boy with car chasing teenage girls <UNK> himself <UNK> something less heroic than the <UNK> member of a boy band who would drag their sex <UNK> boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick flick hoping to get lucky later the worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point millions of <UNK> down culture <UNK> went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because it cost so much to produce it must be great and steve and barbara said it was good and they know their movies br br the <UNK> glory arrived when titanic swept the boards at the academy awards king james of hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based it looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off <UNK> portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people br br however if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off good luck to hollywood if that is how they want to make money i'd do it if i had those kind of chances in life br br it is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly historically false human interest tripe like the <UNK> and pearl harbor
<START> san francisco is a big city with great acting credits in this one the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city they didn't even manage the most basic of realistic details so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie you will not be thinking oh i've been there you will be thinking how did a two story <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> turn into a quiet hotel <UNK> some of the leads used east coast speech styles and <UNK> it <UNK> but the acting was always competent br br the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles at least in the beginning the <UNK> story was the most effective and interesting the plot is weak ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies the originals had a lot more tension and emotional <UNK> they were framed and paced better but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other <UNK> br br the white boy intro was pointless i think the filmmakers didn't know what to do with it so they left it loosely structured and cut it down the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal really folks everyone knows it's not <UNK> to live in the ghetto but his segments are the most humorous they threw away some good opportunities educated and <UNK> on the west coast a <UNK> jerk here is a different kind of <UNK> jerk than they make in new york they are equally <UNK> but always <UNK> that would have been interesting this was not br br the <UNK> point intro was the most disappointing it was the most derivative of the three and <UNK> the most distant from san francisco you've seen it done before and you've seen it done better even the video game was better br br despite the generic non <UNK> and <UNK> script these characters have potential the actors have talent and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction about ten minutes before the ending good concept placed in the wrong hands br br ps there is a missing minority here see if you can guess which one
<START> life begins is a wonderful pre code film starring some of the best of the era it is set in the <UNK> ward of a hospital particularly in the room for the women expected to have trouble in it is an older woman a tough <UNK> mother glenda farrell a <UNK> young woman an italian woman and the main character loretta young who is spending 20 years in prison for murder her husband eric <UNK> is at the hospital at every second <UNK> to know that everything will be okay <UNK> <UNK> plays the nurse who is great at her job br br this film is highly interesting and entertaining it isn't terribly shocking in any way but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen the acting is brilliant all around loretta young is gorgeous here in her prime eric <UNK> comes out of nowhere and is sincere as can be his innocence is reminiscent of michael j fox glenda farrell is great as always a <UNK> of pre <UNK> and for good reason
<START> in 1978 a phenomenon began the release of john carpenter's halloween got people <UNK> around the block to witness the evil that is michael meyers the critics loved it the world loved it it was <UNK> and has gone down as one of the greatest movies in cinematic history br br plot 15 years after a murder took place four friends all females are <UNK> and having it on with their boyfriends on halloween night after escaping from a hospital the night before michael myers returns to his home town to stalk these people he murders 3 of them <UNK> and subtlety he does not speak he walks slowly he hides br br only one of the friends escapes after being saved by doctor <UNK> michael's <UNK> and doctor br br there is one reason why halloween works so well simplicity we don't know where michael is we don't know why he kills and he <UNK> us they're the only reasons why we are afraid br br john carpenter wrote the movie and directed he builds unbearable tension throughout the story and scares to such a degree that sometimes we cannot watch and the climax is truly startling br br as horror this is essential it is terrifying and well acted it is also mysterious michael is a force not a human a force that cannot be denied br br the sequels focused too much around michael and his history this movie focuses on the fear of the unknown perhaps that's why this thing is a masterpiece
<START> i had been looking forward to seeing <UNK> for quite a while what with all it's raving reviews nominations and media attention and i must say the first quarter of the movie was good it really portrayed the black music scene back then however as the movie wore on me and my whole family were bored out of our wits the singing just kept coming one after the other i mean seriously just one more music number and it would have broke even with rent br br furthermore i noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters i just didn't care what happened to them even when eddie murphy's character died of a drug <UNK> i knew i should have been sad but i just couldn't feel any emotion for that character the characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and <UNK> but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in br br finally the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which goes along with the lack of character development this movie reminded me of a copy cat movie based on ray chicago and rent ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances
<START> for me this movie just seemed to fall on its face the main problem for me was the casting of glover as a serial killer i don't know whether this grows out of type casting or simply his demeanor but i doubt glover could ever portray a convincing villain he's a good guy and that's always obvious in his performances other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story nothing very innovative
<START> in a not so conventional sense of the word br br this movie was one of my favorites as a young child and i just recently remembered it and thought to look it up while many of the details are no longer clear in my mind the overall feeling that the movie gave me has stuck with me over the years br br if parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes then i highly recommend this movie it taught me a lot about life and death and brought forth in me a lot of emotion to this day it remains one of my favorite films
<START> i loved this film at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but i quickly got into it there must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and i really admire the work done in cutting it down if you're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here and some real <UNK> technically i liked it a lot too they must have used a new de <UNK> <UNK> or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but i wasn't annoyed by the usual <UNK> seen in video to film <UNK> open water drove me nuts mostly because there are cheap <UNK> cameras available now and i see no excuse in not <UNK> for one if you intend to screen in the cinema sorry that's my own little rant i definitely recommend this film if you've ever been involved with the music scene it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious i might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it's a classic piece
<START> where to start this movie started badly and ended badly it consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effects that had me cringing in my seat seriously my cat could have acted better than this lot br br some of it was actually laughable because it was so unbelievable i would of rated this lower but they haven't got anything else so <UNK> my warning and unless your so bored your close to suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission don't bother with this one i'm still in shock that this could actually be released to the public this should be a crime and all involved should be arrested i gather you've got the <UNK> by now so i'll leave it up to you to decide
<START> if they gave me the option of negative numbers i'd use it this movie was truly god awful i went into the theaters expecting it to be horrible and it somehow managed to <UNK> my expectations br br the script was weak the acting was painful i wanted to walk out but my friend was driving and wanted to get her <UNK> worth i think we were both disappointed br br the growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong eddie izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain he came off as oddly weak and silly jenny <UNK> uma thurman came off as psychotic and strange as did <UNK> luke wilson friend vaughn <UNK> wilson
<START> this is without doubt <UNK> worst movies ever the first part is held in place with solid comedy from <UNK> but it <UNK> gets worse and worse and completely illogical our hero also takes a dig at saints with the same name <UNK> through a corny and utterly lame one liner the first half has <UNK> <UNK> his usual array of <UNK> and style and in the second half becomes a quasi saint after a <UNK> takes him through a <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> where <UNK> not the famous saints he took a dig at earlier gives him special powers for no apparent reason other than <UNK> this is really starting to get interesting now isn't it br br the rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic <UNK> and powers and fighting off politicians and related black magic the usual predictable crap with hilarious <UNK> oh and the black magic never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a <UNK> <UNK> er <UNK> <UNK> with him the bad guys and the usual politician villains are clichéd <UNK> and in the end completely insignificant to the plot which itself doesn't go anywhere br br but despite all the flaws it was fun to kill time with and yell <UNK> related one liners during public events its also fun to watch others curse about this movie <UNK> <UNK> is said to have composed the tracks for his movie through the cell phone thats how important he considered it br br <UNK> is very popular in japan and he has included two characters one of them is called <UNK> why not <UNK> of japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it but the way they are portrayed dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic the japanese may stop watching <UNK> movies after seeing that this movie was probably <UNK> material for <UNK> entering politics but the results of the movie itself would have killed off any of his political dreams br br fun if you turn your brain off though
<START> this movie is weak the box cover says east <UNK> <UNK> gang and it is really santa <UNK> james <UNK> acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough <UNK> gang it is fake boring senseless and <UNK> i tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad it was also on the <UNK> erotic tip far from what the video box <UNK> james <UNK> should act in gay porno james is in every scene he cannot act to save his life the film features eva longoria who is hot but james can't even score with her i felt at times i was watching gay porn and was turned off by the whole film james clearly <UNK> to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again his martial arts skills are minimal at best some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and rip him a new one
<START> i really wanted to like this movie and watched all the way through thinking it had to get better don't get me wrong it's not the worst flick ever but it never lives up to it's potential the premise is good the cast is great i was especially <UNK> to witness the return of david <UNK> and god love 'em you can tell everyone tried their best it just falls short over and over again brutal massacre should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only christopher guest can do christopher guest movies and despite the fact he makes it look easy you should probably just forget trying to do the same <UNK> and brian <UNK> are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often they are the reason this gets 4 stars from me if you're going to have the spinal tap of horror i suspect you might want the guy who made spinal tap to <UNK> it just thinking out loud there
<START> this is the kind of movie hollywood needs to make more of no <UNK> props no car chases no clever one liners just people dealing with being people br br william macy plays an unlikely <UNK> who works for his father donald sutherland macy is the <UNK> son sutherland is the <UNK> father son wants out of the business father won't let him macy loves his own son played beautifully by david <UNK> the ring he also starts to fall in love with <UNK> campbell a girl he meets in the waiting room of his <UNK> office br br it's an interesting <UNK> of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he <UNK> his own needs with those of his family there are many touching scenes especially between macy and his little boy and as you'd expect in a film with william macy in it there's a bit of humor too br br excellent job all around actors and director nice to know they can still make a good film in hollywood on a small budget
<START> this movie is not about entertainment or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god one cannot help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie we have several <UNK> of love that contributes to the value of this movie there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed god's love <UNK> the heart and mind and <UNK> and is eternal there is the love in a marriage while the main character <UNK> with his wife's disease he realizes through god's love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated finally you have the love of child and parent the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love <UNK> fear dear friends love is not love unless it comes from god because god is love and love comes from god talk to someone and let them know you love them love does no good unless it is given to another i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it <UNK>
<START> every great gangster movie has under <UNK> of human drama don't expect an emotional story of guilt <UNK> and despair from scarface this is a tale of <UNK> greed corruption and power the darker side of the <UNK> american dream br br anybody complaining about the cheesiness of this film is missing the point the superficial characters cheesy music and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess nothing in the lives of these characters really matter not on any human level at least in fact the film practically <UNK> satire ironic considering all the <UNK> <UNK> that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of tony montana br br this isn't brian <UNK> strongest directorial effort it is occasionally excellent and well handled particularly the memorable finale but frequently sinks to sloppy and <UNK> thankfully it is supported by a very strong script by oliver stone probably good therapy for him considering the coke habit he was <UNK> at the time the themes are consistent with the focus primarily on the life of tony montana and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power the dialogue is also excellent see <UNK> <UNK> between humour and drama there are many stand out lines which have since <UNK> their way into popular culture in one form or another br br the cast help make it what it is as well but this is really <UNK> film one of his earlier less subtle performances something much more common from him nowadays this is a world entirely separate from michael <UNK> and frank <UNK> yet he is as watchable here as ever in very entertaining and intentionally over the top form it is hard to imagine another tony montana after seeing this film in possibly one of the most <UNK> performances ever pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing but i've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife not an exceptional effort but unfairly <UNK> the supporting players are very good too particularly paul <UNK> as the suave <UNK> <UNK> br br powerful occasionally humorous sometimes shocking and continually controversial scarface is one of the films of the eighties whatever that might mean to you an essential and accessible gangster flick and a pop culture landmark 9 10
<START> i am not going to spoil the <UNK> to anyone who has not yet watched this humble masterpiece by kay <UNK> br br a world famous conductor brilliantly played by michael <UNK> seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village the villagers who has followed the genius in silence are slowly <UNK> him to share of his greatness br br each role in this movie has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own <UNK> in short but precise words a <UNK> of love br br not love in the sense of relationship but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters each revealing their own present story their needs their <UNK> desires and much more br br i shall not forget to mention the two main parts played by <UNK> <UNK> and michael <UNK> whose dramas are played in unforgettable <UNK> of emotional <UNK> they touch each other with a pain connected in their own <UNK> to love themselves br br michael <UNK> is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup in one of those movies that either end up as <UNK> or fantastic and fantastic it became from start to end not one second less or more than enough you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more br br to this day definitely one of the best movies i have had the pleasure of watching
<START> i loved this movie since i was 7 and i saw it on the opening day it was so touching and beautiful i strongly recommend seeing for all it's a movie to watch with your family by far br br my mpaa rating pg 13 for <UNK> elements prolonged scenes of <UNK> nudity sexuality and some language
<START> evil aliens owes a huge debt to peter <UNK> early films bad taste and <UNK> i must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about this jake west is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up to i lost count of the amount of times a major hollywood film was <UNK> most notably james <UNK> aliens the amount of blood and gore on show here isn't funny either the latter end of the film becomes tired and dragged out maybe it would have worked better as a short film the actors a poor the direction is weak and the plot is non existent i can see what the director was trying to do the homage he was trying to pay but others have done the same thing a lot better than presented here 4 10
<START> this was an adorable movie a real feel good movie when you need one the story is light this is no gone with the wind but sometimes one needs this kind of plot funny and warm characters fantastic acting and beautiful costumes wardrobe br br <UNK> k <UNK> also from the tv show er is wonderful in this role she is definitely a new shining star for hollywood all should keep an eye on her she's going to be big in the future br br also <UNK> was the soundtrack for this movie a nice mix of modern and indian tunes i was dancing throughout most of the movie br br highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need
<START> my wife and i are semi amused by <UNK> <UNK> show i also like shatner even when he's at his most pathetic br br but this is absolutely the worst show on television br br please <UNK> this show it sucks a br br the only positive thing i can say is that the girls are <UNK> on this show and seem to wear less clothing than deal or no deal br br the questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure and watching shatner or the contestant say show me the money makes me want to vomit br br this one will not last
<START> reese <UNK> first outing on the big screen was a memorable one she appears like a fresh <UNK> face <UNK> slight and <UNK> but undeniably reese br br i have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on i say that because whenever i have watched her perform the characters thus far in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character quite nicely in fact br br anyway my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with <UNK> sutherland somehow i assumed that was her first time up at bat not so well done reese
<START> this was the first ewan <UNK> movie i ever saw outside of star wars since then i have become a very big ewan <UNK> fan but i still can't bring myself to forgive this movie's existence br br my sister has always been a huge jane austen fan and because of that i have been subjected to various of the classics emma being one of them i've always considered them irritating stupid and boring however after watching this terrible rendition i was forced to admit that the original emma was delightful and charming ewan <UNK> <UNK> serves a purpose in this film after they <UNK> and <UNK> the part of frank <UNK> <UNK> paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is <UNK> and stupid br br my recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in english period drama go see the originals if you're a ewan <UNK> fan believe me by skipping this film you haven't missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad <UNK>
<START> and a 30 000 budget and this movie still looks like it was made for 50 you can tell from the first frame to the last that he didn't care one bit about the movies continuity or plot he was just happy to be making a zombie movie br br what the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies it could have been great if he just had of given a care the end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore and even more poorly produced metal plays over it br br what happens when you combine high hopes big dreams a decent budget hard work and one idiot behind the camera
<START> <UNK> is an astronaut who goes on the world's first space mission to <UNK> but of course this being a horror movie things turn ugly and he returns to earth as the only survivor stricken with some bizarre condition that causes him to slowly melt and lose his mind unless he regularly <UNK> human flesh he kills what apparently is the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the <UNK> town to stalk more victims br br i liked the premise and the monster and gore effects are actually pretty good but the space scenes are just <UNK> together out of stock <UNK> footage and the hospital looks curiously like a warehouse a very weak script little character development and overall poor acting keep this one from rising above being anything other than a mediocre slasher flick with the novelty of having a living candle as the killer and more or less only has its gore effects to hold your interest br br 4 out of 10 strictly for the most die hard monster movie fans
<START> elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying <UNK> self in this film this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and <UNK> rock hudson was ok as <UNK> <UNK> but clearly an actor with more range like william <UNK> would have been better james dean certainly proved he knew how to <UNK> his way through a movie the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long the actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make up hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and dean and <UNK> baker were obviously the same age br br 0 10
<START> just like last years event wwe new years revolution 2006 was <UNK> by an <UNK> chamber match the difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value in reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> new york with the wwe championship those men were current champion john cena kurt angle and shawn michaels there was no way <UNK> mac would put the belt on any of the <UNK> carlito or chris masters and kane kane last held the wwe championship in june 1998 and that was only for one night it was obvious he wasn't going to be the one either last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far br br the only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event out <UNK> vince <UNK> himself and <UNK> they lift the chamber it was then announced that edge was <UNK> in his money in the bank championship match right then and there with no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the <UNK> chamber match john cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a <UNK> to one of the most entertaining heels in wwe this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night br br the <UNK> like last year was truly atrocious triple h and the big show put on a <UNK> fest that had me struggling to stay away <UNK> picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it any pay per view that has both jerry <UNK> and <UNK> wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it the king <UNK> <UNK> who books this stuff and big <UNK> <UNK> defeat against the wasted <UNK> benjamin with a little help from his mama br br the women of the wwe also had a busy night there was the usual <UNK> nonsense with a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> match which was won by ashley and the woman's championship was also on the line in a match i thought would have been left to <UNK> till <UNK> 22 <UNK> james challenged <UNK> <UNK> in a good match <UNK> won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the <UNK> future br br the opening contest of the night <UNK> soon to be wwe champion edge against <UNK> champion <UNK> flair this could have been better but it was a <UNK> and bloody flair that <UNK> after a <UNK> finish edge obviously had bigger fish to <UNK> br br so new years revolution kicked off the 2006 pay per view <UNK> in disastrous fashion the only good thing from that is knowing that for the wwe the only way is up they don't get much worse than this
<START> when i began watching the muppets take manhattan the choppy presentation and dialogue had me convinced i was watching something recent so you can imagine my surprise when i came to the imdb and read that it was made in 1984 jim <UNK> may have ended the muppet show when it was at its peak but spin offs like this and muppet babies which apparently is based upon a very terrible sequence in this film are the absolute <UNK> of all things muppet i used to wonder why muppets attracted such <UNK> from such film reviewers as mr <UNK> so i am glad that the muppets take manhattan <UNK> <UNK> set me straight on that one of course many series have had a massive drop off in quality when the third episode came around aliens <UNK> the evil dead even night of the living dead so while it is no surprise that <UNK> is less than the muppet movie or the great muppet caper the surprise lies entirely in how much less than the awesome debut or its slightly lesser follow up <UNK> is not only is the music far less satisfying the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible br br there are of course some redeeming and genuinely funny moments but they are few and far between the swedish chef is great in any scene he <UNK> so thank the spirit of small <UNK> that he appears in one sequence where his <UNK> is exploited to the <UNK> the problem is that there are just no scenes that work the story such as it is revolves around a broadway musical <UNK> is attempting to get produced he goes through many trials and <UNK> along the way including the <UNK> suspicion the viewer has that we have seen this all before the biggest problem is that <UNK> does not have a decent antagonist to work off this time charles <UNK> was cinematic gold as doc hopper the <UNK> of a fast food chain who wants to exploit <UNK> for his business charles <UNK> was dynamite as <UNK> holiday a jewel thief the muppets must fight in order to save miss <UNK> from a lifetime in prison the saying is that a hero is only as good as his antagonist and these two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films br br charles <UNK> also highlights what is wrong with <UNK> namely the music sucks the opening number of the manhattan <UNK> show that is at the centre of <UNK> to put it nicely makes the drivel that now <UNK> the <UNK> seem <UNK> i might just be letting my peculiar sensitivity to the sounds of words and phrases getting to me but songs like the <UNK> connection inspired tears of joy not <UNK> <UNK> big solo during the great muppet caper while not having the same <UNK> he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own he is all class and if there is one thing <UNK> could use it is rising eight steps in addition to <UNK> a semblance of class <UNK> also feels severely time <UNK> with the story <UNK> from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story <UNK> <UNK> himself pointed out that transition and <UNK> make a film feel like a coherent whole rather than a mess of thrown together pieces see if you can find them in <UNK> br br while <UNK> does have its guest stars they are either poorly <UNK> brooke <UNK> and john <UNK> or totally out of their element <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> coleman to call this a waste of time for <UNK> and actor alike is <UNK> the absence of an end credits routine is especially sore here after <UNK> go home <UNK> for the muppet movie in particular which highlights another problem the characters are poorly written at best with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard animal shouts <UNK> words at times but they have nothing to do with the plot or the conversation going on around him say what you will about set pieces designed to show off characters but think of <UNK> moment after eating the instant growth <UNK> or his <UNK> after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow muppets now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual muppet other than swedish <UNK> hilarious <UNK> of three dimensional film involving popcorn give up then you have proved my point br br given that <UNK> one of the <UNK> <UNK> best and most timeless products outside of the muppets arrived some two years later it makes <UNK> all the more puzzling perhaps this misfire convinced jim <UNK> to <UNK> his <UNK> regarding character development and usage or perhaps the misfire can be attributed to frank oz who at the time had just finished working with george lucas on what many would agree is the most childish episode in the original star wars saga the writers were also involved with the great muppet caper so i will let them off the hook for this in spite of the fact that a script is one of the most essential pieces of a film the production is also <UNK> improved here with muppets appearing capable of moving in ways that were previously beyond them had the story and script been better thought out <UNK> might have been at least comparable to the great muppet caper as it stands now it is a great answer to the question of whether muppets write under the influence or <UNK> br br for that reason i gave the muppets take manhattan a three out of ten two to <UNK> its actual quality and a bonus for the swedish <UNK> moments without him this film would be unwatchable
<START> although kurt russell was and is probably the closest person to look like elvis in show business so many things were false in this film first of all the makers claimed elvis opened his famous live shows in <UNK> after a 9 year <UNK> for films by wearing a white jump suit made in 1972 also they claimed he sang <UNK> <UNK> which he first sung in 1972 and 'the wonder of <UNK> which he first recorded in 1970 they also claim that he got his first guitar for christmas when all elvis fans know he got it for his birthday i know all movies based on past have something false but these things are so obvious to people who like elvis
<START> i really must watch a good movie soon because it seems every other entry or so is something that i despise however my history speaks i must not tell a lie bobby <UNK> and everything about it sucks big green banana <UNK> i never thought that i would see a film <UNK> as <UNK> as this one did al pacino isn't acting in this film he's posing there are many many scenes of his character who is a race car driver just staring at the camera he's perfectly awful <UNK> <UNK> is just as bad these two are supposed to be in a love affair and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever sydney <UNK> directed this film there's no trace of the genius behind <UNK> here is this the same man i <UNK> for in eyes wide shut i can hardly believe it save yourself a horrible movie experience run don't walk away from bobby <UNK>
<START> this rip off of the 1984 hit <UNK> is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie ever made even for a <UNK> grade movie all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot acting and goodness br br it begins with a random old security guard and the younger <UNK> security guard whose name is of no importance why because a few minutes into the film he walks into the <UNK> safe and is killed whilst living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub br br this is just an <UNK> for the <UNK> filled main course the main character kevin struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total <UNK> perhaps he succeeds within the film but to the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard and is guided through his security shift in the wait for it abandoned studio lot yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself back to the film kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the hobgoblins the hobgoblins force people to live out their <UNK> fantasies and then kill them for some reason they must be returned before sunrise or else or else what exactly br br other characters include <UNK> <UNK> army friend nick <UNK> <UNK> daphne whose character has no more substance than a bitch slut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits there is <UNK> manipulative and <UNK> girlfriend amy whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed cher look alike with <UNK> <UNK> with a pair of blue grandma <UNK> on top don't ask me how that works quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is kyle how such groups of friends are made is up for question kyle is a perverted creep who can't go an hour without self stimulating his <UNK> include calling up sex chat lines from other people's houses and most likely <UNK> underwear br br the story unfolds as the heroes search for the hobgoblins <UNK> high creatures aka hand puppets which for some reason attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood each of the characters eventually lives out their <UNK> fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars or the film having a big budget br br warning spoilers ahead the twist at the end of this movie will leave the watcher wondering what the hobgoblins are returned to the safe by their own free will perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to <UNK> havoc or perhaps the story writers got writer's <UNK> and decided not to worry about the ending upon returning to the safe the old security guard reveals what he learned in the military and <UNK> <UNK> which destroys the safe <UNK> the end of the evil hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster ride better <UNK> to a ride on an <UNK> br br the sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears if you plan to watch it i recommend a few alcoholic drinks beforehand to take any serious consideration of the film out of mind
<START> out of the first five episodes of <UNK> short running hammer house of horror series this fifth episode with the wonderful title the house that <UNK> to death is arguably the <UNK> one as a great fan of the hammer <UNK> gothic horror films for many years i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently so far i've only seen the first five episodes and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are i will be satisfied whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and <UNK> dark sense of humor this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine horror the episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations years later william nicholas ball and emma peters rachel davies move in the house with their little daughter sophie emma <UNK> soon after moving in however the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house which is seemingly haunted the second episode directed by francis <UNK> is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry growing pains episode 4 and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances the film is also well made in terms of effects cinematography and score the house that <UNK> to death is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer fans should like to see in a short horror tale the film delivers a creepy atmosphere genuine scare moments and intelligent twists and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end overall this is highly <UNK> to hammer fans
<START> i saw this not too long ago and i must say this movie is terrible i watch crappy movies for fun <UNK> is not fun scarecrow is stupid you have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful <UNK> as he kills his victims actually worse than the one contained in this sentence he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings everyone picks on me the only girl that thinks i'm not trailer trash likes one of the guys that pick on me i want to kill everybody <UNK> ok i'm <UNK> but the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies br br adding to what i just said the kid's mom is <UNK> he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on mom's boyfriend tells him to leave kid refuses <UNK> that he isn't going to leave his own house boyfriend chases kid into corn field he kills kid right in front of mom mom screams in terror boyfriend is like <UNK> i didn't mean to then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it kid was killed under a scarecrow though so like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance his victims haven't been stalked like this before <UNK> official tag line br br to make matters worse this movie was filmed in a <UNK> 8 days that's right 8 days i was going to give this movie a 2 because in spite of itself it has one or two redeeming moments they're spoilers so i won't spoil it for you if you actually want to see this crap i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting the horrible special effects the abysmal script and the bad camera work but i simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level br br this movie isn't nearly as good as i'm making it out to be if you want to see an example of how not to make a movie or if you enjoy watching bad movies like i do then watch this at your own risk everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times
<START> i liked this film a lot it's dark it's not a bullet <UNK> car chasing <UNK> your brain action movie a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds br br in the end motivated by love or vengeance or a desire to <UNK> he does what he feels is right <UNK> god ever forgive us for what we've done ' it's not a question mortal men can answer so he does what he feels he has to do what he's good at what he's been trained to do br br denzel washington is a great actor i honestly can't think of one bad movie he's done and he's got a great supporting cast i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone
<START> i read some <UNK> reviews here on imdb and thought i would give this movie a look disappointed on the plus side the male leads are good and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince seems to be full of its' own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess br br it is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows br br a film noir is marked by a mood of <UNK> <UNK> menace and cynical characters br br well that is the story here 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness alcoholism <UNK> <UNK> etc and together they <UNK> to kidnap a child and <UNK> each other br br would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character <UNK> of the <UNK> i thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress br br whilst some good moments i finished up feeling i had wasted my time br br 4 10
<START> <UNK> answer to the exorcist isn't a very good one unfortunately the film offers bland unimaginative direction from michael winner who wastes an outstanding cast with a screenplay <UNK> <UNK> sized plot holes not to mention it's <UNK> silly never explaining certain key elements within the story br br model <UNK> raines moves into a high rise owned by the catholic church with a creepy blind priest john carradine who holes up in there always at the window she begins to suffer faint spells and <UNK> what's worse is <UNK> she meets in the building such as burgess meredith with a cat and a <UNK> and a young beverly <UNK> as a lesbian <UNK> <UNK> looking great at <UNK> is the <UNK> who showed raines the place <UNK> lover is chris sarandon whose wife committed suicide after finding out they were having an affair <UNK> <UNK> has a small role as the priest of the <UNK> who informs <UNK> arthur kennedy to be careful as he heads to the very high rise not only <UNK> carradine but raines as well sarandon sends a hired hand up to the high rise one night to check out a certain room above <UNK> apartment where she heard <UNK> <UNK> and other loud <UNK> he winds up dead the very same night <UNK> kills her dead father in a nightmare screaming mad on the street <UNK> does indeed have blood on her which leads police detective eli <UNK> and partner christopher walken to investigate them with sure <UNK> that it all somehow leads back to sarandon who is a hot shot lawyer who once beat the cop in court regarding the whole wife's suicide that case is really a <UNK> factor is <UNK> <UNK> approach to finding out whose blood was really on <UNK> and if sarandon has anything to do with it you also have martin <UNK> as a professor who understands this type of latin <UNK> mysteriously understands and <UNK> actors such as jeff goldblum as a fashion photographer and tom berenger as a man interested in this certain room that has become available in the very room now <UNK> that <UNK> once stayed in what bothers me more than anything is lack of explanation towards the end of the film <UNK> and walken are forgotten and we are left wondering why they just up and quit investigating their characters are just left on the back <UNK> how the priests know that now is the time when a certain man will die and must be replaced to guard a certain gate in that high rise and why <UNK> suffers through the trauma she does isn't adequately explained how certain ghosts just appear to <UNK> and disappear when she tries to show <UNK> the rooms they occupied during a <UNK> birthday see for yourself isn't adequately explained not to mention <UNK> role in the grand scheme of things she brings people to that high rise but what is really her reasons in the film it seems like this film should've been longer and <UNK> things up left lost to a rushed conclusion that is just laughable when it should be scary
<START> when you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other the least you can expect is the superb <UNK> and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 <UNK> old amitabh bachchan romances a <UNK> <UNK> old <UNK> wait in fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of <UNK> it is the content that is <UNK> in this <UNK> turned writer director r <UNK> maiden effort br br trust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise cracks and bitter sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half the locales of london as captured in rainy season are captivating by the end of first half romance completed and mission accomplished there is not much left to be said therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girl's father to the extent that he goes for a <UNK> is really a test of patience there is an equally strange climax about how he gives in the result second half is dry flat with no energy there is a subplot with a girl child dying of cancer not making much impact nonetheless the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances
<START> i love this movie purple rain came out the year i was born and it has had my heart since i can remember prince is so tight in this movie i went to a special showing of purple rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so <UNK> it is really one of the greatest movies of all time the music is <UNK> the movie is about the kid played by prince his family is dysfunctional his band is the <UNK> act in town and he has his eyes on the <UNK> an aspiring singer there is no question why purple is my favorite color i can thank the kid for that so if you have not seen this then you are need to <UNK> this is a classic <UNK>
<START> weak bobby <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and mario <UNK> bring this down br br <UNK> being the worst definitely a one trick <UNK> i think they could have gotten other american <UNK> to come to the table on this one as the iron <UNK> the kind of <UNK> this duo come up with really don't reflect on the creativity of the original iron chef series i don't think <UNK> even went to chef school actually there are a lot of great <UNK> in america i just wonder why they don't appear on the food network br br it would also help to have more <UNK> ingredients and perhaps co <UNK> who can handle the pressure i like <UNK> brown but he is a bit too <UNK> funny for this role
<START> this was a silly movie with a predictable storyline and dreadful acting willy nelson was as stiff as his <UNK> the movie just seemed like a very long <UNK> for the bright red <UNK> that jessica simpson wore especially as there were so many close ups on her face the premise was not amusing and as i said <UNK> predictable whatever money was spent on making this movie was a shameful waste any <UNK> to other old marilyn monroe movies did not enhance the viewing of blonde ambition at all it was also so unbelievable jessica simpson being able to step into an executive secretary position at the drop of a hat that was laughable
<START> red rock west is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next nicolas cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work dennis hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better look for a brief appearance by country singing star dwight <UNK> this is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments what matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort
<START> i've never been a huge fan of mormon films being a mormon i've always felt that the humor was too <UNK> to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive <UNK> i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air the <UNK> movie i could finally discuss with my non mormon friends br br boy was i wrong br br i figured since this had b list talent like clint howard gary coleman andrew wilson and fred <UNK> one of my favorites this would have to be at least a little funny and besides church basketball is <UNK> with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such but i must say throughout the entire movie it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing every joke fell flat and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored the dialogue was bland and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen every single character but <UNK> was less than one dimensional it's hard to believe that after nine re writes the film was still as mind numbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed i can't put into words the rage i felt sitting through this my friends and i were extras in the final game scene so we went to the premiere in washington city <UNK> kurt hale the director was there and i must say i avoided all contact with him after the show he waited at the door seemingly ready for <UNK> i couldn't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life but it left a nasty painful <UNK> that i will never forget br br here are a few specific problems i had there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the <UNK> piano player but these two characters came out of nowhere and were impossible to care about so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame uninteresting characters there were many subplots that popped up every now and then each promising the audience the chance for laughs but each one came and went in a <UNK> of smoke ending before you could even start caring this was pretty much how the whole movie felt br br this film was a major letdown and i feel bad for everyone who's expecting the first real funny mormon movie true the jokes in this one aren't too <UNK> to <UNK> then again it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud <UNK> sensation in my ears br br please do not see this movie keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious spare yourself the disappointment i went through

<START> title robot <UNK> 1990 br br director stuart gordon br br cast gary graham anne marie johnson paul <UNK> br br review stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re animator from beyond <UNK> and castle freak took a small <UNK> here and did a little sci fi flick i stress the word little since this is a very low budget flick and there in lies its main weakness br br the story takes place in the future a world in which the great <UNK> that according to this movie are the united states and russia duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots our hero <UNK> must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues br br well the idea is awesome i guess the great nations <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with giant robots interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director br br i as a kid loved this movie and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie you'll have to <UNK> back to little kid mode to have some fun with it i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like what the hell is this piece of crap franco and i'm like well this movie is a sci fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like <UNK> stop and not having them go through that torture i could go through it cause i loved this film as a kid and there's still a little nostalgia attached to watching it but everyone else was just not going to get it br br and i myself realized that the movie isn't really that good first off the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief but unfortunately this being a small scale movie from a small scale company empire pictures which went <UNK> after making this film the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half <UNK> br br ok granted once you accept that you are watching a mixture of <UNK> stop animation and <UNK> well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool and made me go thats why i liked <UNK> movie but every know and them some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little <UNK> you were trying to hide in and boom your right back into realizing this film just doesn't live up to its premise br br and <UNK> another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie this movie is basically a movie for kids you know giant robots <UNK> it out stop motion animation hello but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual <UNK> and the violence gets a little bloody so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities which really isn't a good mix br br so for those of you who don't feel that certain naive <UNK> charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don't have a nostalgic connection to this movie like i do well id suggest you steer clear away from this one <UNK> a great director but this movie he made just didn't do it for me well at least not now that i'm a full grown adult br br rating 2 out of 5
<START> while i can't deny that his movies are often entertaining i have always personally felt that martin scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities his use of flashy <UNK> in a good number of his movies seems to scream look at me aren't i an imaginative director his best film that i have seen is the one with the least added <UNK> the <UNK> raging bull br br for this remake it appears it was business as usual though the dull film stock to convey a 1950's setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself the melodramatic close ups combined with the sub par imitation of the classic psycho score are more likely to <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> than a sense of atmospheric terror the score for psycho was brilliantly unnerving this <UNK> just sounds shrill and annoying even the cast who can be decent at times deliver <UNK> performances that just scream <UNK> the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by lewis as the <UNK> teenage daughter of the <UNK> family br br the worst acting <UNK> here is surprisingly de niro sure he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just <UNK> away now i'm no expert on american accents me originally coming from near <UNK> in england <UNK> all but surely he could've come up with a more convincing southern <UNK> than that being the gifted physical actor he is he almost <UNK> this fatal flaw but not quite it was <UNK> for me as a de niro fan to be wishing he was off screen rather than <UNK> at his performance br br possible spoilers br br the over the top style of the whole movie <UNK> to the ridiculously overblown finale when will scorsese learn that <UNK> the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and <UNK> <UNK> i also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the <UNK> not dead <UNK> cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ br br all in all a thoroughly ridiculous <UNK> scorsese and de niro have done much better work together

<START> having searched for this movie high and low i actually found it when i least expected playing on the sundance channel very early in the morning one day why i searched endlessly for a small vanity project that chuck <UNK> that was made during the last <UNK> years of the tv show i haven't a clue the film is simply put horrible the scripted part that deals with a week that is of course the highlight of the film is seeing the real performers that were too hot for tv or rejected for some reason or other that part is still horrid but campy bad which was enjoyable in it's own way now that i saw what i sought after for so long will i watch it again in my lifetime <UNK> no do yourself a favor and just watch the much much better <UNK> of a dangerous mind or find old copies of the actual show the girl act where there just <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was fun but having to endure seeing jay p <UNK> flash the audience has in all <UNK> made me <UNK> in <UNK> i'm so very happy that this was massive flop for if it was a massive hit there could have been a the 1 98 beauty show movie and that my friends would surely have brought upon the apocalypse br br my grade d
<START> i have to admit when i went to see this movie i didn't really have high expectations but even with my low expectations i was totally and utterly disappointed br br basically luke wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends there's slight mention of a girl stalking him but that's pretty much it for that character which i don't quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie br br so while on a subway <UNK> wilson who i actually liked before this movie convinces him to talk to a hot girl uma thurman this is strange to say the least as everyone can clearly see that uma thurman does not belong under the category of hot br br <UNK> <UNK> performance is also far from hot normally i'm all for his acting but even he couldn't salvage this movie his character was <UNK> unrealistic and rather annoying you could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy or just desperate it was almost painful br br but anyway someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway and luke wilson being the charming <UNK> he is runs after the <UNK> now we all know that uma thurman is the superhero or g girl as they like to call her in the movie it still <UNK> me as to what the g stands for but we'll leave that for the message boards to debate br br the sex scenes i assume are supposed to be funny but i find myself asking who has sex like that they nearly throw the bed through the wall because of uma <UNK> passion let's say it makes my head hurt but not in the i'm thinking really hard to understand this way br br when uma insults anna <UNK> calling her a whore i had no debate with that apart from the fact that she can't choose movies properly she can't act and relies <UNK> on the fact that she's blonde and typical br br overall i would've walked out of the theater if i hadn't paid 8 75 to see it the characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry especially uma thurman someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesn't mean you're acting br br also the script and storyline could've used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid i actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors and their dying careers overall if you value your money and your self respect do not waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie
<START> perhaps because i was so young innocent and <UNK> when i saw it this movie was the cause of many <UNK> nights for me i haven't seen it since i was in seventh grade at a <UNK> school so i am not sure what effect it would have on me now however i will say that it left an impression on me and most of my friends it did serve its purpose at least until we were old enough and <UNK> enough to analyze and create our own opinions i was particularly terrified of what the newly converted post rapture christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast i don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it so i will not mention details of the scenes but i can still picture them in my head and it's been 19 years
<START> there was a great film to be made about steve biko sadly this wasn't it denzel washington never the most <UNK> of actors is totally unable to convey the great charisma that biko had <UNK> big crowd scenes are laughable the <UNK> massacre wasn't like this three neat lines of children some doing <UNK> <UNK> happily into the guns of the soldiers with biko dead the film rapidly <UNK> into farce if the struggle against apartheid was anything it was a black people's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be <UNK> by the escape of a white man and his family i'm sure donald woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that biko was important while he wasn't penelope <UNK> accent is pure <UNK> and she seems completely unaware that she is in south africa at all at all the <UNK> family dog gets more lines than the black maid as the family make their escape one the women i saw the film with incidentally one of only about a dozen black people in a large full cinema <UNK> this is like the sound of music she had a point br br overall this is a film by a well <UNK> if somewhat inept white liberal about a radical black people's struggle and really south africa needs well <UNK> white <UNK> like it needs a hole in the head
<START> bo <UNK> debut film remained unseen for eight years  and that's how it should stayed john derek was a competent actor but as a director he's virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema  not that this is especially explicit considering that bo <UNK> sporting dark hair was only 16 when the film was made john also wrote and photographed it the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set  but the plotting is <UNK> and the dialogue atrocious br br the character played by male lead peter <UNK> has been brought up with <UNK> family they grew up as brother and sister but now in their teens the couple discover they're attracted to one another but as i said don't expect any sexual fireworks still the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their <UNK>  <UNK> wants to turn the remote fishing community into a <UNK> sea side resort and keeps expecting a cruise liner to appear into view which of course it does at the finale <UNK> is even <UNK>  she <UNK> possession of a large <UNK> bath <UNK> for the record the couple are married by the end of the film br br also involved in the non events are the female town mayor and a photographer <UNK> who wants to make a model out of bo and who naturally <UNK> the wrath of the jealous <UNK> occasionally for no very good reason we're even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an open air movie house to which the whole town <UNK> among the titles shown is the public enemy 1931 at the end of the day while <UNK> <UNK> throughout is undeniably charming it's not enough to <UNK> the film's overwhelming <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> this movie was a disappointment i was looking forward to seeing a good movie i am the type of person who starts a movie and doesn't turn it off until the end but i was forcing myself not to turn it off br br <UNK> reason why i didn't turn it off was because i am a huge christian slater fan and i wanted to see him act in it i was really speechless after i finished watching the movie br br this movie was one of the worst movies that i have seen in my life thank you christian slater for putting some humor into it if you hadn't been in this movie i would of been bored out of my mind br br i also agree that anthony hopkins needs to stick to acting by the time the movie was over i didn't even get the plot i was both confused and annoyed
<START> unlike other <UNK> who have commented on this movie's ability to <UNK> race <UNK> i think that this powerful film provides a complex and deep story that <UNK> <UNK> racism and the effects thereof washington directs <UNK> story with a careful hand and critical eye <UNK> this cinematic <UNK> neither to <UNK> of women's bodies <UNK> <UNK> stereotypes nor satisfying the expectation of the white <UNK> i think this film might be a bit too happy in the end however it is deeply <UNK> in <UNK> american culture and <UNK> to the point that some white <UNK> may get the feeling of looking into the life of this <UNK> american antwone fisher i have problems with the naval aspect of the film but when we look at america there are not many choices or opportunities for black men who are were in <UNK> situation or similar situations viewers may go to this movie expecting a black movie what is a black movie br br do stereotypes of <UNK> <UNK> drug dealers single parent homes and so forth <UNK> a black movie i think washington as director recognized that <UNK> americans and other people of color deal with human problems like abuse and <UNK> <UNK> to name a few these problems have historically and <UNK> only been given light and <UNK> via good will hunting and other white movies it's high time they were given the same recognition and <UNK> as their white counterparts in and out of the media br br sad to say though in this racist country denzel washington and derek luke will probably have to wait another ten years before they receive an oscar or anything else they both will have to wait until they direct or star in a movie that <UNK> the usual racist and sexist stereotypes to get an oscar that is to say denzel deserved awards for malcolm x <UNK> and others before that <UNK> training day oscar that is not to <UNK> or push aside other great actresses and actors of color who are denied their due praise for ingenious work yet hollywood would rather send the message that racism and <UNK> and <UNK> are acceptable by <UNK> and even rewarding those stereotypes as they appear in countless films such as american beauty midnight in the garden of good and evil american pie and even gone with the wind br br derek luke is a <UNK> actor and i wish him best all of the other actresses and actors gave superb performances hands down although i do take issue with <UNK> selection of yet another straight haired light skinned <UNK> that said everyone should watch this film however it may not be for everyone much <UNK> 10 10
<START> i think if you are into the sixties kind of thing as i am you are <UNK> to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable <UNK> the saving <UNK> of this <UNK> include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early and embarrassing footage it's as if the producers of laugh in sat down and decided to write a full length film covering all the high points and more of the issues between the flower children and the establishment then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a 10 000 budget to complete it hardly a classic but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was the silliness the over <UNK> and the <UNK> of the establishment clearly not for everyone
<START> this is one of quite a few cartoons with bugs bunny and marvin the martian and a space dog called k 9 is included as well this looney tunes episode is very funny has reasonably good cartoon animation <UNK> animation is very well done and the plot is well done the end is rather weird so be prepared for it it is slightly boring br br in this episode marvin the martian has been sent to earth to capture an earth creature and bring it back to mars with his <UNK> dog k 9 marvin sets out and soon finds the tracks of no other rabbit but bugs bunny he <UNK> them with treats thinking they are trick or <UNK> in their costumes little does he realise they are preparing themselves to take this rabbit to mars br br i recommend this episode to anyone who likes bugs bunny marvin the martian and looney tunes in general as far as the beginning and the middle of the episode are concerned you are likely to like this enjoy <UNK> <UNK>
<START> 1985 was a good year for films maybe even great but this one missing out on a <UNK> went a long way to convincing fans that ol' oscar is little more that a hood <UNK> for good party members br br 11 nominations and not a single title such was the <UNK> disdain for one of their greatest directors and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from <UNK> him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for <UNK> list which is arguably not as good and i'm half polish br br don't get me wrong <UNK> was a classic and i'm not knocking <UNK> of <UNK> which won that year either but it was in my mind a class behind this one an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears and i'm not a big <UNK> br br maybe it was the music superb or the cinematography <UNK> but more likely simply the acting whoopi who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a <UNK> danny glover who i'd never heard of before and of course oprah br br the rest is history but at the time who knew
<START> this movie was terrible the plot sucked the acting was bad the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out i wish i had the time i spent watching this movie back the balloon scene was stupid the mormon jokes are really old the soundtrack sucked i saw no chemistry between the two leads it's full of stereotypes stupid local <UNK> <UNK> most noted was del i'm going to drive as fast as i want to computer idiot what is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed that up this movie help create a long line of lackluster efforts to mainstream lds beliefs into hollywood i e the <UNK> church ball etc etc i would <UNK> watching this movie and instead run head first into a brick wall you will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show
<START> there can be no questions of spoilers for this movie the director beat us all too and spoiled this movie in oh so many ways br br a blatant rip off of stuff like <UNK> and <UNK> this movie fails on so many levels to <UNK> the humour and horror of those better made films it ends up a sleazy waste of time where bad actors deliver bad dialogue in front of an idiot director who occasionally <UNK> stuffed toys at them they <UNK> with said toys in much the same manner as old tarzan films used to use rubber <UNK> shaking them whilst screaming and trying their best to make it look slightly threatening it's painful to watch and not helped by the mental 80's fashions worn by the cast br br basically some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by an aging security guard in a film lot finally get free after <UNK> years <UNK> and begin to <UNK> screw around with peoples minds the guards new <UNK> the idiot who let them out despite repeated <UNK> gets his gang of 80's friends together and they go off and have minor adventures together while trying to <UNK> the <UNK> hobgoblins br br all life is here with the gang <UNK> of a <UNK> jock his 80's slut girlfriend the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> girlfriend and the young hero lacking in confidence and wishing his girlfriend would put out anyway br br first off comes the infamous <UNK> fighting scene where the ex military jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully <UNK> the nerdy hero with the wrong end of a <UNK> for what seems like hours then there's some running around <UNK> in a real pie fight style ending in a <UNK> nightclub with comedy hand <UNK> blowing up everything except the people standing right next to them then the film sorta ends and <UNK> well that ends well br br it's not this is like watching a train wreck you cant take your eyes off it it's so bad perfect fare for mystery science theater but god awful should you try to watch it alone and uncut the fashion police still have a number of outstanding <UNK> for the cast and i dare anyone not to laugh in outright <UNK> at the <UNK> fight this scores 2 out of 10 at most on a good day
<START> i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary what i love most about it is that it is understated and low key but deeply heartfelt henry <UNK> he played the child in e t performance is masterfully <UNK> he is supposed to be a man of few words david <UNK> is a wonderful crazy villain and miraculously given that we're talking about a hollywood product here a baby serves as a main character but one who doesn't act or have lines but rather just is is <UNK> at that interesting to note that <UNK> mysterious relationship w e t was the core of that film while his bond w the baby serves as the core of a good baby br br then there is the music ah what music gillian <UNK> tunes are wonderful the entire score is gorgeous hill country music br br this film is wonderfully atmospheric i recommend it highly
<START> this is <UNK> cartoon that should have won instead of country cousin visually well done and much more entertaining and memorable worth watching just for the music alone although there are elements that <UNK> will <UNK> the sensibilities of some these days the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective it's over sixty years old and it is after all just a cartoon i'm disabled and if i were as hyper sensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take <UNK> i would have long since <UNK> up in a <UNK> position and faded away sometimes you need to <UNK> up put your head back and <UNK> caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly <UNK> bing crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion sigh
<START> not as bad as some are making it out to be though obviously pathetic compared to the original in my opinion amitabh was great as the villain <UNK> <UNK> try not to compare to <UNK> in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect other than some mediocre action scenes however the rest of the film is flawed character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless with many <UNK> and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the dvd case the worst part of the movie was the support roles from <UNK> <UNK> and especially this new dude called <UNK> raj <UNK> is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open as for <UNK> raj seriously who is this guy where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks his acting ability is zero and he has the same tone dialog delivery and <UNK> expression in every scene whether it be action comedy or even a scene when someone has just died ajay <UNK> was average at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion overall <UNK> <UNK> is worth watching for <UNK> solid performance and also a very sexy <UNK> <UNK> in a special appearance
<START> this time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot <UNK> against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world i'm pretty sure it was double team which convinced everyone that jean claude van damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks however it was this that <UNK> his credibility forever while universal soldier the return isn't as dull as double team or the quest it's still pretty awful indeed with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing this sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling as i look back not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud in other words another <UNK> in van <UNK> <UNK> line br br out of 4 bad
<START> this show has come so far at first everyone in the cast from eric to <UNK> they were all new actors and actresses fresh faces and just look what they accomplished they stuck with the show and it was a success its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom i've ever seen in my life it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show i hope to god that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest <UNK> that any season finale has ever had i don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode go down swinging get one last punch in the show deserves it the fans deserve it if they go let everyone know its going to end like on friends and let the finale be huge i say get donna and eric married i say have hyde and <UNK> fight and become friends again i say have something interesting happen between <UNK> and jackie because <UNK> has been trying for so long but of course it wont work out for him just close out the series big time guys br br that 70s show will always be the best in my eyes eric <UNK> donna jackie <UNK> hyde i wish i had you guys as friends you are the best br br 10 10
<START> the movie had a lot of potential unfortunately it came apart because of a weak implausible story line <UNK> and general lack of content substance one of the very obvious flaws was that sean connery who played an arab man didn't know how to <UNK> his own arab name this may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details the quality of acting was uniformly well below average br br movie's <UNK> saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song i don't recall the title overall it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was <UNK> miscast
<START> spoilers in this br br <UNK> is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time but it is way too long it is not touching and sometimes even boring there are too many clichés and not enough good acting br br the storytelling storyline is bad like in james <UNK> titanic an old woman remembers events of her live good now <UNK> got a point of view than there is another woman introduced who does the same confusing is that they both are <UNK> events of <UNK> of other people come on this is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling how can <UNK> know about the fate of the little <UNK> mother and her <UNK> for example br br the scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place for example the scene when <UNK> is <UNK> to <UNK> when did that happen the scene looks like it is set in the <UNK> br br <UNK> character is of course a talented <UNK> well she is even a <UNK> wow her brother comes back from the eastern front he has received a <UNK> which he is showing in some scenes so he is a war hero and still a fine man who <UNK> his conscience and he gained knowledge of <UNK> committed by germans he even made some photographs and so it goes cliché after cliché is <UNK> up and this is why the movie does not work br br basically von <UNK> made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie and in the end it´s all very simple <UNK> finds a way to get <UNK> into bed and <UNK> da everyone is free which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the true story claim at the beginning like <UNK> it is vaguely based on a true event br br it is sad but true this is the typical german movie these days it is bad <UNK> j connor br br
<START> 1 2 scarlett johansson woody allen hugh jackman ian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> directed by woody allen just after his work with johansson on match point the two return for scoop a corky zany and fun comic ride when a student reporter johansson finds out a new scoop from a deceased reporter <UNK> when she enters the <UNK> of a lame magician allen the scoop being of the new <UNK> card killer in london who might be <UNK> peter <UNK> jackman while sondra and sid are playing detective sondra falls in love for the handsome would be killer allen has finally hit a mark not as good as match point but definitely more fun i laughed a lot more than i expected one of the years must sees
<START> fantastically <UNK> i don't mean to imply above that only a few people should avoid doc savage almost every <UNK> group would be bored by this trivial tv movie quality production it's a little like the 60's batman tv series except it's not funny even accidentally you're better off taking a <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> represents the directorial <UNK> of cecil b demille at its most inaccurate and un factual it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an <UNK> than wild bill <UNK> gary cooper buffalo bill cody james <UNK> <UNK> jane jean arthur george armstrong <UNK> and abraham lincoln to interact even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place every once in a while demille <UNK> dangerously close toward the truth but just as easily <UNK> away from it into <UNK> spectacle and <UNK> the film is an attempt to <UNK> <UNK> last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of <UNK> <UNK> and legends truly this is the world according to demille a <UNK> in the <UNK> of entertainment but a pretty campy <UNK> by today's standards br br transfer considering the vintage of the film this is a moderately appealing transfer with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments all in all the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road age related <UNK> are kept to a minimum and digital <UNK> do not distract the audio is <UNK> but nicely balanced br br extras forget it it's universal bottom line as pseudo history painted on celluloid this western is compelling and fun just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate
<START> i know anime i've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon i loved <UNK> before most people knew what <UNK> z even was and just so you know i'm not <UNK> about my let me say this out of all the <UNK> i've seen castle in the sky is by far one of the best it's obvious people say spirited away is the best but i really disagree most people only know that movie because it one an <UNK> award this isn't an exaggeration i've shown princess <UNK> and castle in the sky to people who'd only ever seen spirited away and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three personally i'd never thought that anything could compare to princess <UNK> until i finally saw castle in the sky i still think that the prior is the better of the two but castle in the sky is easily on par with it in many ways castle has major elements that <UNK> was missing in either case if you've only seen spirited away and think that that is miyazaki's best film be prepared to have your earth <UNK>
<START> full <UNK> i'm a <UNK> i like my endings sad and my <UNK> dry i didn't cry when <UNK> mother was shot will smith's new film happiness looks like a desperate <UNK> for an oscar basically i was born without an artistic soul br br so why on earth did i like 10 items or less maybe it was the double <UNK> i <UNK> before the show or more likely maybe it was that even the most <UNK> of movie fans could use an occasional shot of <UNK> br br and sweet it is from the moment him meets scarlet an event far from a nora <UNK> meet cute the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed aided beautifully by <UNK> <UNK> cinema <UNK> style camera work br br the main argument about the film is that it's too far fetched is the film far fetched i don't know you tell me i've yet to meet adrian <UNK> at the market however not for lack of trying do i enjoy considering the adventures that might occur should this <UNK> event take place darn straight i do that's where most reviews of 10 items or less fall short they fail to take into account that even we <UNK> have fantasies and heck sometimes it's worth the price of admission to <UNK> live them <UNK> minutes at a time
<START> it's like a bad 80s tv show got loose and tried to become a soft core porn movie oh my god was it bad the plots of each character had little relevance the plot itself wasn't anything to speak of something about a stalker i guess in the end he shoots himself it's not really clear but somehow there's a <UNK> game involved and the main character randy sleeps around a lot the only reason my friends rented this movie was because casper van <UNK> was in it and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it which were barely watchable at that thank god i didn't spend any money on it but i want that hour of my life back
<START> the perfect space fantasy film a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down but do they sure they do this would not be a family film if they all died then it will all be sad you don't want that kate <UNK> the leading lady gives a golden globe performance but sadly she nor <UNK> thompson won one that sucks so bad i can't say it enough this film is so great <UNK> thompson o lord a perfect girl for this film this film is the best for sure br br sorry but better than star wars star wars is so over rated and space camp was so under rated it should of been the other way around br br excellent 10 10 <UNK> maybe 11 10 <UNK> not good at <UNK>
<START> think of this film as a saturday morning live action program from ages ago even the small <UNK> will find this one hard to please because it runs like <UNK> i can't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting especially in the costume department too many warrior wizard movies out there have used the same old <UNK> numerous times over but this is mighty <UNK> considering its appeal to the little <UNK> and who in the world would've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place i thought this was a family movie mst3k here's another fine gem for your 1999 tv season
<START> this was the <UNK> and final columbia <UNK> film and the only one without richard <UNK> who had retired from movies and was to die the following year it's still a competent thriller the machine carried on without him perfectly but  something was missing <UNK> the stories in the <UNK> series were always interesting sometimes brilliant the screenplays often noir always atmospheric but it wasn't only the <UNK> himself that hung it all together on screen <UNK> did too br br young couple stepping out for a whole <UNK> get the urge to marry in the <UNK> rain but are <UNK> when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad is the potential <UNK> put off even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and <UNK> or is love blind who's <UNK> who is the question michael <UNK> in his <UNK> film is ok if a bit of a <UNK> lovely <UNK> <UNK> finest moments came next film in <UNK> <UNK> meet frankenstein and richard lane was wonderful as ever on <UNK> from boston <UNK> also the only outing where the <UNK> himself must have got wet from <UNK> about in the rain unless he got <UNK> with sea <UNK> in voice br br a lot happened in this last hour well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me the <UNK> radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 <UNK> up nearly 700 half hour shows nearly all of which are available on <UNK> and based upon what i've heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well
<START> i borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but the thought of role playing really intrigued me i was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in san francisco since i live near sf and of course it was nice to see shots of the castro district although the castro to me really <UNK> more to gay male than female but other than that i can't really recommend this movie the characters aren't really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the role playing i was already bored out of my mind and the role playing scenes that i did see were a bit embarrassing to watch the acting leaves something to be desired needless to say i didn't finish the movie i'd skip this one
<START> production line collection of fart jokes that pretends <UNK> was never made the writers clearly hoped that the gimmick of seeing animals talk would be enough to keep the movie going it's not eddie murphy sells out yet again as a doctor who <UNK> his forgotten childhood gift for understanding the <UNK> and witless <UNK> of guinea pigs <UNK> rats dogs and <UNK> the voice cast is impressive albert brooks julie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ellen <UNK> paul <UNK> brian doyle murray but the script is so unimaginative <UNK> and <UNK> unfunny that the whole thing <UNK> down the bin <UNK> pretty quickly
<START> <UNK> a splendid and riveting performance by farrah fawcett <UNK> avoids being <UNK> in her car by vicious serial rapist joe superbly played with frightening conviction and intensity by james russo however joe steals her <UNK> and finds out where <UNK> lives he pays her a visit one <UNK> day after <UNK> <UNK> to plenty of <UNK> and psychological abuse <UNK> manages to turn the tables on joe and locks him in the <UNK> what is <UNK> going to do with joe director robert m young and screenwriter william <UNK> <UNK> a harsh gritty and often disturbing morality tale that <UNK> nails the stark brutality and painful <UNK> of rape while also showing how any person when pushed to extremes is capable of shocking acts of violence and <UNK> joe <UNK> women strictly as objects while <UNK> only sees joe as an animal however this movie to its admirable credit refuses to make joe out to be simply a vile one dimensional creep instead he's a <UNK> real and ultimately <UNK> human monster with a wife and kid <UNK> climactic confession in particular is genuinely poignant fawcett and russo are both outstanding in the leads they receive fine support from diana <UNK> as the passive terry <UNK> <UNK> as the sensible patricia and sandy martin as sympathetic <UNK> officer <UNK> both curtis <UNK> <UNK> cinematography and j a c <UNK> <UNK> skin <UNK> score greatly enhance the considerable claustrophobic tension a real <UNK>
<START> what the hell was all that about i saw the matrix and was amazed it was the most spectacular movie ever made what ever <UNK> the <UNK> brothers to do this film is beyond me br br there is no plot you can't argue with that basically all this film was was a load of talking and don't get me wrong i have no problem with talky films but all the talking in the matrix <UNK> was a pointless load of <UNK> then there would be a fight sequence which lasted way too long then more pointless <UNK> then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anti climax ever a little <UNK> bloke talking a load of <UNK> bull for 20 minutes br br also keanu reeves gives his worst performance yet i knew he wasn't a good actor but this was beyond a joke if you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along god knows what his performance is like in <UNK> gotta give keanu reeves the only <UNK> of wood ever to become an actor br br after the <UNK> of the first film this came as a massive <UNK> if you haven't already seen the first film i suggest you watch it but don't waste your time with this utter pile of turd br br
<START> i wasn't sure at first if i was watching a documentary propaganda film or dramatic presentation i guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three br br admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on we were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training <UNK> and equipment br br where this movie came together for me was closer to the end the scenes had a realism at least as i perceived it that i haven't encountered often before you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young <UNK> this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat <UNK> br br the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in 1943 as the war <UNK> with japan also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years
<START> <UNK> <UNK> in the same way an expensive high quality french wine does it leaves you with a very fine <UNK> br br <UNK> theme isn't new the film doesn't carry an original plot either its colored <UNK> shows fine but not extraordinary its setting is serious its elegant <UNK> never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind br br whatever one further may say about <UNK> it's beyond doubt that this very french film stands out for its excellent acting the three leads convincingly reflect all numerous doubts and <UNK> <UNK> between them making the plot alive their acting fully invites you to participate to make friends br br for those around at the time <UNK> also provides an extra bonus its perfectly captured mood of 1980
<START> i have yet to read shirley jackson's novel something of which i've been meaning to do for quite sometime i am sure it has got to be scarier than this film i remember jumping once when i watched it the other day although i cannot recall the scene br br the special effects are great and i watched this on dvd but i am sure in the theatre it must have been an awesome sight after the first few special effects are done with i was waiting for a story to develop br br i figured this movie at the least has to be loosely based on the classic novel so a good story should be there but it wasn't i was <UNK> to staring at the gorgeous catherine zeta jones character throughout the movie basically because there was nothing much else to watch <UNK> <UNK> was such a suck character i did not like her one bit something about whiny people also the guy in this film reminded me of the cartoonish dudley <UNK> with his voice and face i could not relate to the characters at all <UNK> <UNK> liam neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting br br half to three quarters of the way i was just dying to go see a campy friday the 13th or a scream <UNK> film at least there is some type of entertainment value if there is no story there at least they fill it up with gory deaths or attractive females this had nothing br br
<START> gritty dusty western from director richard brooks who seems thoroughly <UNK> in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact early <UNK> horse race <UNK> a low <UNK> cowboy gene hackman a suave <UNK> james coburn a cocky kid jan michael vincent and even a female a surprisingly game <UNK> <UNK> once the <UNK> are out of the way with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part this becomes a fairly engrossing entry though one which breaks no new ground it instead resembles something from gary <UNK> era good looking if overlong piece has macho <UNK> and a fine cast yet the <UNK> of the plot get tiresome rather quickly from
<START> i went to the cinema with two of my friends and picked this movie out of hat totally not knowing what to expect and it turn out into a very enjoyable die laughing experience it's an excellent movie with very unexpected story very good dialogs and crazy humor all characters are obviously made in alan ford italian <UNK> comic style but that haven't bothered me for a second in fact this kind of loser <UNK> line up made a movie quite unique and interesting sam <UNK> gave very good and convincing role <UNK> macy too clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant but real star is actually <UNK> he made a role of his life in this movie the scene when his character <UNK> dies in the movie is so hilarious that it made me choke and almost die with him highly recommended for all alan ford fans
<START> 60 minutes in the beautiful christina <UNK> tries to escape the isolated <UNK> school she's brought to at the beginning of the movie is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate a monster black <UNK> killer or supernatural evil no she's running from a bunch of bullies for the other 40 minutes that follow various figures walk around the school in the dark holding <UNK> and looking <UNK> or <UNK> which doesn't say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you're going to have characters walking around corridors and <UNK> you better be <UNK> <UNK> or you better know how to light that <UNK> in bright apple <UNK> and <UNK> like mario <UNK> we know a killer stalks the <UNK> of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo we get no sense of sinister mysteries <UNK> secrets <UNK> behind a <UNK> of order and <UNK> and <UNK> which is the kind of movie la <UNK> wants to be but doesn't quite know how to do it we know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says something is seriously f <UNK> wrong here man when <UNK> tries to comment on the sexual <UNK> of the female students he does so with quick cutting <UNK> and detail closeups of eyes and <UNK> lips while high pitched this is shocking music <UNK> in the background none of the <UNK> beauty and longing of <UNK> at hanging rock to be found here it's all a bit clumsy and <UNK> with no real sense of urgency or direction a number of people are presented as suspects but there's little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes <UNK> by the characters inside the movie i like the first kill the image of a knife hitting target <UNK> over the <UNK> face of the victim as a <UNK> <UNK> in the background but the rest is too <UNK> for my taste i have to say <UNK> did much better with the killing children and paranoia du <UNK> of who can kill a child
<START> don't even ask me why i watched this the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with <UNK> and too weak to change the channel it's too terrible for words the movie that is not the <UNK> the acting is <UNK> richard <UNK> <UNK> it up as a trigger happy gun <UNK> serial killer with a <UNK> for knocking off cops nick <UNK> phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film the script is dismal <UNK> with clichéd lines are you ready <UNK> <UNK> richard <UNK> to every single one of his victims dire avoid
<START> i bought this film on dvd so i could get an episode of mystery science theater 3000 thankfully mike crow and tom <UNK> are watchable because the film itself is not although there is a plot a story one can follow and a few actors that can act there isn't anything else the movie was so boring i have firmly confirmed that i will never watch it again without tom crow and mike as <UNK> above however it was better than the film featured in the mst3k episode that <UNK> it mitchell
<START> the wooden horse was one of the first great escape stories from world war ii telling the true story of eric williams and others in their escape from <UNK> <UNK> iii in october of 1943 i really like this film but had to by it on vhs from amazon in england and get it transferred from pal format in the u s i read the book when i was in <UNK> school after having seen a portion of the film in the early 60's on t v the <UNK> drama of peter and john trying to escape from germany during the war is more realistic than the <UNK> of the escapes portrayed in the great escape this film is a lost treasure that should be made more available to american audiences
<START> this move is about as bad as they come i was however forced to give it a 2 for the scenery there are many great shots of the <UNK> including many in <UNK> valley one of the most breathtaking places in the us it is also starting with john ford one of the most filmed in fact one scene with kris and the girl was filmed on a place called john ford point
<START> first of all the big named actors must need the money the <UNK> scenes were laughable and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurd <UNK> do not leave the room during a heart transplant nor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of <UNK> heart lung equipment and <UNK> techniques just a joke couldn't concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes no blood no <UNK> and then the hero doc coming in and taking over it is not a film for thinking adults also the budget must have been limited the street scenes were ok but who was the technical <UNK> seems like it was directed by a total idiot save your money and wait until it comes out on dvd and don't rent it
<START> first i should mention that i really enjoyed <UNK> <UNK> previous film <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> shark skin man and <UNK> hip girl although it <UNK> a debt to <UNK> pulp fiction <UNK> cast was up to the task of carrying the story and the entire film <UNK> with energy the scenes between <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were particularly engaging there was action intrigue bizarre characterizations enough sex to keep things interesting and an utterly unpredictable story line br br so it was with a certain amount of anticipation and optimism that i began to watch party 7 and my enthusiasm was certainly <UNK> with the opening credits which left my wife and i actually stunned by how dynamic and exciting they were the mix of anime and live action work was brilliant then the actual movie started actually it didn't so much start as sort of <UNK> in the side door and stand there <UNK> through its <UNK> looking uncomfortable br br the entire film takes place in three rooms one is a futuristic <UNK> paradise borrowed a bit from shark skin man another is a travel <UNK> office and the third and far the most used is a seedy hotel room in that room a cast of seven characters meets and does approximately nothing really i'm no stranger to talking films one of my all time favorites is my dinner with andre the <UNK> of all talking films my dinner with andre is far more exciting and it just has two middle aged men discussing their lives over dinner the key is that andre gregory and wallace shawn tell interesting stories the cast of party 7 literally just <UNK> at each other for the entire film no you don't yes i do no you really don't yes i really do no you really really don't yes i really you get the idea i hope i wish the <UNK> had br br party 7 is an unbelievably <UNK> film there is only the <UNK> of plots money stolen from the <UNK> just like in shark skin man accompanied by almost no action there is no interesting dialog the characters are largely uninteresting it was as if <UNK> took the throwaway <UNK> moments from <UNK> films and built an entire film around them but <UNK> conversations always have their own internal logic and wit they call it a <UNK> with <UNK> not so with the dialog here which is <UNK> than you can imagine if it weren't for the brief hilarious cameo from <UNK> who is always marvelous and a low key performance from the awesome <UNK> <UNK> i would've given party 7 a single star it really was chore to make it all the way through
<START> roy rogers stars as jesse james and his look alike <UNK> man clint burns george <UNK> hayes is mr <UNK> ex pal sheriff <UNK> <UNK> storm jane <UNK> and sally payne polly morgan are a noteworthy team as two <UNK> on the <UNK> for stories about the <UNK> outlaw hero br br of course mistaken identity <UNK> is a plot development since rogers <UNK> a <UNK> role rogers is charming as usual but there is nothing really <UNK> this his performance above the ordinary any potential to deliver a memorable <UNK> hyde performance is done in by poor material the better pair to watch are ms storm and ms <UNK> as the st louis <UNK> <UNK> they are the film's highlight the songs are fine though badly <UNK> br br jesse james at bay 1941 joseph kane roy rogers george <UNK> hayes <UNK> storm
<START> <UNK> is obviously just a self indulgent programme for stanley <UNK> to be a producer moody deep doctor unlike house he has absolutely no personality and unlike <UNK> <UNK> the brain surgery cases <UNK> even interesting this programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for <UNK> cases yet there's nothing interesting or exciting going on not even the so called pathetic <UNK> between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those hallucinations in the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the <UNK> social life as a father <UNK> boring and pointless br br this show is pants there's a <UNK> of medical dramas around at the moment and this does nothing to make it stand out as special
<START> there are enough sad stories about women and their <UNK> by religious political and societal means not to <UNK> the films and stories about <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> rights as well as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in society all in the name of <UNK> or god or some other ridiculous justification but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subject br br the setting is the 2006 match between iran and <UNK> to qualify for the world cup passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match br br the women who were caught played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> for <UNK> provided a funny and <UNK> glimpse into the customs of this country and most likely all muslim countries their interaction with the iranian soldiers who were <UNK> and <UNK> them both city and villagers and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such <UNK> rules br br it is mainly about a <UNK> society that feels it has to save it's women from the crude behavior of it's men rather than <UNK> the male population they deny <UNK> and rights to the women br br seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of iranian society it is <UNK> surprise this film will not get any play in iran but <UNK> <UNK> has a winner on his hands for those able to see it
<START> i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available i had high expectations and was not disappointed it's funny and the animation is excellent that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films so i'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it maybe the dvd release had improved animation one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot i'm an adult and i really appreciate that it is for adults it isn't only kids who like cute animated characters it is nowhere near raunchy as some have claimed but i can see where some parents wouldn't want their young children to see it i'm very disappointed that it was cancelled i wish they would produce more episodes or perhaps a movie
<START> 9 10 30 minutes of pure holiday terror okay so it's not that scary but it sure is fun br br the crypt keeper john <UNK> tales a tale of holiday fear giving us all christmas <UNK> <UNK> that is <UNK> you should really be careful what you axe santa for have a scary christmas and a happy new fear okay i'll stop br br okay so in the story a greedy wife best <UNK> in the world mary ellen <UNK> kills her husband marshall bell the coach who gets <UNK> whipped to death in <UNK> 2 for the money but her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a santa suit larry dr <UNK> drake comes her way br br if you look it up on youtube you can watch it for free but most of you have already seen this my third viewing but if you haven't seen it i suggest you do
<START> during the cheap filmed in video beginning of crazy fat <UNK> ii i wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover unfortunately it was the story itself is <UNK> simple <UNK> a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder is released into a halfway house because of hospital <UNK> she is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into <UNK> soup <UNK> is then <UNK> by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> him with a wire <UNK> on the stairs and then well you get the idea if this all sounds like fun it isn't this film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting the characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a <UNK> store to make matters worse half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first <UNK> movie criminally insane which is little better a very poor effort
<START> this is a way cool fantasy movie one of my <UNK> it really is so cool the director is bernard rose who went on to direct <UNK> he made a great start with this film br br the film about a girl called anna who falls ill with <UNK> fever on her <UNK> birthday she draws a house on a shred of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house is real each subsequent dream that she has is altered by the presence of whatever she adds to the picture in her third dream she meets a boy she thinks she has created called mark she befriends him and their relationship becomes stronger as the dreams become darker and scarier br br charlotte burke who plays anna is a terrific actress and it is very strange that after just one film she should disappear and never be in anything ever again she really does give a great performance in this film br br hans <UNK> score is also ace much like broken arrow the music is ghostly and mysterious it's a real shame that the soundtrack is not available on cd anymore the dvd is available in <UNK> only
<START> because if i was i may have wished it was me being <UNK> on a wooden cross i'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie and i'm being generous that there was even a plot to begin with as previously mentioned it's a <UNK> on the cover of the dvd that richard dreyfuss is actually the star he was barely in the movie and if he was indeed frustrated as the back cover <UNK> he was well that's probably because he said yes to be in this disaster of a movie and couldn't get out of it the movie really seemed to focus on jared martin and what his role in the movie was supposed to be other than the extreme close ups was not as big of a mystery as to what gene <UNK> role actually was or wasn't and speaking of big <UNK> had the bright idea to fit gene barry in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> his <UNK> literally pulled up to his <UNK> should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober i could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was from the dialogue not matching the actors' mouths think <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> jumping from scene to scene again being generous even calling the frames of pictures scenes to the lack of a plot however if you're into bad early 70s genre and if you're in a <UNK> in <UNK> with nothing but this movie and a box of kid cat pictures i recommend having a good bottle of wine before you <UNK> on this weird ride of a movie because you'll be thankful that you may not remember it the next day
<START> i usually read reviews before i watch a movie guess what i didn't do that before watching <UNK> and i have to say i was very surprised to see the above average rating at imdb i found it to have a total lack of story you just get dropped into it and sadly not in the way saving private ryan dropped us into the movie and it also has a sudden end which was very unsatisfying for me br br i have to admit the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me especially with the low budget in mind but prepare yourself to have a laugh some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are olympic <UNK> a mid air <UNK> or <UNK> during <UNK> i is a bit too much for me especially when it's performed countless times during the movie br br but the parts that really got me laughing until i almost cried were the scenes containing close combat the screaming and shouting german voices unbelievably funny it seems as if they are spoken by one single actor voice performer because they all sound exactly the same and it just sounds like a <UNK> german voice br br i would absolutely not recommend this movie to anyone except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it
<START> i was so glad i came across this short film i'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across so when i saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards i was so pleased that i actually had a film that i was rooting for br br the plot is pretty simple the director writer and star <UNK> <UNK> tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy br br it's a well made short film well edited and the actors all do a great job and the last shot of the film is perfect br br i highly recommend this film
<START> for the lt to have chosen this one first the film wasn't horrible it was just hollywood worst case i need this to happen or we have no movie scenario if <UNK> mission was to save the doctor but she was <UNK> that her people make it out of the <UNK> he would have put her on that first <UNK> and <UNK> those <UNK> to the border without her he would not have <UNK> his package for the <UNK> that's not how it works but as i pointed out this is hollywood we must have drama this is why we make movies because reality isn't quite so complicated however i did think that willis and the good doctor had <UNK> chemistry that said there are also some well done battle scenes in the film it's not a waste of time tears of the sun is worth the dvd rental <UNK> check it out on a rainy day and you'll be satisfied
<START> this is really really bad lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job but what makes it worth watching is the scene where <UNK> <UNK> grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the <UNK> plays a song with the <UNK> i got the evidence on you makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics attributed to david <UNK> and leslie <UNK> but i couldn't find it on <UNK> talk about seeing into the future too funny for words the rest of the movie is forgettable the score and songs are more interesting than the script <UNK> the sequel which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies doesn't say much for the world's viewing <UNK>
<START> before seeing this movie i was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book instead it's the book interrupted with dramatic scenes <UNK> the different <UNK> that didn't bother me much but it <UNK> my enjoyment of the film one story or even two or three long stories with <UNK> from the book interspersed through the movie would have been <UNK> in my opinion if you're going to base a movie on a psychology text you've got to find a more interesting and preferably accurate text than this one the film drags during parts where it's little more than a video <UNK> of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly <UNK> if it weren't sexual in nature because sex interesting for most of us even me luckily there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in br br but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> theories of sexuality went <UNK> for the most part i was hoping it would use stories to show how the <UNK> of his <UNK> view of psychology which is still held by many to this day br br so in the end what do you have a detailed <UNK> of a few <UNK> and <UNK> with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and <UNK> of a few sexual <UNK> before they are <UNK> for most of the film the film moves with the <UNK> speed and mood of a wake and as an obviously low budget film the cinematography and acting are not exactly top <UNK> although i was pleased with the music costume and interior design br br i felt this film's subject was right up my alley and i still feel it's a below average film it deserves a 3 10 a 4 10 if i were feeling extremely generous i can't imagine anyone enjoying this if they didn't already have an interest in sexual <UNK>
<START> there are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and <UNK> set that 70's show is a great example when the show came on the air nobody really heard of <UNK> smith and debra jo <UNK> much less the <UNK> played wonderfully by <UNK> grace and <UNK> <UNK> both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests i wish <UNK> would stay around because the show began about his character eric and his close circle of friends <UNK> is already the john travolta of our time remember when john was in love with diana <UNK> from eight is enough think of <UNK> with <UNK> moore the cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it i miss mo <UNK> who played <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to steven hyde i loved watching <UNK> roberts besides charlie's angels i loved brooke <UNK> playing <UNK> mom she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway this show has been a delight with many surprises i hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but i hope they don't stay too far away too long i wish the show's creators bonnie and terry turner who also created my other favorite show third rock from the sun is more successful on fox than they were on nbc which <UNK> their show the <UNK> are not <UNK> and i hope they create more shows like this in the future
<START> my husband and i are the parents of an <UNK> little boy who lives in the same <UNK> as the screenwriter of this movie we were very upset that the <UNK> is bringing this movie to its jewish film festival because of the way that the mentally disabled character frankie is portrayed we went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out we <UNK> out money back we would encourage the screenwriter to <UNK> a portion of the <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> program to apologize br br we did not like seeing frankie a mentally disabled and perhaps even <UNK> teenager as part of a joke in which he keeps dropping something to look at the <UNK> breasts br br there was no point to <UNK> character other than to say hey being mentally disabled is funny challenges like <UNK> are a serious matter families like mine are truly suffering br br the screenwriter needs to explain herself does she know families with disabled kids does she see the families with disabled kids week after week at the <UNK> pool
<START> a woman <UNK> a boy to this world and was alone they both were alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one package he was capable of <UNK> sword from his arm there was always a wound on his <UNK> in the cause of this gift the wound of the <UNK> weapon inside of his body first he kills his constantly drunk <UNK> who hurts his mom every time then he grows up and decides to find his real father just as simple as all the time for a superhero he reaches the justice but the society decides this justice is not necessary and dangerous which is indeed right 'cause it is not like in hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone <UNK> he is the main hero acted by <UNK> <UNK> kills if the person who in his opinion deserves to die but gets blames from authorities and runs in such a runaway from authorities and mafia he meets a girl acted by <UNK> <UNK> and falls in love with her everything else is to be watched not told be aware that this film is more about feelings and emotions but not about actions this film is full of pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life
<START> this is an excellent film for female body <UNK> female action fans i think that sue price did a great job in this film series nemesis 2 3 4 and proved to be a great fighter she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful <UNK> nemesis 2 though not a film of great value and sue <UNK> acting skills not the best to have met in my life the movie itself was something awesome a priceless gem for fans of female body <UNK> action well some parts of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci fi films such as terminator or predator but that's not the point the point is that a <UNK> casted in that film a very talented body <UNK> who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3 a rather boring sequel and nemesis 4 a much more interesting sequel than 3 what a pity it hasn't shown yet on dvd
<START> i came to nancy drew expecting the worst because of everyone else's bad reviews i thought even though i don't read the books that doesn't look anything like the nancy drew i've heard of but i was wrong sure it wasn't a <UNK> copy of the books but when you make a movie out of something you have to <UNK> it to become big screen entertainment the plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and i thought that emma roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character there were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements at no point in this film does nancy come off as a <UNK> she was intelligent conservative polite and genuine one thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy romance suspense and heartfelt moments i loved this movie what a flick what a flick and if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this be prepared for some scary as heck moments because i was like freaking out go see it or be a bum bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you a mistake i almost made i love it i wanna own this movie i love emma roberts now too she's like a mini <UNK> van de <UNK> from <UNK> love it love it
<START> i as a teenager really enjoyed this movie mary kate and ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease i thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to be sure and rent it also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players
<START> quite honestly the <UNK> code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time during the first 30 minutes i sat stunned in my seat trying to decide if i should demand a <UNK> but since i hadn't paid to see it in the first place passes i figured i might as well stay and i didn't think it could possibly get any worse br br it did i will quickly run through the low points includes some spoilers the horrible <UNK> of casper van <UNK> as <UNK> lane a <UNK> <UNK> with two <UNK> the characterization was inconsistent for example lane despite his <UNK> is a complete <UNK> then there's the lame o depiction of the <UNK> of the biblical <UNK> we see a bunch of sensational news <UNK> accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code also terrible action sequences lane escapes from tough situations without explanation and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger it turns out to be a dream sequence that's cute for <UNK> school writing <UNK> but it's an <UNK> plot device in a motion picture the pacing was bad after a long opener the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds later the pacing <UNK> but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around and as someone else mentioned years pass yet no one not even <UNK> young daughter ages that was <UNK> br br there are a few good things though the quality of the film e g lack of <UNK> is high and very attractive the <UNK> shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism also there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god finally to help him this proved to be quite <UNK> even to me someone who does not accept jesus as a personal <UNK> but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie unfortunately it was followed by major <UNK> br br the characters dialogue direction and acting were all poorly done michael <UNK> had nothing to do and michael york was just weird i think the producers wanted to do too much if the plot had been <UNK> and more focused and the characterization more fleshed out the film would have been far better br br in a nutshell the <UNK> code disappoints definitely do not pay to see this i give it out of ten stars br br
<START> i remember when this came out a lot of kids were nuts about it i guess i was a bit too old to get all excited and i was a fan of real martial arts films and always found this a bit cheesy br br in the early 90's we were <UNK> with programs such as this making kids feel like they could fight and be a power ranger or an equal to these kids on 3 ninjas i think eventually parents and film makers alike got sick of it because all we had in reality was <UNK> of kids going around <UNK> and hitting everyone br br many kids movies have some big point they're trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message this one doesn't have any message at all it just exploits a million difference things in less than 90 minutes br br the movie has no great visual qualities but would one expect it to the acting is pretty bad victor wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here the short fat <UNK> eyed old fart as a powerful ninja that was just hilarious the kids over acted way too much and the youngest ninja <UNK> <UNK> was maybe the worst kid actor i have ever seen br br the movie has a plot that anyone knows before they even read the review 3 ninjas <UNK> you know they're gonna fight a bunch of bad guys and win obviously need i say more sorry if i spoiled it for anyone br br with all that said kids will love it this movie is aimed at kids and only children could enjoy it if you don't mind your kid seeing movies about kids fighting this is a good movie to let them see if you don't mind allowing your children to see complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts real acting or reality period then you have found a movie for your kids i say kids because i think even the girls will like it i recall all the girls having a crush on rocky br br 2 out of 10 stars because i think you can make a movie for kids and still make it enjoyable for adults this movie failed big time at that it is beyond cheesy and nothing original or unique and i would not allow a child of mine to watch it kung fu the tv series is on dvd and there's tons of great shaw brothers films out there why not show your children things that will really entertain them and not make them dumb along the way perhaps even teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs as grandpa did on 3 ninjas no no no never kick a man between the legs never thats so <UNK> like
<START> i thought i read somewhere that this was the last <UNK> production but whether that's true or not it doesn't matter because if it wasn't then it should have been it's a deadly dull affair starring john carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself appear like an older scientist who is <UNK> with the aid of his young apprentice robert <UNK> in bringing the dead back to life every time their subjects are <UNK> they seem to have a <UNK> face like <UNK> as they are lying <UNK> to the laboratory table big deal carradine manages to <UNK> his faithful dog to life after it's dead and the <UNK> <UNK> an unusual ability to walk through walls in a <UNK> fashion <UNK> that's about all she wrote br br for an ultra cheap <UNK> <UNK> this thing at least actually <UNK> a more fancy <UNK> lab setup than is usually <UNK> the funniest running joke in the movie is that the older doctor carradine constantly refers to his young assistant <UNK> as <UNK> when in fact carradine was actually 40 and <UNK> was 45 when they made this
<START> i saw this film in its <UNK> week in 1975 i was 13 years old and at that time i found it adequate and somewhat fun i then came to discover the world of doc savage through the <UNK> novels of the old pulp magazine stories i had no idea before any of this of the realm of doc but i fast became one of the most avid doc savage fans you could ever meet i read and still own all of the <UNK> books i started going to comic book cons along with star trek and doctor who and all manner of geeky fat kid events and had a wonderful time with each adventure i took with doc and the original <UNK> 5 philip jose <UNK> book the apocalyptic life of doc savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day i have very fond feelings regarding my doc phase in so saying i have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat it is a film that did not know what it wanted to be when it grew up the screenplay was <UNK> and bore little resemblance to the pulp story these stories from the 30's were short and if one looked at lester <UNK> aka kenneth <UNK> outline for writing them they broke down into perfect 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment one would have thought that with george pal and michael anderson at the <UNK> it would have turned out better the spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there but then fall short it is interesting to watch though in that they hired second string character actors guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film who all <UNK> themselves very well paul <UNK> of course has gone on to be a fine <UNK> player in all <UNK> of entertainment and bill <UNK> is a television <UNK> all the rest have fallen off the map sadly i do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero but i fear i will not watch it much as it is too painful i would say 0 but i give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction <UNK> answering machine at the end was a nice touch and the cast of 3rd <UNK> getting a moment in the sun
<START> it is a <UNK> thing to play a queen on the one hand the actress has to be <UNK> and <UNK> and on the other she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line br br emily blunt is quite <UNK> as victoria but it's not as full a performance as i'd like no blame to her i can't help but feel like this is a mills <UNK> novel adaptation compared to a darker more dramatic movie about another young queen elizabeth hence blunt doesn't get to run the gamut of <UNK> emotions at least not to the full extent since she's <UNK> the young victoria to see the old victoria check out mrs brown br br jean marc <UNK> is an interesting choice of director for the movie he last did c r a z y which was excellent and <UNK> him to fame it was quite a different movie but i remember it looking gorgeous and that's probably the main similarity between the two movies but while <UNK> wrote c r a z y this one was by julian <UNK> and though i really enjoyed his <UNK> park the story for this movie was much less interesting i soon got lost with all the <UNK> politics maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential <UNK> of the <UNK> i'm just saying
<START> i first saw this version of a christmas carol when it first appeared on television i actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations i have now purchased the dvd and plan to watch it every year with the exception of it's a wonderful life i consider this version of a christmas carol one of the best christmas movies ever made george c scott is excellent and a superb cast led by roger <UNK> <UNK> him scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself how can someone be remembered as both <UNK> and scrooge scott does so easily the direction is marvelous with the fine sets costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time place and era depicted you will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season
<START> i didn't agree with any of the <UNK> in the left behind series but nonetheless i found the books gripping and i read 8 of 12 of them undeniably good writing and interesting story however i didn't have very high expectations for the movie there was no way mainstream hollywood would have taken up a christian series and produced a big budget movie so it was done <UNK> and it just felt like i was watching a really long tv show it just didn't feel like a movie it didn't have that movie experience to it if anybody knows what i'm talking about so the movie suffered because of that and the low budget poor special effects were another <UNK> for me br br on top of that i feel that gordon <UNK> was woefully miscast as <UNK> <UNK> reading the book my impression of <UNK> was that he was supposed to be this charming dazzling amazingly handsome guy who spoke english with almost zero trace of an accent so i imagined somebody like pierce brosnan in the role instead they found some clay <UNK> <UNK> neck who looks like an employee of the month from best buy and gave him a really bad fake accent so that lost a few stars for me right there a movie is just not convincing when the major villain doesn't look or sound the way he's supposed to br br the acting was okay but nothing to write home about some of the scenes like one of the <UNK> scenes can't remember which one were real seat <UNK> for me and some of the christian rock music or whatever it was was really out of place for some of the scenes like in the one with kirk cameron praying in the bathroom br br in short it wasn't a bad movie but it just didn't do it for me stick to the book folks it's much better
<START> casting bone to pick david <UNK> was <UNK> playing the father of robert <UNK> who was then <UNK> yeah i realize he's supposed to be just out of college but clues in the script have him being a <UNK> and so he's probably 24 25 in the script that still puts <UNK> in <UNK> classes in junior high i assume the <UNK> wrote medical miracle up in their 1938 year in medicine this movie hasn't aged very well at all and now it's main appeal is just to see a snap shot of sin city circa 1969 and all the <UNK> smoking the weird hair <UNK> has an atomic <UNK> over that makes him resemble a well <UNK> hip cousin it and trendy fashions that went along with it if anyone remembers <UNK> wasn't exactly london the city <UNK> the mob and <UNK> <UNK> in those days <UNK> comes off as sexually ambiguous his dad thinks he might be gay in a sad irony <UNK> himself died of aids at <UNK> and the <UNK> conflict is from the generation gap issue <UNK> as if one may call 7 years a gap sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino <UNK> palace and <UNK> him with girls including the horny for money <UNK> williams interestingly enough the son doesn't seem to mind being thought of as gay unusual for the time and a cute brenda <UNK> is nearby to <UNK> <UNK> over him what nudity there is is awfully lame just what was needed to pull the audience in for an <UNK> rating in the early days of the mpaa rating system which then was g m r 16 and x the editing is horrible and there's stupid silly <UNK> by the <UNK> a late 60's neo <UNK> garde comedy <UNK> that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years don <UNK> is on board as a <UNK> dealer seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better casino two decades later not to give anything away but they would've dealt with mr <UNK> character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then a curiosity at best far from joshua <UNK> usual caliber of work <UNK> <UNK> now go watch casino again
<START> good engaging cinematic <UNK> great presentation vehicles are actually fun to drive fairly appealing <UNK> faithful to the movie and the list goes on br br bad main missions are a bit short br br this game <UNK> what a good third person <UNK> not necessarily a spy game is great <UNK> carry on the story and make you want to complete every single mission through and <UNK> all the genuine <UNK> the game has to offer the hype this game had was lived up to and i personally think you should buy it and hook up with a couple of friends and play this one loads of fun br br the sound in this game is a rip roaring achievement from a few previous bond games and firing a weapon really feels like you're firing a weapon it ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy br br all in all this game makes you excited and satisfied after you make it through and some <UNK> that can compete with the standards of the <UNK> james bond <UNK> game for <UNK>
<START> excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the taken for granted ordinary <UNK> <UNK> during <UNK> <UNK> the film is much more than a commentary on <UNK> in fact it <UNK> the workers in china the owner of the factory the <UNK> <UNK> in new orleans and even the <UNK> in new orleans what stands out the most is the director's ability to tell a <UNK> story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way his amazing access to the factory is another aspect that's intriguing and i only wish i knew how he got inside it's a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it and the conclusion provides hope without leaving people feeling <UNK>
<START> along with king of the rocket men this was still being repeated on bbc tv in the early to mid eighties if i was <UNK> up a time capsule of this period both these series would definitely go in br br someone watching it for the first time will think it is silly but this is one of the best examples of the serials don del <UNK> will make you laugh when i was little my <UNK> for him was mr <UNK> head and it was funny upon being shot at he says your bullets can't harm me then he stumbles back seemingly less than happy i also like the way he <UNK> with sebastian in the first episode br br i watched this again because i had good memories of it from years back there are some good stunts and good music it has the ingredients you expect including water <UNK> runaway <UNK> apart from the first episode with ralph <UNK> the <UNK> wasn't nearly as good as i remembered it and yes it features the inevitable flashback episode it gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace padding and the other tricks if you are interested in these serials i recommend the book by william <UNK> in a door into a fight out a door into a chase although there is only a small entry about this series in it
<START> spoilers <UNK> with hatred and revenge half breed <UNK> <UNK> james coburn had spent the last 11 years on a chain gang <UNK> his escape what <UNK> <UNK> more then freedom is to even the score with the man who captured him and in the process during a wild shootout killed his <UNK> wife the former <UNK> county sheriff sam <UNK> charlton heston br br making his escape after killing two prison guards <UNK> makes his way towards <UNK> knowing that that's not just where <UNK> lives but where his his young daughter susan barbara <UNK> <UNK> as well using his fellow escaped <UNK> to lure <UNK> into the vast arizona desert by promising them 30 000 00 in gold <UNK> that he buried there <UNK> plans to exact his bloody vengeance on <UNK> but only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow <UNK> or are in not being with a woman for years as horny as a rabbit during <UNK> season br br brutal and very effective western that <UNK> the john wayne 1956 classic the <UNK> in a father searching through dangerous indian territory for his kidnapped daughter charlton heston as the guilt ridden sam <UNK> in his <UNK> somehow responsible for killing <UNK> wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff charles coburn as the vengeful half breed <UNK> <UNK> is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict br br the man who escaped with <UNK> are really not interest in his personal affairs but have no choice in that he knows the territory like the back of his hand but to go along with him it's only the thought of them having their way with susan when <UNK> gives them the green light as well as the buried 30 000 00 in gold <UNK> that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way br br also going along with <UNK> is <UNK> boyfriend hal <UNK> chris mitchum who proves in the end that he's as good as <UNK> is who felt that he just didn't have it in him in both tracking down the escaped criminals as well as using common sense which in this case <UNK> lacks in doing it br br spoilers the unbelievably brutal and blood <UNK> showdown between <UNK> and <UNK> is almost too much to sit through <UNK> who's hatred of <UNK> <UNK> on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death it was that hatred that <UNK> took advantage of and after taking some half dozen bullets thus ended up putting the crazed and blood <UNK> as well as mindless lunatic away for good
<START> i am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably reviewed more buster keaton films for imdb than any other person every film he made from the beginning of his career to the early 30s with only two exceptions have i reviewed so you can tell i am a major fan it's because of this that i found this episode so painful and hard to watch i loved this man's films and kept thinking buster how could you well now that i think about it i guess i can see why buster keaton starred in this god awful episode of the twilight zone he'd lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a leading man was long passed as well now in the 1960s keaton needed the money and loved his <UNK> in popularity so he <UNK> himself out to anyone willing to pay appearing in beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series br br the biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and buster deserved much better the show is supposed to be funny but isn't and instead of a homage to silent films is just painful to watch particularly with keaton putting that stupid time travel helmet on as well as all the poorly executed slapstick do yourself a favor skip this one it's a pale imitation of the greatness that once was keaton's career
<START> <UNK> the absolutely most pathetic piece of crap in cinematic history is not an easy task candidates being so <UNK> but nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since i saw it it was so funny we had to rent it again the next day and again i laughed so hard i was literally rolling on the floor this usually only happens when i see monty <UNK> scott of the <UNK> br br throughout the whole movie an overwhelming what the heck feeling firmly <UNK> the viewer i'm utterly <UNK> that this clumsy home video ever made it to production stage it's supposed to be a sequel yet has no apparent connection whatsoever with the first film the hero has the same name but this time alex is female although it took us half way into the movie to stop guessing what with all the <UNK> and the barbarian <UNK> outfit br br there is really no plot at all it's merely a prolonged chase scene only it's so slow paced and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound way more interesting than it really is there is almost no dialogue which is just as well considering the quality of it and then the film suddenly just comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene with lots of <UNK> explosions without ever really explaining what it was all about luckily it never gets boring because there's something silly and phony going on at all times br br terrible movies are usually just tedious but nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of over seriousness and utter <UNK> <UNK> that it's truly entertaining rent this film or buy it even you won't be disappointed
<START> i had been long awaiting this movie ever since i saw the trailer which made it look like a political drama starring three of my favorite actors al pacino john cusack and bridget fonda and even though it was directed by harold <UNK> who has done uneven work he and pacino did combine on sea of love which ranks among each of their best work but <UNK> on some level for starters several of the scenes in the original trailer don't appear in the movie and changing of tone subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller make this while watchable nowhere near as it could have been br br which is too bad because i really wanted to like this movie there was great potential here to be a film about how government can still be worthwhile despite all the corruption and to make a complex statement about that corruption not the usual good guys vs bad guys and there is good acting here pacino and cusack are both very good and danny aiello gives one of the best performances of his career but fonda is wasted in her role having nothing to do and while there is merit in the central storyline when it turns to a thriller the movie loses its way briefly <UNK> in the final scene between cusack and pacino and then falls down completely in the end i wish i could like this more but no
<START> the movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon <UNK> but the plot was out of course and didn't have as an interest as the other movies it was a waste of money and time the same corny humor and cliche bad guys the movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make pokemon famous the movie should better not associated with <UNK> such as <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> oh the drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this movie i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on pokemon <UNK> is more of an anime and doesn't fall anywhere close to pokemon it's second movie is coming out late 2002
<START> well the story is a little hard to follow the first time but that's only because of all the bare <UNK> '70s painted up vampire witches dancing to the <UNK> drums this of course interrupted by a few <UNK> <UNK> and there are some very interesting <UNK> and uses for them and for girl on girl action <UNK> or not this movie just rocks
<START> hotel du <UNK> is a gripping drama of guilt in which marcel <UNK> portrayed an entertaining tale of ill <UNK> love which also functions as a revolt against the cruel world the film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers pierre and <UNK> were mistaken when they believed that suicide would put an end to their misery hotel du <UNK> has its own <UNK> charm as its inhabitants have become an essential part of the establishment there is an element of <UNK> as everyone <UNK> to hotel du <UNK> to eat chat etc marcel <UNK> has remained true to the spirit of the films produced in 30s and 40s as hotel du <UNK> has a certain kind of nostalgic feel <UNK> while <UNK> the life of <UNK> roads was able to create a sort of nostalgia for black and white giving a unique genre of poetic realism to his <UNK> hotel du <UNK> can be <UNK> as a <UNK> of cinematographic <UNK> the <UNK> july ball scene on the banks of saint martin <UNK> remains a magnificent sequence the film's immense popularity can be judged from the fact that hotel du <UNK> has been <UNK> as a national <UNK>
<START> this effort is based on the true story of jim morris a high school science teacher baseball coach who is inspired by his players to try out for the pros and fulfill his life long dream of playing in the <UNK> dennis quaid no stranger to sports films plays morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of <UNK> the real world events that led to morris brief <UNK> as a relief <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> bay devil <UNK> the first half of the film dealing with his <UNK> tag bunch of high school baseball players all of whom look way too old to <UNK> be in high school is less effective and probably a bit too long overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without however it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national <UNK> for a reason grade b
<START> having heard so much about the 1990s cracker series without seeing any of them i looked forward to this eagerly surely the combination of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> could not go wrong how wrong i was br br the <UNK> backed by frequent repetitive and violent flashbacks were <UNK> the production tried to be super modern but the flashing boxes and even the childish <UNK> irritated <UNK> <UNK> sleep walked through the two hours coming up with unexplained and unlikely insights and the police were portrayed as one dimensional bumbling idiots as a result the tension never built up and the next to final scene no details for fear of spoilers was as laughably bad a piece of tv drama as i have seen for a long time br br no i don't want to see any more of these but i will go back to the dvds of the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation
<START> the eight jean <UNK> film i have watched is also possibly the <UNK> the intriguing plot such as it is seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its <UNK> <UNK> minutes but it somehow <UNK> to get <UNK> muddled as it goes along a would be female vampire scantily clad as promised by the title is held in <UNK> inside a remote <UNK> and emerges only to <UNK> on the blood of willing victims who are apparently members of a suicide club as if unsure where all of this would lead him the writer director ultimately has the human villain  actually the blank faced hero's kinky father  <UNK> revealed as a mutant from the future the <UNK> pace and dream like atmosphere the <UNK> wear <UNK> and animal masks to hide their features from the <UNK> girl are of course typical of both the film maker <UNK> the <UNK> setting at the anti climax and the euro cult style as are the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> on display personally the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor bernard <UNK> who appeared in six latter day luis <UNK> films crop up <UNK> through it from time to time
<START> this was eddie <UNK> <UNK> film and his last and he died of cancer nine days after shooting was complete all of which makes his key scene in the movie all the more poignant br br although some of the hair and clothing styles are a bit dated also note the video game shown in the film but the subject of the film is pretty much timeless heston said he had wanted to make the film for some time because he really believed in the dangers of <UNK> br br several things make this film a classic the story is solid br br the acting is top notch especially the interplay between heston and robinson with nice performances also by <UNK> and peters br br the music is absolutely perfect the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> combined with the <UNK> visual elements make for some truly moving scenes this was the <UNK> on the cake for the film br br and the theme or the point of the film is a significant one yes it's a film about <UNK> but on a more important note it's a <UNK> tale about what can go wrong with man's <UNK> of earth it's in the subtext that you find the real message of the film pay attention to what <UNK> says about the old days of the past which is our present and note how thorn is incapable of <UNK> what <UNK> is saying br br this film is one of my top sci fi films of all time
<START> i was really looking forward to watching this being that i love danny <UNK> and i think gillian anderson is a gifted actress the beginning was interesting i liked the relationship between the two stars it then quickly jumps to the main plot which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and <UNK> gets beaten extremely bad while anderson gets raped they then decide to go for some revenge sounds good right well it's not the story gets boring and side <UNK> and certain things get really weird i won't give out any details but things happen that i for one have no desire to see i like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt and i really wanted to like this one it just didn't work out i give it a 3 out of 10 mainly for the acting
<START> this is the greatest film i saw in 2002 whereas i'm used to mainstream movies it is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films from the technical info the chosen directors i feared it would have an anti american basis but it's a kind of 11 times personal tribute br br the weakest point comes from y <UNK> he does not manage to swallow his pride and considers this event as a well <UNK> punishment it is really the weakest part of the movie but this <UNK> of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece the <UNK> comes from the mexican nearly <UNK> art film i am still not sure what a <UNK> <UNK> meant the 9 others are perfect k <UNK> s penn s <UNK> or nearly perfect c <UNK> and made me either smile or cry or even left me stunned i still don't know if s <UNK> fable is really related or not to the september <UNK> catastrophe but it is so pretty that its finale place deeply <UNK> <UNK>
<START> very bad but watchable science fiction film that suffers from <UNK> special effects poor acting and a ridiculous story the film opens with a spaceship returning from exploration on mars with a woman and a man with green <UNK> on his arm she through some hokey plot <UNK> begins to tell what happened on this <UNK> trip as almost all the tapes seemed to be <UNK> wiped off four <UNK> take on this journey a military type played by <UNK> <UNK> a poor man's <UNK> bogart who enjoys saying the word irish and has the acting <UNK> of a <UNK> then there is <UNK> hayden a beautiful <UNK> and only female crew member on flight with three men wearing the most <UNK> suits possible to <UNK> all her <UNK> next les <UNK> a wonderful character actor from cheap sci fi films like this as the <UNK> and last jack <UNK> as sammy the guy from brooklyn with jokes and doesn't seem too bright although chosen for his expertise in <UNK> none of these performers are really any good and all of them say their dialog with little conviction watch <UNK> as he <UNK> that scientific nonsense really the best out of the four is <UNK> and that really says a lot about this film but bad acting aside the movie just falls apart when they land on mars via flashback the angry red planet had a real cheap budget because mars is really the american <UNK> with a heavy red <UNK> over it when the story calls for something that might look martian there are drawings placed with a heavy red <UNK> over them you can tell they are drawings the monsters are perhaps even worse as we get a bat rat spider with a size <UNK> of 40 feet that looks like some kids got together <UNK> dead animals together the other significant creature is a giant <UNK> with an <UNK> eye <UNK> these are bad there is a nice drawing of a martian city but there just was not enough of this in the film despite all these big problems the angry red planet is a fun bad film it is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization most of the stuff they used in the movie is so outdated one guy is using an electric razor with a <UNK> and i thought they can get to mars but they are still using <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> gives an interesting look to much of the film even with the <UNK> constraints but the story by him and sid pink doesn't fly and how bout that ending with the music and the psychedelic colors <UNK> man
<START> following the brilliant <UNK> aka hanzo the razor sword of justice 1972 and its excellent and even <UNK> sequel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aka razor 2 the <UNK> 1973 this <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aka razor 3 who's got the gold is the third and sadly final installment to the awesome saga about the <UNK> samurai <UNK> hanzo 'the <UNK> <UNK> brilliantly played by the great <UNK> <UNK> who fights corruption with his fighting expertise as well as his enormous sexual powers as a big fan of 70s exploitation cinema made in <UNK> sword of justice became an instant favorite of mine and i was therefore more than eager to find the sequels and full of anticipation when i finally stumbled over them recently while this third hanzo film is just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors it is definitely another great piece of cult cinema that no lover of japanese exploitation cinema can afford to miss who's got the gold is a bit <UNK> than the two <UNK> hanzo films but it is just as brilliantly comical and <UNK> humorous and immediately starts out <UNK> odd the film begins when <UNK> two <UNK> see a female ghost when fishing having always wanted to sleep with a ghost hanzo insists that his <UNK> lead him to the site of the <UNK> if that is not a promising beginning for an awesome film experience i don't know what is <UNK> <UNK> one of my personal favorite actors is once again brilliant in the role of hanzo a role that seems to have been written specifically for him <UNK> is hanzo the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who hates corruption and deliberately insults his superiors and whose unique <UNK> techniques include <UNK> female suspects the <UNK> women than immediately fall for him due to his sexual powers and enormous penis which he trains in a rather grotesque routine ritual i will not give away more about the plot in who's got the gold but i can assure that it is as cool as it sounds the supporting performances are also very good and as in the predecessors there are plenty of hilariously eccentric characters this is sadly the last film in the <UNK> sleazy <UNK> series if they had made 20 sequels more i would have happily watched them all the entire hanzo series is brilliant and while this third part is a bit inferior compared to its predecessors it is definitely a must see for all lovers of cult cinema oh how i wish they had made more sequels
<START> john hughes wrote a lot of great comedies in the '80s european vacation is not one of them the follow up to <UNK> first big hit vacation 1983 is about as predictable unfunny and annoying as they come no matter how much you love the dumb but romantic clark and ellen <UNK> chase and <UNK> br br i greatly enjoyed vacation as well as the third film <UNK> christmas vacation but the <UNK> trip to europe is bland and forced perhaps because this was <UNK> first attempt at a sequel that he didn't get it but it's really <UNK> how uninspired and devoid of a story european vacation is there is no through story the <UNK> win a game show for being greedy little pigs and go on a tour of europe through england france germany and italy even the screwball physical humor that is the trademark of the first loses all effect because you see it coming which is part director amy <UNK> fault the fast times at <UNK> high director sets everything up too predictably br br maybe it was hughes taking a cheap shot because he was put up to the sequel european vacation takes great pride in insulting americans recall the greedy little pig game show they win especially tourists represented by the <UNK> <UNK> family it also <UNK> itself on the back <UNK> saying oh us <UNK> we're always getting into something because our dad is an idiot then in nearly comic fashion it ends with a tribute to america and how grateful the <UNK> are to return to such a better country if hughes was going for satire and meant to do it in the form of a bad movie well maybe i should award this 8 10 stars br br it's not just the <UNK> but european vacation boasts the two worst actors to play kids rusty and audrey jason lively and dana hill they're both annoying and obnoxious with the unattractive and loud mouthed audrey <UNK> about the boyfriend she's left behind nearly the entire film hughes even goes as far as to have her comment about missing him right as she <UNK> a giant <UNK> quite <UNK> speaking of breasts are <UNK> in two different scenes for no good reason unless it was to comment on <UNK> love of gratuitous <UNK> in their comedies br br i will give the film one of its two stars thanks to eric <UNK> of the monty python crew whose cameo at a few different points in the film where he <UNK> lines directly from holy grail is about the funniest part if hughes intended for us to find one of the film's only non american actors as the only funny part then another tip of the hat to him for ripping open the <UNK> of hollywood comedy in the '80s still would it have hurt for him to do that while making it entertaining
<START> it's a good thing i didn't watch this while i was pregnant i definitely would have cried my eyes out and or vomit it was kind of gruesome mainly disturbing i personally thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted little way however as a mom i <UNK> when beth stabbed herself in the stomach and when <UNK> <UNK> the child during her 3rd <UNK> with rusty <UNK> no less also as an animal lover i almost cried when she <UNK> the cat to a bloody pulp however as creepy and sinister as the baby was i was rooting for it to live and as twisted as the movie was i am extremely intrigued to see the sequel
<START> surprisingly well done for an independent film an <UNK> nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia wonderfully well written and directed it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an <UNK> br br starring dominic <UNK> as jack we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on the narration is almost <UNK> and from the opening lines it is impossible to turn away fascinating and slightly disturbing it shows how someone <UNK> with a lack of sleep <UNK> on the brink between sanity and madness br br with twists and turns around every corner an <UNK> nightmare is provocative and engaging it comes very highly recommended
<START> does anyone think that this show actually helps some people or does it only anger the people who watch it when i am flipping through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of morbid curiosity i understand that pat <UNK> is not all together what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say pat <UNK> is of little consequence he is an old man who thinks in an old way fear of <UNK> no longer has the same affects as it once did thank god now if someone will please answer my question i will be <UNK> lightning <UNK> for the rest of eternity
<START> so the wife and i just finished it despite several <UNK> from both of us to turn it off for the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie there was just very little excitement the acting was atrocious to the point where we actually <UNK> several times during some of the worse scenes the church lady for example the dead sister was using <UNK> means to contact her living twin although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like the ring rather then get the police involved which i'm sure those <UNK> she found would have <UNK> all over them she instead <UNK> a horrible plan to <UNK> the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister i call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too which the movie then fades to black bad dialog bad acting bad ending
<START> i have seen every episode of this spin off i thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is <UNK> <UNK> thus i have continued to watch i'm afraid the second season lacks the charm the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor <UNK> <UNK> the relationships seem contrived and the acting is so so the writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in <UNK> there are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived unfortunately <UNK> is not so i loved kate <UNK> presence in <UNK> i'm afraid kate <UNK> life in la is simply not interesting
<START> i can watch b b c and feel all the emotions i felt when i first saw it at aged 18 well maybe all but one certainly miss k novak has lost none of her <UNK> <UNK> in nearly half a century she was a thinking <UNK> diana <UNK> all those thinking <UNK> now collecting their <UNK> can briefly regain the heart <UNK> collar <UNK> blood <UNK> <UNK> they felt when she <UNK> directly into their eyes back in the days when they were being told that they had never had it so good now <UNK> up against the cold and <UNK> of being <UNK> by a <UNK> they <UNK> home as fast as their <UNK> knees can carry them from the video shop relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple locked <UNK> safety of their fourth floor tower block flat they can regain just a small <UNK> of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal this movie is miss <UNK> golden moment she <UNK> it <UNK> and gave a performance of awesome <UNK> combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex appeal and despite all this she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and <UNK> innocence she completely <UNK> the <UNK> mr j stewart who seems <UNK> to <UNK> her the movie misses e <UNK> and h <UNK> offer comic relief along with mr e <UNK> whose peculiar talents are strictly <UNK> mr j lemmon plays miss <UNK> brother he is a <UNK> a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream some of the more hardcore beats <UNK> themselves as hippies a few years later certainly they had become figures of fun by 1958 and mr lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one but all else is mere <UNK> miss novak <UNK> in a particularly beautiful spectrum of technicolor is the sole <UNK> <UNK> for bell book and candle it survives its reputation enhanced as the ultimate showcase for one of hollywood's most beautiful women loved by <UNK> ignored by critics miss novak will continue to <UNK> with that enigmatic smile all the time thinking old men have the strength to push the play buttons on their dvds one day probably after we are all gone she will be discovered by a new generation who will <UNK> realise that it is quite possible for a woman to be fully dressed and sexually attractive at the same time
<START> the first episode of this new show was on today and it was horrible not only did shaggy have a <UNK> new voice that made listening to his lines torture but it's so far away from the original concept and animation style that it's barely recognizable as a <UNK> <UNK> show br br even back in the dark days when fred and <UNK> were gone and <UNK> nephew <UNK> was there the team still solved mysteries this new show instead features shaggy and scooby battling a james bond type super villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion there's not even a van called 'the mystery <UNK> and the <UNK> for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did not put my mind at ease how can anyone take scooby doo and make this br br the show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole scooby doo gang all of whom speak with the correct voices except shaggy and even then i'm being far too generous
<START> a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story the luzhin <UNK> <UNK> the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty depth and character br br it gives john <UNK> what is probably his finest role to date thank goodness they didn't give it to ralph <UNK> who would have murdered it similarly emily watson shows the wealth of her experience from her outstanding background on the stage to reach the tortured chess master <UNK> her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love watson does not portray beauty <UNK> sexuality but she brings to her parts a self awareness that is <UNK> br br in a chance meeting between <UNK> watson and luzhin she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the film has come to <UNK> his hopes and aspirations later as their love affair develops she subtly <UNK> dancing to chess luzhin has <UNK> to dance but never with a partner she encourages him to lead her with bold brilliant moves and in doing so <UNK> him to relax <UNK> to later play at his best and also realize himself as her lover br br this is a story of a woman who <UNK> a man to his greatest achievement and in so doing finds her own deepest <UNK> emotionally and intellectually or so we are led to believe certainly within the time frame <UNK> is something of a <UNK> woman rather than someone who <UNK> herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother br br the italian sets are stunning the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie goer yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit and most deservedly so chess is merely the <UNK> backdrop for developing an emotional and <UNK> movie although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess player that the characters existed although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting
<START> mild spoilers br br in the near future arnold stars as ben richards a wrongly convicted man <UNK> into playing 'the running man' a deadly tv game show where people have to keep moving to try and escape brutal deaths at the hands of the <UNK> of course people are expected to die eventually and its up to arnold to prove the system wrong br br i haven't read the stephen king book but this is a great film regardless one of <UNK> best he does what he does best in the action man role delivering death with unforgettable one liners classics are probably the <UNK> was a real pain in the <UNK> after <UNK> a guy with <UNK> wire and <UNK> had to split ' referring to <UNK> he just chain <UNK> someone <UNK> dawson is perfectly irritating as the tv <UNK> and all the <UNK> are suitably camp the action is violent but its an action film that's the point the film is fast paced and at 90 minutes it doesn't <UNK> its welcome br br with <UNK> and <UNK> paul michael <UNK> at the <UNK> and made in the wake of the success of the terminator previously this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for arnold and very far fetched but today anyone who watches a lot of tv could see how the film is getting closer to reality i wouldn't be surprised if i turn on the tv in the <UNK> <UNK> and see a show not to far from this br br on that depressing note i must however recommend 'the running man' to anyone who likes the 80s arnold ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action film 9 5 10
<START> spoilers following i picked up the book evil angels when it first came out knowing nothing of the case just to give the press and the <UNK> people a break here i was quite far into it before i began to question the <UNK> guilt the author obviously intended the reader to understand why the public jumped to the conclusions they did john <UNK> told the story just as it was presented to the <UNK> and picked up by the press of the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> dr james <UNK> <UNK> that the collar was cut with <UNK> that a baby could not be taken whole from her clothes with the buttons still done up bloody hand print etc all quite convincingly after all these were experts in their fields who were <UNK> with no apparent reason to lie and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all it was also highly technical evidence difficult for a <UNK> to understand to this point beyond some <UNK> <UNK> in the trials hardly anyone had ever heard of a <UNK> attacking a human people didn't believe it was possible the public was suspicious of the seventh day <UNK> whose origins made them appear to be a cult and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt were it not for dedicated <UNK> lawyers who worked relentlessly to investigate and counter the trial <UNK> finding <UNK> clothes later would not have been enough to get lindy out of jail the book <UNK> me for that reason and i've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since <UNK> <UNK> of course i was thrilled that a movie was going to be made about the case and don't think it could have been done better i've always liked sam who i could identify with completely and meryl was perfect as always beautiful photography haunting music i think it's not only a very good but a very important movie too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released

<START> i found myself very caught up in this movie at least at the beginning and any credit i give to this movie is <UNK> <UNK> she was fantastic but thats where it ends i seem to be very good at <UNK> out who the killer is and i like it when a movie is able to completely <UNK> me but i felt out and out <UNK> to they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end they gave no hit to it at all thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning someone did not think at all br br i felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that the lead you on they also seemed to not answer anything why did jane maria burn down the <UNK> house br br its a great pity as i felt it started out as a relatively good movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> burnt alive seven people in a mission in <UNK> in the 70's also he <UNK> that he had murdered another 16 people he used to kill pregnant women and then he set them on fire br br this movie is a documentary that <UNK> the personality of <UNK> through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts br br <UNK> <UNK> is a serious work so <UNK> it's not morbid at all such a horrifying <UNK> about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster br br my rate 7 10
<START> at the end of this episode holmes asks watson not to record the case for <UNK> for a good reason the super sleuth left his little grey cells sorry agatha at home for this tale there is no <UNK> reasoning no <UNK> analysis of signs at crime scenes holmes <UNK> along fifty <UNK> behind the plot the <UNK> <UNK> is finally dealt to by an old <UNK> in a manner that would have made charles <UNK> heart <UNK> with pride six bullets in the <UNK> in an ensuing chase a <UNK> gets hold of one of <UNK> shoes mercifully the writer didn't decide to <UNK> on the story of cinderella to <UNK> the film the <UNK> holmes and watson escape <UNK> free oh well it is a bit of a change of pace in late victorian london a bit of <UNK> law
<START> a very slick modern keeping it <UNK> hip <UNK> on the dracula story although staying with the traditional customs with quite an interesting if not fully <UNK> back story of the prince of darkness the first time i tried watching it i could only make it halfway through before losing interest again it gets off to a good start especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with dracula but then for me it got less involving when it hits new orleans to focus on van <UNK> daughter a great place to set it but never took advantage of its settings despite <UNK> a paradise in damn where dracula could <UNK> produced by wes <UNK> and yeah they throw that name out there but written directed by patrick <UNK> artistically it had its moments with few <UNK> visuals but some <UNK> editing and cheap <UNK> don't help the messy script does get considerably silly <UNK> does a polished job that remains rather <UNK> <UNK> a lot of blood the make up is suitably achieved and a lot of virgin advertising no i don't mean <UNK> it's the music company as it does get in numerous shots and <UNK> daughter works there too oh that wasn't obvious <UNK> the soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes now the performances are all over the shop but there are few familiar faces to spot danny masterson sean patrick thomas nathan <UNK> <UNK> west and <UNK> <UNK> gerard butler as dracula just didn't come off as not much of a presence was formed he was simply out <UNK> by the <UNK> ladies of the night jennifer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ryan as <UNK> brides the likes of <UNK> lee <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> okay christopher plummer gives out a <UNK> turn as van <UNK> and omar <UNK> has fun with his role
<START> story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a <UNK> orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy <UNK> of it's singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the <UNK> dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third <UNK> on a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great <UNK> <UNK> future stars sally <UNK> and <UNK> forrest can be seen briefly
<START> radio was not a 24 hour <UNK> a week happening when i grew up in the 1930s england so children's hour was a treat for me when we had <UNK> and an <UNK> to spare for the power the few <UNK> i heard therefore made a great impression on my young mind and the 3 that i recall still are <UNK> one about all the animals at the <UNK> and grey owl talking about the animals he knew which he called his brothers it was only in recently that i <UNK> that grey owl wasn't a genuine indian but the tribute paid by the <UNK> chief makes great sense to me a man becomes what he dreams would that we could all dream as world changing and <UNK> as <UNK> grey owl <UNK> would that a new grey owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment
<START> this movie could have been a decent b movie if 3 4 of the the movie wasn't so much focusing on the sex scenes i mean he's a sex addict and i'm sure that there's a lot more that goes on with sex <UNK> outside of having sex on a constant basis michael des <UNK> did a good job considering what all he had to do which wasn't much at one point or another one would have to laugh at him because his character was so pitiful <UNK> kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex <UNK> she could've of done more though and i'm not suggesting her having sex the person that stood out the most to me in this movie was <UNK> arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife there's something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me she played that role and as you watched the movie you start to feel bad for her br br diary of a sex addict while not oscar material or a modern classic to anyone's standards is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how one's personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly of
<START> gundam wing is a fun show i appreciate it for getting me into gundam and anime in general however after watching its predecessors such as mobile suit gundam zeta gundam and even g gundam i find wing to be gundam <UNK> br br characters an aspect long held by gundam is to have their characters thrust into difficulties and grow into maturity this does not happen in wing <UNK> is top dog at the beginning and he's top dog at the end personalities do not change growth is never achieved the best character is <UNK> who is for all <UNK> and purposes a hero throughout most of the series but suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason br br <UNK> wing has great suit designs the <UNK> are super cool with the <UNK> being my favorite i even consider a few of the oz suit designs to be on par with some of the classic <UNK> suits but sweet suit designs doesn't quite save the series from boring characters br br conclusion in the end wing has cool fight scenes though <UNK> with recycled animation but shallow plot and character development enjoyable but not moving like previous gundam <UNK>
<START> this long episode packs amount of astounding of surprises thriller mystery and concerns about a battle of wits of sherlock against charles <UNK> <UNK> a master <UNK> this is an excellent overlong runtime of jeremy brett holmes series in the film appear usual <UNK> cannon as inspector <UNK> and mrs hudson though no <UNK> however is a greatest villain charles <UNK> br br it's a genuine ripping yarn with intrigue thrills and suspense including an exciting final twist this is a particular sherlock movie but we find to holmes falling in love with a servant kissing crying and even robbing this time along with the episode <UNK> in <UNK> with irene <UNK> result to be the only one which holmes is <UNK> top notch brett performance he alongside peter cushing are the best sherlock tv while in the cinema is forever basil <UNK> brett performs as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sleuth here doctor watson isn't a comic <UNK> and clumsy pal <UNK> by <UNK> bruce but is an <UNK> and cunning partner well <UNK> by edward <UNK> a perfect <UNK> of brett casting is frankly magnificent special mention to robert hardy as <UNK> nasty hardy today famous by role as <UNK> <UNK> in harry potter is a veteran actor with forty years of career and with several success such as the <UNK> kingdom and winston <UNK> furthermore appear <UNK> actors with terrific performances <UNK> grace sophie gordon <UNK> gordon among others the movie gets a colorful atmosphere the london streets and <UNK> baker <UNK> house are well designed the motion picture is well directed by peter <UNK> director of various episodes it's a must see for the arthur conan doyle fans
<START> this is quite an amazing film to watch using digital technology the director rohmer has literally <UNK> his living actors into painted backdrops most of the time this works brilliantly especially at the start where the film is like a pop up story book come to life it is less successful in a few scenes where it limits camera angles they had not painted the side of some of the buildings for example but it is a very interesting way to film a historical film which is as much about our own <UNK> and limited views of history as history itself it is narrated using the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> ex mistress grace elliott so an event usually claimed as one of their own by <UNK> historians especially in france is here told from the point of view of a female <UNK> <UNK> inevitably a different point of view emerges there can be no objective representation the use of the <UNK> device does give the film a rather episodic quality personally i found the story line around the king's death the most interesting a <UNK> <UNK> she is shocked when the <UNK> votes for the king's death a basic knowledge of the french revolution is probably helpful to follow the dialogue between grace and the <UNK> here he was <UNK> cousin and had himself elected to the <UNK> where he promptly changed his name to philip <UNK> the filming of <UNK> death is <UNK> grace and her <UNK> are in <UNK> out of paris watching from a hill with a <UNK> we do not see the execution we only hear the <UNK> commentary like grace the most dramatic event of the revolution happens off screen grace cannot bear to watch her king be killed her view is that of an aristocrat any justification of <UNK> death is literally beyond her vision this is powerful <UNK> intelligent film making the love story between the <UNK> and grace is <UNK> never told and is <UNK> moving tho the <UNK> does seem a bit of a pompous fool at times what does she see in him no <UNK> for taste the <UNK> of madness simply existing being enough to be a suspect that <UNK> individuals along in a time such as the revolution are illustrated as <UNK> life is turned upside down her house is searched daily yet she still orders her servants to cook her food and is incapable of dressing herself if you have any interest at all in a subtle well told film making clever use of new technology to tell an old tale or the representation of a pivotal moment in <UNK> history narrated by an <UNK> foreign woman its ultimate <UNK> then this is well worth your time it is a little slow in places but your patience is <UNK> rewarded
<START> don't waste your time or money on this one the half decent cast might fool you into thinking that this teen thriller whilst hardly about to break any records might lightly entertain for 80 minutes br br it won't br br it won't make you scared laugh cry or even challenge your intellect it will leave you wondering how on earth this movie ever finished production yes it really is that poor
<START> i watched free money last night it was the longest 90 minutes of my life with such an intriguing cast i really thought that i was in for a treat especially since i'm a brando fan wrong what a waste of talent it's almost embarrassing to watch at times like the cattle <UNK> scene there were so many missed opportunities for humorous <UNK> why didn't they show charlie <UNK> character going back to <UNK> <UNK> truck ugh it tries to be a slapstick comedy but i just wasn't buying into it skip this one only for die hard brando fans br br i'm giving it 2 out of 10 because i still think the worse movie ever made was <UNK>
<START> when i saw this movie cover the first thing i thought was that it was made for video the second thing that came to mind was how similar this looked to another terrible movie darkness falls the tale of this dumb witch who killed people in the dark unfortunately darkness falls was quite the masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage and this movie should not have been made br br the film starts off with a small back story for the witch or more like a pointless introduction of two little kids who are going to go meet the tooth fairy in hopes of her giving them a shiny new <UNK> for their tooth the opening is filmed poorly and like the rest of the movie it's certainly not scary in present time the movie is about peter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> renting out his house and his ex girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> west and her daughter cole come to stay there cole meets a neighborhood child and they talk of the tooth fairy and how you shouldn't lose your tooth or she'll come for you unfortunately seconds later it looks like the tooth fairy steals her bike and knocks her tooth out how ironic will cole survive the wrath of the tooth fairy and will her mother and peter be able to save her and <UNK> their romance this is a bad movie you could probably figure it out br br one of the main problems with this idiotic film is how <UNK> the tooth fairy is they say she kills you if you lose your tooth but nope she's more like a serial killer who kills at random and if you lose your tooth you're definitely going to go she steals a bike so apparently she's a thief too i said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on darkness falls but where did they get the inspiration for the tooth <UNK> appearance let's see she looks like a burn victim and she previously went around the neighborhood <UNK> children hmmm it's almost as though she's an exact rip off of freddy krueger from the nightmare on elm street films and this is not the worst part of this awful mess the climax is this movie might have the most laughable climax not literally laughable because i found it more sickening than funny i've ever seen don't see this br br just a little trivia <UNK> <UNK> was in scary movie and <UNK> <UNK> was in scary movie 3 and they both were in this so apparently scary movie stars are forced to end out their career with bad scary movies br br my rating 1 2 out of 80 mins r for violence
<START> some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them as i watched this film made in 1988 in 1999 i thought i was watching the o j simpson <UNK> although i have very different opinions about the innocence of the individuals in each situation br br the australian news media if this movie is to be believed <UNK> the case of a possible <UNK> and truth was left as an <UNK> it was scary to see the scenes of <UNK> <UNK> media <UNK> ridiculous accounts of half truths and lies and <UNK> over the supposed merits of the case by persons at all levels of society br br equally appalling is the <UNK> depiction as indifferent and <UNK> of the technical information in the case i do wish more was made of the issue of religious prejudice in the case the accused are seven day <UNK> br br today these <UNK> have become common but that makes the lesson only more important br br streep is excellent as usual and this is the best i've ever seen sam <UNK> the aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible
<START> i'm a <UNK> year old college professor i went with my wife and 12 year old daughter we all enjoyed the movie the film is original witty fast paced and totally charming the plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow but <UNK> enough to keep an adult interested i thought emma roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine my only criticism is that the los angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been they were <UNK> but nothing stood out on the other hand make up costume lighting cinematography editing and directing were excellent altogether i thought it was a totally enjoyable experience i am disappointed that the professional critics almost all adult males <UNK> attacked the film apparently they have something against films that portray strong intelligent and independent young women their <UNK> reveal more about their own sexist <UNK> than anything about this wonderful family film i recommend it strongly to every child and every parent
<START> being that i am a true product of the hip hop and electronic dance music generation this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time beat street although not as authentic in some respects as wild style is a film that is guaranteed to <UNK> the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban <UNK> dj based music and <UNK> club culture br br although i will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy you can't help but feel for the characters and ultimately wish you were there for the <UNK> of hip hop culture in new york city in the early eighties the b boy battle scene at the <UNK> nightclub a real life real time competition between the legendary rock steady crew and the nyc <UNK> is just as essential to a hip hop <UNK> <UNK> as any classic album watch some of the <UNK> moves in slow motion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and <UNK> expertise of a seasoned b boy b girl all <UNK> due to the <UNK> nation
<START> along with <UNK> the best greek comedy series ever <UNK> <UNK> writes and <UNK> <UNK> directs in a magnificent way <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> grandpa <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in a few words <UNK> a butcher living in a district around the center of <UNK> is married to <UNK> one day he meets <UNK> an old date of his who now is married to <UNK> and lives along with her father in law and his caretaker <UNK> <UNK> also has a son named johnny who appears at the end of the first period and the entire second one the rest main characters are <UNK> <UNK> assistant at the <UNK> and <UNK> sexual and <UNK> <UNK> lost sister who has turned up to be the best prostitute in the entire <UNK> the main story of the series is <UNK> attempts to kill <UNK> because he is cheating on her but everything else happening in that are not of lower importance brilliant screenplay with an excellent plot <UNK> quotes awesome performances and a great directing original idea and especially the shootings were something that was done at the greek television for a series of the greek television for the first time e g scenes shot under water surely a serial you will never stop enjoying
<START> i had seen this movie when it got released and when i was 12 years old and i still vividly <UNK> the wonderful scenes of how the hero heroine escape every time when faced with danger and the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain i think many so called action movies copied a lot many escape scenes from this movie and not only does it never impress me when i see such <UNK> it always <UNK> my appreciation for this masterpiece the lead actors have acted wonderfully the slow and realistic development of the chemistry b w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed as children we felt that the love that developed b w them was very natural the way they face and overcome all their trials and <UNK> together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love sacrifice and caring i recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance <UNK>
<START> this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life i gave up to watch it after an hour and <UNK> that hour a lot the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it <UNK> some ideas from movies like resident evil and aliens doesn't result in a movie like them if this going to be a top korean movie i'd rather won't bother to see even a korean movie trailer br br by the way this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising i think every korean who has internet for online <UNK> rated this movie over the 8 even though has no clue what it is about
<START> a <UNK> <UNK> of cinema since its <UNK> is that genre involving seductive women whose <UNK> and means <UNK> <UNK> men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in <UNK> for the male victims along with <UNK> as to whether or not <UNK> will be forced to take their medicine and here susan <UNK> performs as a <UNK> although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera <UNK> are <UNK> to make her performance a credible one isabelle <UNK> <UNK> wife of venture <UNK> stewart collins john <UNK> begins a love affair merely for fun with <UNK> salesman richard davis philip <UNK> simply a <UNK> for her but an earnest matter of the heart for richard apparently <UNK> by his lover while she takes advantage of his <UNK> by engaging him in a <UNK> plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent when davis becomes convinced that <UNK> isabelle is a victim of physical abuse <UNK> by her husband he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may <UNK> her himself coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a <UNK> <UNK> at hiring a professional assassin who will <UNK> of the allegedly violent stewart in the wake of the hit man's assault upon collins a pair of police detectives performed by joe <UNK> and dean mcdermott become increasingly curious concerning <UNK> possible involvement in the crime while at the same time reality <UNK> upon <UNK> richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are properly cast as a <UNK> pair of <UNK> each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of <UNK> but <UNK> and mcdermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as <UNK> direction and design elements released upon a <UNK> dvd this largely <UNK> affair depicting a man <UNK> the spell of a <UNK> does benefit from top flight visual and sound quality and although no extra features are provided the above average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer robert <UNK> and composer stephen <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story it's too unrealistic and is a typical sunny <UNK> movie that is aimed to bash <UNK> the movie's aim is to <UNK> the viewers so they can think that <UNK> and it's government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws won't work and all the songs and music of the movie are all bad most likely the <UNK> will love <UNK> movie cause they are being misguided the movie sucks and sucks with power i think only <UNK> <UNK> was good in the movie if i can give 0 out of 10 i would but the lowest is 1 please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie disaster
<START> this was a new <UNK> low among westerns the writing is excruciatingly bad characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed and <UNK> maguire shows us the flip side of his talent <UNK> through his part with those <UNK> eyes and that <UNK> voice of his that here betrays only <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> is among my five worst movie experiences ever a western never to be <UNK> in the negative respect
<START> lets enter the world of this movie for a second so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here br br edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his <UNK> have been letting loose 50 000 bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and <UNK> shouting at them and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him instead of wasting this guy that has caused you so much grief instead of just walking up and pop what do you do the bad guy he talks to him he grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun they have nothing to talk about shoot him shoot him now but he talks to him anyway oh another thing at the end a newspaper says <UNK> prize winner story right here or something right above on a front page of a paper when its like the first time the story is <UNK> so how in the <UNK> did someone win a <UNK> for it that fast <UNK> you know those types of stupid movies <UNK> well that's edison in a nutshell br br you get mr cool morgan freeman and <UNK> eyed tough kevin spacey who both phone in their roles completely ll cool j who <UNK> literally every single moment of the movie while <UNK> to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places and who's last line duck was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made and justin timberlake whining and <UNK> nonsense every time he talks little cocky bastard the only bright spot was a crazy dylan mcdermott doing his best denzel from training day impression which was pretty entertaining br br oh <UNK> so whats the movie about eh something about <UNK> involving the city <UNK> fictional special unit police force called f r a t i swear i'm not making this stuff up which was supposed to be a obvious play off of s w a t anyway little <UNK> super singer boy justin <UNK> <UNK> something foul <UNK> after a murder involving 2 undercover cops from frat and he goes <UNK> off looking for a story gaining his <UNK> freeman trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought blah blah blah its like a <UNK> <UNK> brief meets a <UNK> training day the pacing was slow and off the script was horrible and the acting was extremely uninspired it jumped everywhere without going anywhere people get put in <UNK> and you forget about them everyone in this movie just didn't think damn what a stupid movie its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended no lie basically do not waste your time
<START> it begins with several of the principles on a stage run to <UNK> <UNK> hayes <UNK> sounds like duke is the driver and begins his usual <UNK> against women in general with his girlfriend pearl being an exception he then relates a <UNK> version of the biblical story of <UNK> to justify his <UNK> of long <UNK> against the wishes of pearl who is the town <UNK> no less and who claims if everyone followed his example she would be out of business this point will return to dominate the last scene in the film <UNK> seems an <UNK> to some reviewers but is a definite plus to this one it's too bad he wasn't in more of the better <UNK> scott westerns to help <UNK> up <UNK> usual iron <UNK> demeanor also on this stage are randy cole <UNK> his future wife <UNK> craig as <UNK> wallace whom he is getting <UNK> with and a little girl myrtle to whom he soon becomes a hero when he <UNK> her from the runaway stage after it is held up by henchman of <UNK> wheelchair bound uncle john <UNK> george cleveland who essentially runs the town br br randy soon learns that his uncle and by <UNK> himself is not exactly popular among the town folk he does however quickly form a useful friendship with <UNK> after he learns that uncle john was responsible for the stage <UNK> of his business <UNK> <UNK> wallace and the associated murder he demands that uncle john return the money and decides to work for <UNK> and her brother ted russell hayden instead of for uncle john br br as his <UNK> <UNK> rise uncle john decides to plant an <UNK> barbara <UNK> as <UNK> tyler in the wallace office to keep him informed as to when they are delivering <UNK> from the mines to town so that he can <UNK> their run when this doesn't work he <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> of staging an <UNK> of his own office for which randy is blamed unfortunately when the fire was discovered randy was in <UNK> apartment confronting her with suggestive evidence that she was <UNK> off uncle john myrtle and <UNK> <UNK> that he was in the apartment when the fire was discovered this puts him and <UNK> in the dog house with <UNK> his apparent beau and ted who hopes to woo <UNK> this news also ends uncle john's trust in <UNK> as an <UNK> and he suggests she leave town instead she switches sides and tells the <UNK> why randy was in her apartment uncle john tries once again to <UNK> their <UNK> run and when that fails there is a general shootout in town you can guess the results br br the plot is well constructed and executed with complicated relationships between the principles and with a variety of obstacles for randy to overcome with the sometimes aid of his associates at least randy was <UNK> the necessity of bringing his uncle to justice uncle john had a choice to avoid assassination but <UNK> trusted that a woman wouldn't have the guts to carry out her threat the presence of hayes and two beautiful wholesome single women as well as little myrtle much helped to <UNK> the otherwise tense atmosphere in this battle for survival as uncle john put it br br it seems odd that barbara <UNK> the bad girl gets top female billing over catherine craig <UNK> love interest <UNK> on camera time was much more limited br br those who grew up on the <UNK> tv series featuring george cleveland as <UNK> will be surprised to find him playing such a mean controlling villain we may wonder if his wheelchair bound status has a bearing on this persona this leaves him with few <UNK> for making a living in the wild west without apparent family to help support him except randy he can't afford to have some <UNK> beat him out of the most <UNK> business in town on the other hand from his conversations he probably achieved his status as the town boss before becoming wheelchair bound
<START> i have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video <UNK> i finally found it on dvd at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie the story is set around amazon jungle <UNK> that are living in fear of the devil laura crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in south america they take her into the jungle laura is <UNK> by some ridiculous native who calls himself the devil she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy <UNK> are <UNK> up the devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner peter <UNK> is the devil hunter who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her
<START> i don't know what it is with this movies but movies about history or religion are always <UNK> by their accuracy of course it's not 100 accurate it's difficult to make 100 accurate films nowadays when even the experts disagree with each other therefore i rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuracies br br so i start by saying that i liked this mini <UNK> but i do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast the series should have been a three part story his childhood being the first part but if they didn't have more money to shoot more story who am i to <UNK> that br br there's only one real problem i have with this movie and that's the fact that it's told in a history book way especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened i rather would have liked to see hitler more <UNK> more scenes where he doubts himself etc <UNK> taylor did that more in the movie <UNK> which seem to work better i think nevertheless i'm glad this was made and own it on dvd just to remember more vividly what happened and see <UNK> giving his best 7 5 10
<START> if they could get ed <UNK> why didn't they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers and why did the protagonist throw the wise old <UNK> character to the ground when he was never in danger it forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long <UNK> i guess thats why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he <UNK> for extra work if the d bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better he has good reason to be jealous good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective controlling manipulative father all the characters that are meant to be likable aren't and everyone else is the <UNK> boyfriend how did they meet anyway a wine <UNK> and a saw mill worker
<START> br br worst movie ever br br what was the purpose of filming this remake aside from turning it into a 90 minute <UNK> for the movie's soundtrack zombies that run i guess the director never watched the original dead films which show stiff <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> creatures <UNK> <UNK> toward their living prey br br and how exactly did the survivors know which boat in the <UNK> <UNK> to the recently <UNK> steve br br 1 10
<START> there is one good thing in this movie lola <UNK> ass sorry to be so blunt but it's the truth too bad she didn't do a nude it would at least have made this mess tolerable we see another <UNK> boobs but she's nowhere near lola and man is <UNK> <UNK> old or what the man looks like crap consequence is the usual b movie you would expect the story had potential it's like they had good ideas but didn't know how to <UNK> them the cinematography is just plain awful ugly the directing is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twists and washed up actors lola <UNK> is great as the <UNK> in a cheap <UNK> way but not even she saves consequence from being trash and not funny trash just plain old <UNK> trash
<START> i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was superb although i would have to mention bill <UNK> in particular as giving an absolutely <UNK> performance bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films timothy <UNK> and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance and billy connolly as always totally gorgeous it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a well written superbly acted and good looking movie
<START> up until the last few minutes of the movie i would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars however the ending is so terrible and <UNK> that it completely <UNK> the first 80 of the movie br br the plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear <UNK> the captain gene hackman is all for <UNK> while his first officer denzel washington is in favor of <UNK> the launch orders first the problem is to launch both the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys hackman is determined to launch and washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed <UNK> aboard the sub eventually the mistake is discovered and the <UNK> are not launched cool however here comes the part that just doesn't ring true after they are back on land and go before a review board washington and hackman who'd just spent half the movie trying to kill each other shake hands and are all buddy buddy huh too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me
<START> at the time my left foot was the little movie that could it was hugely popular and everyone <UNK> the fact that such a small independent film could make it all the way to the oscars br br since then movies like my left foot are a dime a dozen so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about it's certainly a well made and competent film but it's clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of daniel day lewis who <UNK> himself in the role of <UNK> brown a man living with cerebral <UNK> day lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won dustin hoffman an oscar the year before for playing a man with <UNK> in rain man and the academy followed suit by giving day lewis the same honor br br the only thing really <UNK> this film from a big budget hollywood production is just that its budget in every other way it's just as formulaic as any standard product that's not to say it isn't a good movie but it's not a masterpiece br br grade a
<START> but i regret having seen it since the ratings on imdb are relatively high and they must also have been relatively high on netflix i guess i put it in my <UNK> because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the uk a category that has produced many films i liked immensely saving grace on the other hand falls into the category of laugh less comedies usually populated by hollywood movies produced and directed by the talentless brenda <UNK> is a capable actress and i have liked her in other movies the concept a <UNK> growing marijuana to overcome the <UNK> she finds herself confronting after her husband's death does not offend me notwithstanding the <UNK> efforts on the part of the cast to produce humor the film falls flat on its face falling flat on its <UNK> might have been funnier as far as i and my wife were concerned be <UNK> oh gentle reader not all offbeat british comedies succeed this one is a dud
<START> this is above all else the typical crown international pictures drive in read passion pit <UNK> the 1975 sammy <UNK> hit record chevy van is heard repeatedly on the soundtrack this movie has even been <UNK> with the title chevy van despite the film's title vehicle being a dodge danny <UNK> makes only six minutes of on screen appearance but countless vhs <UNK> <UNK> credit him as the star of the flick the movie is a <UNK> sexist morality tale will bobby find sexual satisfaction through the one night stand his <UNK> van <UNK> or must he wait until tina the girl of his dreams gives him the time of day still it is representative of the <UNK> <UNK> dream of male american high <UNK> of the time and on that basis alone the van has almost in spite of itself become an <UNK> of the period that must be <UNK> in any honest <UNK> of the <UNK> popular american cinema
<START> in 2006 the <UNK> awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting <UNK> in the <UNK> place on earth that film was march of the <UNK> narrated by academy award winning actor morgan freeman br br walt disney studios has had a <UNK> on the animated circuit for decades now they've taken their stabs at live action film making and it's been hit and miss all across the board disney then created a sub division called <UNK> and release its first feature film titled earth this is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries i've seen in quite sometime br br narrated by the great james earl jones earth doesn't offer anything new to anyone who has watched the discovery channel in the past five years or follows the global warming crisis very closely earth touches very deeply on the issue and takes a very liberal approach on the subject matter br br it <UNK> an emotional connection to nature that i haven't experienced before it also shows not only the beauty and <UNK> parts of our gorgeous planet but the <UNK> and disturbing aspects that it often <UNK> it's one thing to watch <UNK> fall from a cliff in to a <UNK> or <UNK> mother be shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods it's all good because at the end of the film we know it is just that a film this shows <UNK> polar bears elephants all types of families from all walks of life living and dying in their natural <UNK> these real things make a real movie experience br br though a bit heavy weight on the graphic nature of the film which many people will disagree earth is a touching experience there is stunning cinematography work here by a great camera team and an amazing score by george <UNK> in comparison to march of the <UNK> or <UNK> man it doesn't really hold any measure but it stands great on its own at the end of the day you grow an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness as many of us will probably never get to visit these places we'll witness in the film we live here yet it's like we never get to explore the planet for one reason or another earth is beautiful br br
<START> wow this was a movie was completely captivating i could not believe that i started awake so late to watch it but it came on late ounce i started watching i couldn't stop it had a full range of very good cast members wow even <UNK> <UNK> and ruby dee forrest <UNK> and james earl jones and many more well known actors and actresses this was more than a glimpse into history it was eye opening into another part of society that people don't know of and may even be embarrassed to talk about i've never heard of a book or movie about this before and this is something that black history never <UNK> only looks down on because they were <UNK> and mixed race i highly recommend this movie
<START> an <UNK> subtle and lean film the man in the white suit is yet another breath of fresh air in <UNK> format from ealing studios while i suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure i doubt many would fail to be <UNK> by the expert way the plot the themes and characters are <UNK> <UNK> during the film's course br br the genuinely great alec guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously <UNK> as <UNK> inspired kind hearts and <UNK> from 1949 this time he merely plays one character rather than eight but as the <UNK> <UNK> and scientist sidney <UNK> he always finds the correct tone and expression along with <UNK> subtle <UNK> performance the rest of the cast are effective of the main players cecil parker and ernest <UNK> do stand out <UNK> is <UNK> absurd as the crippled but influential business <UNK> while parker is <UNK> as the <UNK> yet pivotal mill owner and father father that is of joan <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> comic actress who is at her <UNK> peak in this film <UNK> and seductive of aspect and <UNK> she is quite sublime in this film a fine contrast with the similarly unusual but more <UNK> guinness the scene where she seemingly tries to <UNK> him is played so <UNK> by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing br br the themes are handled very effectively with no easy morals drawn the <UNK> of the relationships between science business and the <UNK> are <UNK> and <UNK> examined expertly <UNK> by alexander <UNK> this film is technically <UNK> in all areas <UNK> photography fitting sound effects and music and a <UNK> script all quietly impress a thoroughly satisfying film with guinness and <UNK> magnificent br br rating 1 2
<START> this is a smart drama about the way of life in a texas <UNK> <UNK> in the early 1980's john travolta and debra <UNK> turn out two very believable performances as bud and sissy davis this film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce america to the mechanical bull if you love a good romance film then you will love this movie
<START> i had watched the eye before i watched this one i really liked the eye it was one of the best movies of the recent asian horror cinema so i picked this <UNK> haunted because it was the same director and it was kind of popular round here but man what a disappointment <UNK> haunted are three stories about love revenge ghosts etc that are no scary at all not even disturbing as the eye was no nothing i can't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment br br 100 boring br br my rate 2 10
<START> i just rented yes i paid money to see this film <UNK> it is one of the very worst films i have ever seen as another reviewer put it ms <UNK> get out of films please please never make or appear in another film the lady has the charisma of a <UNK> no that's not fair to the <UNK> which probably has more going for it she does not know how to act she affects a disgusted look all the time reminded me very much of my always disgusted young sisters in law from europe she is not charming she is not pretty there is no real story and the editing there wasn't any that i could see it's pretty bad when you are watching a film and just to get through it you press forward forward on your remote and still nothing happens i mean i kept <UNK> screaming cut cut what were they thinking well obviously they thought they would make a film together and get paid to make love on screen pretty good deal for them pretty raw deal for the viewer i think i'm going to throw up now
<START> i just loved watching it though and having fun with it's total badness of a film i saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of mystery science theater 3000 and i have the dvd if you flip the to the other side of the dvd they show the actual movie so i gave it a chance seriously folks this is <UNK> cheese br br the acting special effects and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic doesn't she need <UNK> said crow <UNK> how the head can still talk while it doesn't have a body and tom <UNK> just <UNK> remarks no she's got neck juice the ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with k porn i loved the cat fight between the two <UNK> that <UNK> after the fight or scene whatever was classic so in some ways this was a fun movie i think for horror fans you'll probably enjoy it for a good time watch the <UNK> version you'll get a great laugh br br mst3k version 10 10 the brain that would die 1 10
<START> les <UNK> is the absurd story of jean pierre <UNK> desperately waiting for a cup of hot water the story of a conspiracy against actors the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be but a stunning tribute to french actors and their cinema br br supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting the fourth wall the hidden cameras to play or not to play the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera the film is not <UNK> is quite vague and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite amusing as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the film and leaves <UNK> <UNK> to play his part great actress she's hilariously serious especially when in <UNK> role she <UNK> about herself as actors run in each other on the street asking for <UNK> as fights and <UNK> happen we recognize <UNK> of other scenes in which each or others have played br br actually for whoever does not know the actors most of them being at least in their 50s or does not know french cinema this movie has less interest since most of the references will be missed but it will still offer a good track of reflection on aging on acting on public life
<START> a definite no a <UNK> no this movie is an absolute dud br br having been recommended to me by a friend very much into that sort of thing i watched this movie with some anticipation of being informed changed moved altered <UNK> and all the other positive mystical things that could happen to me when i suddenly see the truth now this may sound like someone who is already <UNK> to poo <UNK> anything dealing with the <UNK> the <UNK> physical boundaries of existence believe me i am not such a person i try to be open about any presentation and then decide <UNK> br br in terms of content the only thing i found mildly interesting and informative was the bit about <UNK> emotions addiction and <UNK> <UNK> that was the only <UNK> element i could find in the documentary part of this film the rest of the documentary <UNK> around several topics and never seemed to <UNK> and <UNK> try to tie up and conclude to a point and what was all that stuff about native americans not being able to see the ships that <UNK> came in who told the authorities in this film that that was what happened in <UNK> where they there too had they compared this to scientific work being done in visual <UNK> the famous gorilla video for example visit the visual <UNK> lab at the university of <UNK> site there may have been a more convincing point made here however it seemed like <UNK> mystical <UNK> <UNK> br br as a film this wasn't one film it was two i found the documentary part mildly interesting just to hear the people talking about what they were talking about i was annoyed that their <UNK> weren't presented at the bottom of the screen when they spoke at least initially but i found the story part of the movie with <UNK> in it annoying disjointed <UNK> non related and downright stupid that bit about the polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny it was laughable ludicrous <UNK> and stupid and i found the use of the word <UNK> offensive it just seemed so out of place and wrong is such usage okay because a member of the group uses a <UNK> term to refer to the group because he or she is a member of the group that may be okay to make a point but it didn't seem to be used that way here and in any case i don't care what the reason it offended me a pole i never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as <UNK> and i certainly don't like like it when others do can i watch or listen to a <UNK> conversation in which this term is used you <UNK> but again this didn't seem to be the case here it just seemed so out of place <UNK> <UNK> br br the acting was abysmal <UNK> <UNK> performance was totally unbelievable at times it seemed like she was just reading her lines that had just been given to her <UNK> <UNK> for the most part seemed to be sleep walking through this whole thing perhaps she was <UNK> by the material i know i was if she was supposed to be portraying a <UNK> drugged up anxiety prone <UNK> it just didn't seem to click but by far the world's worst was <UNK> all in all i found this a disjointed poorly acted piece of <UNK> trap
<START> i will be short this film is an embarrassment to everyone except its cinematographer the very fact that it is a critique of the sex <UNK> industry seems valid until we are treated to a lingering dance scene the plot is ridiculous no one except the most <UNK> fan of bad horror will get anything out of it and for the love of god please stop saying this film is a tale of innocence lost or even of female <UNK> because it is quite clearly not childish <UNK> lesbians what the hell this was by far the worst film at the <UNK> festival that i saw anyway someone even <UNK> halfway through the film probably because they couldn't take any more of it this may seem like an overly critical rant but i genuinely cannot find a redeeming feature of this film except for perhaps if you take it as pure comedy in short this film is best watched on a cocktail of class a drugs
<START> an uninspired and <UNK> new columbo which sees the man in the mac attend his <UNK> wedding only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night columbo <UNK> br br and that it is about it <UNK> plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script given that it is written by robert van <UNK> who penned the highly enjoyable columbo story murder under glass in the <UNK> <UNK> there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of <UNK> <UNK> to columbo by the script writer is the <UNK> down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding which include everybody who was there br br devoid of every columbo <UNK> possible i thought i was watching an episode of hill street blues an insult to the history of the series with appropriately soap opera style acting very <UNK> stuff
<START> before this the flawed <UNK> five was the best but this screen adaptation of mother night is very true to the book and keeps the comedy mystery and tragedy intent thankfully it wasn't hollywood <UNK> or <UNK> a la the movie of breakfast of <UNK> another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it as i think you do for <UNK> five that's probably true of breakfast of <UNK> also but they did such a bad job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie nick nolte did an excellent job in this film
<START> i first saw this video 15 years ago i thought it was excellent then and i still do i am a former teacher of english high school and college and a lover of english romantic poetry so <UNK> rates highly with me anything which might detract from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story wouldn't get my vote of excellence in this case everything works well to engage the viewer especially high school students the story is well illustrated for a generation which grew up on television in addition the voice of michael redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority to it okay so there wasn't a big budget for the project so it wasn't star wars and there's no cgi in it but who can dismiss <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as part of the presentation the comment above which in just four lines <UNK> the video as a piece of trash is grossly unfair and <UNK> i'm a friend of the producer but that isn't my reason for this comment rather i'm defending a work of artistry which i think has value on all levels it is well suited to bring <UNK> poem to students in a way which <UNK> their appreciation of it and <UNK> their sympathy for the lesson which the ancient <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i wouldn't say this totally sucked but if it wasn't for netflix i wouldn't even have this in my house steve <UNK> eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat he's just not funny he's another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work <UNK> themselves to the next snl movie the <UNK> coach with the elmer <UNK> <UNK> is about as funny as it is original amy <UNK> simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately the only thing going for this movie is that tina <UNK> is easy on the eyes the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn't get pregnant the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple <UNK> along not really entertaining or creating laughs
<START> final score 1 8 out of 10 br br after seeing <UNK> and silent bob strike <UNK> i must have been on a big <UNK> <UNK> kick when i rented this movie <UNK> <UNK> is a junk psychological thriller dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up and <UNK> like <UNK> wes <UNK> american beauty <UNK> affleck drowning <UNK> and likable star melissa <UNK> luke wilson is also in there ridiculously miscast as a priest the movie the <UNK> of writer director stephen carpenter seems like a mutant <UNK> of <UNK> your <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> and movies where a character and the audience is caught in a world of <UNK> caused by an accident death the movie keeps <UNK> out <UNK> images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved i don't think these movies are that entertaining by their very nature to begin with but <UNK> is rock bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it the visuals the script the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway <UNK> to movies like this plus it's pg 13 so it doesn't even deliver the gore or t a to sustain it as a guilty pleasure even the <UNK> version is tame i had heard that the movie contained some hot shower scene between <UNK> <UNK> as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting <UNK> for the shower scene at least i would get something out of this then it comes the two girls get paint on their shirts they jump in the shower fully <UNK> and <UNK> it off that's it people thought this was hot <UNK> <UNK> is one of those drop dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it it puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about in the end it leaves us empty carpenter's finale is a mess of flashing light and <UNK> sound and that's probably the most lively part it will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night <UNK> on usa or the sci fi channel due to it's low cost and pg 13 rating and that's probably best for it
<START> jake speed is a fine movie with a wonderful message it has its flaws of course at times it's a little slow it introduces its villain too far into the story it's action is paced at the rate of a <UNK> <UNK> it has a z grade cast although i've always admired the work of karen <UNK> who has the straight laced good looks of sandra <UNK> br br but with all this going against it jake speed really is inspiring thanks to a charming script by wayne crawford who plays the title role and andrew lane br br why do i find it so inspiring because it says to me hey why not try to be a good person br br the story is essentially a stranger in a strange land premise that is good and heroic jake speed is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people jake is more than a boy <UNK> he's more than a knight in shining armor jake speed is the <UNK> saint of optimism in a dirty mean and evil world br br it's because of this that jake speed really needed to be a hit it has a great message that should have gotten out to hollywood and then to the rest of the world br br imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people i'm not saying that we should be watching the <UNK> in every theater at the <UNK> but that it would be nice if more movies such as jake speed would get a chance due south a tv show about a canadian <UNK> is a good comparison of what can be done to <UNK> up american entertainment br br sure jake speed has violence blood and guns but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person you'll beat the forces of evil every time 10 14 99
<START> this has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the <UNK> thin plot it is another sailors on leave film <UNK> than <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> but not as good as <UNK> the <UNK> br br kathryn grayson is bland but kelly and sinatra work well together their <UNK> you knew <UNK> number is hilarious as they make up the song as they sing it 'i <UNK> <UNK> is also fun with sinatra showing how <UNK> he was at <UNK> sinatra's solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like grady <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> carlos <UNK> and pamela <UNK> and an unlikely but <UNK> jose iturbi as himself to keep one watching br br kelly is the star of the film although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children which astaire never did dean <UNK> plays a child who wants to be in the navy and <UNK> on to the kelly character he also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a <UNK> story of his life in the <UNK> navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated jerry mouse in another scene he dances a charming mexican hat dance with a <UNK> grave faced little girl sharon <UNK> that is <UNK> and sweet br br very pleasant then but a bit too long a <UNK> of better musicals to come
<START> most hollywood movies fail to capture the full range of experience of teenagers this film demonstrates exactly how to do it right it combines elements of humour suffering rebellion etc in a way that is <UNK> sympathetic the ending could be a bit <UNK> but the fact that the director doesn't spell everything out for you in advance before coming to the conclusion means that this film assumes a more intelligent viewer
<START> i caught this movie on t v last night and you know danny masterson was a pretty good actor in the film and its great to see him in something other than that 70s show the film <UNK> rated but in my opinion i would rate it r just because of the nudity and plenty of adult content but all in all i loved it i thought that <UNK> <UNK> were pretty funny its just basically about a guy who has no job girlfriend or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator more of a <UNK> really he gets framed for the murder of a rock star and the rock stars girlfriend is one of the people that really need to help him out i give it 3 stars
<START> not sure one can call this an anti war film it shows war at an elite level these are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it even when they are <UNK> they still enjoy the skill level and <UNK> their <UNK> even if it does go against being a <UNK> the movies is slow and rather <UNK> and in many ways is rather tame as war movies go more so by todays standards no body parts flying off as in modern movies it is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level this is more of a thinking man's movie once you start to watch you don't want to miss anything the thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions is what the movie is about not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline this maybe called a war <UNK> br br if you are into the skill of war if you are into reading or seeing programs about the <UNK> and so on you want to watch this movie br br comparable movies are the hill 1965 with sean connery <UNK> parallel 1941 with an all star cast the naked and the dead 1958 with cliff robertson all are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level enjoy
<START> as the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment i have ever heard on an <UNK> you seriously thought they were gay are you retarded if you went to go save your best friend and someone decides out of the goodness of his heart to help you then you are in a serious debt to that man <UNK> was a good person and each time they helped each other it made them closer as friends they weren't gay lovers like your <UNK> about and to let you know the game is set in a medieval time period back then women did just prepare <UNK> while the men fought do you even know your history do you know how long it took for women to be accepted in the army in present day this game contains a lot of realism even though your too damn slow obviously to catch it and you really need to spit out some solid proof instead of ignorant <UNK> based off your misguided act to interpret the story
<START> i felt asleep watching it and i had tickets for the midnight premiere any questions the most disturbing scene as far as i can remember was the <UNK> dance i dont know what that was scene by the way what an ending
<START> when ever a film is produced or directed by mel <UNK> you can bet your life any of his pictures will be seen for generation after generation just having <UNK> <UNK> ellen r <UNK> the egg i <UNK> appearing and starring in the film will make it even more of a great classic film in this film ellen <UNK> gets married and then she encounters all kinds of mental problems and even murder the mystery gets very much involved and robert ryan david <UNK> battle of the <UNK> <UNK> comes to the aid of ellen and sometimes you even wonder about david being on the up and up as you view this picture you just about find yourself beginning to understand who is the real nutty person and all of a sudden you begin to change your mind how the film will end great acting by <UNK> <UNK> and robert ryan who played an entirely different role than he usually portrays on the screen i forgot to mention that mel <UNK> was married to a great film star audrey hepburn great classic film with great classic actors
<START> when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible the cause can <UNK> be found in the book either it was pointless to start with or the point is one not easily conveyed to film or the movie missed the point which is the most frequent of these results and the <UNK> to happen especially when the point is one not easily defined the book <UNK> <UNK> has a point every reader of the book must have felt this and felt as if he had gotten it but i suspect most of them could not state it in words i'm not sure i can myself but perhaps it comes to this or something like it things come things go such is life but we carry on or at any rate some of us people like <UNK> do no doubt a more <UNK> critic could <UNK> a more adequate definition but the important fact is that there is a point possibly the sum of the entire story is the point and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view and to carry over in adapting the story to film the maker of this film evidently missed the point and doesn't substitute one of her own and so the film is about nothing br br this is not the usual complaint of a book lover that his favorite text has been <UNK> the merit of the book is something i <UNK> <UNK> in reading it i found it a bloody <UNK> and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly the narrative is supposed to be the work of the half educated <UNK> but that illusion is constantly <UNK> by a dozen different types of literary effect as if the author were <UNK> at her with his pen there are inconsistencies of style and tone as if different sections had been composed at different times and any conclusions i could reach about <UNK> had to remain <UNK> because it was uncertain which <UNK> the author intended and which he did not for instance despite <UNK> own self characterization as a <UNK> am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working class <UNK> girl and beneath her <UNK> of music <UNK> not so different from those of generations past in any case despite my <UNK> at the author i couldn't deny that his book stuck with me and what i couldn't get out of my head was his character's attitude her angle on the world which was almost as vivid as a <UNK> portrait <UNK> is the kind of person who's always <UNK> situations at once rather comic and rather horrible occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her like flies so that much of her life consists of a kind of <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> through <UNK> practical and <UNK> philosophical and that doesn't begin to describe it <UNK> enough the complex of incidents and of <UNK> <UNK> to them are the substance of the book and its achievement in exposing a cross section of existence it would be difficult to <UNK> otherwise for all my dislike of the book i can see this br br the <UNK> just described is not the <UNK> of the movie or if it is most of her is kept <UNK> an actress who might have been a good fit for the character had she been the right age at the right time is <UNK> <UNK> from the old tv series <UNK> samantha <UNK> then would seem like good casting she's rather the same sort of actress and in one of her earlier movies <UNK> son she played a girl who with a few <UNK> could have been turned into this one unfortunately as the film turned out she doesn't have the character from the book to play for one thing the book is one that if it is to be <UNK> virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience without her comments her perspective her voice the story loses most of its meaning it has lost more of it in that the <UNK> has <UNK> it of its comic and horrible elements the most memorable incidents from the book are <UNK> before they turn <UNK> and so <UNK> <UNK> whether of amusement or <UNK> depending on her mood are missing too and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story in short the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a <UNK> edgy <UNK> comic novel into a <UNK> art tv film and chose as her typical image one of ms <UNK> <UNK> in a artistically <UNK> melancholy as if the outing <UNK> signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross this isn't at all what the book or the <UNK> of the book was about for another thing the <UNK> of the movie isn't scottish the actress said in an interview she hadn't had time to study up the accent and she ought to be it's important that she her family and her mates are all from a single place and finally the film is missing the end of the story <UNK> spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness it's winter the <UNK> has frozen the power has gone out and the pub is dark minus this and minus all of the rest what's left is a failed art film a dead film about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her <UNK> or native inability ever to give in to being dead
<START> and when i watch sarah silverman i get the same results i love quirky <UNK> humor but this woman is so <UNK> b o r i n g annoying and yawn worthy she's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous the deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not funny i watched two segments of her program and was ready for <UNK> br br <UNK> my kid age 19 saw her <UNK> on comedy central and said she was a dumb chick i thought that was a compliment the one where she says watch my show or i'll kill my dog is actually believable i know she's a wanna be <UNK> she just comes across as a <UNK> nut case i just don't ever want to see her around my dog
<START> this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in 1978 it was a revelation to us we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children obviously we were wrong love may come from where you don't expect it and maybe don't want it but we both chose that love anyway br br and no it never changed our sexual <UNK> that kind of stuff is for the christian <UNK> br br when we were young we both had affairs but never with the opposite sex as we aged we stopped having <UNK> affairs br br this story is not far fetched however the suggestion that they became <UNK> seems pretty unrealistic to me my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last 40 years we are still gay end of story
<START> 1st watched 2 28 2006 4 out of 10 <UNK> sydney <UNK> dvd version i watched titled 3 days of the <UNK> so so cia drama full of laid back performances making for a very laid back movie the premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a cia research group being killed with robert <UNK> character <UNK> <UNK> being the one that was left who killed them and why that's what redford tries to find out while trying to not be the <UNK> victim at the same time along the way he gets faye <UNK> character involved involved originally because he needs a place to hide and then she eventually helps him out after a little <UNK> <UNK> time this is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one doesn't have a lot of suspense the flat performances don't help and the finish doesn't seal the deal for the audience enough either despite having a good director in sydney <UNK> and a group of classic performers the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be
<START> this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment its the best ending of any movie i've ever seen perfect beautiful funny simply wonderful br br i found this movie delightful even with it's french taking itself too seriously deep meanings thing going on i loved it it's a great love story and i loved the way <UNK> were woven in and by the way the music during the final credits is great i want the cd
<START> i have watched anime but i'm not a die hard fan and i don't read manga i say this because many of the reviewers who are <UNK> lyrical about this film seem to have that background i have seen st john's <UNK> and although it isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination it made me pick up <UNK> especially since everyone seems to love it br br well i watched it this afternoon and fought very hard to keep watching yes it's very beautiful the slow motion water scenes the <UNK> leaves on the trees even the cgi eye <UNK> <UNK> i liked the <UNK> the costumes even some of the fight scenes but overall this was dull as dirt br br it seemed as if someone took romeo and juliet the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers and threw in some x men for good measure two of the characters split <UNK> powers the guy dressed in a bear costume had his <UNK> and the grey haired guy had his ability to <UNK> himself then you have the girl who has a poison kiss that's poison <UNK> from batman why do they give these women such dumb powers poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death man that's some great power for you and the other girl can create bugs from this yellow dust that she <UNK> on her hands the other woman one of the star crossed lovers has the power of a hypnotic stare wow br br i sort of made it to the end of the film by fast <UNK> it and did see a bit more tragedy than i expected some people are comparing this to house of flying <UNK> and hero don't make that mistake they may share similar endings but that's where the similarities end <UNK> is made by an amateur the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker br br i would say avoid this film unless you're 12 to 18 years old
<START> i managed to tape this off my satellite but i would love to get an original release in a format we can use here in the states eddie truly is glorious in this performance from san francisco i don't remember laughing so hard at a stand up routine my wife and i both enjoyed this tape and his work on glorious i just wish i could buy a copy and help support eddie <UNK> through my purchase we need more of his shows available
<START> i second the motion to make this into a movie it would be great i was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game i have played it again and again over 20 times just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time final fantasy eat your heart out this should be made into a movie if anyone out there wants some help to start a <UNK> to have this made into a movie please contact me i would love to help with that project any day the graphics are great for <UNK> and even make you forget it is <UNK> most of the time the <UNK> of side <UNK> makes it different every time you play
<START> in addition to being an extremely fun movie may i add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful this kind fun loving woman had a great deal of money unfortunately she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money this woman was lonely since the death of her husband he had <UNK> to her in a theater that was going to be torn down to prevent that she bought it her daughters were afraid she was throwing away their money and decided to take action the character actors in this film were a great plus also i would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library but as of yet it's never been released sad
<START> solid comedy entertainment with musical <UNK> it <UNK> a fast pace that carries proceedings along in <UNK> <UNK> through a <UNK> of humorous and <UNK> complications boris karloff bela lugosi and peter lorre form a strong setup of sinister <UNK> the script contains all the standard mystery film props <UNK> <UNK> secret <UNK> thunder and lightning and <UNK> blow <UNK> karloff lugosi and lorre go in for heavy <UNK> and obvious <UNK> of the <UNK> era kay <UNK> and his band offered great entertainment for the people living in the 1940's who were trying to forget about the <UNK> of world war ii
<START> an absolute classic the direction is flawless the acting is just superb words fall short for this great work the most definitive movie on <UNK> police this movie has stood the test of times br br <UNK> <UNK> gives a stellar performance <UNK> <UNK> no less all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to <UNK> about many issues that confront our society br br this is the story of a cop <UNK> <UNK> who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately <UNK> into a killer the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about <UNK> cops kudos to <UNK> br br after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal politician police <UNK> thus this movie was truly a trend <UNK> this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade br br this movie was a <UNK> box office hit br br a must see for <UNK> movie fans
<START> overall this is a delightful light hearted romantic musical comedy i suppose a small case could be made for the movie being to long but i'm not sure what you would cut out the singing that kelly and sinatra do no the fabulous dancing that kelly does no the time the movie takes to develop the story line and develop the relationships of the characters no that seems to be a common complaint many times that more recent movies don't develop the characters br br some comment that iturbi didn't bring much to the movie but this gives us a chance to see and hear a great talent from the <UNK> so what if he wasn't an actor he was an important part of the movie as the basic plot was to get grayson an audition with him br br originally <UNK> grayson wanted to be an opera star louis b <UNK> brought her to mgm for a screen test that included an <UNK> during her audition in the movie there is a shot of the mgm <UNK> <UNK> and smiling you can just imagine it was like that when she had made her real screen test years before br br this movie is so full of life it is hard to hit all of the highlights great use was made of color and lighting throughout the movie you can see why frank sinatra became the star he did a nice counter point in the movie is how sinatra a ladies man even then played the role of wanting to just find a date while on leave you'll feel good after seeing this movie 7 10
<START> i wanted to like this film yes its a saw blah blah blah ripoff but i like those films if done well this had all the ingredients of being a good not brilliant but good film unfortunately those ingredients had gone off the acting was terrible and this was first seen when the <UNK> are introduced with their <UNK> one by one <UNK> taken off the remarks and one liners are just terrible yes i know bad writing but this is more than that it was bad writing coupled with bad acting two of the <UNK> had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film br br sorry im even wondering why i am bothering to review this movie at all br br i will end with plot holes plot holes more plot holes disappointing
<START> man this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books frankly i found it too slow and unappealing right from the start i kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened this movie is vastly overrated br br shakespeare with the king james english has never <UNK> to me anyway so it may just be me there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald colman playing the role of othello br br the good points of the film include thanks to a restored print some decent cinematography and a young slim and attractive <UNK> winters br br overall this is simply too boring too much <UNK> in some of the scenes to watch again besides we all know that most actors are nut cases anyway but kudos to hollywood for <UNK> it here in this story
<START> the people who are bad <UNK> this film are those who don't understand film to begin with these are the people who love movie blockbusters and <UNK> to any movie that doesn't star <UNK> <UNK> wilder <UNK> is a neat little film that may seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first but what it lacks in plot it more than makes up for in substance br br one thing in particular about the movie that impressed me was it's use of music which plays a large part those students of film music will notice how important music is in the movie both in <UNK> and <UNK> life and in the background <UNK> theme <UNK> theme and <UNK> theme are all heard in the opening sequence and it is funny how some of the lyrics play out for instance in the scene where the men are singing duke of earl <UNK> is with wilder when the men sing something like she is my girl and then she goes over to wallace to give him something when the men sing the <UNK> she will be my girl cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers there are all sorts of little <UNK> like this inside the movie and while it may look like a flop on the outside the real student of film will notice how good this movie really is
<START> if you need cheering up on a cold <UNK> evening this is the film for you excellent script and perfectly cast actors i especially loved ray <UNK> himself up in front of the mirror before <UNK> inspired
<START> this series was just like what you would expect from mr spielberg it is truly one of those <UNK> funny childish shows that you won't forget just like outer limits another great show this little series does what not a lot can it was great and deserved to run longer it was a great show that even kids could watch though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted to be but all of them always had a moral at the end like the twilight zone that made you realize what situation you didn't want to end up in or ones that you did i remember watching some of these on sci fi when i was 10 and even now i still enjoy seeing them when i can truly a fun imaginative show i loved it and still do
<START> great entertainment from start to the end wonderful performances by belushi beach dalton <UNK> some twists and many action scenes the movie was made for me funny lines in the screenplay good music dalton as the tough sheriff and <UNK> as redneck villain i must recommend this film to every action adventure fan 10 10
<START> this chinese movie made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture i don't belong and are far from in an almost <UNK> approach the film helps one to relate to each character and to the happiness of doing the simple routine things br br all actors are brilliant and <UNK> <UNK> exudes kindness and wisdom yet also vulnerable and mean er min the retarded brother shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal and that wisdom comes to and from the most <UNK> persons in this universe a different china this is far from the chinese realism yet it has lots of humanity and realism of a different kind br br get it you won't be disappointed
<START> i agree whole <UNK> with the comments so far i remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative i've ever seen as stated before i recall that i began watching thinking it was just another nature study interesting not necessarily special but i was so wrong not only was the story of the colony incredible but i remember the music as being so much a part of it's appeal if i remember correctly it was native <UNK> <UNK> akin to the music at the end of one flew over the <UNK> nest i too have been looking for a copy this should be required watching for anybody but especially the schools it should be re released
<START> this movie was disaster at box office and the reason behind that is innocence of the movie <UNK> of the story music was good story is very simple and old but presentation of such story is very good director tried his best <UNK> is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene <UNK> looks so sweet in the movie rest star cast was simply okay music and all songs are good <UNK> is impressive as an singer here don't miss this movie its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us <UNK> best work till date i will give 9 10 to <UNK> <UNK>
<START> haunted boat sells itself as 'the <UNK> meets <UNK> <UNK> in many ways this is accurate there are scares and weird looking people to keep you interested br br however the acting ability is poor at best showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film which in all credit they do to the best of their ability when you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks on br br many aspects of the film are creepy and strange but it suffers for using too many twists and turns in a short space of time which just leaves you bored and confused in terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well ignoring the irrelevant <UNK> every 5 seconds near the end you actually want to know what is going on and are willing to wait the <UNK> 35 minutes for the climax br br this is no ghost ship but it'll definitely do for an evening in front of the t v
<START> full house is a great family show however after watching some episodes over and over again i've realized that they're incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot yes there is a lot of comedy but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy it's not like i hate it but just don't watch them over and over again because they get old quick probably the best season is the first br br full house is about widower danny <UNK> bob <UNK> and his three daughters d j <UNK> cameron stephanie jodie <UNK> and michelle mary kate and ashley when <UNK> wife dies the he is in need of some help so his best friend joey dave <UNK> and the girls' uncle jesse john <UNK> moves in with them once they live there together they find they can't live without each other br br full house reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again
<START> before seeing this movie i would've said that i loved everything kathy bates has done now it's everything minus one james woods is pathetic not his character his acting someone should've told him that poor is not <UNK> with dirty nor ignorant nor cliche <UNK> for randy <UNK> stereotyping the only redeeming feature is henry thomas who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this <UNK> mess if you enjoy the country you'll enjoy the scenery that's the best i can give it br br i'm a serious fan of both independent and quirky films but this is simply terrible
<START> this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection br br the animation is well done but i feel like it is too <UNK> i would have preferred more images from behind more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so <UNK> to me br br but for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of <UNK> films and this is bothering to me perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice over br br i think the voice over is too <UNK>
<START> before writing this review i went back and <UNK> the reviews of others this movie was a particular disappointment to me since it features two of my favorite dancers gene kelly and george <UNK> boasts a score by the often <UNK> michel <UNK> <UNK> heights ice station <UNK> the thomas <UNK> affair the dancing was stilted <UNK> and unoriginal the songs forgettable the story a joke even the <UNK> was not particularly <UNK> only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit i'm glad other people enjoyed the young girls of <UNK> though i most certainly did not
<START> genre dinosaur animation new york time travel circus br br main characters rex the <UNK> rex elsa the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> a boy called louis a girl called <UNK> and captain new eyes actors john goodman rex <UNK> smith <UNK> martin short <UNK> the clown <UNK> <UNK> elsa etc br br what happens four dinosaurs see above are fed some brain grain <UNK> and are now <UNK> friendly dinosaurs who are going to be nice to children they go into new york with big <UNK> br br my thoughts this is a cute animated film the animation of the dinosaurs when they go <UNK> and friendly is a bit <UNK> and not so good but they look pleasant all the same that way i like the dinosaurs when they are <UNK> and friendly they are nice friendly and good i like almost all the characters featured especially elsa and <UNK> but of course i like the others as well overall i like this film a lot br br recommended to people who like good children's animated films people who like dinosaurs john goodman and people who think that <UNK> aren't always what they <UNK> enjoy
<START> arnold once again in the 80's demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives but as the tag line says arnold has yet to play the movie begins in the year <UNK> in which the world economy has <UNK> with food and other important <UNK> in short supply and a <UNK> state has <UNK> controlling every aspect of life through tv and a police state it's most popular game show is the running man in which criminals are forced to survive against <UNK> that live to kill them br br the movie opens with ben richards arnold leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress he is ordered by his superiors to fire on them <UNK> to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help the government blames richards for the massacre <UNK> him the name butcher of <UNK> <UNK> months later richards along with two friends william <UNK> <UNK> and harold <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a <UNK> zone they worked in they make their way to the underground led by <UNK> mick <UNK> <UNK> quickly <UNK> richards as the butcher of <UNK> and refuses to help him but his friend's convince him otherwise they want him to join the resistance but he'd rather go live with his brother and get a job soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for <UNK> and a woman name <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has taken his apartment knowing who he is she won't help him but he convinces her but is <UNK> at the airport by the cops after she <UNK> him out br br meantime the running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there <UNK> to kill damon <UNK> dawson the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture richards refuses to play <UNK> threatens to use his friends instead of him so he signs the contract you'll love that part but soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure <UNK> knows he'll be back the <UNK> begin to make there way through the <UNK> and fight characters that are memorable sub zero buzz saw and many others eventually richards is joined by <UNK> who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too together they find the underground and make there way back to <UNK> and give him a farewell send off br br the running man is another one of <UNK> great movies from the 80's the movie was apparently somewhat based on stephen king's book of the same name some have said that the book is better i'm sure it's not and i don't care anyway i loved the movie as in all of <UNK> films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from arnold and even <UNK> gets a couple in but without a doubt richard dawson is the standout in this film being a real game show host he easily <UNK> himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded the whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you keep an eye out for them <UNK> fun and some old shows hate boat among others also the cast was great besides arnold <UNK> and <UNK> don't forget professor <UNK> <UNK> jim brown <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> with all the reality tv nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now but i'm sure the hollywood <UNK> would make it into a movie about the evil bush the new dvd had mostly poor extras meet the <UNK> being the only <UNK> one some how the <UNK> managed to get some of there communism into the dvd and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an arnold movie of all things <UNK> overall for any arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80's on him you can't miss this its one of the first ones i saw back in the 80's and it's still great to this day the futuristic world and humor are great overall 10 out 10 stars definitely one of his best
<START> i'm really getting old am in the midst of watching this 40 year old flick and wonder what my <UNK> will be watching 40 years from now its an old saying but they don't make em like that anymore it's not only the story its the music the acting both by young and old the cast it would seem were born to play their roles young oliver old fagin too many to mention them all the role played by the judge oliver stands before i've seen in other roles over the years the <UNK> <UNK> ron moody as fagin mr and mrs <UNK> the movie not only won 5 oscars but took a few golden globe awards too if you decide to see this film do yourself a favor take a few if not all the children to see this masterpiece
<START> if you see this movie you know you will see an <UNK> video clip of popular music but you will find more incredible fx great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids if you compare this movie you have to remember is a pop <UNK> clips of man in the mirror leave me alone smooth criminal and <UNK> come together
<START> henry fool surprised me i didn't expect it to entertain and <UNK> as well or as strongly as it did fay grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid <UNK> to a story that seems not to need it once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie however it becomes <UNK> aware that this is one of the best sequels to brilliant indie film at least as good as ginger <UNK> back if not better br br i am a little disappointed that jeff <UNK> part is so small but i'm happy he is a part of this short run he is convincing and delightful as agent <UNK> also a delight is liam <UNK> who quite <UNK> portrays ned grim the son of fay and henry br br this movie is a pleasure for so many reasons i am pleased for example to discover that henry isn't really the loser he seems by the end of fool and to further discover that he is in fact a genius well that really is a lovely stroke of the pen br br i am hoping they do a third like the end of the trilogy it seems to be missing they should <UNK> it ned fool grim and it should be liam looking for his father to <UNK> the awesome change in his mother and the sense of near genius he himself feels <UNK> inside him assuming of course that fay continues <UNK> many of the most important facts from her son concerning his father it feels like it needs to be done i'd buy it br br even with more action this is still not an action flick it is more drama and intrigue a mystery of sorts i'll watch it often br br it rates an 8 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> the beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appeal br br one of the reasons that was so at least for me was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted with too little contrast it doesn't look good at least on vhs once in a while it breaks out and looks great but not often also the characters come and go too quickly for example i would have liked to have seen more of <UNK> dick when the film starts to drag however it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong br br overall just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last dozen years
<START> this film is not deserved of the next few minutes i will spend <UNK> it but i know many people like myself rely on imdb com to assist in deciding on films for that reason alone i am writing this br br live feed is like an asian version of <UNK> the incredible torture show aka blood sucking freaks http www imdb com title <UNK> torture <UNK> murder <UNK> sure it's all here along with a third grade script pathetic acting and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy br br the film takes place in china yet everyone speaks english there is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the <UNK> of dogs in a <UNK> yet are sexually excited about entering a porno <UNK> one gal who is disgusted by the filth in a <UNK> <UNK> moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film the film is absolutely awful even for a b movie even if you were to <UNK> it for free it would be an insult to your hard drive
<START> this movie is the only movie to feature a scene in which michael jackson <UNK> a tommy gun plain and simple br br this movie rocks because it is <UNK> hilarious it may be creepy to see <UNK> w little kids but this movie also stars wait for it br br joe <UNK> br br think about it joe <UNK> and <UNK> with tommy guns throwing <UNK> into <UNK> from 20 feet away whats not to like as stated before this movie rocks
<START> with its companion piece masters of horror nightmares and <UNK> can only be seen as the absolute <UNK> of the genre that began so <UNK> with the twilight zone and the outer limits br br of course part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a <UNK> adult audience instead aiming at ten year olds who are only able to count body <UNK> and <UNK> that and so <UNK> is king and king is <UNK> br br stephen king is simply illiterate  in general he has the <UNK> for storytelling of bart simpson since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the movies br br true the cinema is not such a bad place to start since it has generally escaped the <UNK> of realism but these films are only the <UNK> not the thing and if you want to write you have to dig deeper br br of course only <UNK> had monsters as close <UNK> but even so it should be clear to any <UNK> that vampires are not dracula and lugosi br br at least <UNK> room four is a clear indication of what is wrong one can almost imagine this pathetic <UNK> sitting as his desk trying to come up with something scary br br not mind you trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part making the stupid <UNK> but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew suppose you were <UNK> and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those <UNK> things wouldn't that be gross and that boys and girls is the story br br what about characterization oh yes he's one of these suits who never really appreciated life you know and now it's too late right and he's shouting  well they can't actually hear him you know  he's saying that he's going to sue the hospital but he's not such a big shot anymore you see lying there or is it laying i can never remember and all and he's thinking oh no please please don't cut me and this is terrible lying or laying like that  now wouldn't that be a great story you know i read somewhere that a snake bite can do that i think it was that great medical authority agatha christie what was the name of that snake again oh yeah a <UNK>  has quite a ring to it doesn't it br br let's make it a <UNK> <UNK> sure steve that's great  except that <UNK> is <UNK> you moron but how can you really tell that the target audience is children and not simply mental <UNK> it's easy there's no sex br br well there is but it's the kind <UNK> through a crack in the door to our <UNK> bedroom modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre the monster the female victim the chase br br but unlike universal and <UNK> they have no idea what's going on all that's really left is the <UNK> outside the <UNK> club and the fascist <UNK> that people with sexual <UNK> are <UNK> evil br br in spite of a certain <UNK> in size king kong knew exactly what to do with fay <UNK> freddy krueger can only kill her br br and since there's no real <UNK> in that he has to torture her first  not in any way that might <UNK> her you understand since that would upset our <UNK> sentiments and so horror and <UNK> become simply <UNK> and the <UNK> of <UNK> br br our hero you see is a rubber <UNK> and can only get a <UNK> if someone touches him you know down there with you know  rubber <UNK> giggle and that's what they use in <UNK> and that's how they discover that he is in fact you know br br obviously this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers too bad they cut it out since it might have upset the five year olds watching the show
<START> the only explanation i can <UNK> as to why this film isn't widely distributed is because it hits too close to home for some this movie was a genuine happy surprise the satire is genius this film turns the lights on in the dark that is organized religion and big media and the <UNK> <UNK> for cover rent the dvd and watch it for yourself if you haven't yet this film succeeds where many have failed dogma comes to mind to poke it's nose under the <UNK> both by using humor and very clever <UNK> coupled with telling backdrops and locations can't comment in depth without revealing some significant spoilers there are some surprises in this film which even the seasoned film buff will be caught off guard by
<START> for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart this is one of his lesser films from later in his career and while it isn't a great film compared to many of his other pictures it isn't bad and is a decent time <UNK> but not much more br br kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her over time the cold and detached ms novak also begins to fall in love with stewart and apparently in the <UNK> rule book this is a definite no no br br the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches they are neither the baby <UNK> nor the all powerful variety most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street <UNK> and very oddly the witches all seem to be <UNK> who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing <UNK> and listening to crappy jazz considering what i think of jazz it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world br br anyway the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic but not something i would rush out to watch the acting is pretty good but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film in fact i almost scored the film a 6 it was really close
<START> this movie makes me want to throw up every time i see it if you take the first movie and reverse the plot ariel wants to leave the sea her daughter wants to go to the sea take the same characters and give them new animals and new names and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor possible you get the little mermaid 2 its basically a copy of the first movie with a <UNK> plot i'll take you through the horror of it step by step these are the people from the 1st movie first of all prince eric is still prince eric with about 3 lines in the whole movie ariel is uptight annoying and is not the <UNK> <UNK> spirit we saw in the 1st in fact she is the exact opposite sebastian is still sebastian only less cute less convincing as being <UNK> out and the jokes just aren't funny anymore <UNK> has about 2 lines he now has kids and he talks with a dumb <UNK> voice <UNK> is still dumb <UNK> only not funny king <UNK> character is probably the best he still <UNK> the <UNK> and love for his daughter melody ariel and prince eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter br br like i said all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them this is what they did ursula the new evil villain is morgana <UNK> sister who feels like she always lived in <UNK> shadow i wouldn't be scared of her if she showed up at my <UNK> with a knife she can't do anything right and she's a failure as a villain she has the same voice ursula did sebastian <UNK> have been replaced by probably the most stupid <UNK> tip dash a <UNK> and a penguin they try to be hero's but always fail when trying the plot is so predictable they become heroes at the end yawn <UNK> <UNK> now replaced by a shark who was turned about <UNK> smaller by <UNK> hes really bad too morgana and the shark <UNK> i think was his name have no chemistry good or bad ariel ah ariel our lovely mermaid was replaced by her un lovely daughter melody melody cannot sing her voice is about 2 <UNK> higher than it should be and you want to punch her in the face because <UNK> so fake <UNK> sweet she wants to go to the sea she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her she has to go find herself yawn br br not only is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is certain parts of the movie make you want to call disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful original br br basically comparing the little mermaid 2 to the little mermaid is like comparing and ed wood movie to casablanca don't ever watch this not even when your bored
<START> given the chance to write direct and star in my own movie i would probably choose something about robot women with guns anthony hopkins however decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen <UNK> is a movie that is so strange that even david lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say <UNK> going on ' br br this is a movie where in one scene a man crosses the road towards a yellow car facing to the right which suddenly changes into a pink car facing to the left this is a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing up walls this is a movie where a man starts talking about invasion of the <UNK> only for the actor of that particular movie to suddenly show up as himself and then disappear into thin air br br this is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight out of the window and use fifteen different edits whilst doing so as well as changing from black and white to colour for seemingly no reason at all br br i must however <UNK> mr hopkins for his choice of actors in this movie some of whom portray multiple characters all of those involved throw themselves into their roles even if they probably have no idea what they're actually doing my favourite here was christian <UNK> thug in a hat who was <UNK> menacing whilst <UNK> nonsense and singing the american national <UNK> br br anthony hopkins has been <UNK> saying that he did this movie as a joke and that's possibly the best way to sum up <UNK> it's a joke on the audience you'll watch it from beginning to end trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come only to discover that the answer never actually does what the punchline to this particular joke is only anthony hopkins will ever know br br i mentioned david lynch earlier and i'm a big fan of that particular director i would guess that anthony hopkins shares my love for the likes of twin peaks blue <UNK> and lost highway however <UNK> isn't as satisfying as any of the movies of lynch despite imitating many of his techniques although i was surprised to discover that nobody talks backwards in <UNK> it's far too chaotic and random as another reviewer here pointed out it's the movie version of <UNK> disease no doubt there are a small number out there who are able to watch this and draw something from it unfortunately for the rest of us <UNK> quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience that was only made due to <UNK> involvement br br watch at your own risk
<START> these things have been floating around in my head for damn near 10 years now some pieces of this work were really memorable id love to see another more current example of cg <UNK> <UNK> stuff actually i'd love to be part of it br br if i'd would of had the chance to just say what i wanted and thats it i wouldn't have to write all this extra in order to make 10 lines if text as this website requires i mean really this almost <UNK> me i mean luckily for the guys that made the movie i really liked the minds eye and it took me 3 times to have enough lines i hope you don't get me on the <UNK> <UNK> you did
<START> if you are viewing this show for the first time you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality colorful and imaginative characters entertaining dialogue plots that seem to have some depth to them even creating <UNK> of suspense and drama at times i mean this is a <UNK> children's show right this is the same <UNK> that has brought kids such <UNK> as pokemon pepper ann mighty <UNK> power rangers and <UNK> troopers please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese <UNK> courtesy of the fox network and <UNK> entertainment don't worry you are just <UNK> some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980's and early 1990's some examples of this period would be transformers garfield and friends captain power and c o p s a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox besides these prime examples disney also returned to <UNK> programs for kids coming up with a <UNK> called the disney afternoon aside from a <UNK> down show called the <UNK> bears early shows like <UNK> duck duck tales and chip <UNK> <UNK> rescue rangers gave <UNK> to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like the little mermaid beauty and the beast the <UNK> down under and the great mouse detective but above all these wonders shines <UNK> the premiere of <UNK> and lightning was a two hour thrill ride and won an emmy much to my delight the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere br br while i enjoy the plots and dialogue i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters there's rebecca cunningham an independent female but still <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> full of pre teen angst and optimism <UNK> with his loyalty and support frank <UNK> the most entertaining engineer since <UNK> on the original star trek molly cunningham cute and witty but with some depth that most child characters don't have and of course in the middle of it all there's <UNK> whom i would describe as a <UNK> version of james bond this is because whenever there's trouble <UNK> saves the day with the assistance of his <UNK> than most <UNK> of all sea duck read james <UNK> <UNK> martin of course every great show has to have great villains and <UNK> doesn't disappoint here either from the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the vain and always failing air pirate don <UNK> to the hilarious and inept soviet <UNK> <UNK> the animation is good the music appropriate and the episodes are for me the finest that children's programming has ever had to offer great fun for the whole family
