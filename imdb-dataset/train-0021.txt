<START> i'm intrigued by the strong sense of favour towards or sympathy for sinatra in the other reviews here i've read elsewhere that sinatra never seems to have forgiven anyone for not being cast as sky masterson br br ok so who wouldn't want to be cast as sky masterson  it's a great part the charismatic successful <UNK> who makes a grave mistake when he allows himself to be <UNK> into a bet in which he must take salvation army <UNK> sarah brown on a date to cuba or lose it's not the money  it's the pride but he and she meet their match meanwhile nathan detroit must <UNK> his long suffering fiancée <UNK> with trying to find a spot for a <UNK> game which will make him rich if it doesn't alienate his fiancée forever first br br the film started life as a series of short stories by damon <UNK> that's his unique dialogue you hear and those are his great character names and that's his horse racing nightclub late night gambling world then it became a musical and you can't help but feel that in film form it never really left the stage the camera is unusually static and the sets remarkably  and not <UNK>  flat and <UNK> fortunately the music is so great i don't care that much br br my absolute favourite thing about this film though is the singing and acting of the two non singers brando as sky and jean simmons as <UNK> sarah brown of course putting pro singers into these roles would have produced better music but what surely gets forgotten is that two such excellent actors brought something else to the party instead what they lacked in vocal talent they more than made up for in gusto acting ability and pathos pathos pathos you're with sky as he <UNK> with sarah against reason <UNK> <UNK> and safety you enjoy <UNK> <UNK> up under the influence of cuban milk you feel completely the <UNK> and passion of their scene in the <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and an hour to go before the plane takes them home as sky rightly says it's chemistry pro singers  be they broadway <UNK> or smooth <UNK>  can't necessarily be relied on to make this happen and they certainly didn't i read somewhere that brando <UNK> sinatra for not putting all of himself into his role of nathan detroit sinatra in turn was <UNK> by <UNK> four take acting method as a brando fan does it show i'm bound to take the other side but i can't imagine that this film would have been the much <UNK> classic it is today if brando and simmons hadn't been in it with their wonderful chemistry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> face all pink <UNK> and brown hair drunk and ashamed in a cuban bar beautiful i'll always want a copy of this film lying around in case i need to feel good again you'll forgive me if give some of the nathan sleep talking parts the 100 brush off though won't you you won't oh be quiet and have some more of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i was a huge fan of the original cartoon series and was looking forward to finally seeing gadget on the big screen but i never in my <UNK> dreams expected something so extremely extremely terrible the pace was way too fast there was no plot and <UNK> ' what the hell is that it was <UNK> '
<START> i went into this film expecting it to be similar to the matrix or <UNK> boy was i wrong yes there is a poorly written poorly acted plot in the movie with cg animated cells and <UNK> to boot however the real focus of the film are the expert talking heads <UNK> out new age feel good <UNK> in between plot segments br br sure it stars off <UNK> enough there is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning it states for example that <UNK> exist as both <UNK> and wave and that an <UNK> is mostly empty space however the movie takes a giant and <UNK> leap saying that sub atomic quantum effects happen on large <UNK> as well the talking heads take it even further according to them the following are true br br when <UNK> arrived in the <UNK> the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were incapable of <UNK> something so different <UNK> can <UNK> the murder rate with positive thought you can walk on water your thoughts can change the <UNK> of ice <UNK> in <UNK> of water br br and hey that's only in the first 40 minutes br br watching the movie was torture this film felt like a movie they would show you to get you to join a cult after doing my <UNK> i realized that it basically is just that br br on the other hand this could be seen as a campy comedy albeit one that's not funny br br save your time and money don't see this movie
<START> all the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character jim being either a bad father a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish how can that be funny of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed but <UNK> character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner br br and why it that my guess is that it's because he should now better <UNK> not a stupid guy he can take care of things and he's got the opportunities to do so but he chooses not to it's a conscious choice he makes when he chooses to not play with his kids not go shopping because he doesn't want to buy lady products and it's a choice he makes when he puts down his relatives br br the other characters seems to only be in the series so jim can have someone to be a jerk to if the <UNK> character was a real person she would have left him years ago and not stay with the <UNK> for 8 years but alas she's just a <UNK> for <UNK> quirky middle class extreme <UNK>
<START> strange yet emotionally disturbing <UNK> about fed up middle aged man william h macy who finally decides to leave the family business murder for hire run by his quietly over demanding father donald sutherland while seeing a shrink john ritter and <UNK> with another patient <UNK> campbell br br talk about a major dilemma but panic is a top notch thriller that looks like american beauty meets the professional macy and sutherland are the stand outs here remarkable debut for first time writer director henry <UNK> i'm surprised that this movie didn't get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a terrific dutch thriller based on the book written by tim <UNK> another of his books <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called <UNK> 'the <UNK> in 1988 this one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the american remake also called 'the <UNK> but there are times it comes close br br especially the opening moments are terrific we see a man later we learn his name is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> van <UNK> coming from a plane in thailand when he picks up his <UNK> it is pretty clear that he is <UNK> something across the border these scenes are perfectly directed photographed and acted a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this later we see how <UNK> makes his deal in thailand with a woman both stating that they have never done anything like this br br from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash forward we see how <UNK> still as a child here played by <UNK> van der <UNK> befriends a guy named <UNK> as a kid played by <UNK> <UNK> we learn how they grew up as friends sort of and how <UNK> as an adult played by marcel <UNK> became a criminal <UNK> in the meanwhile goes to college and <UNK> with a woman around this time he sometimes meets <UNK> but does not really want anything to do with him br br the movie is <UNK> in a way it shows <UNK> and <UNK> as kids than as students young adults and in their mid thirties but from time to time like i said the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults br br minor spoilers <UNK> br br the title means 'the <UNK> and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending although it is in fact not that happy like the beginning the ending is terrific the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it <UNK> our attention of the first scenes only to come back at that point in the end it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well
<START> james gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he take a role in this piece of unfunny rubbish affleck is just a lightweight who just can't cut it the rest of the cast are truly unforgettable i saw this in the usa in an empty theatre i soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes i walked out before the end it was so bad so imagine my surprise when back in england i saw the movie had a glowing report from that <UNK> paul ross in one of the down market <UNK> i always rely on ross to save me money on cinema tickets if he says the movie is good i get straight on this very website to check it out this movie should have gone straight to <UNK> 99 dvd in a supermarket near you
<START> my brother tom br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format <UNK> digital br br following an episode of sexual abuse at the hands of a trusted neighbor young jessica jenna harrison forms a relationship with a strange boy ben <UNK> she meets in the woods unfortunately <UNK> has secrets of his own no less <UNK> and far more dangerous br br <UNK> drama <UNK> by brave performances by harrison and <UNK> in which two <UNK> spirits <UNK> themselves in a mutual love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately their friendship <UNK> as harsh reality begins to <UNK> leading to an inevitable tragedy directed by dom <UNK> and photographed in digital video format the movie looks <UNK> in places too many awkward close ups and sloppy hand held camera moves and takes a while to find its feet but the dramatic pay off is quietly rewarding
<START> <UNK> folks br br well this movie sucks really think love actually in reverse nothing fits quite right nothing is coherent and certainly nothing makes you laugh love is rare in this film br br it is a total flop as <UNK> however there are three redeeming points about this <UNK> potential of a film br br a with a star billing of jennifer love <UNK> there will be <UNK> of guys who will submit with grace to viewing this just to catch a glimpse of the <UNK> <UNK> with form fitting clothing to tell you now guys there are some promising scenes but it's really weak eye candy the possibilities here are watered down nevertheless i watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene of you know what <UNK> br br b the ending is romantic and positive that it's contrary and over the top is relevant yet for me was still a positive point br br c <UNK> scott plays an <UNK> friendly guy refreshing thank you br br 2 5 not worthy of your 10 or so dollars br br 2 <UNK> of the way through i was convinced jennifer love <UNK> was becoming the next <UNK> legend although i'll take that back for now it <UNK> greatly on her next film br br oh and her sister is way stupid her husband is way stupid and what the heck she's way stupid br br next time can't wait for the next love actually with <UNK>
<START> is nothing else on tv are you really bored well then watch <UNK> beach however don't rent it and definitely do not buy it that would be a big mistake br br i watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard however there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at if you are looking for an extremely funny hood movie then watch friday if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie something that this movie tries at kind of watch something like <UNK> dreams or <UNK> <UNK> if you are <UNK> for some good black <UNK> go watch a <UNK> <UNK> porn flick because the nudity in this movie is nearly non existent however if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable go ahead and watch it you will be slightly amused br br 3 out of 10
<START> i found this movie to be very good in all areas the acting was brilliant from all characters especially ms stone and <UNK> <UNK> character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute the plot is interesting even though this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious thriller like masterpiece go see this film now it deserves better than what it got from the audience which was <UNK> by some <UNK> terrible reviews about the movie before it even started you won't regret it if you go see it
<START> ok well i found this movie in my <UNK> old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover but the movie actually sucked ok the first story with the <UNK> was pretty good but it took a while to get into then the one with the boy was completely retarded it wasn't even scary his dream sounds like a little kid's <UNK> story then the news girls one was completely retarded too i'm sure <UNK> going to call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you but that one ended cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on t v and he said all that junk to her next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead people <UNK> its so stupid i'm not even going to say any more about it the last one was the best it wasn't that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cool uh yeah the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something then when they're all done telling their dreams to each other the losers get on the bus to hell <UNK> and they see all the people from their dreams on the bus ha the end
<START> this is a really heart warming family movie it has absolutely brilliant animal training and acting if you can call it like that as well just think about the dog in how the grinch stole christmas it was plain bad training the paulie story is extremely well done well <UNK> and in general the characters are really <UNK> too not more to say except that this is a great movie br br my ratings story 8 5 10 acting 7 5 10 animals fx 8 5 10 cinematography 8 10 br br my overall rating 8 10 big family movie and very worth watching
<START> dr <UNK> how the grinch stole christmas 2000 out of four br br if you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your <UNK> spirits and continue the traditional dr seuss classic fable don't see dr <UNK> how the grinch stole christmas if you are old enough to read this review then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture it contains lots of colors creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction <UNK> load noises and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village <UNK> unfortunately that is where the movie's positive elements end the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for jim carrey to <UNK> on screen while giving a <UNK> grin all while <UNK> through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do br br many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole christmas from <UNK> so i will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read however i will say that the movie's story is executed in three major acts the development of the grinch and setting the <UNK> festival and the dr seuss vision of the mean one robbing the who's from their christmas there are many familiar names within the credits here but no familiar faces like in battlefield earth i just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities <UNK> by <UNK> makeup and costumes regardless there is <UNK> molly shannon as betty lou the wife of bill irwin the later playing lou lou the father of little cindy lou played by taylor <UNK> jeffrey <UNK> is the <UNK> mayor anthony hopkins lends his <UNK> voice for the film's narrator and christine <UNK> is the <UNK> lone lost lover br br the filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little cindy lou the screenplay by jeffrey price and peter s <UNK> just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape there is little if any focus by director ron howard and the screenplay is predictable too extensive and contrived the only character given any <UNK> here is the grinch himself all of the other characters are puppets of the plot <UNK> and uninteresting and the dialogue is <UNK> and too corny to be anything but pathetic example grinch oh the who <UNK> br br the movie's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer michael <UNK> the costume designer rita <UNK> and the ample makeup department how the grinch stole christmas is a very good looking production the sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream the people of <UNK> are <UNK> with makeup to the point in which we cannot tell the actor <UNK> the <UNK> lines although dazzling i really can't give credit to the performances for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place br br jim carrey is one actor who i can talk about his performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself he is way too <UNK> as the grinch too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of seuss surprisingly although there are a few funny moments due to a few <UNK> clever sequences no laughs come from jim <UNK> zany silliness it is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for carry to <UNK> his part this factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy which is only a pale shadow of the original christmas classic how the grinch stole christmas br br after this movie historians should check the coffin of the late author dr seuss may have rolled over in his grave br br
<START> a good korean film about not just <UNK> but what its takes to be good like a thugs way of fighting cannot beat a <UNK> guy in his sport because there are rules just as there are to life and school and this film has undertones of this notion br br the martial arts in the film isn't that good but it is passable and enjoyable friends who go on to achieve something they once would mock become stronger through the mind and heart this film isn't meant to be taken too seriously as it does have slapstick but it also carries a message br br a good film again from korea
<START> i haven't really seen too many of the columbo films actually i think i've only watched one or two apart from this one i've always liked columbo though somehow without even having seen that much of him peter falk is and has always been the perfect choice for the character because of his looks his voice and his charm the perfect proof of this is that though the series started all the way back in 1968 the latest and probably not last of the films was made in 2003 that's 35 years and falk was 40 back when he made the first one the series consists of <UNK> films unless my count is off all of which are made for tv everyone knows the character even though no one has ever seen a film featuring him in the cinema that is quite an accomplishment if you ask me the plot is pretty good the only problem i have with it is that the killer and murder is revealed at the very beginning though that may be the same for all of the columbo films leaving no mystery but how columbo <UNK> it making it somewhat dull since there's not much to look forward to at the end of the film the pacing is good there's hardly a scene where you're bored the acting is very good particularly that of falk and ruth gordon they have some great <UNK> of dialog in the film the characters are well written and credible the dialog and script is unusually good for a tv movie all in all the film is yes surprisingly good for a tv movie and definitely worth watching for any fan of columbo and or crime mystery flicks 8 10
<START> what can i say i think i have to write spoiler alert and then reveal they used the f word a lot in this movie like in every two sentences i did not like this movie at all too much hints on sexual <UNK> <UNK> and cheating and that swearing was totally out the window i gave this movie 3 and two of those points are for mira <UNK> sexy movements on the dance floor
<START> tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did it is as if he has <UNK> a dirty and worn out <UNK> full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years no grant character <UNK> no hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic the balance in speed in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly <UNK> this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied the fact that this film is about nothing merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked <UNK> a party of one of the characters makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining it is brilliant because it is empty in between the lines it is happening to see or not to see that's the
<START> father of the pride is a pleasant surprise it is funny witty and features some great voice acting the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of <UNK> roy shows indeed all of them are stereotypes but that's what makes them so funny <UNK> is not a kiddie cartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way it is full of <UNK> references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed i'd say i'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original i've seen most of those stereotypes many times before even in that particular order
<START> two years passed and mostly everyone looks different some for good and some for worse i still enjoyed as much as i did the original though br br some flaws they had though like changing the joker he now has no red lips and looks like more <UNK> hair and black <UNK> hes still voiced by mark <UNK> which is a plus i guess they made poison <UNK> more white <UNK> that she is becoming more like a plant and <UNK> looks much different and not as attractive as she was in the original br br though costumes like batman <UNK> killer croc and scarecrow look <UNK> especially scarecrow br br the show isn't as dark as the original because batman doesn't work as alone as he used to most of the time working with <UNK> and the new robin tim drake while <UNK> dick grayson comes to the rescue often batman gave up the yellow <UNK> and with the black wing on his suit and seems like he got a bit bigger but still kicking tons of ass br br the show isn't as good as the original mostly because of some of the <UNK> characters but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite over the edge might be one of the greatest batman episodes ever so make sure you check that out br br overall 8 9 10
<START> this movie is really bad the acting is plain awful except michael <UNK> i don't get the story richard <UNK> is the only survivor after a fight between two <UNK> gangs he comes to a town and suddenly he is <UNK> to fight against the bad people who wants indian land at the cover it said he was a indian himself that returned too his home town i didn't hear that in the movie if so it wasn't clear br br richard <UNK> was one hell of a bad actor stiff and ugly he said his lines like it too and we wouldn't talk about sean young she <UNK> been any of my favourite actors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with <UNK> <UNK> she is awful br br when i rented it i <UNK> between this and <UNK> with amanda pays i <UNK> this one because of michael <UNK> was in the cast maybe i should have taken <UNK> br br don't see this unless you think richard <UNK> looks tough on a <UNK> with <UNK> br br i will soon <UNK> the cast list because i have it at home i wrote it down after i seen the movie
<START> i loved this movie great storyline and actors and good movie sets it told the story in a way i can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack i can not find it anywhere please email me if you know where i could get the soundtrack other than not being able to find the soundtrack i thought the movie was fascinating <UNK> did a great job i think this is some of his best work his past movies were ok but this one really told a story for a change this will go down in history as being one of the best tv films ever aired <UNK> to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work
<START> i couldn't keep from commenting after reading the very short not bad commentary this movie is much better than just not bad the acting is stellar even from the children in the cast who don't play cute or anything else but act just like my son's friends the movie is smart and expects it's audience to be as well the double back flash story lines are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than act as time filler i watched this movie with my kids and then i watched it again by myself a few days later if you have kids and are sick to death of movies that inspire a <UNK> coma with their <UNK> <UNK> then check out holes my 6 year old enjoyed it as much as my 11 year old and my husband and i enjoyed it as much as the two of them how many movies can you say that about
<START> dangerous <UNK> is the story of a seemingly anti social girl and how she got that way it's based on a true story and though i was irritated by the one note depiction i e ever <UNK> of the title character and the hard to believe dedication of her lawyer i'm forced to accept that life does imitate art and that there are people out there like that br br the movie succeeds for me because although there's little <UNK> of the title character's <UNK> until almost the end one is gradually moved to sympathy for her as the movie shows how she got to her present state which proves to be self destructive rather than anti social br br truly a moving movie which will bring a <UNK> to your throat when you think on it which will be often br br despite its many flaws including that it's hard to watch sometimes because of <UNK> functions and suicide attempts this is another production that i'm proud to call canadian
<START> very disappointing film by the end i no longer cared for any of the characters i did enjoy seeing <UNK> <UNK> in a very small part and william macy was good as always still not worth watching it starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker <UNK> will like it as i am sure it will put them to sleep
<START> this is the fifth von trier film i have seen i believe that he is the only director to whom i have given such a high score on all his movies four of them the element of crime europa breaking the waves and dancer in the dark i have given a 10 and one the idiots i have given a 9 and i have been <UNK> whether to give it a 10 since i first saw it although i'd like to see it once more before i do he has been <UNK> for calling himself one of the best working directors i tend to agree with him i cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films in 50 years when von trier <UNK> he will be looked upon as the pre <UNK> film artist from europe perhaps from the planet and there will be classes taught in his name he simply is the bergman or fellini of our time it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this br br about europa itself i'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong i think that's the point this film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the <UNK> at some level this is absolutely clear from the framing of the film max von <UNK> narration we are <UNK> or von trier is <UNK> and this is our his <UNK> mind i'm inclined to lean more towards his mind since the <UNK> of europe concerns me an american very little this framing is also clear if you have seen the element of crime an even more brilliant film than this although i am <UNK> that in my mind what europa needs more than anything is a proper release on dvd hopefully <UNK> again with theatrical aspect ratio and <UNK> sound and picture then i am fairly sure this film would seem as great as any of von <UNK> other films in the element of crime the film begins with a <UNK> whom we actually see on screen this time is <UNK> fisher a european detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish the first words of that film are fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track and whenever fisher the narrator gets off track the <UNK> does <UNK> him and tells him to get back on with the story he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line something along the lines of do you understand the difference between good and evil the <UNK> laughs and says now fisher she didn't really say that did she br br so the key to <UNK> europa almost a sequel of sorts to the element of crime is that we are deep in our von <UNK> <UNK> and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone what does the train itself <UNK> consider it <UNK> and only then discuss it <UNK> europa is a great film a masterpiece i was never bored by it even though i watched it at 3 am the perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic
<START> this was one of the first creepy movies i ever saw i was about 5 at the time it scared me good but that night i put chewing <UNK> in one eye to be like the monster and my mom got very upset she had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye <UNK> like double <UNK> now that's a movie hey for it's time it was a great movie that head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then and if your 5 it is very scary kids now a days are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing for your minds imagination your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects imo
<START> i happened to catch this film at a screening in brooklyn it's difficult to describe the plot it has a lot of wacky characters but let's just say i'd have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh the hardest i wouldn't know where to begin even the <UNK> roles are well written and well acted br br there are numerous small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable it has a few devices that pop up and add another hilarious <UNK> it is refreshing to watch not some recycled stuff i'd seen many times before if this film could reach a wider audience i'm certain it would be a real crowd <UNK> the story is so original and heartfelt br br there's a lot here to like funny back stories <UNK> and <UNK> which set up the final act and dramatic conclusion cross eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart it's a touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout definitely worth seeing
<START> i liked this movie a lot the animation was well done and the romance was cute i liked most of bryan <UNK> songs and the hans <UNK> score was excellent what a lot of people don't realize is how well it relates to the heart of darkness apocalypse now themes what happens when so called civilization <UNK> someone <UNK> home what does it mean to be <UNK> etc the opening scenery and music were very stirring the film is a <UNK> to an america that was once beautiful
<START> read on and take note you could save <UNK> minutes of your life was that all br br <UNK> bleak this film sets out to produce i'm guessing a modern small town american christmas fable in the <UNK> style if fails completely and absolutely fails i've been trying to think of one good thing about it and can't let me mention some of the highlights br br people don't die they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in <UNK> factory angels are actually ex <UNK> who sit in trees santa can bring people back from the dead if you send him a nice letter br br and the plot i won't spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isn't any even the photography is bleak snow shown at the end of a freeze everywhere looking cold <UNK> and miserable br br as you might guess the film has a happy <UNK> ending what a relief
<START> the movie was to be shown here in <UNK> with all the <UNK> and even in the theater it failed miserably br br apparently the story writer just don't hold water something was definitely missing in my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment br br the movie just lack any substance the only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story and a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time such as the meaning of sacrifice <UNK> etc it is called the central theme br br the movie fails to answer why would i watch it anyway br br at least some strange legendary flying elephants psychic king or the eccentric king such as the king and i would have been lovely something would have added greatly to the <UNK> appeal i guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie br br once you got the appeal then the story is the next thing we concentrate on in marketing terms we call it must see upon hearing the title of the movie people would say oh i must see it now where's the appeal in <UNK> why not just <UNK> the title and call it how not to be a king and make a black comedy of the old <UNK> days to the style of dr <UNK> that would have been much more interesting narrative like experiences of the <UNK> of the king from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny br br most movies today have that must see appeal such as <UNK> men x these titles speak for themselves if they don't have familiar characters some other movies such as the island had an appeal itself when the advertising asks do you still believe there is an island br br or for the movie <UNK> how not to be a king might ask the question so do you still want to be a king br br <UNK>
<START> erotic cinema of the 1970's was tame compared to the triple x <UNK> of today which is good because there is a good story around the naked <UNK> and sex scenes of course i wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods but it's worth watching the <UNK> version then the edited up version which is titled the devil's <UNK> but if you don't care for <UNK> of naked women dancing and having sex then this isn't the movie for you however i did enjoy it and i give it 7 stars
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen quite a few movies it is passed off as an art film but it is really a piece of trash it's one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing but that cannot make up for sally <UNK> <UNK> obvious tribute to herself the plot of this movie is nonexistent and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end especially where she starts singing it's absolutely unreal
<START> i saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release in a <UNK> empty theater believe it or not after decades of watching movies this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time or at least the worst that i would allow myself to watch br br the acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of drunken high school students <UNK> off the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less br br after the first shock of disbelief we laughed for a while as each scene hit new <UNK> but after a while even that dubious pleasure wore off and it just got to be really sad
<START> this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what <UNK> going on the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers commercials <UNK> one enters by mail and a host of other <UNK> besides what other movies have cameos by martin <UNK> king jr to <UNK> the film hunt down the director's book entitled i was curious it'll all become clear it's a grand and bold experiment in improvised <UNK> filmmaking a triumph now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color other than white the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible
<START> elmer <UNK> is laughing while <UNK> in his easy chair and reading his comic book his dog <UNK> nearby sleeping in front of the <UNK> all is peaceful until a flea comes <UNK> by the flea is dressed in a <UNK> type outfit with a big <UNK> and is carrying a <UNK> with the name a flea on it he gets out his <UNK> and spots the dog we see a big shot of the <UNK> butt and the flea <UNK> in excitement screaming t bone he then sings there's food around the corner there's food around the corner br br that sets up the storyline of this cute but obnoxious flea <UNK> the poor dog the <UNK> is hilarious as he <UNK> to the flea br br the drawings of his huge teeth <UNK> right next to the fleeing flea are clever and the <UNK> dialog made me laugh out loud a few times this might be the funniest <UNK> i have ever seen in a cartoon the poor <UNK> under a threat of having to take a bath as to not react when the stupid flea causes him pain it's almost painful to watch as the flea uses <UNK> <UNK> and the like on the dog he puts <UNK> in the <UNK> behind it's brutal
<START> this film can be judged from three <UNK> as history as a profile of <UNK> as a fictional thriller br br it fails as history it mentions in passing the coup that threw out <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> and has the <UNK> hi jack as background but not in any <UNK> consistent time frame br br as a profile of <UNK> it may have been interesting because forest <UNK> is incredibly good and if this was a better film he would get an oscar he got it which proves the oscar voters don't watch the films they vote on it ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel which observed <UNK> and the history of <UNK> from the point of view of the doctor it tells instead the <UNK> story of the <UNK> doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of <UNK> but the story told is the one incident that <UNK> was probably innocent of br br as a fictional thriller there is no plot to hold it together the beginning is taut it takes cinematic liberties with the novel but sets up the story the character of the doctor is well defined but becomes lost in the second half of the film which suffers as a result br br why the doctor decides to stay in <UNK> is badly explained <UNK> by power why he befriends no one is strange the character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the <UNK> has the affair instead of the black doctor a ludicrous <UNK> which does not seem even <UNK> believable but allows the writers of the film to show the <UNK> of <UNK> close at hand the man called horse bit at the end is <UNK> br br finally in 1971 <UNK> drove on the left not right the number <UNK> were three letters and two or three numbers and where are the <UNK> <UNK> br br in short if you've never heard of <UNK> you may want to spend two hours watching this film to appreciate forest <UNK> acting but the last hour will bore you to confusion if you know <UNK> or have read the book don't see the film it will only <UNK> you and if you want to know why the doctor was so <UNK> he wasn't
<START> i first saw this film when i was about 8 years old on tv in the uk where it was called <UNK> the flying island i absolutely loved it and was <UNK> when it was repeated a while later and i missed it i was enchanted by the story and characters but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw sometimes <UNK> referred to as the <UNK> dub the dub was actually by <UNK> themselves and only distributed by <UNK> which is sadly <UNK> except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box set br br unfortunately i feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the <UNK> dub or the original japanese had and i think james van der <UNK> sounds too old to play the lead they have made some pointless <UNK> such as changing the main character's name from <UNK> to <UNK> and added some dialogue but worst of all i feel that they have ruined many scenes with <UNK> music the opening scene of the <UNK> for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disney's moronic <UNK> that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking which i find annoying in many disney films br br this film still blows away most recent animated films and i cannot recommend it highly enough the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass market <UNK> animation
<START> this 1998 film was based on a script by the late edward d wood a script that featured no dialogue in the tradition of films such as the thief while much of <UNK> work was quirky low budget entries into various genre film traditions his first released feature <UNK> or glenda was a truly <UNK> attempt to express the <UNK> through primitive avant garde techniques i woke up early the day i died represents that side of ed wood the <UNK> although this film is a comedy a nightmarish comedy however while the cross dressing theme of <UNK> or glenda was taken so seriously by wood that there was not room for comedy there from the first few seconds of this film i knew that i was being taken to a new cinematic world and i can't really compare that world with anything else the technical side of the film production design sound design music <UNK> photography etc is groundbreaking on any number of levels in particular although the film has no dialogue there is sound of all kinds and also language but you'll have to see how it's done yourself as the <UNK> and surprise of the methods provides a level of excitement throughout the <UNK> or glenda <UNK> technique of <UNK> stock footage for surreal effects works well in the film and is kept to a minimum the whole film is played at a hysterical fever pitch and billy zane provides an amazing tour de force performance that shows what a brilliant physical comedian and actor he is in a just world he would have been given some award for this performance he even looks like ed wood and as played by zane this character is at various <UNK> sleazy tragic sympathetic and anonymous sometimes simultaneously what a shame that this film was caught up in legal troubles and never received a north american theatrical or video release only playing a few festivals right now it's only available on video in germany in fact my copy is from a german source the <UNK> from <UNK> screenplay that are shown on the screen from time to time are translated into german although the newspaper <UNK> that great low budget technique of giving plot elements especially those that would be too expensive to film via newspaper <UNK> is used here in the wood tradition that zane sees are in english i think that this film could have gotten a word of mouth following had it been played at midnight in some large cities with some careful promotion and if played off city by city <UNK> on the art film circuit it could have done well in fact if the legal issues can be resolved i'd like to suggest that the film should still be given a theatrical release especially a midnight cult release this is a classic waiting to be discovered br br did i understand every scene no but i felt every scene emotionally did everything work in the film perhaps not i've only seen it twice and the first time i saw it i was <UNK> a number of times however with all the <UNK> line junk playing the <UNK> and with so much alternative film being <UNK> or pretentious shot on video film school rejects we need actual hollywood made <UNK> like this the recent bob dylan film masked and anonymous took similar chances as did something like steven <UNK> full frontal this film could find an audience much larger than either of those if you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing see if it has ever been released on video you will not be bored invite some friends over make it a party play the amazing soundtrack loud i have a feeling that wherever he is in the <UNK> ed wood is happy with this film and feels as though his unique vision has been justified and <UNK> somewhat by the making of this film <UNK> probably also laughing that just like he always seemed to get the bad breaks in life the film made in tribute to him after his death is held up in <UNK> and sits <UNK> in the country of its making
<START> the mystery here is why this delightful small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves simply <UNK> the budding talent of audrey <UNK> should be enough to generate greater recognition from the <UNK> br br lacking in <UNK> and relying on quirky characterizations <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life <UNK> and unlike some of <UNK> more <UNK> acclaimed competition in the genre such as the taste of others it actually entertains
<START> i'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum and many of the reviews i think tony scott made a good movie here yes it is highly stylized flashy and over the top but it is very entertaining i'm glad at least ebert and <UNK> agrees with me br br this movie may not be for anyone but if you like over the top dark humor cool action and dialog you should see it br br i've previously seen scott's man on fire <UNK> tide and enemy of the state all good movies but i like this one more it's like a roller coaster ride with great soundtrack <UNK> visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be <UNK> it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity gory violence and have explicit dialog br br it doesn't hurt that <UNK> is super hot and even shows <UNK> in this one either
<START> i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself the cast just makes it that much more appealing meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture she nails mrs <UNK> mannerisms the accent and even look she shows the pain hurt surprise and anger that lindy had to endure and in the process it's hard to remember that it isn't lindy in my opinion this performance of <UNK> was better than her oscar winning turn in <UNK> choice and should have garnered her her third oscar sam <UNK> is perfect as michael chamberlain and for some surprising reason wasn't recognized by the academy with at least a nomination in all this movie only receive one oscar nod <UNK> for best actress however it did receive several australian oscars and nominations br br definitely a top rate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast
<START> 2003 was seen as the year of the matrix with the release of two sequels and a computer game that actually linked to the plot of the film also released was a dvd of 9 short animated films most written and made in japan and made as anime japan makes some of the best animation in the world sadly most of these shorts are disappointing the best of them is the first part of a prequel to the first matrix film br br the second renaissance is made as a historical file it tells how humans made machines in their own <UNK> humans live the high life whilst machines are the <UNK> the workers of society second class citizens in the year <UNK> a machine <UNK> <UNK> was put of trial for murder after killing his owners who wanted to <UNK> him the machine does not have a fair trial and <UNK> start around the world the <UNK> of the world order to <UNK> machines many machines leave human society and form their own country in the middle east <UNK> <UNK> has a <UNK> economy and easily <UNK> the human nations forcing them into economic crisis the human <UNK> <UNK> and reject the machines <UNK> for peace thereby it was the humans who were responsible for the war that <UNK> them br br the second renaissance is a interesting watch with excellent traditional animation style and sets a compelling world it shows how the machines were <UNK> and that humanity <UNK> the <UNK> of their own destruction there is a political and social world and the short tells a lot in it short running time the short shares themes and a style to the classic silent film metropolis partly the beginning with the underworld they are the themes of slavery the <UNK> of the working class and racism the short also has some religious themes and religious <UNK> mainly that men saw themselves as god and created the machines in their own <UNK> seeing themselves as the <UNK> masters of the machines the machines too use religious <UNK> mainly <UNK> their nation in <UNK> of human <UNK> and the machines coming to the united nations dressed as adam and eve offering an apple br br the animation style is beautiful done in the traditional anime style like <UNK> the set designs are great combine futuristic with historic cities e g washington d c there is well down future scene and surprising violence which is key to the film the director <UNK> <UNK> also directed the anime sequence in kill bill <UNK> 1 so has good <UNK> to hollywood he is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story going br br the only real complain is a continuity error to the first matrix film because <UNK> mentions that the humans have no historical records or know who started the war but its a good watch
<START> how unfortunate to have so many of my a list and good b list actors agree to do this movie but they did and that is what sucked me into watching it i had never heard of this movie but there was cuba gooding jr right on the dvd cover and james woods in the background how bad can it be in a word very this movie starts o k has some twists and turns then just lays an egg the ending was so weak it was as if the writer got called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the type writer and <UNK> out the ending how ironic a for a movie titled the end game to have such a poor one these are the types of movies that can move a list actors to the b list in hurry i hope cuba gooding jr and james woods don't make a habit of this
<START> all the folks who sit here and say that this movie's weak link is the ramones would probably say that <UNK> was ok if not for that irritating <UNK> rock and roll high school was centered around the ramones how anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of joey <UNK> eating bean <UNK> <UNK> in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet <UNK> square daddy o ms <UNK> exploding white mice the hall <UNK> instant classics <UNK> the riff <UNK> character br br if you don't like the ramones then you don't know rock and roll and you don't deserve to watch a movie called rock and roll high school
<START> back of beyond takes place at a dive diner gas station in the middle of the australian desert run by tom <UNK> paul <UNK> a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some <UNK> unexpectedly arrive we get what at first <UNK> seems like a flashback in which he and his sister though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film are <UNK> through the desert on his motorcycle afterwards he appears as a terribly quiet and sometimes moody character in the presence of the <UNK> br br we know one thing is for sure and that is <UNK> sort of spiritual sense his <UNK> of danger and such his <UNK> only slightly relevant to the story the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way of course tom falls for one of the thieves a young woman named charlie and suddenly it <UNK> all three already <UNK> allies against each other but not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action in fact the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant but really fails to do so even the ending of which plays out like a trite <UNK> tale and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws is almost just as ridiculous br br it may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pacing but are in the mood at least for something a little different than the usual
<START> an interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger a <UNK> and a <UNK> who saved a baby who was close to be killed by a group of <UNK> during the ice age the <UNK> of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end one of the <UNK> in the group got an order to finally capture the baby who was hardly saved by his mother when the <UNK> attacked her community the baby was then rescued by the <UNK> and the <UNK> but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby they went through very <UNK> paths with plenty of danger and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the <UNK> at the end the group of <UNK> tried to capture the baby but the <UNK> helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs
<START> i wish i could give this movie a zero cheesy effects and acting the only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is lets start with the kid who plays brian what a geek i couldn't believe the <UNK> then there was the talking to himself i guess they couldn't just have the movie be silent but still of course they had to have him skinny <UNK> too not something i wanted to see but jared gave a great performance compared to the special effects department everything from the bear to the crash was something i could do myself and better i seriously doubt that gary <UNK> had anything to do with the production seeing as the movie was not even called <UNK> finally i do not think the writer had ever read the book seeing as nothing was the same i think the book was great but this movie <UNK> like a <UNK> goat
<START> how can you sum up just exactly how <UNK> and right and touching this film is for several weeks this dvd <UNK> off the shelf at me every time i went in the store having seen steve <UNK> in a couple of films previously i didn't want to <UNK> my thought process of him so i <UNK> and <UNK> until finally i grabbed it up with a <UNK> the hell ' attitude and how surprised was i i just wish i had purchased it earlier having watched it three times in two days i am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters yearning for that which is missing since the passing of his beloved wife who thus meets an intriguing woman charming her in such a profound and interesting dare i say <UNK> way throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what he has been searching for br br the <UNK> of that woman being his brothers girl <UNK> matters which portray dan <UNK> shy and with a heartfelt <UNK> seeing his someone special bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brothers life you just really begin to feel for him br br then when the blind date occurs with <UNK> <UNK> that is the turning point in <UNK> <UNK> of dan the look she gives him when he repeats her comment about not liking <UNK> sheer green eyed monster <UNK> an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor this sequence is one of the most well crafted as dan starts to <UNK> up with regard to marie br br other gut wrenching scenes dan returns from the book and tackle shop confronted by his brothers begins to describe what has just occurred when <UNK> face drops it brings a sharp <UNK> of breath br br his youngest daughter <UNK> making the present celebrating their love for suzanne his late wife brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little <UNK> as dan realizes just what he has lost in life br br when dan plays guitar and sings at the talent show his voice cracking slightly as he <UNK> the song absolute gem br br the acceptance of what occurs late in the film by his daughters they all three love their father and want to see him happy will not let him deny his love for marie the <UNK> of dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock their <UNK> and tell him so much more than that with just a few words br br i could go on and on but i will leave it for now maybe return and add more comments here in the near future but i will end by saying br br if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good with twists of comedy to <UNK> up the drama that never feels forced or crass that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life not just with a woman but also with his extended family then look no further br br dan in real life 9 out of 10 for such a well rendered cinematic experience with a score by <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> takes you there throughout whilst never being <UNK> with fine performances by the ensemble cast i cannot wait to re watch this again
<START> yes definitely better than my viewing of death tunnel actually some of the deaths were pretty original and the gore was decent it was kind of like wrong turn meets the hills have eyes br br but 1 when the kids high school or college are discussing horror movies in the kitchen everything <UNK> says is almost an exact quote from scream 1996 the thing about the big <UNK> girls etc br br 2 was steve not a <UNK> randy from scream 3 besides the fact that it took place in october what the hell did the movie have to do with <UNK> pretty unnecessary if you ask me i find it humorous when i see those horror movies from the 80's that explain away loose ends by pointing the fingers at the <UNK> or a <UNK> br br 4 wow they made a sam <UNK> reference 5 why was gary and his sister in the movie they're characters had nothing to do with anything and hes so psychic that he couldn't even see his own death 6 when gary was being killed in the bathroom at that point the deaths became simply troma <UNK> how could she hear the screams when she was <UNK> but not hear them when she was standing outside the door 7 <UNK> sister commented on <UNK> thats primarily a scottish dish not irish br br 8 so the lesson is if you are like <UNK> and don't have any fun or crack a smile through the whole film you'll be the one to live 9 the mutants were pretty cool but they looked like walking <UNK> of <UNK> con <UNK> br br 10 when they brought in <UNK> sister did they forget that steve had been <UNK> there and wonder where he went 11 was there not more than one killer <UNK> beat that one but never encountered any more of them br br 12 what was with the flashbacks to those other people half of them <UNK> didn't know if they were dead or alive so what was with that 13 why didn't they kill gary and his sister before 14 why did no one ever call the police and apparently everybody knew those people lived in the woods why did they never <UNK> some kind of raid 15 as far as i know they were not zombies or vampires so how could she turn into one at the end i'm with everyone else on the giant huh at the end br br way better than death tunnel but still quite sloppy i still don't understand why they even placed it in ireland considering <UNK> had close to nothing to do with the plot
<START> a beautiful <UNK> of new york the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear it never did my teenagers liked it too my son for natasha <UNK> and my daughter for michael <UNK> my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done the ending came with a twist which we all liked too if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch
<START> my discovery of the cinema of jan <UNK> opened my eyes to a whole tradition of czech animation of which <UNK> <UNK> was a <UNK> his <UNK> is one of the finest most technically impressive animated movies i've ever seen br br a potter wakes up and waters his plant then he goes about making a pot but in comes the huge hand which crashes the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of itself he casts the hand out but soon it returns and <UNK> him in a bird cage where he's forced to <UNK> a stone hand he sets about it <UNK> from <UNK> but eventually <UNK> the task br br in a marvellous sequence of <UNK> the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings which keep him in <UNK> and he escapes back home he <UNK> himself in and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head br br this movie doesn't hide the fact it's pure animation unlike modern movies that <UNK> to be realistic why the hand for instance is clearly someone's hand in a <UNK> everything else is clay strings are visible and are part of the narrative making it a <UNK> of the movie strings the atmosphere is eerie that hand going after the little potter managed to <UNK> more dread in me than many horror movies combined br br the movie is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity it's a fable about artistic freedom and <UNK> which can't help winning the heart and mind of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right
<START> this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast a gripping story with a chilling ending great music and excellent visuals without significant special effects it is interesting to note though that like so much science fiction its <UNK> for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted that's not to say we're out of the woods yet but <UNK> is now obviously too soon to be in this condition it shares this failing with a fairly <UNK> list of science fiction classics 1984 2001 a space odyssey compare its space station with our international space station and <UNK> <UNK> i robot <UNK> brains were to have been invented in the 1990's
<START> this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s jack pearl <UNK> baron <UNK> as well as jimmy <UNK> however 7 1 2 decades later it's being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful <UNK> may oliver as well as <UNK> <UNK> br br as for the stooges this is a film from there very early days before mgm had any idea what to do with the team at this point they were known as ted <UNK> and his stooges as <UNK> was the front man fortunately for the stooges they soon left this nasty and rather <UNK> man read up on him you'll see what i mean and the rest is history within a year they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team this sort of thing was a common <UNK> at mgm a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of buster keaton laurel and hardy <UNK> and <UNK> and others in fact up until they left for columbia mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film roles including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady and oddly in this film they didn't act as a team they just did various supporting roles such as larry playing the piano br br this particular film begins with pearl and <UNK> lost in the african jungle when they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show <UNK> by scenes with the leads here and there as for pearl i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films as he has the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome as for <UNK> i never knew what the public saw in him as least as far as his films are concerned he was loud and loud he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton's career to make this film together pearl and <UNK> rely on lots of verbal humor and vaudeville style routines that tend to fall rather flat br br in this film the stooges they didn't yet have the right chemistry seeing <UNK> doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd what they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though die hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life long goal of seeing everything <UNK> even the rotten joe <UNK> and joe <UNK> films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of <UNK> and curly br br overall the film is rather dull and disappointing however there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess at about the 13 minute mark you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing look carefully as this is walter brennan in a role you'd certainly never expect another unusual thing to look for in the film is the clean as a <UNK> song starting at about 22 minutes into the film this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so called pre code scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the production code was <UNK> despite the word clean in the title it's a very <UNK> number with naked women showing lots of flesh enough to <UNK> but not enough to really show anything it's quite shocking when seen today though such <UNK> were pretty common in the early 1930s finally at the <UNK> minute mark see jimmy <UNK> set race relations back a few decades see the film you'll see that i mean
<START> <UNK> in da hood looking for revenge and <UNK> <UNK> except da hood is a wild west town in the late <UNK> i do not remember any westerns like this when i was growing up what would randolph scott say if he saw <UNK> kim he might say alright i have to admit that i tuned into this just to see her bare <UNK> and low cut <UNK> are not the <UNK> of the usual cowboy flick but these are the <UNK> and they are fine br br now don't go looking for any major story here and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting and <UNK> the last time you heard john wayne call someone <UNK> and i don't remember the <UNK> brothers <UNK> and kissing before they <UNK> to the ok <UNK> br br i watch this on bet so i missed the action that got it an r rating but i doubt if i will buy the dvd to see it unless i can be assured it was <UNK> kim in that action
<START> flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made br br this flick exposes all the clichés and then some excruciatingly bad downs syndrome actors terribly heavy self important dialog scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat jarring editing pointless plot points all wrapped up in a kind of <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> for the audience and vague <UNK> drivel br br it achieves exactly what it was designed to a hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust <UNK> to show to their parents when they ask them what they've been doing for the last two years after what is it received its cannes award <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof in part of his own films he supposedly blew up at the info to this day he refuses to discuss the incident br br anyway see it and laugh this will be a classic of humor for many years to come
<START> before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon <UNK> fan in fact thats what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so much br br but this isn't half as good not even jon could save this film for me my main problem would be that it simply isn't scary apart from <UNK> character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn't care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire drug addict woman the female vampire simply isn't scary or sexy rather she looks like an <UNK> 14 year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then another huge problem is that everything is just too bright there is no atmosphere or sense of dread i know the first vampires being set in new mexico wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be this film has no tension like that br br the story is basically the same as before vampire wants <UNK> cross to be able to walk in daylight however the story has less cool bits this time there is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master the original vampire as in the first film you really don't care who or what this one is there is no army of masters instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a <UNK> attraction then a creepy temple br br so there you have it really lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story a real let down for me personally
<START> i have read the short story by norman <UNK> and the movie did justice to norman <UNK> writing my husband tends to <UNK> it occasionally and i myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind we have videos of many of redford <UNK> movies and we have watched a river runs through it many times redford is part of the <UNK> as he is always around we never get tired of <UNK> perception of norman <UNK> <UNK> and the beauty of montana the script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as mr <UNK> father according to a river runs through it <UNK> are <UNK> who can read a line which by the way is not in the short story but i think that is a funny line my husband and i are well read <UNK> br br i have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow i disagree as one search for inner peace this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three four rhythm of the <UNK> the photography is outstanding the acting is great i love the scene where norman and paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer then as adult paul played by brad pitt <UNK> is the perfect guy who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it the same applies to <UNK> burns who uses worms as bait he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help the scene where paul refuses to eat <UNK> and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace finally after hours they all <UNK> around the table to say grace and they all leave but the <UNK> stayed on the plate that scene where the two love birds and their <UNK> on their <UNK> that is funny the <UNK> the drive back home where jessie burns emily lloyd decides to go via the train line beautiful dialogue when norman <UNK> to jessie because he wants her to come to chicago with him br br redford himself does a superb job as a narrator i could not stop myself from comparing brad to the young redford <UNK> in the park the nominated director producer actor is a <UNK> who deserves to be praised for his <UNK> not only in the cinema in the us but around the world i am glad to live in <UNK> hundred because i have seen the beginning of the black and white television the movies and all the technology and special effects to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as redford because i have had the chance to see his works redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of montana in this masterpiece the river to me means that line that <UNK> life from death memories and realities redford shows the hands of the creator so <UNK> and a river runs through it
<START> i am a big fan of arnold <UNK> finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie not just a bit part made me happy br br unfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or <UNK> <UNK> br br i have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired but arnold is an excellent actor i have to <UNK> it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired br br i love arnold <UNK> and he made the film <UNK> otherwise i would have written it off as another lousy film br br i found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good but the sound effects of the shoot out were pretty bad there are some <UNK> in the film continuity but they are <UNK> considering the low caliber of the film br br all in all i enjoyed the film because arnold <UNK> was in it br br jackie
<START> did sandra yes she must have know we would still be here for her some nine years later br br see it if you haven't again if you have see her live while you can
<START> so so thriller starring brad pitt and juliette lewis who join david duchovny and michelle forbes on a road trip out west the latter couple are <UNK> notorious murder sites for an upcoming book <UNK> a serial killer on the <UNK> <UNK> to dave and juliette is his poor not all there companion this is a good cast and the story moves along but pitt isn't <UNK> scary as a serial killer although it is one of his better earlier roles the best thing is here is michelle forbes who always manages to shine whether in her roles on homicide life on the <UNK> or in the brief series wonderland ' br br vote 6
<START> i have never seen one of these scifi originals before this was the first i think it only fair to judge the acting direction production set design and even the cgi effects on the other scifi movies to compare it to your typical hollywood production is unfair i will say however that overall aztec rex was not exactly reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece <UNK> wrath of god br br i will begin by noting that yes i do recognize the fact that this movie has more to do with culture clash than it does with dinosaurs despite this being a made for tv sci fi movie there is some underlying context to the story which i shall examine the symbolic elements included are evident enough br br consequently as a student of history <UNK> mythology and film i found the dialogue outrageous and the plot themes to be somewhat insulting i am not asking for any <UNK> <UNK> on behalf of the producers as i said before the movie is what it is but what concerns me is that much of the younger <UNK> for this movie probably rely on television to provide them their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity br br the main problem <UNK> itself most <UNK> with the character <UNK> not a commentary on <UNK> <UNK> performance but simply how her character was written although i'll say she has some work to do before she receives any emmy <UNK> it is through her character that the spanish europeans actions are justified her function in the film as the love interest of <UNK> <UNK> that the european way is the right way simply because they are european there is really no other reason given it's really just left to the <UNK> that the viewer is meant to associate themselves with the europeans over the aztec because their dress language ideology etc is more familiar to them than the aztec so therefore the aztec are portrayed as <UNK> and <UNK> ' and it's not simply that the viewer is left with that <UNK> due to <UNK> perception on the viewers part but it really seems like the story is trying to convince the viewer as if the aztec were not capable of coming up with a plan if not a better one to lure a dinosaur to its death on a bed of <UNK> sticks br br in fairness there is a <UNK> of the spanish who are portrayed as <UNK> <UNK> and intent on simply <UNK> the native <UNK> there is also a scene where we have the christian holy man noting the achievements of the aztec they have <UNK> medicine <UNK> etc but in the end it is still the aztec warrior who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the movie even over the <UNK> <UNK> more on that later he his portrayed as <UNK> <UNK> and attempts to <UNK> the romantic european <UNK> by <UNK> him into <UNK> <UNK> mind <UNK> <UNK> an important spiritual <UNK> to certain aspects and <UNK> of the native <UNK> north americans again more on this later so that he can keep the female he feels belongs to him and away from the <UNK> br br now in <UNK> the true nature of the story leaving the obvious christian vs <UNK> themes off of the table from a symbolic standpoint a viewer can easily take these so called thunder <UNK> to be <UNK> of the <UNK> ideology <UNK> which in this movie is portrayed as being one intent on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wicked maybe even evil in opposition we have this group of christian <UNK> led by a young <UNK> <UNK> who are portrayed as naive yet overall noble <UNK> caught up in the dark <UNK> world of the aztec also the name of the film is aztec rex leading one to believe that it is about dinosaurs out to eat people however what aztec rex <UNK> to is aztec king a the head of the aztec state or in this instance <UNK> of being ' hence why the title of the film was changed and so who in fact do we see as the new aztec king at the end it's the remaining <UNK> <UNK> aztec rex is in reference to the new european ideology which <UNK> through disease bloodshed war <UNK> native americans <UNK> <UNK> the ideal european as the <UNK> of this film would like them to be remembered in opposition to <UNK> who represents the <UNK> yet still noble <UNK> but when you examine the <UNK> of the <UNK> let us be honest don't the symbolic <UNK> of this film's story have it backwards br br i have to say aztec rex is at worst a little racist or to be kind about it ignorant at best br br and yes i know it's just a movie all meant to be in fun i understand but so at the end we're left with the idea that <UNK> was the father of the last remaining aztec lines i wonder what native <UNK> would have to think about this ending as for myself i thought it was a little too self indulgent br br best supporting performance of the movie goes to ian <UNK> wig although <UNK> it did at least alter <UNK> appearance enough so that i didn't think i was watching the <UNK> from <UNK> leading a bunch of <UNK> into the heart of darkness <UNK> actually proves himself to be a more than capable actor in this movie i actually bought his performance or at least i forgot it was ian <UNK> anyway i don't know whom his agent is but he should get more work br br in closing it was also a pleasure to see jim <UNK> again i've been a fan ever since his all too brief scene stealing performance in <UNK> <UNK> br br alexander

<START> remember h g <UNK> the invisible man well here's another movie like it only more extreme hollow man is like no one story about <UNK> as a weapon of choice kevin bacon plays sebastian caine a scientific genius who goes out into the world of <UNK> and making it useful for military purposes at first making the serum was the easy part making the person come back was not most of the first tries ended up unstable until one night when he <UNK> the formula and who else but caine would be the lab rat the gorilla was the first and almost died so when he came to it was a close one so when the did caine he decided to use it for fun then when he got tired of being not seen the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of the flesh however the <UNK> formula happens to not work the way it should and caine would delve into madness so he ends up being one mad invisible killer it would be best to just get out of town instead of taking the lives of people that are close to you i would care less about the ones who did you wrong great movie plenty of fun 3 out of 5 stars
<START> i being of <UNK> descent had mixed <UNK> about this documentary first i was offended that ms <UNK> compared <UNK> <UNK> to che <UNK> also just a point of fact mr john <UNK> is not of <UNK> descent his parents came from columbia <UNK> did research on this was not very accurate i feel that the future of our race rests on education this message should have been <UNK> throughout this film education is our road to freedom and power i think any future <UNK> of this production team should make this their focus in my opinion this film <UNK> toward an anti american sentiment
<START> in my years of attending film festivals i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution and they end up in the 3 <UNK> at <UNK> i just found dvd of <UNK> tanks there great doc but how sad for it to end up as a rock bottom remainder br br i loved this film wish i'd seen it at the cinema in it's everything i'd have preferred that new <UNK> films had translated the title directly it's good for americans to stretch a little if the film's title helps the us audience to explore random chaos all the better cinema <UNK> life <UNK> versa br br also i found it distracting that the subtitles put <UNK> in dollars come on the euro is not hard to figure out make the <UNK> audiences do the <UNK> seeing a film especially one shot in paris the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded i am an american watching a movie and they are <UNK> the <UNK> into dollars for me br br looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer director as well
<START> six degrees is a wonderful show i watched the entire season online since i just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season 2 ' and to top it all off abc has now taken it off line so it is unable to be viewed online anymore why would abc create such a wonderful show with a great story line and with great characters just to pull it off the air without ever <UNK> the tale it seems it is left to our imagination to figure out what happens to all of our connected characters honestly though i feel that abc could at least place the show online for viewers who <UNK> it while they continue to air overrated reality tv shows six degrees we will miss you
<START> i can't agree with any of the comments first time i saw the film on a uk tv channel it was presented as an indie film and if you take the film under this angle i think it's an all different matter i couldn't believe what i was seeing and got hooked instantly the plot may be as bad as a <UNK> show ie there is no plot but the acting is wicked it's hilarious and it's all in all an incredible trash movie br br it says as much about america than a bully or a ken park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse on the us society and more precisely on what afternoon tv viewers in america and i believe there are plenty of them are interested in after all it's the <UNK> we're talking about don't we br br 100 fun
<START> 1st watched 2 2 2003 4 out of 10 <UNK> jim <UNK> brian smith drab and un spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated 101 <UNK> ' yes the movie continues where it ended in the first one but the problem is that it plays out much like the original one of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story which this one doesn't have the animation is also very un spectacular for disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again when is disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re <UNK> etc etc probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out
<START> a family affair takes us back to a less complicated time in america it's <UNK> to see how different everything was back then it was a more innocent era in our country and we watch a <UNK> family dealing in things together the film also marks the beginning of the series featuring the hardy family br br the film directed by george <UNK> is based on a successful play judge james hardy and his wife <UNK> are facing a domestic crisis that must be dealt with married daughter joan comes home after she has committed a social <UNK> and her husband holds her responsible at the same time another daughter marion brings home a beau who is clear will clash with her father the happy teen <UNK> andy seems to be the only one without a problem until his mother makes him <UNK> polly to the dance something he is reluctant to do br br needless to say judge hardy will prove why he knows best as he puts a plan into action to get everyone together again after all he is a man that understands not only the law but how to deal with those outside forces that threatens his standing in the community and what will make his family happy br br lionel barrymore plays judge hardy with conviction he is the <UNK> that holds everything together spring <UNK> is seen as emily the mother mickey rooney has a small part in this film but he is as always fun to watch <UNK> parker and julie <UNK> appeared as the daughters marion and joan sara hayden and margaret marquis are also featured in the film as aunt <UNK> and polly the girl that surprises andy with her beauty br br a family affair is a good way to observe our past through the positive image painted of an american family
<START> this deserves a 12 out of 10 an absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories this show needs to come back i've seen every episode and this is real quality br br the show centers around a couple of new <UNK> plays around with the concept of the six degrees of <UNK> and cleverly <UNK> their lives bridget <UNK> and jay <UNK> are stunning and so is the adorable <UNK> the scenery is amazing and <UNK> are exquisite br br we need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless <UNK> br br if it never comes back six degrees will be sorely missed
<START> in theory <UNK> <UNK> should have worked the talented rob <UNK> plays peter <UNK> a former television director <UNK> his experiences behind the camera amongst the <UNK> he is alleged to have worked on are <UNK> <UNK> 'the <UNK> of duke <UNK> and 'the <UNK> his <UNK> are not the least bit informative due to his habit of wandering off the point br br but in practice it failed <UNK> it is a one joke show and the joke is not particularly funny the scripts are completely lacking in wit and <UNK> fails to convince as an old man whenever stuck for anything amusing to say which is like every five seconds he issues a <UNK> laugh rather than being amused by <UNK> you want to shoot him if <UNK> old men strike you as hilarious then this is for you br br it didn't help that the shows <UNK> were with the exceptions of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> rather good for the joke to work they needed to be really dreadful such as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> t t ' <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br the show <UNK> big time so thankfully we are <UNK> the horror of future <UNK> wouldn't it be deliciously ironic if <UNK> <UNK> were someday itself the subject of a spoof
<START> this is absolutely the best none animated family film i've seen in quite a while back to the first <UNK> bound paulie is a <UNK> movie about life through a <UNK> <UNK> it's a really touching movie and ranks high among family films up to disney status imho

<START> all i could think of while watching this movie was b grade <UNK> many have spoken about it's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self <UNK> state of unfortunate events yet really the techniques used as many have already mentioned were <UNK> and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole br br as far as the plot is concerned it was <UNK> unimaginative implausible and convoluted you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would br br granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action looks can only carry a film so far the action is poor and <UNK> a few punches thrown here and there and a final <UNK> towards the end nothing really to write home about br br as others have said <UNK> movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are <UNK> you <UNK> in that fact this film however is a void it's nothing br br furthermore if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and loathing in las <UNK> and <UNK> are just a few examples though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like <UNK> overall both serious and funny and <UNK> br br on a final note the one possibly redeeming line in this movie delivered by <UNK> jones was stolen from <UNK> stock and two <UNK> <UNK> to think that a bit of that great movie has been <UNK> by <UNK> is vile br br overall i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie
<START> la <UNK> et la <UNK> is the <UNK> film of all time and what's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with which is directly inspired by <UNK> a la <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> br br indeed la <UNK> et la <UNK> and in search of lost time apparently tell the same story the one of the failure of love which repeats itself endlessly the first woman's name is always <UNK> and the second woman appears like a twisted and <UNK> double of <UNK> <UNK> is like a whore <UNK> beautiful like the night whereas <UNK> was pure and beautiful like the day after the failure of the first love a second love begins but this one is like already doomed by the first one <UNK> takes the place of <UNK> in <UNK> life and in the movie she <UNK> <UNK> her first by time to time <UNK> still coming when alexandre waits for <UNK> then totally that shows it's the same sad story repeating itself the same <UNK> woman like alexandre says who appears endlessly and <UNK> is for <UNK> the higher point in love which makes it exist but which also <UNK> its <UNK> br br art is what causes the passage between what's outside the illusion of love to what's inside which is the truth and is a learning of this truth for instance when <UNK> notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed he answers that he saw it in a movie and then that a movie it's made for that to learn how to live how to make a bed alexander wants to live like he was in a film he wants his life to be art br br this conception of art comes from <UNK> with whom <UNK> shares the same <UNK> of political art and realism in art la <UNK> et la <UNK> fights against a conception of art <UNK> political see for example the <UNK> review of a political movie by alexandre like <UNK> says art doesn't care for all this <UNK> and only exists in silence first of all art is <UNK> and that also why realism or <UNK> is rejected art needs to <UNK> reality to exist <UNK> writes i discover the illusion of realism which is a lie that's why la <UNK> et la <UNK> doesn't hide its <UNK> <UNK> by the way the actors say their text the more you seem artificial the higher you go said <UNK> br br <UNK> and <UNK> both share this idea that the artist is a <UNK> of a inner truth but alexandre failed where <UNK> succeed la <UNK> et la <UNK> tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is you can <UNK> the tragedy <UNK> when you go further in the movie which becomes saddest you can see it in the face of alexandre who looks more and more like a living dead you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer and that after a while nothing happens outside at the end of the movie when you see alexandre writing and <UNK> asking if he's writing his life you can guess that he's not that even literature failed the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander who is <UNK> by the <UNK> of reality and in this tiny <UNK> room alexandre looks more like <UNK> than marcel br br to explain this failure we can say that alexandre is a <UNK> reader in <UNK> et <UNK> jean <UNK> explains that in <UNK> the readers of <UNK> who are <UNK> and <UNK> are unable of any artistic creation because they're stuck in reality which they mistake with art they see reality in art and are not aware of the <UNK> that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work between reality and art and that's exactly alexandre he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons because she played in a <UNK> for example he's like <UNK> who falls in love with <UNK> because she looks like a <UNK> woman br br life is perhaps not my <UNK> this thought is indeed by <UNK> who committed suicide even if it's said by alexandre nevertheless there is a difference between alexandre and <UNK> if <UNK> is absolutely alexandre alexandre is like a double without art a horrible vision of the artist which <UNK> his fears br br by <UNK> <UNK> at the end of the movie alexandre is condemned to <UNK> it's death that remind me the last frames of the movie in the face of jean pierre <UNK> as well as in the endless <UNK> of <UNK> or maybe it is already hell that describes the end like in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and absolutely not like in the final <UNK> of le <UNK> <UNK> if <UNK> had read <UNK> alexandre could never have finish the book always <UNK> by life and <UNK> when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the <UNK> la <UNK> et la <UNK> is like a <UNK> double of in search of lost times which tells how alexander doesn't become an artist whereas a la <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> tells how marcel becomes a writer <UNK> br br if like <UNK> says an <UNK> tells reality at the light of his dream it is his nightmare that <UNK> tells us in la <UNK> et la <UNK>
<START> this movie is visually stunning who cares if she can act or not each scene is a work of art composed and captured by john derek the locations set designs and costumes function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty youth and wealth in some ways i would like to see this movie as a tribute to john and bo <UNK> story and this commentary would not be complete without mentioning anthony <UNK> role as father mentor lover and his portrayal of a man of men lost to a <UNK> era when men were men there are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence <UNK> and security yes they do not make men like that anymore but then how often do you find women who are made like bo derek
<START> i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable it is a quiet little film that doesn't <UNK> you with special effects or big performances it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north <UNK> br br henry thomas gives a good performance as raymond <UNK> a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods <UNK> search for the <UNK> parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life david <UNK> plays truman lester a slimy <UNK> with an <UNK> motive and david plays the bad guy to perfection br br there is much more to this film than first meets the eye filmed on location in north <UNK> and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music it is worth watching
<START> i thought that it was a great film for kids ages 6 12 a little sappy but the story is uplifting an fresh it proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true i think that it's a great story for any kid who is feelings down or feels as if there trying to <UNK> too many things among them very <UNK> film bravo
<START> peter <UNK> first international success the last wave is a mainly effective <UNK> with a fascinating back story based on <UNK> myth richard chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly <UNK> from reality as he <UNK> deeper into a murder case involving <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> plays one of the suspects who does his best to guide <UNK> thru the realm of <UNK> an alternate reality <UNK> central to native australian history and <UNK> <UNK> heavy on atmosphere deliberately ambiguous in plotting the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat <UNK> by poor effects probably due to <UNK> limitations nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as <UNK> will stay with you
<START> one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravo initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it to be perfectly honest i wasn't disappointed the main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well you would think her talents would be wasted as a <UNK> but apparently not after watching the whole film my only real <UNK> is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays <UNK> christ its bad the prison guard hank is <UNK> too all he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co guard <UNK> though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with <UNK> near the end the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the <UNK> this movie is well watching alone for the beautiful talented and very sexy jennifer thomas
<START> i was raised in a very christian household since birth i was saved before i saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church this movie was highly disturbing i saw it when i was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years i used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom's footsteps upstairs if i didn't hear her footsteps i would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn't been <UNK> i used to pray so hard every night for salvation because i was terrified of jesus forgetting me this is definitely not something i will show to my kids until they are much older if at all it took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me
<START> ok a slasher movie a very very stupid slasher movie br br we got your stereotypical teenagers in a house thing going we got a fbi agent that's seen dirty harry one time too many so what's the secret <UNK> we got about 4 different little camera shots and scene that make no sense at all hey man i'm <UNK> the <UNK> that guy was my favorite part of the movie suddenly there's a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies he gets killed br br they follow the killer into the middle of nowhere with no cops suddenly she's in a church wearing a wedding dress i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie i've ever seen
<START> i've often wondered just how much casper was meant for children with all the issues revolving around his identity in this film we are lead to believe that he is the spirit of a dead child as his home is a cemetery plot as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film maybe casper was meant more as a morality play or famous studios felt like breaking new ground in <UNK> cartoons br br there's good <UNK> tonight is a well animated project no doubt there but the plot development involving the fox who becomes <UNK> friend but meets a tragic end is a concern br br give famous studios credit they tackle death with respect but the stark image of <UNK> mourning is rather graphic and disturbing for children though the denouement does offer a happy ending but i won't give away the ending and the violence is rather <UNK> even for 1940's standards br br this might be a good cartoon for parents to use in helping explain death to children but i wouldn't pop it into the vcr for a <UNK> cartoon break
<START> what's that there in the <UNK> is it a plane is it superman <UNK> <UNK> it's a turtle see that's what becomes of the cold war nothing but bad news and other issues the americans shoot down a russian combat plane somewhere over <UNK> territory and the subsequent explosion <UNK> literally <UNK> the giant <UNK> turtle creature named <UNK> he she is not a very friendly <UNK> as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path the arguing <UNK> finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and super sophisticated ice bomb but <UNK> has another surprise in <UNK> the damn turtle can fly the first time this happens results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence <UNK> lies on his back looking defeated when suddenly fire blows from his <UNK> and he <UNK> himself up in the air how can you not love that then there's also a dire sub plot about an annoying kid who's able to <UNK> communicate with the monster but that's just not interesting enough flying turtle people there's very little else to write about this japanese and american re edited sci fi effort apart from that it's an obvious and totally shameless rip off of such classics like the original godzilla and the beast from 20 000 <UNK> the effects and monster designs are extremely hokey and unlike the aforementioned films it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambiance respectable actors like brian <UNK> the <UNK> experiment and dick o'neill <UNK> seem unaware of what film set they're on and even the original japanese mayhem scenes aren't very convincing <UNK> very own and <UNK> theme song is rather cool though so it gets one extra point for that
<START> paris is the place to be to enjoy beautiful art and music and to fall <UNK> in love as is the case in this film boy meets girl they fall in love but something stands in their way of eternal happiness the classic story br br the wonderful music of george <UNK> <UNK> the great dancing by gene kelly and leslie caron an american in paris is a humorous light hearted loving film well worth watching br br 8 10 br br
<START> sholay considered to be one of the greatest films i always wondered if they would ever remake being the classic it is that was the time <UNK> announced this movie and i was somewhat excited to see it i always thought that maybe this will be a good movie but every week we would here <UNK> change something and the movie is a very b grade movie something that i had not hoped br br i really tried looking for <UNK> but i promised to keep sholay out of my mind the cinematography is awesome the movie tries to be its own but that is the up side the action sequences are weak the screenplay had potential the biggest flaw is editing none of the scenes <UNK> you for example the comedy sequences felt very out of place and forced ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original and none of the characters are developed and no scenes will <UNK> until the end and the ending was very disappointing br br the biggest question is acting amitabh bachchan was good as <UNK> <UNK> nothing great it seemed as if they concentrated too much on his look that the character only looks menacing but you don't get <UNK> out <UNK> is barely in the movie but he <UNK> in his few scenes ajay <UNK> was decent it wasn't so much the performance he gave it his all it was the weak script <UNK> raj is very confident and has potential to make it far with better movies br br i had most expectations for <UNK> <UNK> who was probably the best of the lot she was <UNK> but this still was not enough <UNK> <UNK> surprised me she seemed <UNK> for the most part but her emotional scene after her friend's death was quite good seems as if she needs to find a director who will help her talent not her cute looks but what disappointed me most was chemistry ajay <UNK> and <UNK> raj didn't look like friends ajay <UNK> were not a strong couple no passion was to be found between <UNK> and <UNK> and amitabh and <UNK> did not the hateful passion they needed br br as for songs they pretty much suck <UNK> <UNK> was too overblown and i pretty much slept through it it was however nicely <UNK> the <UNK> number was enjoyable but not memorable same went for the other songs for someone who looked forward to this movie i was heavily disappointed i had high hopes for <UNK> because of his jungle but seems as if he lost his talent during the shooting of this movie but hopefully he <UNK> his talent for <UNK> raj but this movie is best forgotten all the <UNK> still do not make up for the boring movie it is
<START> when you read the summary of this film you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is for the primary character of this film gerard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is haunted by visions and hallucinations the visions gerard see are all more or less subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute this is mostly due to the great performances of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> christine and the great direction of the whole by paul verhoeven his directing style is clearly visible and one can say looking at it from different angles that <UNK> <UNK> man' is a typical verhoeven film it will not only seem typical for people familiar with his american films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his dutch films because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story when people watch <UNK> american films short <UNK> people might say he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex that is what some people think whereas i think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film although not a good film hollow man his last american film is an example that verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to <UNK> he needs that just watch his dutch films not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom but they also show that he has remarkable talent <UNK> <UNK> man' brought him one step closer to hollywood and is certainly one of his best br br 8 out of 10
<START> i really enjoyed this movie i am a single dad with a 17 year old daughter who is smart athletic and talented i wish my girl applied herself so well to solving crimes and helping others so for me perhaps this is pg level <UNK> i read many nancy drew books in my teen years long long ago sure this character was <UNK> played by emma roberts but did not resemble the nancy drew i recall from the books that is due to script not the acting br br emma is an adorable teen playing a self confident <UNK> and proud character with good manners and good taste she is not caught up in the trendy <UNK> around her there are some weaknesses in the plot aside from not resembling the nancy drew of the books and trying to figure out what decade we're in like what is that car anyway br br i read the imdb <UNK> before seeing the film as i was <UNK> <UNK> leigh cook from other movies this is not one of her best roles but i will continue looking for more of her films <UNK> was too old to play this lead but does a fine job as the grown up orphan central to the mystery br br i am very disappointed in other reviews written here some expect perfect connection with the books some expect more credible situations or adult action film i got what i expected good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls and their fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement this is a teen pg movie not james bond which would you want for a role model for your <UNK> daughter
<START> some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous not painful to watch with your significant other i was <UNK> to my boyfriend the entire movie br br it was so slow and awfully strange br br both <UNK> vanessa and natasha were <UNK> for this especially with vanessa doing that ridiculous <UNK> american accent br br claire danes was the same <UNK> <UNK> awkward girl that she was in my so called life she has yet to push herself in any way girl find a new way to pretend to cry br br meryl streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie she was on screen for five minutes and i swear to god she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake br br oh and hugh <UNK> who gets better every time i see him br br glenn close and <UNK> <UNK> were also great in their two and a half scenes br br i mean this was a well shot movie it was very pretty the settings were interestingly dressed providing relief for the intense boredom i was feeling br br i don't know it's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of the greatest actresses of our time sucks so much it sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors and the main character ann was a huge jerk i was glad she died but that's because i felt bad for <UNK> <UNK> friend mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy br br ugh bad job evening the film you weren't entertaining and you weren't even thought provoking i sure hope the book was better so it didn't waste even more of people's time 3 10
<START> this is the best mob film ever made it deserved more then what it got at the oscars nominated for things like its score art direction supporting role newman this film could have easily been nominated for best picture director <UNK> actor hanks supporting actor newman and law and won hanks gives one of his best performances and the kid who played michel jr was so good that i'm surprised i don't see him in more movies today critics themselves didn't give this film enough credit but besides the incredible performances another real star of this film is the incredible music this was by far the best score of the year it was nominated but didn't win this is a great film that should be seen by everyone my grade a
<START> no likeable characters the lead is a combination of the worst of woody allen paul <UNK> reiser and the contrived scenes did anyone really think <UNK> kid on the <UNK> was not going to knock the guy down were just <UNK> bad br br
<START> this is a gem a real piece of <UNK> for all that this implies if you are self <UNK> to resist life <UNK> stories just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe and what makes the <UNK> on the cake truly <UNK> is that it is fact based on a real <UNK> to <UNK> story no need to <UNK> pick what details were changed to make a <UNK> story chris cooper is one of the greatest living actors and the complex self conflicted bottom line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight the simple minded comments <UNK> to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while <UNK> that he may possibly be off track expose the <UNK> of the <UNK> not the writers or the acting this is not for the cynical or the simple minded
<START> the thing that really gets me about this movie that is the thing about this movie that makes me physically ill is that someone actually paid to have it made there is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie it is not frightening it is not thought provoking it is not entertaining it is not good it is a sleeping <UNK> made of <UNK> the dvd case <UNK> it to blair witch evil dead and a few other decent movies making the <UNK> desperation <UNK> obvious it is nothing like any other movie ever made it is far far worse the claims of an extremely shocking ending you will never forget are the equivalent of one ton of <UNK> horse <UNK> please do not ever waste your time watching this piece of trash because it may make you <UNK> the man who wrote this movie should be wiped off the writer's <UNK> <UNK> list and never allowed to film anything again because if he thought this was a movie worth making he probably does not have much of anything to offer in the future zero stars may <UNK> have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to see this i am going to go vomit now
<START> i should never have started this film and stopped watching after 3 <UNK> i missed the really <UNK> ending this film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better it had nice atmosphere a top notch cast and director good locations but a <UNK> story line a bad script i paid attention to kenneth branagh's southern accent it was better than the script the plot was stupid driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways no one behaves like this outside of hollywood scripts
<START> this movie can be labeled as a study case it's not just the fact that it <UNK> an <UNK> and non artistic lust for anything that might be <UNK> as <UNK> imagery the author lives with the impression that his <UNK> revolt against some generic and <UNK> <UNK> social <UNK> <UNK> is the most <UNK> region of europe i don't believe one <UNK> in the birds <UNK> romanian people steal because they are poor europeans steal because they are thieves are more or less close to a responsible moral and artistic attitude but he is sorely off target br br what <UNK> doesn't know is that it's not enough to pose as a righteous person you also need a <UNK> of <UNK> talent and intelligence to <UNK> this stance into an artistic product <UNK> the foreign legion shows as much <UNK> as a family video with uncle <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> himself in front of the guests the script is chaotic and incoherent randomly <UNK> together <UNK> half subjects in an illiterate attempt to suggest some kind of a story the direction is <UNK> <UNK> the so called director is unable to build up at least a mediocre <UNK> en scene his shots are annoyingly awkward and any sense of storytelling shines by total absence of course any comment is forced to stop at this level it would be ridiculous to mention concepts as cinematographic language means of expression or style the acting is positively <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> level with the exception of <UNK> the soccer goal keeper <UNK> <UNK> who is very natural and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seems to have a genuine <UNK> but she is <UNK> by the amateurish directions given by <UNK> br br the most serious side of this offense to decent cinema is the fact that the production received a <UNK> <UNK> from the national budget via c n c the national cinematography <UNK> the fact that long time dead old dinosaurs like <UNK> are still <UNK> for the government <UNK> is understandable in a market driven economy they would be instantly eliminated through natural selection but the corruption of the so called jury that <UNK> the country's money on such ridiculously <UNK> non art non cinema and non culture belongs to the criminal field
<START> this movie was so badly written directed and acted that it <UNK> belief it should be remade with a better script director and casting service the worst problem is the acting you have jennifer <UNK> on the one hand who is polished professional and totally believable and on the other hand <UNK> who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece peter <UNK> and jenny <UNK> are just awful as the slave <UNK> and keeping couple although both normally do fine work the actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at all they are inconsistent and unbelievable much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english the casting is ludicrous why have children of an african <UNK> thus less socially <UNK> to the <UNK> de <UNK> society been cast with very pale skinned actors while the supposedly socially <UNK> marcel has <UNK> african features including an obviously <UNK> blond <UNK> it's as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color it's just so weird this could be a great movie and should be re made but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors there are plenty of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how jennifer <UNK> daniel <UNK> and gloria <UNK> would do with an appropriate cast good script and decent direction
<START> always enjoy the great acting talents of harry <UNK> jim <UNK> strange hearts <UNK> who plays a straight as an arrow husband who seems to get all kinds of attention from very charming young women namely lisa zane <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is a co worker with jim <UNK> and you wonder why he doesn't try to hit on her for some fun annie <UNK> kris <UNK> breaking the rules <UNK> is a very warm and sweet loving wife to jim and has complete trust in her husband kris wants to always keep her husband happy and even buys him a home with out him even seeing it for himself this film will keep you guessing right to the very end
<START> this is the only movie that my wife and i have ever walked out on totally sucked we saw it in <UNK> even not funny at all looks like a 14 year old kid wrote the humor i can't believe these real politicians were actually in the movie awful
<START> one of my favourite domestic movies i don't know if there is any person in our country who hasn't seen this movie it's funny and sad at some moments i don't know how did people around the world who had opportunity to watch it accept this movie because you have to know some moments in our serbian history and character of <UNK> in the first half of the 20th century to be able to understand it but as i see here there is somebody from canada who watched it and he liked it br br i think that i'll try to put all good quotes from the movie on this site but first to find out how to do that br br cheers
<START> i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it which was sometime last year anyway i got to see today and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after 10 mins or so i thought that the movie was pretty good but the thing i didn't like was how the killer was created i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends final cut i almost died it mostly everything in <UNK> final cut needed to be improved cut is 100 times better than <UNK> final cut the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes the killer kicks mo f ing ass br br i give cut a 8 out of 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> goes all out to touch upon taboo issues and gives the most realistic picture of the modern society one gets the impression of the director even from his earlier movies like <UNK> and <UNK> bar the issues just hinted on in the latter movie are explored and exposed in <UNK> here the casting is amazing and one can see the <UNK> on each scene from many angles mostly the movie leaves you wondering on lots of facts around as you start guessing the things you end up at most being close but missing the mark in many a scenes it leaves a lasting impression in the end br br actors to watch are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> among others the dialogues are well written and you feel you've lived around some of these people there are still some scenes that make you think of more depths the songs are in the background saving time and <UNK> voice in a very meaningful song <UNK> <UNK> leaves you feeling you're left all alone in the midst of the modern society

<START> well what can you say about a barbara <UNK> adaptation br br there are some amazing actors in this oliver reed sarah miles christopher plummer but they clearly are <UNK> up the money br br <UNK> anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other <UNK> epics anthony with hugh grant who looks suitably embarrassed and gilbert with helena bonham carter br br if you really want to see a watchable adaptation of <UNK> the bonham carter one is the one to go for a <UNK> of hearts what a title gilbert is the weak link in that but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act and the rest of the cast play it to the <UNK> with <UNK> firmly in cheek edward fox diana <UNK>
<START> notorious for more than a quarter century and often banned it's obscurity was its greatest asset it seems hey it's often better to be talked about rather than actually seen when you can't back the legend up with substance br br the film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently and is available on home video so that <UNK> is slowly being lifted while there is still plenty to offend the masses it is more likely to bore them than <UNK> much real passion except for a gratuitous and <UNK> <UNK> sex scene between a pair of horses nature documentary anyone there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama br br once the sex and nudity begins it is a <UNK> sequence involving masturbation a <UNK> flashback to an alleged <UNK> and the <UNK> encounter and a naked woman running around the mansion nobody even her supposedly protective aunt seems to even think of putting some clothes on her on video i guess you can fast forward thru the <UNK> but it's not really worth the effort the nudity doesn't go beyond what is seen in something much more <UNK> such as <UNK> the <UNK> br br try as one might to find some <UNK> or <UNK> in the <UNK> i doubt it's worthy of anyone's effort unfortunately for la <UNK> now that you can more easily see the film the <UNK> of something once <UNK> has been lifted and this beast has been <UNK>
<START> kurosawa really blew it on this one every genius is allowed a failure the concept is fine but the execution is badly <UNK> br br there is an air of fantasy about this film making it something of an art film the poverty stricken of tokyo deserve a <UNK> and more realistic portrayal many of them have interesting stories to tell a very disappointing film
<START> one word <UNK> i don't think i have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid tv schedule filled with reality shows and boring re runs br br i have to say i had my <UNK> after all critics were almost <UNK> in crying foul and <UNK> the show but when half an hour was over by the way thank you nbc for running a commercial free show i was left with the feeling of instant love love at first glance the true love that one feels in his guts everything about this show screamed excellence br br graphics in this show were at least as good as finding <UNK> and shrek no small feat considering those movies took years to be developed br br cast was marvelous i am partial to john <UNK> voice but the rest of the team certainly were on par with john special mention lisa <UNK> guest appearance she was on top of the game creating neurotic <UNK> and lovable <UNK> with a jewish streak in her <UNK> from brooklyn only in this show br br script was funny with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp yet not tacky a note for all parents this is not for children this show was never advertised as such and there's a reason why it's set for <UNK> not <UNK> so if you'd like to complain about <UNK> context save your breath adults deserve a comedy made just for them and father of the pride is it br br not everything was perfect i was a bit puzzled by <UNK> and <UNK> characters do i sense stereotype when it comes to them yes they are gay yes they are flamboyant yes they speak with german accents but that's <UNK> news give us something new something fresh something funny putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach i understand that the creators of this show wanted to use the star power that these guys have that's fine by me but please don't <UNK> on something everybody already knows by heart hopefully the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over br br in general the show is definitely a must see tv funny witty with a few unexpected twists here and there there haven't been a comedy this good since seinfeld i am certainly looking forward to the next episode
<START> 1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time terminator 2 judgment day and bill ted's bogus journey out of the two i've always liked bill ted's bogus journey a bit better terminator 2 judgment day is the better made but there's just nothing like bill and ted besides chris <UNK> and david spade in tommy boy it's hard to think of a greater comedic duo than bill and ted they are one of a kind br br seemingly influenced by national <UNK> o c and <UNK> bill and ted were created by ed <UNK> and chris <UNK> two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in l a back in the 1980s the two quickly began writing a screenplay about two and before long bill ted's excellent adventure was born the film shot in 1987 and released in 1989 became a big box office success and an instant cult classic it wasn't long before work began on the sequel stephen <UNK> the director of <UNK> <UNK> wasn't keen on working on the sequel since he considered it to be too mean spirited and unlike the first one so peter <UNK> making his feature film debut was brought in to direct the sequel there couldn't have been a better director for the job bill ted's bogus journey is <UNK> directed it's filled with its own unique style and energy that can't be matched br br what makes <UNK> <UNK> one of the best sequels ever is that it while it is darker than the original it is just as fun it doesn't change the characters like most sequels do bill and ted are the same lovable characters that they were in the first film this is because it was written by the original writers most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one but since <UNK> <UNK> had the same screenwriters it ended up being just as good as <UNK> <UNK> if not even better just like the first one <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely hilarious well written fun and above all original it's filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from alex winter keanu reeves and william <UNK> it's an unforgettable <UNK> 10 10

<START> critics need to review what they class as a quality movie i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have <UNK> to the matrix style of films europa is a breath of fresh air a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension the back projection effect he uses during the film <UNK> and enhances the characters and the focus of the conversation they are having other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene the commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions br br i could talk about the effects more but i think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own and really <UNK> the drama of the film a film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not br br 10 10 don't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors
<START> h g wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by he was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour at the very beginning of the 20th century he <UNK> the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species natural <UNK> on one side and <UNK> market economy on the other side were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple <UNK> of number the weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite he <UNK> then a strict <UNK> policy with the <UNK> of all those who were in a way or another <UNK> the human race first of all the non <UNK> with the only exception of the jews who would disappear thanks to mixed <UNK> then within the <UNK> community all those who were not healthy the <UNK> the mentally disabled all those who were <UNK> disabled etc that was not hitler that was h g wells and that was not after the first world war that was more than ten years before and twenty years before the first world war he had published the time machine that <UNK> the idea that the human race left to its own means and due to the <UNK> <UNK> evolution of life on earth would see the <UNK> of the human race into two species the working class would become a <UNK> <UNK> species and the <UNK> would become an <UNK> surface species the point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak <UNK> species was the prey of the other species who were the <UNK> wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by <UNK> a strict <UNK> policy the first countries to follow this <UNK> were the <UNK> countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them the film here <UNK> a vision of <UNK> with a world government that is absolutely <UNK> in the fact that there is no election no <UNK> no really <UNK> institution only peace <UNK> by military conquest and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few <UNK> and in that future world all absolutely all human beings are <UNK> wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by <UNK> amazing wells <UNK> some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all the last sentences are the vision of this white civilization <UNK> the whole universe when <UNK> the sky and its stars and planets frightening and that was produced in 1936 all the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of <UNK> <UNK> japanese <UNK> or <UNK> can be found but it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of h g wells we are obviously very far away from the brave new world of absolute <UNK> social selection or the animal farm of the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> or the 1984 of the abstract <UNK> <UNK> of big brother this vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others and i only want to compare wells with the british science fiction writers of his days it would be unfair to go beyond this reveals that in england in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among <UNK> the fear that the future would only be somber bleak and in the form of an <UNK> of some kind br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK> university <UNK> saint quentin en <UNK>
<START> when i saw this film in the 1950s i wanted to be a scientist too there was something magical and useful in science i took a girl friend along to see it a second time i don't think she was as impressed as i was this film was comical yet serious at a time when <UNK> <UNK> were rather new lessons from this film could be applied to issues relating to <UNK> <UNK> of today
<START> just too many incidents of violence br br the film goes from one scene to another and in nearly every one violence <UNK> br br now i am not one who is shocked by violence and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing but please not one after another my reaction was not shock or horror it was here we go again there is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence but two thirds of the way through the film i had switched off completely and couldn't wait for the end br br if this is the best the film makers can do they should find something else to do with their miserable lives like making shoes or delivering mail
<START> i watched this let me <UNK> suffered through this because i'm a fan of <UNK> i don't think this is a flick she'll put on the back of her head shot photos i like <UNK> <UNK> but this wasn't even close the budget couldn't have been more than a few hundred dollars and that money was probably spent on the <UNK> br br the premise was interesting but the first victim died before you get the chance to care about her or not br br i won't bother saying who did what and how because it isn't worth the effort i'm only glad that because of my <UNK> rental plan at the local video store that i didn't have to actually pay for this garbage br br oh before you flame on me i love movies i thought a <UNK> <UNK> were good that some of you have <UNK> so for me to jam this tells you all you need to know
<START> okay so there aren't really that many great movies around recent gems like american dream the straight story and even toy story 2 don't normally come so close together but boy does this film counter balance the quality br br i have no idea what these people thought they were doing are the <UNK> in this world so easily convinced to <UNK> such a <UNK> of i can just see it now br br producer so we've got joe <UNK> he's cute as a button and was pretty good in shakespeare in love and we've got rhys <UNK> who isn't cute but was cool in <UNK> hill we'll mix in a really mediocre score a few forgettable post <UNK> tunes <UNK> root and lizard brains and hey <UNK> you've got the worst film of the new millennium and believe me it's gonna be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years br br the bank i like it any unnecessary sex bad camera movements and what about the worst accents this side of devil's own br br producer yeah we got plenty of those br br the bank sounds great where do we sign br br please
<START> robert a <UNK> classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years in everything to paul verhoeven's 1997 film to a tv series to a number of games but none of these so to speak has really captured the spirit of his novel the games are usually unrelated the tv series was more of a spin off and the less said about verhoeven's film the better little do most know however that in japan an animated adaptation had already been done released the year of <UNK> death and believe it or not despite its differences this 6 part animated series is plot wise the most faithful adaptation of <UNK> classic br br the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor <UNK> something we were <UNK> of in verhoeven's film like the book the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel though we see a fair amount of each while events happen differently than in the book the feel of the <UNK> plot is present rico and carmen have a romantic <UNK> but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment but what did you expect but it's far superior to the film <UNK> political views are merely <UNK> as opposed to the film where they are <UNK> the big payoff of the series however is the climatic battle on <UNK> between the troopers and the bugs aliens which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version br br overall i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of <UNK> and i think they did pretty well with this if you can find this series give it a look
<START> wow i remember so many awful films that loosely <UNK> around high school from the early 1980s they usually had <UNK> strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students as i watched this film i felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s however then i find out that this film was made in 1989 say what well the nostalgia factor ends right there this is just bad the plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools which is odd in that the students at this school are both wealthy and <UNK> in fact the main character lives in a mansion makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive have they never heard of property <UNK> oh but here is the <UNK> the school board says that they will keep the school alive if the students can raise 200 000 so the <UNK> go about doing this hmmm you raise 200 000 but instead of saving that for college you put it towards saving the high school that you are a senior in and why exactly would they close an <UNK> school before the year is out and <UNK> forget it this film was stupid and made in 1989
<START> i consider this film one of the worst in the nightmare series it was so boring that i couldn't remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over it even <UNK> me to write a review on it br br okay 4 was a joke and freddy was the joker 5 tried to return to the roots of the series it was darker and more atmospheric than nightmare 4 which is a good thing basically they tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares because of that nightmare 5 the dream child is neither funny nor is it scary what we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors maybe with the exception of lisa <UNK> br br the plot freddy killing <UNK> friends by using the dreams of <UNK> unborn child has a good base but it just isn't enough for 90 minutes of film sometimes the story gets very confusing maybe because there isn't any and you can't stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at the screenplay must have had more holes than swiss cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself let me say that i don't like cheese though even if i am from switzerland not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4 br br don't bother to rent buy this film if not for <UNK> it's quite a mess br br my rating 4 10 get used to it 6 is also a messy one
<START> i cant understand at all why so many godzilla fans think this is excellent one of the best godzilla films ever in fact this film is horrible and one of the very few <UNK> films i cant stand to watch again the other being g vs <UNK> br br the plot is too campy to be in the <UNK> series a series that attempted to turn the aging godzilla franchise into <UNK> action films revolving around ideas that seemed more in place in 1974 than 1991 it just sounded ridiculous especially with some of the subject matter take for example the ww2 scene with the japanese soldiers <UNK> a dying <UNK> a <UNK> and serious tone take the <UNK> former commander turn <UNK> and his death serious <UNK> in a film its fans somehow <UNK> as played for laughs as a goofy romp with guilty illogical fun if so than this is easily one of the most tasteless films i've seen however i think its more likely it was only talent the filmmakers lacked and this was a case of a straight faced action movie gone bad it was made ever worse by the fact that the special effects are terrible beyond compare from the jet packs to the <UNK> to the hokey sound effects <UNK> from everything its impossible to take anything seriously and yet the film expects you to there's no <UNK> to the camera br br like nearly all godzilla films there's a pointless romance and this is no exception though something can be said about the fact that this one is especially pointless since and inexplicable there is literally no reason at all presented for the romance it just happens and there lives make <UNK> degree <UNK> for it aside from this the other terrible aspect of this film is dialogue both the japanese and english is horrible clunky and possibly the inspiration for battlefield earth br br the <UNK> dvd <UNK> the problems making everything look grainy <UNK> dim and just plain ugly the same was for the sound i first saw the japanese region 2 version and the differences are night and day with the original vibrant colors and <UNK> the noteworthy score the fight scenes especially are actually watchable br br in my opinion the <UNK> series is a disappointment with the exception of godzilla 1984 japanese version there is little to praise here and godzilla vs king <UNK> is case in point of this failure it doesn't even come close to deserving the reputation and fans it gets br br 2 out of 10
<START> i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production but it turned out to be the the biggest let down a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss it was vulgar and <UNK> i don't think dr seuss would have <UNK> how the grinch stole christmas was much better i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on whereas the cat in the hat screamed <UNK> they caught a lot more than i would have liked growing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got <UNK> on the big screen lets see what they do with <UNK> hears a who i hope this one does dr seuss some justice
<START> i have to admit i've caught this one a few times on the usa network there's just something about the well sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it's on yes you're right about the sub par acting the plot which only an seven year old could like etc but i can't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors then again a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel
<START> a bit of trivia b c i can't figure out how to submit trivia in the backdrop of this performance one of the images is br br george <UNK> a sunday afternoon on the island of la <UNK> <UNK> painting seen best in chapter 18 this painting is the subject of a <UNK> musical sunday in the park with george br br a bit of trivia b c i can't figure out how to submit trivia in the backdrop of this performance one of the images is br br george <UNK> a sunday afternoon on the island of la <UNK> <UNK> painting seen best in chapter 18 this painting is the subject of a <UNK> musical sunday in the park with george
<START> like almost everyone else who has commented on this movie i can only wonder why this has never appeared on video br br i recall seeing it at about age 12 on the the late show circa 1972 i too recall the poison gas attack and the <UNK> <UNK> horses i don't recall the more horrific bits i've seen described here they were likely cut out for the tv audience but the scenes i really liked were the ones involving the death of lord <UNK> aboard the <UNK> <UNK> almost exactly 90 years ago the scenes of the doomed <UNK> approaching the <UNK> in the storm were really chilling as i recall br br don't recall the musical score but the comments of the others now have me curious get this one out on video
<START> this movie is one of the most provocative jesus movies i have ever seen it does not seek to tell the whole story but only to portray an <UNK> expression of the last day of jesus christ it is darkly witty playful and seriously faithful to elements of the jewish tradition and to modern <UNK> interpretation <UNK> is much more ordinary than other portrayals not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine but a grossly mistaken man horribly misguided in his <UNK> chris <UNK> jesus is playful and serious faithful and committed very human while also divine the final dialog is <UNK> done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity i would watch this movie again and recommend it to others
<START> some may feel that the rating i have just given is a bit generous but for what this film is i think the directors have done a good job with that they had available to them this is also a film a film of an acquired taste br br my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film 'the <UNK> i e the <UNK> aliens from outta space <UNK> human host to then <UNK> havoc wherever possible br br you can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror gore genre however cleverly maintains its own originality well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rival only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host to then pick another fight with another infected host and this film even throws in a love story but i wont say no more otherwise it gives too much away br br great but like i said of an acquired taste so don't be surprised if you don't like the film it is low budget and yes it is blood <UNK> with the creatures aliens things <UNK> their limbs into crude looking weapons i e <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and even the odd gun to all but <UNK> there <UNK> i found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next br br so if you like gore you like aliens you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere then i must recommend this film as a must see i just wish i came across this earlier then i did
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen the <UNK> held this dubious <UNK> but no longer the acting in jill the <UNK> is terrible and was only <UNK> by the plot this movie is as intellectually stimulating as the <UNK> it doesn't know whether it wants to be an s m flick or a really bad thriller only watch under extreme <UNK> or if you're bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction this script should be <UNK> into a porn it wouldn't take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life a porn even a bad porn wouldn't do the damage to <UNK> <UNK> career the way that this movie has
<START> with the death of her <UNK> husband may an older woman faces a future in an urban world that views her as invisible dead from the neck down and <UNK> in the pseudo sophisticated <UNK> homes of her son bobby and his shallow wife helen and paula a self absorbed <UNK> and <UNK> talented daughter the central family is anything but warm supportive and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life with the death of her husband the mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies the elder parent is both <UNK> and a burden to grown children whose careers and status seeking <UNK> all else br br as may comes to realize the world is still important to her the lonely widow finds her <UNK> <UNK> and alive with her daughter's boyfriend a carpenter and rough sort may <UNK> on an <UNK> sexual affair with darren whose character is sympathetic to her at first but his flawed nature is quickly revealed through the <UNK> of the women who surround him br br this is the kind of role hollywood actresses of a certain age <UNK> is never written for them but would never appear in because the film's <UNK> overt sexuality <UNK> wardrobe little makeup and social commentary on the <UNK> of the very society most film industry women are <UNK> the performance by the lead actress anne reid <UNK> from quiet to <UNK> and her interpretation <UNK> on screen from the drab widow to a sexually alive and freed middle age woman without face lift hair <UNK> and <UNK> she <UNK> more than her soul for the screen br br daniel craig is the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> both mother and daughter he turns in another stellar performance that is at first sympathetic to the <UNK> situation but in the end is without redemption as his true nature unfold and he is literally the <UNK> in a <UNK> house his <UNK> character's inability to say no to the ex wife boring girlfriend and her mother is blamed as the root of his <UNK> existence while good with his hands at building a <UNK> he is unable to <UNK> meaning in his life br br one of the best films from britain in years it is simply adult in its storyline the mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for american audiences to tolerate having no car chase no <UNK> no rap soundtrack to <UNK> out the <UNK> performances by tv <UNK> and buff <UNK> the mother reflects how the aging baby <UNK> are now <UNK> people that <UNK> are willing to overlook send to the retirement home and get out of the way may doesn't know what to do as she is made alive by darren isn't willing to go to the old folks home and finds her kids are more conservative than she ever was at their age
<START> i really don't understand all these positive user reviews this movie is the worst movie i've ever seen and i'm not trying to be <UNK> br br eva <UNK> is hot but terrible in this film but i don't think it is her own fault but the directors he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial their acting the idea the make up everything br br the star i'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie which was very bad executed br br don't watch this <UNK> go watch a fellini woody allen or some david lynch
<START> i'm not to keen on the <UNK> it's not too bad but just very slow at the times as the movie goes on it gets a little more interesting but nothing brilliant i really like david <UNK> and i think he's good here i'm not a massive gwyneth paltrow fan but i don't mind her sometimes and she's okay here the <UNK> is not a highly recommended movie but if you like the leads then you might enjoy it
<START> i got a dvd of <UNK> and this <UNK> was an extra feature i assumed that it was boogeyman ii because it was paired with the original but you know what they say about those who assume it makes an ass out of u and me i had read before viewing that <UNK> contains a lot of footage from the original and that it starred actress love while watching return of the boogeyman i decided to stick around through the original footage to see the notorious death by <UNK> scene before i knew it the film was over rip off i think that i thought this was <UNK> because this has a similar title to one of <UNK> alternate titles oh well at least this was just an extra feature right br br let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the movie's mistakes many many mistakes who does this guy <UNK> whatever think he is does he really think the same movie will sell in different forms there is nothing original holding part iii up it is basically a flashback of the original through the eyes of a psychic who is giving us a <UNK> boring play by play as everything happens that's the movie oh and one death by <UNK> scene but you can read that off someone else's review my interest in boogeyman ii is forever lost br br final note this is not a series of films to watch back to back
<START> ok so i know of this movie because of a friend of <UNK> in it and i actually visited the set when they were filming so from a personal stand point i was intrigued to finally view this obscure little gem if you dig at all on info regarding this movie you'll find it's <UNK> in legal troubles even over 7 years after being filmed so if you are at all like me then you'll do whatever it takes to obtain a copy my source ebay about 15 but i felt ripped because when i got it today in the mail it was a very rough grainy copy of a <UNK> only release complete with annoying top mini time code but alas i could still enjoy it but not as much as if i had a proper copy something i suggest you obtain if you want the full impact this film may or may not have on you from what i have <UNK> it's been released on dvd in germany now spain with that good luck happy searching <UNK> the score <UNK> is worth it alone very <UNK> and varied <UNK> rare these days imho in film i think that will be my next <UNK> score to locate but i <UNK> br br now onto the review the film opens as billy <UNK> character is <UNK> a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in he steals her clothes even shoes and quickly moves into a series of holding up a bank <UNK> shop but after escaping with the <UNK> well i guess this is where the plot begins he inadvertently <UNK> it after <UNK> several campy over the top crimes <UNK> to various a to c list <UNK> to locate the money he finds himself somehow in a cemetery where a funeral i think for the dead guy he shoots in the <UNK> office bank and even with 1950's police cars and cops looking all over for him <UNK> throughout he never gets seen or <UNK> he sees daily <UNK> <UNK> his crimes this i liked because it gave the thin plot an <UNK> after all it's a movie see fiction director <UNK> <UNK> does what i think is everything possible to 1 bring <UNK> vision to <UNK> and 2 give it an updated feel yet have shots of authentic 50's police cars <UNK> with <UNK> local l a 99 stores so well hence my 9 rating if the period and props were authentic i would have given it a 10 now it <UNK> it self up kinda weird and i won't spoil it for anyone but let's just say the final ending is somewhat disappointing for it to me it had promise action and comedy all up till the end so with all that said locate a copy at your own <UNK> br br just realize that as there is no <UNK> except for some narration and singing this may be up your alley maybe not but i definitely think it's worth a watch the actors all do fine performances and it's only the <UNK> in proper period pieces that really made me long for just that <UNK> then i would say by all means check this film out for it's not like anything these studios put out these days or will in the future too i am sure
<START> and i don't say it in a bad way br br i watched this movie at the cinema when i was 6 or 7 for me and my cousins it was magical beautiful and scary at the same time when we left the theatre michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about it br br over the years i saw this movie being aired a few times but i always changed the channel even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that feeling of magic and warm my heart and i liked it that way br br so i've only seen this movie once and i believe it was a good decision not to watch it again if i saw it today i know i couldn't help but <UNK> <UNK> acting the plot if there was one and this and that for me this is a childhood memory so my feelings towards it are those of a child from 20 years ago br br i see my adult self <UNK> in my rating and gives it an 8 for the memories and wonderful music for that little kid who watched it in awe 20 years ago though this is definitely worthy of a 10
<START> this movie was excellent a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the <UNK> this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie you have the master who is <UNK> in tradition and kind hearted in his own way <UNK> despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions this equals on big happy movie in the end this movie does a good job at showing how <UNK> in tradition one can be so <UNK> that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture the cinema photography is excellent in particular the opening parade sequence with all the <UNK> bound to be in oscar <UNK> for best foreign film
<START> a boring movie about a boring town in the 50's how can anyone think this is a classic the producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend <UNK> shepard into several movies that were way above her acting ability i think this movie gives an insight to how bad peter <UNK> future movies were going to be <UNK> <UNK> career took a dive after being in several movies that peter <UNK> produced it wasn't until <UNK> that her career started to come back i thought the acting was poor rendition of the graduate i have noticed that this movie hasn't been shown in the us the only place i have watched it was overseas in europe late at night
<START> silly hilarious tragic sad inevitable br br a group of down and outs team up with a seasoned crook to elevate themselves out of their poverty great idea if you ignore the <UNK> factor br br nice to see george clooney doing something genuinely funny for a change the casting is perfect and the acting standards very high although it could be said that the <UNK> crew subject isn't new i think this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way <UNK> so that it stands out from what has gone before br br very well done guys
<START> i get the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful ridiculous western ever made painful is the best word i can think of to describe it br br on the plus side you have nice color photography and beautiful and well spoken <UNK> <UNK> my sympathy goes to jacques <UNK> who played the <UNK> who acted well enough in an annoying role written so <UNK> that no actor could give an enjoyable performance the production values were quite good which only served to highlight the terrible story and screenplay br br things i hated stewart granger looked so little like a western figure what with his british accent neat <UNK> outfit and silly <UNK> always white <UNK> tied around his neck it got tiresome the way the <UNK> and his son were constantly <UNK> and insulting granger and he never spoke up or <UNK> back i know we are supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate westerns as symbolic morality plays but this one broke the spell with it laughably unrealistic and predictable scenes the worst being at the end where granger miraculously <UNK> and single <UNK> plants dynamite around a canyon pass that the bad guy's cattle will pass through and then granger plants himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create rock <UNK> to bury and <UNK> the cattle and bad guys seemingly destroying them all save the two main bad guys next worst is everything about the plot which is loaded with soap opera scenes nothing in the movie seemed believable i couldn't believe what all the conflict was about the bad guy was driving his herd through to market and wanted the <UNK> to chew some grass along the way i don't see why something couldn't have been worked out you need a land <UNK> <UNK> for that don't bother to see it
<START> sondra locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful <UNK> anyway unfortunately she drags everyone else including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real <UNK> it's an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in bored poor acting even from the normally good eastwood there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep <UNK> wow could a film be any more boring i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker don't bother with this one
<START> i have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago and one thing surprised me so <UNK> that i could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies dennis quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin while his smile and grin are two of his <UNK> danny glover was cast as the bad guy but again most <UNK> imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role also jared <UNK> was not believable as the former medicine student the tension was just not there since the killer was known very early the finale was again neither dramatic nor tense nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next all we could wait for was the end of the movie all in all a disappointing evening spent at the cinema
<START> i thought the movie was a poor documentary nothing of substance was discussed it seemed to <UNK> the ideas and did not provide anything new the film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science most scientists appeared stereotyped and sometimes weird a woman said that her awards didn't matter a whole lot only children that were helped she said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards playing humble scientist are we i have <UNK> dancing in my head another said i don't see how that explains anything to us it hasn't covered significant effects of science on our culture politics of science were barely touched br br not a bad flick for a 10 14 year olds other than that i felt it was boring and <UNK> br br 4 10
<START> br br this movie sucks ridiculous school <UNK> unbelievable students that are very bad and behave like criminals but then later after the good teacher nick nolte taught them they became as good and as quiet as <UNK> br br if this works for you it doesn't for me 0 out of 10
<START> i am a huge fan of say anything jerry maguire and almost famous i wasn't that big on <UNK> so it's safe to say that i look forward to anything that cameron <UNK> <UNK> his name to i went to see vanilla sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that i probably wouldn't like it if i was expecting anything similar to <UNK> other films well having just seen it let me say that the former was correct and the latter couldn't have been more wrong it is a very weird movie and nothing really comes together until the end anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to <UNK> their <UNK> from their memory anyway the movie was stellar and i look forward to <UNK> it as soon as the dvd is released i was moved by the film and felt emotionally spent by the end this is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion if the viewer allows him herself into the plot in the theatre in which i saw the movie there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot i'm sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this i don't mean that to sound pompous but some people are more cut out for the seagal chan van damme genre of movies and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie it is very cerebral so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental <UNK> as well as much thought afterwards br br as far as comparing this film to other <UNK> movies it is very similar in at least one regard in all <UNK> movies the soundtrack is a character <UNK> itself this is almost definitely due to <UNK> <UNK> ties to music as anyone who has seen almost famous knows and to his marriage to heart star nancy wilson it was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between tom <UNK> acting and <UNK> directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen jerry maguire in my mind that is not a bad thing br br anyway if i had to compare this movie to any one other film i would say this if you enjoyed david <UNK> the game you will almost certainly be a fan of vanilla sky
<START> i swear that zombie was killed like twice and kept coming back i gave this movie an 8 let's face it folks this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying i e a handy <UNK> shot film hey hey hey welcome to total <UNK> film making the fact that todd sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents yes the story has gaps yes we see the same zombies over and over again but who really cares take it for what it is a fun and gory horror film one to share with your <UNK> or to gross out the people you really care about lol <UNK> out people i suppose you all liked <UNK> of garbage like titanic or <UNK> instead peace and support independent film making
<START> now i'm no film critic but i truly hated september 11 this film was on a general basis bad with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> segment which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter the short films were at best boring and at worst offensive the worst in my mind was <UNK> <UNK> pretentious segment in which he compared palestinian suicide <UNK> to american soldiers even going so far as to suggest the suicide <UNK> were fighting for a greater cause the segment was completely off topic and considering <UNK> seeming lack of any decency whatsoever a waste of my time and patience the idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper but in practice it was tasteless
<START> this movie has one of the <UNK> plots i have seen for me that's what makes it so awesome fred <UNK> and al lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original <UNK> series while there was less slapstick they still worked wonderfully together <UNK> i wish <UNK> de <UNK> as lily would have had more plot involvement she showed that she could do comedy in the original series but it was mostly wasted in this movie this movie also stars the great sid <UNK> but sadly he doesn't have any interaction with <UNK> and lewis i think some better work could have come out of that
<START> i love b movies but come on this wasn't even worth a grade the ending was dumb b c there was no real ending not to mention that it comes to life on its own i mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time period and i won't even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head and then you don't even get to see what jigsaw even does with his so called new jigsaw puzzle unless you have nothing better to do id watch paint dry before id recommend this god <UNK> movie to anyone else oh and to make it even better the other movie <UNK> you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window that was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film
<START> it's highly stylized but this movie shows that real people appear on these shows and what seems like good fun and a chance to appear on television can have serious consequences br br yes <UNK> mostly comedy but there are some sad moments
<START> stanley and <UNK> is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life <UNK> life is difficult because he never learned to read or write <UNK> is a widower with two teenage children working in a <UNK> where she meets stanley she decides to teach stanley how to read at her home in her spare time over time they become <UNK> involved after stanley learns to read he goes off to a good job in chicago only to return to <UNK> and ask her to marry him br br it's a really good film without nudity violence or profanity that which is rare in today's films a good film all round br br
<START> after reading some quite negative views for this movie i was not sure whether i should <UNK> out some money to rent it however it was a pleasant surprise i haven't seen the original movie but if its better than this i'd be in heaven br br tom cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable david convincing me that he is more than a smile on legs for only the third time in his career the other examples were <UNK> and born on the fourth of july penelope <UNK> is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role as does diaz the only disappointment is the slightly bland kurt russell in the movie however it is not the acting that really <UNK> its the filmmaking br br cameron <UNK> excels in the director's role providing himself with a welcome change of pace from his usual <UNK> the increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by <UNK> the brief sequence where cruise walks through an empty time square is incredibly effective the soundtrack a <UNK> feature of a <UNK> movie is also sublime br br you will be shocked and challenged as a viewer the plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly <UNK> the movie isn't perfect but its a welcome change of pace for cruise and <UNK> and for those raised on a <UNK> of hollywood <UNK> should be a revelation
<START> when i was born this television series was the number one show on t v america <UNK> the feat of the ultimate <UNK> <UNK> country with big ambitions <UNK> potential and a very comfortable economy after a big sunday dinner why not sit back and watch bonanza in color this <UNK> western evokes an american tradition which <UNK> the <UNK> of the typical u s household during the era in which it was viewed the breathtaking cinematography of lake <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> american culture western movies were so popular that western television shows followed suit this was a period in time in our country which <UNK> for a <UNK> reflection on our own country's struggle for survival the end result of the trials and <UNK> at the <UNK> ranch as demonstrated in this series <UNK> a realization that americans are now <UNK> enjoying the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> labor br br the t v show bonanza was popular for so many different reasons mostly on account of the fact that the late fifties and early sixties had not yet established the <UNK> of two different cultural <UNK> which was ready to surface with our nation the <UNK> of <UNK> in the united states which <UNK> during the debut of bonanza was a big reason for the show's success in the show's later years bonanza had established a firmly <UNK> core market television audience the cast to bonanza became famous and the wholesome entertainment of bonanza <UNK> a <UNK> for the all american <UNK> everybody liked bonanza and a lot of americans totally loved it <UNK> on rough and <UNK> family values is a favorite past time of many americans and the television show bonanza was perfect for that frame of mind i liked the show a lot and most people i know like it as well certainly my entire family loved bonanza this show was one of the all time american classics in the history of television
<START> this movie pretty much surprised me i didn't have very high expectations for it but i was wrong mary <UNK> was very funny and well written they didn't spend too much time <UNK> the past so they weren't relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie overall it was very entertaining br br my girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit com and i think i might agree with her
<START> welcome to <UNK> is kind of a disaster considering the people involved it should've been multiple times better br br watching it if you're at least somewhat attached to the faith that it'll get better will probably make you cry it's one of those movies that had potential but was robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad acting not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary george clooney character and the guy who reminds me of richard dreyfuss but about whom i care so little that i don't even want to know his name br br the film's only saving grace is the weird con <UNK> it introduces i found myself thinking of it time and time again as i watched more crime <UNK> this is the only reason i gave the film a 3 the plot is boring the characters are neurotic needlessly offensive and highly unlikable they are in a constant state of <UNK> stress and they're all so irritating that i celebrated their obstacles they yell at each other and swear <UNK> the dialogue is insipid at best and <UNK> stupid at its low points br br i find that steven traffic <UNK> and george clooney are to blame for this they should be tried for war crimes if anyone actually remembers this crap long enough to care
<START> unique movie about confused woman lindsay <UNK> who gets involved with sharp con men joe <UNK> gives an oscar caliber performance as the <UNK> of the group absolutely enchanting first hour as <UNK> shows <UNK> the <UNK> of his con games story line <UNK> a bit later on but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world definitely worth a shot
<START> this is one of the few movies i watched twice in the theatre i really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero <UNK> <UNK> he makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption isn't this a rather <UNK> thought br br when i watched it for the first time i thought that after the won election the movie would be over i didn't know the book so boy was i wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come i was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the film br br many people here utterly dislike this movie i cannot understand that one single bit maybe those who read the book first are as often with screen adaptations of novels simply disappointed that so many things have remained <UNK> unseen unexplained but as a movie telling a touching story the story of a family the rise and fall of a man the deep compassion of a woman the strength of love and the insanity of hate and <UNK> this movie is simply splendid furthermore the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well especially <UNK> <UNK> and jeremy <UNK> br br so definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for
<START> jane <UNK> emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen <UNK> <UNK> emma is <UNK> gwyneth paltrow with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography is able to bring out the comedy effectively she fails to make emma likeable paltrow is not aided by the fact that her <UNK> are simply <UNK> for the part and i believe the era and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses kate beckinsale on the other hand manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr <UNK> the most romantic of jane <UNK> heroes actually sees in her mark strong is a splendid mr <UNK> with the right mix of handsome looks an appropriate age <UNK> compassion and <UNK> behaviour emma and mr <UNK> are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful
<START> wow i have seen some really bad movies in my time but this one truly takes the cake it's the worst movie i've seen in the past decade no exaggeration br br as a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film not because it brought back memories far from it but because there was absolutely no attempt at authenticity to be found anywhere in the film not so much as the <UNK> little shred it seemed like it had been written by an 8 year old child who got all his notions of war and <UNK> behavior straight out of comic books the film was made in <UNK> which should have been a clue but even that can't fully explain the atrocious production values of this cliché ridden piece of trash br br i could try to list all the endless technical flaws but it would take virtually forever from the ancient unit shoulder <UNK> which have not been seen or worn since wwii and the character's name <UNK> like <UNK> worn by the character colonel collins which was actually spelled using the <UNK> mirror image n of the russian <UNK> not the us <UNK> the list just goes on and on the uniforms the equipment the plot and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves every single scene was just chock full of ridiculous flaws inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichés br br neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable it was all laughably childish in the extreme this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre <UNK> boys and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd br br in short this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all it's a total waste of time i'd strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by it's truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for
<START> don't get me wrong i'm a huge fan of many of <UNK> movies obviously his late 70's masterpieces annie hall interiors manhattan and most of his late 80's early 90's dramas hannah crimes and <UNK> husbands and wives in fact i even liked some of his more recent efforts melinda anything else small time crooks but this was abysmal i though it couldn't possibly be any worse than last years match point but how wrong i was br br it was <UNK> plotted basically a cross between match point manhattan murder mystery and small time crooks with all the jokes taken out woody seems to be on the way out as well <UNK> most of his lines and delivering <UNK> <UNK> 'i mean that with all due respect ' over and over until the <UNK> of it all becomes to much to bare br br i know that most actors are <UNK> up to work with him but they should at least read the script first scarlett johansson and hugh jackman are so much better than this and woody should really take a more behind the camera role in future if he has any sense about 20 miles behind it br br it wouldn't be so tragic if we didn't have so many great woody films to compare this to but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort woody should call it a day before he becomes an industry joke br br embarrassingly bad
<START> i originally scored <UNK> show with a nice fat 8 but i've <UNK> a bit with her humor of late and a thin 7 is what's settled in i shall explain br br you will either like <UNK> humor or you won't if you don't i doubt anyone could <UNK> you you folks know who you are and it's perfectly fine but then you know that too moving on the first season gave us fantastic bits about sarah her friends and family and her <UNK> in life in one memorable episode she is pulled over by officer jay whom she meets for the first time do you know why i am standing here he asks because you got all <UNK> in high school she <UNK> replies it seemed to be a genuine question that is funny stuff in my book sarah can come at you from odd angles in another episode her affair with god was notably funny god being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke it is clever it is a twisted view but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughed br br then came the second season while still not without some new and inventive comedy we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal <UNK> and fart jokes quite simply i get some good laughs here and there but much of it seems like filler while she and the writers struggle to <UNK> some original material <UNK> and tiresome are the feelings i have for the episodes lately but i have been <UNK> it out for the gems i do find the turtle and waiting for her to turn it around i was a fan of her jesus is magic routine and would like to think that i understand what she is capable of let's get back to that
<START> i disliked this movie for numerous reasons within the first ten minutes of the film i grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself for me at least that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had <UNK> unfortunately that did not occur the two draws of the movie for me were to see jane fonda and <UNK> <UNK> i don't know enough about lindsey <UNK> work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film afterward i just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were moments in each of their performances i imagine that for each of them to find their moments was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog although the plot is an interesting one the movie on the whole is so poorly written directed and edited that <UNK> performance as an actor would suffer and be <UNK> by it the <UNK> way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of small town america i think were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it's mark as one reviewer has noted and i would agree the movie is almost impossible to market given it's finished form i suspect that or at least hope that for the actor's <UNK> anyway there are some real gems on the cutting room floor sad for us but if that's true then the actors can take <UNK> in that and feel somewhat good about <UNK> their talents and time to such a flop oh yeah and another thing i wished for just once i could go see an american movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully <UNK> settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren't <UNK> and or <UNK> <UNK> the country side with pop <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and other such trash
<START> this was a movie that i had heard about all my life growing up but had never seen it until a few years ago it's reputation truly <UNK> it i knew of michael myers had seen the mask saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed but i was growing up during the decade where jason and freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game and never thought much of the halloween franchise boy how i was being cheated with cheap knock offs br br halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie now by today's standards it isn't as graphic and visceral but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today the atmosphere that john carpenter creates is so creepy and the fact that it is set in a quaint mid west town is a testament to his ability the lighting effects are down right horrifying with the shape seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will the simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense br br the performances by all the players are well done with specific <UNK> to jamie lee curtis and donald <UNK> ms curtis is such a good laurie <UNK> because she is so likable and vulnerable it is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by michael myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her we want her to survive and get away br br donald <UNK> plays dr <UNK> like a man on a mission and it works well he adds a sense of urgency to the <UNK> the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets br br overall not only is halloween a great horror movie but also a great film it works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up this should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie and for an even more <UNK> time try watching it alone with the lights off don't be surprised if you think you see the shape lurking around in the shadows
<START> without question the worst film i've seen for a long while i endured to the end because surely there must be something here but no the plot when not dealing in clichés <UNK> to the point of non existence dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed characters never develop beyond sketches set pieces are clichéd worse considering its co director the photography is only so so br br comments elsewhere that elevate this alongside get carter long good friday or <UNK> <UNK> are way way off the mark lives of the saints lacks their <UNK> let alone their depth and <UNK> in short their craft a ruthless editor could probably <UNK> it down to a decent 30 minute short but as it stands it's a <UNK> form film project realised on a million pound scale rambling and <UNK> with its own <UNK> that it received funding surely only because of <UNK> name while other small films struggle for cash is depressing for the british film industry
<START> for the life of me i can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movie and i think i have the <UNK> to say so i am a former special <UNK> soldier with 14 years in the lifestyle this movie was totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone that did very little research into life in the army in combat or at a team or platoon level br br three <UNK> guys <UNK> around bagdad on their own get real no chain of command get real <UNK> <UNK> buildings get real <UNK> military intelligence sniper <UNK> buck sergeant get real wait i shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me without firing another shot or being injured at all get real i <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> while i am only armed with a 9 <UNK> break into another civilians house get <UNK> by his wife then make it back to camp on foot in the middle of bagdad at night without as so much as a scratch or confrontation get real br br there is absolutely no <UNK> to military <UNK> army and no resemblance at all to any army unit that i have even encountered totally unbelievable and <UNK> to the men and women of <UNK> who contrary to this poor film are not wild <UNK> seeking <UNK> but extremely <UNK> professionals doing an incredibly hard job
<START> i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting no no no no it cannot end here there are too many unanswered questions the engagement of the <UNK> <UNK> disappearance <UNK> <UNK> the zombie was little brother saved by his father and what about the head <UNK> then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably wouldn't be true to lars von <UNK> vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned granted it would be hard to find someone to play <UNK> as the character deserves <UNK> the doctor you love to hate i think i have yet to see a more self absorbed oblivious self righteous character on screen but i could overlook a change in actors i just have to know how it ends
<START> 1993 was the year this was long before phillip seymour thomas had won an oscar who knew i would be an extra in a movie with him i was actually a paid extra in my <UNK> back which was shot in a <UNK> of austin called <UNK> <UNK> the original title was johnny zombie thank god the producers had a change of heart i was in the theater scene i rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters it is more of a comedy than a horror movie but for a good laugh you might want to check it out nothing that is even close to dawn of the dead or even shaun of the dead quality but the cheese factor is good enough <UNK>
<START> it's easy to forget once later series had developed the alien conspiracy plot arc more that once upon a time the x <UNK> wrote episodes like <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> where the aliens weren't all little grey men or mind control <UNK> but could actually surprise you br br <UNK> <UNK> starts with an invisible elephant actually an elephant somehow <UNK> in space and time not a mile away from the walk and ends with a pregnant gorilla being <UNK> and it's very much an episode of wonderful moments the subplot is annoyingly worthy yeah we get it <UNK> are bad except when they're not but the ideas that within it are fascinating visually powerful and very memorable and it covers an angle on <UNK> that is largely overlooked why would humans be the only things that aliens are interested in br br in the end it wasn't an instant classic but it was enjoyable viewing while it lasted again very memorable and mainly it's something that you couldn't imagine many other shows doing
<START> horrible ending and i can't believe moore spent a year coming up with it <UNK> of l ron <UNK> and <UNK> which <UNK> claimed to pen in just three weeks this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my <UNK> from the first 3 5 years now the first 1 5 hours were action packed though absurd in the premise and then it <UNK> into a slow painful <UNK> <UNK> of the series unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was were we to think more deeply if i wanted a lesson in a <UNK> i would <UNK> daniel <UNK> <UNK> absurd to think <UNK> people would give up everything for a fresh start absurd to throw in a disappearing <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> and six absurd to throw in the <UNK> eve just absurd
<START> i caught this film at a test screening was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story well acted natasha <UNK> is the next julia roberts the male lead was <UNK> very funny film takes place in the best locations in new york made me want to go there i just saw you've got mail i thought it had to be <UNK> was a much better story <UNK> br br it was clean and great for whole family i think it will do well audience i saw it with loved it a definite recommend
<START> i have nothing against religious movies religious people need something to watch on a saturday night i guess but what really <UNK> me off is when the write up on the dvd box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer passing off religious propaganda as entertainment is not cool <UNK> br br and even if i was a religious person i would have to agree with most of the other posters here this movie was a mess poorly directed poorly acted poorly edited and the attempt at a soundtrack was hilarious the fake accents were terrible the characters were mainly stereotypes and continuity was out the window the only reason we sat through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead should have just gone to bed br br absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie unless you are the religious type who will immediately <UNK> anything that will <UNK> your beliefs to the <UNK> even if it's a pile of garbage if you aren't avoid this at all costs do not be <UNK> by the box write up
<START> ok i didn't know what to expect when i saw the cover to fido honestly when i came across it in the video store i was tempted to rent this movie but nothing about it really grabbed my attention but when i was looking around in netflix they were advertising this like crazy if i liked goofy scary movies so i figured to just give it a shot i'm so glad that i did watch it this was just a great movie it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch like i said it's <UNK> meets night of the living dead it's just a great concept what does happen after a mega zombie attack as we see in another zombie comedy shaun of the dead they have fun by making the zombies left over as handy citizens this is a very overlooked horror comedy movie i think a lot of people were just so blown away with shaun of the dead that this got the boot but it's a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie br br in a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies this radiation still <UNK> humanity as all those who die after the original <UNK> turn into the undead in order to continue living normal lives <UNK> are <UNK> with the help of a <UNK> corporation named <UNK> <UNK> provides <UNK> with accompanying remote controls to control the <UNK> <UNK> for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants in the town of <UNK> a housewife helen buys a zombie in spite of her husband <UNK> zombie <UNK> their son timmy befriends the zombie <UNK> him fido one day <UNK> collar <UNK> and he kills their next door neighbor who turns into a zombie timmy kills the <UNK> neighbor when a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor they capture fido and timmy helen comes and <UNK> timmy and fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing several days later the <UNK> body is found and the murder is <UNK> back to fido who is taken away to <UNK> where the public is told he will be destroyed timmy learns through a friend that fido is simply working in a factory at <UNK> timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get fido back br br i really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it it's so silly but a lot of fun billy <UNK> did a great job as fido and really brought no pun intended a lot of life into the character i think the scene that made me laugh the most was when timmy has to <UNK> the old lady that fido attacked and killed his last words to her were so funny you weren't really nice but you liked flowers <UNK> and he <UNK> her in the garden not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend sick disturbing wrong but classic laughs i still love how even though this is like the leave it to <UNK> esquire type of world there still is a lot of gore in the movie so if you do have a chance to see fido take it i promise some good laughs br br 9 10
<START> this horror movie is really weak that is if this is the correct movie i am commenting on nothing really terrible goes on as a family <UNK> a cute little german shepard <UNK> i had a german shepard and it is a really good dog i did not get the idea to get one from this movie though but rather from the comedy k 9 that is another story all together though this movie really doesn't have much horror at all as the most horrific scene is at the end and it looks really cheesy also we see a guy almost put his hand into a lawn <UNK> that is about it the father suspects something though as his family seems to be getting rather strange somewhere he finds out if you hold a mirror to them while they are sleeping you can see if they are possessed all in all a really weak horror movie even by television standards television movies that do work are out there as this house possessed is pretty good and there is another haunted house movie about a woman and these strange creatures that is also rather good this one is really rather dull
<START> in the world of old school kung fu movies where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen it took a lot for a film to stand out and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years what is arguably chang <UNK> finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry from the themes of loyalty <UNK> and revenge as explored by john woo who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang during the <UNK> of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980's to more modern movies like a man called hero which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film the influence has also carried into other areas as well from music such as the wu <UNK> clan tv commercials for <UNK> and video games such as mortal <UNK> so what makes this movie so special the plot on the surface is pretty simple it deals with members of a rogue group known as the poison clan who are searching for a treasure hidden by their <UNK> all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities <UNK> by their animal styles or <UNK> the lizard can climb walls the <UNK> has a deadly strike etc the twist is that since the clan always wears masks not all of them known who the others are thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller we're not talking the usual suspects here but it's far above many other kung fu movies of the time supposedly golden <UNK> was not too happy with <UNK> script like most of his movies they felt it was too dark and violent and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it thankfully chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script which has since has become <UNK> as one of the best for the films of its time if not ever <UNK> an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect <UNK> for the extraordinary action sequences br br but what really <UNK> the movie are the <UNK> themselves chang <UNK> hit upon a magical formula with the cast not only did he gain talented martial artists whose moves <UNK> without the aid of <UNK> or other special effects put most modern martial artists to shame but great actors as well the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the <UNK> in his later movies getting back to matters at hand in most old school movies the actors seem to playing out cardboard <UNK> but here the actors actually create characters it seems that everyone has a favorite <UNK> mine is philip <UNK> best known to many as mad dog from hard boiled as lizard and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly <UNK> <UNK> which makes it a true classic of the genre even if you're normally not a fan of old school movies you need to check the five deadly <UNK> out if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from
<START> i don't really post comments but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film it's an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever on a technical level it's completely amateur constant unintentional jump edits within scenes dubbing wildly off etc the plot is completely clichéd the structure is laughable and the acting is embarrassing i don't want to be too harsh i've made my share of student films and they were all awful but there's no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see it br br safe <UNK> that much like the cast positive comments are filmmakers friends and family
<START> i loved this show so much and i'm so incredibly sad its canceled i thought it came back too but just two stupid weeks thats terrible i hate how we never find out how everyone ends up it sucks bring it back abc has stupid shows like <UNK> and <UNK> but doesn't give time to good ones like six degrees if they're complaining about ratings it was probably because they had a bad <UNK> because this was truly a good show something i could relate to and anticipated <UNK> <UNK> delivered he's awesome i wish abc could just trust him enough to complete the story i loved the entire cast too i couldn't wait to see how everyone would someday meet each other at once everyone's story is now left <UNK> now i'll never know if steven and <UNK> would get together or carlos and mae i wanted to see what would happen to laura or <UNK> and everyone else this is really such a <UNK>
<START> it makes the actors in <UNK> look like the royal shakespeare company this movie is jaw dropping in how appalling it is turning the dvd player off was not a sufficient course of action i want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face i will never get that time back never how is it possible to create such a banal boring and soulless film i could not think of a course of action that would <UNK> the tedium writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a <UNK> piece of cinema what more can you say than <UNK> how truly awful the acting is please avoid
<START> <UNK> parade is among the best of the 1930's musical comedy <UNK> a snappy script and an all star cast including jimmy cagney the lovely joan blondell dick powell and ruby keeler make this film a cut above the rest directed and choreographed by the creative genius busby berkeley this film will have you <UNK> from ear to ear from start to finish br br busby of course is the <UNK> master of the hollywood musical with gold <UNK> of 1933 and <UNK> street to his credit as dance director <UNK> parade is <UNK> by hundreds of scantily clad chorus girls a berkeley trademark the elaborate dance numbers were shot with only one camera and busby was the first director to film close ups of the dancers his obsession with <UNK> legs and rear view shots is <UNK> demonstrated here the overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing br br our boy jimmy cagney plays <UNK> kent a producer of <UNK> or short musical stage productions that were performed in movie theaters to entertain the audience before the <UNK> were shown he's surrounded by crooked partners a corporate spy and a gold digging girlfriend although cagney had a solid background in vaudeville this was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents joan blondell is memorable as <UNK> wise cracking <UNK> secretary and ruby keeler is adorable as always br br the film <UNK> with three outstanding production numbers honeymoon hotel the <UNK> and shanghai <UNK> each one a masterpiece and not likely to be <UNK> in today's hollywood where so called special effects have replaced creative cinematography br br <UNK> bottom line clever and erotic with some of the best musical production numbers ever put on celluloid a thoroughly enjoyable depression era romp
<START> basically cruel intentions 2 is cruel intentions 1 again only poorly done the story is exactly the same as the first one even some of the lines with only a few exceptions the cast is more unknown and definitely less talented instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it i ended up feeling dirty because it <UNK> to watching a soft core porn i'm not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writers and i always feel bad saying that because i know how hard it is to do both but it was basically a two hour waste of my life it literally <UNK> me that some movies get made and this is no exception i can't believe they'd make a third one
<START> end of the world is an <UNK> movie which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth the main character is some kind of scientist i'm not exactly sure what kind he has two jobs at a government facility <UNK> by four security men his first job is <UNK> <UNK> to and from space although this actually seems more like a <UNK> he does when not working on job 2 job 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room at least that's the best i can figure apparently the plant is not exactly top secret as the scientist brings his wife there she hangs out they're on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space major earth <UNK> repeated over and over he says something about it being the first message from space he's ever been able to <UNK> his wife tells him they're going to be late for the dinner party so they leave and go to the party moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major <UNK> from there the movie goes nowhere yes christopher lee is in it but that really doesn't help much besides lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii this movie is boring but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z grade sci fi plus there's lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed
<START> slight spoilers br br way back before <UNK> was made before <UNK> <UNK> was an idol and household name for many anime fans and before <UNK> had reached the status of <UNK> <UNK> was made with only wings of <UNK> made by <UNK> at that time and the famous <UNK> shorts or course <UNK> had some tough acts to follow up it didn't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before space opera br br luckily <UNK> decided to put it out as a six part <UNK> direct to video series this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film this also <UNK> it from becoming too boring and overly long with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way besides that they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera <UNK> used in <UNK> or gundam and many other popular space operas br br for one the shows starts out pretty light with <UNK> in the <UNK> high school for <UNK> <UNK> is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle when she was still a little kid this makes her life at the academy quite hard as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that <UNK> is <UNK> by the <UNK> the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced and <UNK> and <UNK> best girl in class are chosen to help the assembled fleet out br br the middle bulk of <UNK> leaves our female lead in space focusing on both personal drama and action a couple more characters are introduced and parts of <UNK> past are dragged up again besides that the alien threat becomes more <UNK> every minute and the <UNK> <UNK> final hope is presented smart as writer <UNK> was he <UNK> the principles of time <UNK> to spice things up a bit in short time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light this means that <UNK> can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete also the dramatic aspect of this is <UNK> when <UNK> sees her friends again on her return to base who have aged considerably more than her the science might not be perfect but it's presented in a pretty believable way with even some <UNK> science theatre shorts in between the episodes where <UNK> <UNK> and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series br br the animation for a series made in the 80s is definitely good the designs are retro 80s style of course but it has it's charm animation is <UNK> enough and the character designs are nice although the costumes do <UNK> br br some of the <UNK> fascination <UNK> will later exploit to the <UNK> the <UNK> throughout the shows are pretty cool too with the <UNK> as the ultimate killing machine strong and vast the last episode was entirely done in black and white while it's generally believed but not confirmed that this was done for budget reasons it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series which is suited perfectly for the latter part br br the music is very typical space opera fair too <UNK> in places very generic and definitely not worth buying it does fit the series for the most part but it can become quite annoying at times <UNK> is not really a famous composer and the only other respectable series he's worked on is dragon half if you think 80s anime music you will know what to expect br br as the series progresses the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this step by step the drama will be toned down and the battles will take the front row neither aspect is ever left completely out though with the last episode in sight <UNK> and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind and with the last battle in sight certain questions are presented to the audience concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can go to guarantee self <UNK> while they are never answered later on they still present some interesting food for thought the last episode is very epic with a nice but quite predictable ending though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course again it fits the series br br <UNK> may sound like your average space opera anime at first with alien <UNK> huge battles and some personal drama and for the bigger part it is but it is done exceptionally well for a change instead of going for a steady mix of former elements six episodes long <UNK> presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic <UNK> along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed out characters which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time <UNK> phenomenon the show is very tightly written although it does tend to slip up at some points overly dramatic <UNK> and too cheesy <UNK> attacks could have been easily avoided overall the trip <UNK> takes you on is a very relaxed sometimes sad sometimes heroic one it might not have <UNK> the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre but at least it bend them a little highly enjoyable anime classic but not without flaws br br
<START> this film evil breed the legend of <UNK> contains very little thought or effort it is <UNK> with <UNK> of ultra fast slasher style death and plain disgusting acts of death the acting was rated a d as the actors show very little ability and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable the way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different the odd split of porn is fit in thought it really doesn't offer much and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death example is the poor fellow whom is <UNK> from his <UNK> and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes it is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up this film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture
<START> this is an ok adaptation but not as good as the tv version the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again i preferred kate <UNK> emma there are excellent support performances from toni collette juliet <UNK> and <UNK> thompson br br the script is often played too much for laughs the book is a comedy but there are too many set piece gags here and also the frank <UNK> subplot is almost completely absent br br my biggest criticism is the scenery it is far too lush england has never been like this it looks like a chocolate box only americans would make it like this br br despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more
<START> this movie i have been dying to see well it took till now to decide to actually rent it it was completely worth it this movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end chris rock is funny no matter which movie he is in however this should come real close to being his greatest if <UNK> <UNK> for a family movie ie pre teens and up then this is one u can't pass over
<START> this is what i was expecting when star trek <UNK> premiered not to slight <UNK> that was a wonderful show in it's own right however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted enterprise is that show while having a similarity to the original trek it <UNK> enough to be original in it's own ways it makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again and that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved another <UNK> to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members viewers really cared deeply for the crew enterprise has much promise in this area as well the chemistry between <UNK> and <UNK> seems very promising while sexual tension in a show can often become a <UNK> i feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical i think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even we get some very interesting ideas and television also we should note the performances <UNK> is very convincing as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> really has a <UNK> and strength of character that delivers a great performance the rest of the cast delivered good performances also my only <UNK> are as follows the theme it's good it's different but a little to light hearted for my liking we need something a little more grand doesn't have to be <UNK> maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice and my one other complaint they sell too many adds they could fix this by selling less ads or making all shows two <UNK> otherwise we'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of voyager
<START> soon after watching this film you will realize why it didn't even make it to the theaters this movie does not deserve the prequel tag instead this is a common theme in hollywood rip off previously good movies with disastrous <UNK> sequels etc br br this film's plot was <UNK> all over the place like a <UNK> <UNK> ball and the character development was non existent i seriously felt like i was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad p <UNK> needs to stop <UNK> movies with his horrible acting he actually made me laugh every time br br the only good thing that comes out of this movie is <UNK> <UNK> who looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some enjoyment from watching this film br br if you are a big carlito's way fan i recommend you not watch this if you decide to watch it anyway then treat this movie as if it ripped off the original because that is exactly what it did
<START> ever since i started visiting this site and voting for movies i have never given any movie a rating of 1 even the disturbing dance <UNK> with <UNK> got a 2 there is a reason for this br br any time i find myself watching what i think is a really bad movie i have to stop and ask myself the following question is this movie really as bad as the horrific soul sucking beast that is <UNK> <UNK> and i've never been able to answer yes br br i would give anything within reason to know what <UNK> said hey let's remake <UNK> <UNK> with barney in the harrison ford role and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film furthermore i want to know what the hell kind of market they were going to sell this towards if it hadn't gone <UNK> to video this is that rare monster a movie that is way too violent for kids and way too insanely stupid for adults i'd ask what were they thinking but in this case it might actually be redundant br br anyhow all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you're one of the five or six <UNK> fans of howard the duck or if you are curious to see the most evil insane movie of all time or you want to really <UNK> yourself
<START> i absolutely loved this show i watched it from the time it first aired in the late 90's to the very last episode in my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children yes things have changed a bit with jo since we last saw her in the books but it's still compelling with great stories and good lessons the actress that portrays jo <UNK> michelle burke does a wonderful job as does as the actor who plays nick <UNK> spencer <UNK> throughout the series we get to see the developing romance between jo and nick as well as the daily stories and lessons the kids and students learn i recommend this show to anyone
<START> it takes guts to make a movie on gandhi in india in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong this movie shows how a <UNK> failed to be a decent father at least in the eyes of his son br br the performances are terrific the cinematography fantastic the direction fabulous but the film drags if the intention was to make this movie without any box office expectations which i assume is the case here then its a brilliant attempt but if the makers were expecting this to be a commercial success then the film's fate was doomed the day they chose this subject br br 20 <UNK> from now this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of harilal by <UNK> <UNK> he deserves an oscar nomination for this one and honestly his is not the only performance worth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is terrific too br br watch the scene where harilal hears about his father's death no dialogues no screaming but a speechless shot by <UNK> its one of the finest scenes ever shot in the history of cinema br br gandhi my father is not at all exciting cinema but yes its excellent cinema and a must watch brilliant attempt
<START> what would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a <UNK> guy bar all smooth <UNK> until he takes his bachelor hat off what would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her what would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his <UNK> a new low right well paul coleman played <UNK> by jason lee leads this experience of a <UNK> <UNK> and a new low i got to say this is one of his good leading roles however i do believe his role in vanilla sky was better acted br br his <UNK> named karen is played by the up and down actress <UNK> blair while <UNK> character <UNK> is played by the lovely and talented julia stiles getting back to where we left off paul now has to deal with one <UNK> problem to another he gets <UNK> has to deal with certain people and has to play his lie games with stealth or any member of each of the families could get p <UNK> including one of his relatives that hasn't had a <UNK> movement for 14 days vomit all of this leads to the long <UNK> wedding with one hilarious scene before it <UNK> all the hell that paul and his brother had to go through br br overall a guy thing is quite funny and is all right sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes here and there but it's a mixed movie and if you're a canadian and a fellow fan of the <UNK> brett butt sitcom corner gas you'd recognize a small role played by fred <UNK> the same man who plays the hilarious hank in the series this movie is all right it's another <UNK> in lee's hat quite an empty hat so far however br br my rating 7 10 br br <UNK> a
<START> the movie is a total crap we have two good actors who are miscast and a meat head of an actor salman khan just to attract the female audience the story is a crap the characters poorly <UNK> non existent story telling no editing to speak of ajay <UNK> as a rock star that is a dream in itself the movie drags along to the point of <UNK> the whole <UNK> about <UNK> bringing his <UNK> to london let him <UNK> his girlfriend and let him not play at <UNK> <UNK> in the dubbing process is absurd salman <UNK> over the top acting or <UNK> is too painful to watch i remember seeing some good movies from this producer <UNK> shah but this is not one of them it seems all the good directors are falling prey to the box office <UNK> that the <UNK> media morons have created this is yet another crap movie in the lines of wanted with idiot actor like salman khan who has no place in a good hindi cinema he is good to the indian cinema as titanic was to the winter cruise business on a positive note i like <UNK> character dancing <UNK> when she changes to the western style dancing when the teacher is not looking
<START> this movie proves that you can't judge a movie by the awesome artwork on the dvd cover it also goes to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it or get it for someone at christmas the beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising well until you meet the characters <UNK> jack the old guy from down the street brings the college co <UNK> a book full of <UNK> spells that he leaves at their <UNK> haunted house where the movie takes place after that there is some drinking fighting and soft core porn then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour br br overall <UNK> end was predictable <UNK> and reminiscent of a soft core porn this movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do as it is a good movie to make fun of and for first time viewers it is really fun making <UNK> of the order of people who die
<START> now i won't deny that when i purchased this off ebay i had high expectations this was an incredible out of print work from the master of comedy that i so enjoy however i was soon to be disappointed apologies to those who enjoyed it but i just found the <UNK> al to be very difficult to watch i got a few smiles sure but the majority of the funny came from the music videos which i've got on dvd and the rest was basically filler you could tell that this was not <UNK> greatest video achievement that honor goes to <UNK> honestly i doubt if this will ever make the jump to dvd so if you're an ultra hardcore al fan and just have to own everything buy the tape off ebay just don't pay too much for it
<START> well i must say this is probably the worst film i have seen this year the jokes were extremely crude wasn't expecting it from as pg movie rated pg in canada and they weren't funny with this great cast i at least expected some good acting but i didn't even get that i am a huge <UNK> wilson fan and this is the first time i was extremely disappointed by his performance neither luke <UNK> or uma <UNK> characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them i didn't expect this at all as in the past i have really liked other movies by this director six days seven nights for example this movie was not worth the 10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie i guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over
<START> i just saw this movie the other day when i rented it and i thought this was going to be just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point but diane joined boxing because she wanted to i thought this movie was good i gave it a 8 10 that's how good it is plus a movie with michelle rodriguez is always good even is she's been in only six
<START> although this film is somewhat <UNK> because it was made at a time when people just didn't talk about sex it is an extremely helpful short film to show <UNK> girls so they know what to expect during <UNK> not surprisingly it was paid for by the <UNK> company though what may surprise many is that disney made this film as they made a lot of educational films during the 1940s 60s however well made the film is though i think the film <UNK> missed a real opportunity instead of the nice female <UNK> voice and the relatively bland visuals it would have been great if they'd used <UNK> mouse and the rest of the disney gang i know this would have given old walt a heart attack but wow that would have been a great film by the way although the notion of sex is barely hinted at in the film it does adequately explain <UNK> in general however it does lack some details especially about <UNK> that i assume were included in the accompanying <UNK> br br now if only i can figure out why i watched a cartoon about <UNK>
<START> in one word excruciating i was advised to read some <UNK> about this film's philosophical meanings afterward but having sat through the movie's interminable <UNK> minutes and being slowly crushed beneath its <UNK> symbolism and <UNK> flowing <UNK> it seemed better to just report my reactions to the movie after all who goes to see a movie with a <UNK> in hand and this flick was dismal lead actor claude <UNK> from the film's opening to its end wears the same <UNK> and annoying mask of agony as to be practically <UNK> from the film's eternal dreary voice over filming one over the other might have worked better than <UNK> an audience to both as they basically say the same thing the priest of <UNK> is a wretched human being the story about a <UNK> priest who tries to help out a troubled rich family does nothing toward making its characters remotely interesting or sympathetic as the family are a bunch of unpleasant <UNK> and the priest himself comes across as a <UNK> <UNK> the last 30 minutes suggests some breath taking message about grace and one man's suffering <UNK> that of others but due to all the indulgent close ups of a suffering <UNK> and the vague subtext in robert <UNK> script all i felt was finally it's over let's have some ice cream interesting for fans of <UNK> fanatic paul <UNK> just to see how many elements of character and setting <UNK> carried into in his own scripts and movies especially <UNK> raging bull and light sleeper
<START> faithful to the work of pearl s buck whose years spent in china as a child of <UNK> parents that provided her with deep insights into the chinese culture and its philosophy this film adaptation is brilliantly done both in technically artistry and acting br br wang lung is a humble farmer grateful for the <UNK> of life to survive off of his land and to be newly <UNK> to <UNK> a servant to a rich and powerful family in the village area despite wang lung and <UNK> best efforts to farm the land raise kids and build <UNK> and wealth a <UNK> threatens to wipe out everything they have worked for choosing not to sell their land a traditional asian belief they instead journey to a major city to wait out the <UNK> while in the city they are reduced to begging and being just one of hundreds of other unfortunate homeless families although not a <UNK> <UNK> gets caught up in a mob <UNK> at a rich man's house she's <UNK> rounded up for execution by the army but is saved at the last minute her good fortune however is that she found valuable <UNK> at the <UNK> site that <UNK> her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm to start over again the newly found wealth transforms wang lung he becomes selfish self centered and takes credit for the find he becomes a very rich farmer but that only makes matters worse as he increasingly becomes more <UNK> arrogant and difficult to reason with he loses touch with the basic things in life that money can't buy loyalty commitment trust fairness and honesty as punishment nature once again turns the table on wang lung by sending a plague of <UNK> to destroy everything he has brought to his knees wang lung <UNK> the aid of all friends former friends workers and family with all that help he succeeds in saving the farm from that experience he once again returns to <UNK> and an appreciation for the <UNK> in life
<START> the final chapter in the hanzo the razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> blind beast red angel <UNK> in the director's chair but the style is pretty much the same perhaps due to <UNK> <UNK> serving as the producer apart from the titular <UNK> br br hanzo <UNK> a female ghost who is <UNK> treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake of course hanzo being hanzo he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost so he proceeds to rape <UNK> <UNK> her using the now familiar revolving net device the plot takes through a series of blind monks who also <UNK> as <UNK> corrupt officials <UNK> wives and the necessary hack and slash <UNK> superior officer <UNK> and his two servants provide the typical comedic notes and generally it's business as usual br br significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first which is all over the place and a bit of a mess less stylish dramatic and bloody than the second arguably the finest in the hanzo series but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits complete with trademark training sequences the obligatory rape <UNK> and a mystery hanzo is called upon to investigate this will ultimately satisfy the fans
<START> look there's nothing spectacularly offensive about this film it's just boring it's a typical <UNK> com with an ending you can see coming before you've seen so much as the trailer the key difference is that the classic <UNK> <UNK> tackle their stories with wit and a lack of <UNK> this movie has no <UNK> but it really has no sense of movement you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment the production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago i'd recommend re watching a classic movie like when harry met sally instead of this shallow imitation oh one other big problem no chemistry if you're used to seeing michael looking all cute as vaughn in <UNK> you're going to be seriously disappointed with the way they've made him look here
<START> there is just one word for this film appalling the director clearly has talent but like his character robert <UNK> he throws it all away br br <UNK> has potential but like <UNK> he can't be bothered to use it being drawn into petty crime and then <UNK> into <UNK> is <UNK> vision of british youth like the british <UNK> this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect <UNK> cries out for attention but deserves none br br i was appalled by the act of violence that <UNK> chose to <UNK> in the faces of the audience he assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities like a piece of obscene <UNK> on a toilet wall he shows us male <UNK> with adolescent glee br br some actors of quality have small parts in this film danny <UNK> and leslie <UNK> both make short appearances the acting is otherwise amateur the young men joe and ben are cringe making <UNK> played by daniel spencer is creepy miranda wilson plays monica the attractive wife of <UNK> chef <UNK> michael <UNK> how she was able to subject herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief the film is never subtle and monica is treated to the most gratuitous violence which is cut with war action war imagery is used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves that acts of violence will occur within even <UNK> countries this is most certainly true and is <UNK> of our altered society where males have an increasingly less important position but <UNK> <UNK> to the level of the <UNK> males he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images the female characters in the film offer no relief they are either victims or in <UNK> case a washed out mother the community is represented as dysfunctional br br this is <UNK> first film i listened to what he had to say during a q and a session at <UNK> and he is not <UNK> he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his <UNK> the film is due to be released later this year but i hope the company goes bust <UNK> the public really don't need this kind of messed up material
<START> i watched this show and i simply didn't find it funny at all it might have been the first episode lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them
<START> playing <UNK> <UNK> san <UNK> etc the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream i love watching him interact w amanda blake or don <UNK> or <UNK> he clearly was having a ball and i think he made it easier on his guests as well so long as they knew ahead of time it wasn't a <UNK> 19 take kind of production relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there br br he reminds me of guys like <UNK> <UNK> benny hill maybe jerry lewis some too great timing ancient gags that kept audiences in <UNK> for decades sheer enjoyment about what he was doing his sad little clown he played was good too but in a touching manner br br personally i think he's great having just bought a two dvd set of his shows from <UNK> or so it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me i can remember seeing him on tv at the end of his run when he was <UNK> up the series in 1971 or so br br check this out if you are a fan or curious he was a riot
<START> this is a poem on film wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly <UNK> lake district in the <UNK> it's a love story with a twist the characters are unique and believable the settings are deliciously exotic some of the scenes the funeral boat in the fog the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> floor are beautiful images and rather than the mandatory happy ending this story has a bitter sweet one if film is an art this is close to a masterpiece br br
<START> c'mon people look at the title lol i remember seeing this movie on saturday late night creature features years ago it's a great cheesy monster flick with hilariously bad acting and two wonderfully moronic <UNK> that add to the schlock factor the 2 redneck boat rental guys are the movie lol and you'll love the boat scene where the english guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and it's <UNK> and sunny bloody hilarious you can tell they just didn't care about plot they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible bottom line you'll love it if you love 70's schlock

<START> best animated movie ever made this film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely <UNK> effects but the <UNK> of the human mind soul and philosophy the story features a family of cats where in the big sister dies the younger brother sees this and <UNK> her body but when she <UNK> she is left without a soul so the two sibling cats <UNK> on a journey to find it i have related this journey to many things the history of the world the bible the cycle of life and every time i watch it i discover more and more hidden themes and <UNK> if you aren't so into the <UNK> aspect of it then you will still adore it the animation is superb and the creative scenes will have you attached to the screen for example the ocean <UNK> in time god eating soup out of the earth a strange and slightly <UNK> retelling of <UNK> and <UNK> to conclude cat soup is an absolute treat for anyone br br ps not for kids gratuitous violence included
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting the writing was top notch james <UNK> is a great actor and he showed it here brian keith was too old to be <UNK> <UNK> and can anyone really play <UNK> but <UNK> parker br br another great actor in this move was <UNK> julia who gave depth to santa anna a vain and complex person who led mexico through <UNK> times br br while some may think the movie was slow paced it captured the battle as it <UNK> lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror br br what impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in in this day and age when nobody stands for anything i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time
<START> everyone plays their part pretty well in this little nice movie belushi gets the chance to live part of his life differently but ends up realizing that what he had was going to be just as good or maybe even better the movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have not the ones we do not or cannot have if u can get this movie on video for around 10 <UNK> be an investment
<START> i am currently sitting here forcing myself to finish this i figure i blew 6 <UNK> on the vhs might as well suffer for it i remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for war of the worlds cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time and i missed the old tv series from the early 90's the website make it out that this was a multi million dollar budget rendition of the classic book it was going to be a perfect translation perfect crap is more in tune with this film br br first off the video on this movie was <UNK> it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mid 90's pc or <UNK> cd <UNK> video game sadly enough the color quality was similar the acting made <UNK> classic dramatic pause look damn near shakespearean in quality the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of <UNK> scenes br br secondly it is slow and terribly drawn out i sat thru 45 minutes of the video no <UNK> at the beginning before the <UNK> actually opened to reveal the first alien after that the alien was a terribly constructed cg <UNK> i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien <UNK> i have seen is a spinning silver <UNK> crappy down even attached to a mechanical arm the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done <UNK> the last thing on that for an alien invasion in the turn of the century <UNK> no one is concerned for their life it's like they have no concept even though media was slow word of mouth <UNK> fast and people would have known the illusion of day and night was shoddy at best simply changing the color around the people to purple blue or green does not <UNK> night time perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the hero <UNK> around or walk down silly roads get on with the film i know how people get around you do not need to be so in depth br br now finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines mighty <UNK> power rangers had better looking effects even the <UNK> of <UNK> humans looked as if animated by a <UNK> high school computer <UNK> class student the animations do not match up to the scenery at all br br in closing folks if you want the war of the worlds do one of four things 1 watch the 1953 original 2 watch the early 90's tv series 3 wait for spielberg's rendition to be released shortly or 4 read the <UNK> book something we all probably did in <UNK> english class avoid this movie it is a waste of your money
<START> this is certainly one of my all time <UNK> episodes of trek there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool first the guys <UNK> down to an alien planet thats about to explode they meet a freaky <UNK> type dude very well played then kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like <UNK> century earth mccoy and spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100 000 years in the past kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy <UNK> who was <UNK> to the this frozen awful world by some bad guy br br spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives mccoy a royal <UNK> <UNK> when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out anyhow they all finally escape leaving the poor <UNK> behind it takes a ton of convincing before spock finally gives in and leaves you can literally taste the sadness at the end leaving the <UNK> all alone in her frozen <UNK> just seems cruel and is really touching spock must have been out of his <UNK> mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human albeit in a not so nice neighborhood br br anyway you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode a love story the <UNK> witch trials spock as a human the desperation of being left in total isolation abandoned and three entirely different settings on the alien planet its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film this one is a classic don't miss it i want it on dvd <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> currently this film is listed on imdb as the <UNK> worst film ever made which is exactly why i rented it from netflix however i am <UNK> to report that the film while bad is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list i have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one hardly a glowing <UNK> but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list br br the film begin with stewart moss and <UNK> <UNK> on their <UNK> honeymoon by the way they are married in real life as well he's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave once there they behave very very very <UNK> hallmark of a bad film and are soon bitten by a bat according to this film bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the us both of which are not true at all br br oddly after being bitten the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital the first thing on anyone's mind especially a doctor is to get medical help immediately but not this <UNK> soon he's having <UNK> yet he still isn't interested in seeking help again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history br br after a while he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital but by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood when it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine the wife who like her husband has a <UNK> for a brain refuses to believe he's dangerous even after he attacks people steals an <UNK> and runs a police car off the road br br now most of the time moss is going through these episodes his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person oddly however a couple times he develops bat like hands and towards the end they used some nice <UNK> on him to make him look quite bat like had this been really cheesy the film would have <UNK> a 1 br br in the very end in a twist that hardly made any sense at all the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a <UNK> of bats kill the evil sheriff how all this was arranged was a mystery as was <UNK> and <UNK> belief that this film would somehow help their careers though they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since 1974 br br overall very dumb the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real not a good film at all but not among the worst films of all time either br br note for some reason imdb shows the graphic for the three dvd set for it's alive and it's two sequels of the web page for the bat people while the bat people has been seen with the title it's alive the two movies are not at all related it's easy to understand the mistake especially since they both came out in 1974 but the movie i just reviewed starred stewart moss and <UNK> <UNK> and the other film starred john ryan and sharon farrell
<START> what can one say about elvira that hasn't already been said in the world's press the classic <UNK> that is elvira delivers in her first full length big budget comedy masterpiece br br from the very first movie frame <UNK> elvira packs an acting punch that clearly says film great eat your heart out bette davis see a <UNK> elvira see an <UNK> elvira see a jealous elvira see a murderous elvira you can do nothing but marvel at her acting <UNK> br br at the heart of this comedy masterpiece is <UNK> desire for las vegas show stardom despite putting the <UNK> back in the <UNK> as a horror <UNK> with the <UNK> elvira finds the small screen <UNK> emotionally and physically <UNK> said she packs up her <UNK> and heads east a <UNK> in one hand and a letter from her <UNK> lawyer <UNK> her inheritance <UNK> in the other br br i've seen this movie so many times i can almost <UNK> it <UNK> <UNK> would just be showing off br br grab a copy laugh yourself silly learn the lines br br why she didn't win the best actress oscar for this role is beyond me
<START> hollywood north is an <UNK> from the movie industry as they went to canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a <UNK> city like toronto in this case later in <UNK> peter <UNK> the director probably saw a lot of the <UNK> from california that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the arriving personalities trying to capitalize on the <UNK> that canada presented br br needless to say moon <UNK> the successful novel written by a canadian author is turned into flight to <UNK> which has nothing to do with the original film a great <UNK> has been michael <UNK> who is obsessed with what is happening in iran is offered the lead part which turns to be a disaster br br the film seems to be saying that too many <UNK> have spoiled the <UNK> which seems to be the case with the ultimate product which is saved by its producer bobby myers with the help of sandy ryan who has been around making a documentary of the film being shot in toronto parts of the film are transformed into a cohesive movie at last br br the filming process is hilarious and the acting in general is good
<START> let's value it br br entertainment a trashy script which has been <UNK> by <UNK> people in front of <UNK> a thousand times pathetic acting that is <UNK> by the story ok production value including good set location and gorgeous girl rating 4 10 br br social message the movie has no social message it's thought free but if i pretend i were 10 and my iq were 70 i feel the message is don't be afraid to love rating 0 10 br br <UNK> things nothing special just the mild jewish <UNK> and arrogant attitude that is presented by the writer director generally speaking good nothing <UNK> 8 10 br br overall rating is 4 10
<START> if the themes of the girl from <UNK> sound familiar it should that's because anita <UNK> who wrote the screenplay here also wrote the classic gentlemen prefer <UNK> unlike marilyn monroe in that film jean harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of means br br and it's men of means that jean harlow is after she leaves the road side <UNK> house run by her mother and <UNK> because she's decided that the best way to gain the easy life is to marry it her talents as a chorus girl are limited but she'll be able to trade in on that beauty br br her odyssey starts with her and friend <UNK> kelly getting an <UNK> to perform at a party thrown by millionaire lewis stone but <UNK> to jean <UNK> just having a wild last <UNK> before doing himself because of the <UNK> he owes not owns still she <UNK> a few <UNK> from him that fellow millionaire lionel barrymore notices br br <UNK> amused by it until jean sets her sights on his playboy son <UNK> tone after that he is not amused and he looks to shake jean from climbing the family tree br br the girl from <UNK> went into production mid adaption of the code so it went under peculiar censorship i've a feeling we would have seen a much more <UNK> film still jean harlow as a younger and <UNK> version of mae west is always appreciated what a great comic talent that woman had seeing the girl from <UNK> is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film <UNK> with her passing three years later br br ironically enough the casting of <UNK> kelly with harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts kelly was making with another famous <UNK> blonde thelma todd harlow and kelly have the same easy chemistry between that <UNK> had with thelma todd would also die a year later in a freak accident suicide homicide that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given br br don't miss the girl from <UNK> it's bright and sassy must be from all that <UNK> jewelry

<START> this is a story of the winchester rifle model <UNK> the gun that won the west to <UNK> outlaw peace officer or soldier the winchester 73 was a <UNK> possession an indian would sell his soul to own one br br winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director anthony mann and actor james stewart a duo that would go on to create a run of superior westerns that added a new psychological depth to the genre the story sees stewart as lin <UNK> pursuing the man who killed his father riding into dodge city with his <UNK> friend johnny williams <UNK> mitchell lin runs into dutch henry brown stephen <UNK> the man he wants but with <UNK> <UNK> will <UNK> having taken all the guns from those entering the town both men are unable to have the shoot out that they are ready for the men instead square up in a competition to win a winchester 73 rifle a competition that lin eventually wins but before he can leave town with the magnificent prize dutch <UNK> him steals the rifle and <UNK> town fast as lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle the rifle will changed hands a number of times with each time adding another dimension as the day of <UNK> for all approaches br br very much a <UNK> for what became known as the so called psychological western winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past tho shot in black and white the only one of the <UNK> westerns that was the landscapes are still breathtaking <UNK> for the eyes the tone is set with the opening scene as lin and johnny on <UNK> and in <UNK> <UNK> over a <UNK> as they make their way to dodge city it's just the starting point that would see mann use his <UNK> as a way of running <UNK> with his characters emotional states br br stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as <UNK> proving once and for all that he was one of <UNK> finest and most versatile actors the support cast isn't too bad either shelley winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the <UNK> while mitchell <UNK> <UNK> and the always great dan duryea add further class to proceedings there's even bit parts for tony curtis and rock hudson in here tho the latter playing an indian brave is a stretch too far br br originally the film was a project for fritz lang who even had the script ready to run but lang walked away from it something that proved to be a <UNK> for western fans for as great as a director that lang was with mann directing and with a new script from <UNK> chase robert richards in hands it set the <UNK> in motion to alter the course of the genre not only with the further efforts that mann stewart produced but also in who they influenced the likes of <UNK> <UNK> nicholas ray and sam fuller were all taking notes and <UNK> for the western <UNK> they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further br br a big hit at the box office back on release winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age 9 5 10
<START> this movie has always been my <UNK> disney movie then on 11 21 <UNK> i saw the <UNK> <UNK> of this movie dvd wow i remembered why i loved this movie the dvd is so great it has an extra 30 min that the original did not have i did not know this when i first started watching the movie made ever so much more since the music they cut out should have been left in you have not seen this movie until you have seen the full <UNK> min version a lot of people say that the music is forgettable i remember every song in this movie by heart every song has it's own charm by it's self and comes together as a hole i remember when i was younger i had the <UNK> song stuck in my head for days at a time as well as <UNK> sea that song was meant for marry <UNK> but was cut out of the film please watch the new uncut <UNK> <UNK> movie and re vote for this movie the 10 that it really is
<START> i saw the original chorus line on broadway god knows how many times and felt the passion despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater michael bennett knew he would have to re imagine chorus for the screen but could never figure out how to do it if the man who came up with the show is <UNK> that should answer your question there are some shows that are simply made to be seen live with an audience however richard attenborough fresh of the musical work of <UNK> and dancing with animals in doctor <UNK> ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show horrible songs were added surprise surprise great songs were dropped or given to other characters which didn't make sense michael douglas was <UNK> cast people that couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy <UNK> woman who couldn't sing act or dance i guess she had just finished being <UNK> wife the dances by jeffrey <UNK> look like nothing more than schlock from <UNK> rejects and nothing works i sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be <UNK> to nothing if you truly love this show and it is coming back to broadway in 2006 see it but don't think that the long running musical event that was a chorus line has any thing at all to do with this film
<START> i saw this film while at <UNK> southern college in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the red balloon both films are similar in their dream like quality the bulk of the film <UNK> a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner a little boy is away at school a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are and begins to <UNK> stalk his prey the boy begins his walk home from school and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend the fish becomes <UNK> by the <UNK> presence and finally jumps out of the bowl the cat quickly walks over to the fish gently picks him up with his <UNK> and returns him to his bowl the boy returns happily to his fish none the <UNK> br br the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity it is hard to imagine how the director could've pulled the technical feat back in 1959 it seems more a trick for 2003 br br if you can find it watch it you won't be disappointed and if you do find it let me know so i can get a copy too
<START> i don't know why i like this movie so well but i never get tired of watching it
<START> despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural <UNK> not on the <UNK> apparently br br a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural <UNK> she watched unfold before her eyes in a later conversation she said imagine a <UNK> director making a movie in <UNK> about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and <UNK> as the <UNK> worse imagine dressing the scarlet o'hara female lead in a period <UNK> <UNK> missing the <UNK> and sporting a 1950's <UNK> maybe some people in <UNK> might not realize that the <UNK> <UNK> was missing the <UNK> or recognize the bizarre jane <UNK> hair but in <UNK> they would not believe their eyes or ears and be laughing in the <UNK> excellent story and photography be damned br br so watching <UNK> of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances actual geisha or japanese dress and that was the topic of the movie hollywood is amazing in its <UNK> view of film making they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films <UNK> embarrassingly wrong i thought the last samurai was the <UNK> achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be <UNK> of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time
<START> tell the truth <UNK> a bit <UNK> to see all these positive review by so many people which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie and after having seen it i was really a disappointed and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie br br <UNK> surprise at this movie all completely â it is like a <UNK> movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children <UNK> and swearing <UNK> not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account br br synopsis the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak br br just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done the story is very predictable though expected and the humor is lame and <UNK> we already seen the same characters play by <UNK> <UNK> in so many other movies like sasquatch gang i think i laugh <UNK> and almost fell a sleep br br well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay and the acting is so so as expected when <UNK> watching this type of movie and the direction what do one expect this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer and that movie also sucks but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie br br anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie <UNK> really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone br br pros elizabeth bank two topless scenes br br cons not funny dreadful story nudity and kids do not mix together br br rating 3 5 10 grade f
<START> plan b has the appearance of a quickly made <UNK> sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved an outing that should have been <UNK> from the start it is just another mafia based <UNK> that has nothing new and <UNK> the standard for those <UNK> br br joe <UNK> paul sorvino is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control his personal assistant mario anthony <UNK> is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny <UNK> has whacked one of his <UNK> who just happens to be married to <UNK> <UNK> diane keaton and <UNK> takes <UNK> on as his assistant to work off her dead husband's debt by being <UNK> <UNK> man' <UNK> is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> instead to transport her <UNK> to florida to hide at her brother <UNK> house until she can figure out what to do next this alternative to killing the three candidates is called plan b plan a being to kill them the ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters br br diane keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and <UNK> but here she screams and <UNK> and <UNK> her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch paul sorvino is well the paul sorvino type cast from other mobster films the supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the <UNK> slapstick <UNK> fashion imaginable what is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone director greg <UNK> needs to go back to tv sitcoms had this flimsy story been <UNK> into a half hour gig it might have had a chance grady <UNK>
<START> im gonna make this short and sweet because i don't think there is much you can really tell someone about this show who has never seen it other than its hilariously funny and unique for me its possibly the funniest show ever br br you have to really watch it to understand its humour and it took me a few episodes to really get into it but once your in there is no getting back out for example the way <UNK> character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomes br br its all round classic i mean the cast the writers the director its just a recipe for success one actor i think who always gets a hard time is <UNK> <UNK> but i mean he's great in this show i don't think its possible for the the character <UNK> to have been played by anyone else it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid all the main characters are great and it wouldn't be a worth while review if i didn't mention the stone cold fox <UNK> <UNK> now thats a <UNK> meet a ball ha ha all joking aside amazing show
<START> i can't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton and sure it's his company but you're fired or you're hired for how many seasons now after watching the show i wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment <UNK> br br i'd love to hear just one person get up and say donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent <UNK> i see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe i hope he gets hurt so i don't have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it i'd give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve that
<START> while movie titles contains the word <UNK> the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother's love for her children br br however the mother tells a different story br br the mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child here <UNK> hill director roger <UNK> tells us how a mother's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her br br before daniel craig takes on the role of james bond here he plays darren a man who is helping to <UNK> the house of the son of the mother and sleeping with her daughter as well anne reid who was a familiar face on tv series takes up the challenging role of the leading character may br br the story begins with may <UNK> with the sudden loss of her husband <UNK> in a family visit to her son bobby while she befriends darren a <UNK> who is doing some <UNK> in <UNK> house she was shocked to found out that her daughter paula was sleeping with darren at the same time may was <UNK> with life after the death of <UNK> <UNK> that harry and paula do not wanted her may starts to find her life going off track until she spends her afternoon with darren br br darren was nice and friendly to may and may soon finds some affection on darren instead of treating him like a friend she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple later may found sexual pleasure from darren where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else and this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family br br the mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life and <UNK> on someone who is there for her to shoulder on this can be told from may buying tea time <UNK> for darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her where it eventually gave her more than she <UNK> for br br anne reid has made a breakthrough for her role of may as she was previously best well known for her various role on tv series as she do not have much movies in her career resume the mother has put her on the <UNK> attention daniel craig on the other hand had took on a similar role in his movie career such as sylvia 2003 and enduring love 2004 if his <UNK> role of james bond fails film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career and the mother is one of them br br the mother may not be everyone's favorite but it is definitely not your usual <UNK> show to go along with tea and <UNK> accompanied by <UNK> and jam
<START> the only way we survived this stinker was by continually making fun of its stupidity funny thing is none of the audience around us seemed to mind we all joined in br br this movie is <UNK> bad its only potential is to become a midnight cult movie that people can <UNK> lines and throw popcorn at
<START> the mind <UNK> at exactly what about universal soldier <UNK> a sequel since the real star dolph lundgren would not be able to <UNK> his role from the original there is already <UNK> reason to <UNK> <UNK> in this obvious tax write off bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael <UNK> white to their credit they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role for once his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times and it does not get irritating the problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor <UNK> that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films and <UNK> lies the problem you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action you go because you want comedy however unintentional br br <UNK> to many people universal soldier was followed by two direct to video sequels i have only seen the first which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke matt <UNK> was so terrible in the role of luc <UNK> that for once in his career the sight of jean claude van damme comes as a welcome relief the film more or less completely <UNK> the stories of the aforementioned direct to video sequels and instead begins a whole new story set an <UNK> time after the events of the original after years of investigation and explanation the <UNK> project is still going ahead with some minor <UNK> for one the new <UNK> are stronger and more damage <UNK> than their earlier cousins for another all of the <UNK> are now under the direction of a <UNK> called seth in the early parts of the film seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass <UNK> br br being that the film barely lasts more than <UNK> minutes we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut the <UNK> project is on the <UNK> block which essentially means that seth will be turned off seth somehow <UNK> this conversation through means that are never really explained decides to <UNK> the <UNK> as an army against those seeking to shut him down his only problem is that every so often a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic <UNK> two individuals possess the code in question seth kills the first in short order and those who are familiar with the plot <UNK> that van <UNK> films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be the rest of the film revolves around the <UNK> attempts to get the code out of van damme without <UNK> him too badly a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting br br the film is loaded to the <UNK> with ridiculous lines and clichés when seth <UNK> his command <UNK> into the body of michael <UNK> white we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and <UNK> will be <UNK> weakness <UNK> gee seth you mean they will not be our strong points all kidding aside the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength it leaves the action without adequate setup in the original we are given a very <UNK> explanation of the <UNK> how they work and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film here the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a <UNK> is and how they operate at least in the original a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a <UNK> of ice here one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform and presumably his body getting up every time without stopping for breath br br i tend to <UNK> the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner if you can see it on the cheap knock yourself out this is the kind of film that makes me <UNK> the loss of mystery science theatre
<START> the movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too it was extremely funny <UNK> jolie was wonderful as juliet the parents are hilarious they are <UNK> as well as enemies the kids play the parts of romeo and juliet in the church play they fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart spoiler ahead i think they sneak off after a party and do it surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie if you don't like stereotypes and the <UNK> of classic literature don't watch if you don't mind those you will have a blast watching this one
<START> this film was more effective in <UNK> me of a <UNK> conspiracy than a muslim one and i'm jewish br br <UNK> go to <UNK> school read an <UNK> <UNK> year <UNK> these <UNK> <UNK> presented in a <UNK> way might prove <UNK> but by offering no <UNK> of possible <UNK> arguments nor <UNK> or any at all <UNK> few sources and each of dubious origin makes the argument an <UNK> <UNK> br br and thank goodness for that i wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre believing any of this racist <UNK> br br a good lesson for me and hopefully a <UNK> tale for you to actually read about a film before seeing it
<START> i was very impressed with this film i would have to rate it as one of the better classic era westerns i say that for the whole thing the acting mature dialog no nonsense story and excellent cinematography br br director anthony mann who did several well photographed film <UNK> around this same era also made some westerns such as this one it has that same film noir look mann and jimmy stewart <UNK> on several westerns during this period if you like this movie i recommend the mann stewart film bend of the river br br in a nutshell the story is about a man lin <UNK> stewart who owns this <UNK> winchester 73 rifle a weapon he won fair and square in a contest it is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain all of those villains are interesting characters br br <UNK> stewart act out this interesting tale are shelley winters dan duryea stephen <UNK> <UNK> mitchell charles drake will <UNK> and j c <UNK> all of them are fun to watch it was a bit of a stretch however to see rock hudson playing an indian young bull but you can't have everything
<START> my take makes use of its familiar plot with fine performances and a few genuine moments of excitement br br the plot is familiar an innocent man is framed for a plot to <UNK> the president of the united states the first <UNK> in the united states secret service as his fellow secret service agents pursue him he tries to prove his innocence of course we know his innocent and the real <UNK> is just around the corner but i was still entertained by the sentinel in this time where thrillers are reduced to being too ludicrous and too <UNK> in action sequences the sentinel is a good <UNK> back to all those good old fashioned political crime thriller the familiar plot is <UNK> by neat thrilling sequences and terrific performances br br michael douglas the perfect man for the job is long running secret service agent pete <UNK> who is framed for being part of a plot to <UNK> the president former colleagues in the secret service <UNK> sutherland and eva longoria pursue harrison while he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and the <UNK> in the secret service this leads to a lot of chase scenes that surprisingly and thankfully are never unbelievable the screenplay also offers a subplot involving <UNK> having an affair with the first lady played by kim basinger this thankfully wasn't unnecessary like most subplots are to these kinds of films br br the films director is clark johnson s w a t who manages to make the film look good although many have criticized it as should have been a tv movie i must disagree agreed this is not a perfect film and much of it is inspired from other action thrillers and political <UNK> like in the line of fire or an episode from the tv series 24 which this film closely resembles when it comes to style and star sutherland but even so this film takes its plot into serious heights and doesn't abandon even its smaller details the performances are terrific with a top notch cast its bound to be even with the by the numbers script br br all in all i award it 1 2 not perfect but not far from it br br rating 1 2 out of 5

<START> i'm one of those people who'd crawl a mile through broken glass to see a hal hartley film from trust and <UNK> to henry fool and my hartley favorite no such thing <UNK> unique brand of movies are an acquired taste <UNK> equal parts mystery espionage with <UNK> comedy seems to be his <UNK> the comedy isn't in your face necessarily and often runs throughout an entire scene before coming to <UNK> and that's the case with fay grim the sequel to henry fool br br parker posey stars as fay grim abandoned wife of henry fool and mother to <UNK> only son ned fay lives a quiet life until she comes home one day to find a cia agent in her kitchen his name is <UNK> jeff goldblum man of the year and he wants <UNK> <UNK> there are many henry fool <UNK> and they were all previously believed to contain nothing but mad <UNK> apparently there's much more to them secrets weapons research or paths to terrorists who knows but henry agent <UNK> tells fay that her husband is dead but this is quickly <UNK> as a <UNK> to get fay out of her home and searching for henry and it works but not the way they think br br fay battles multiple spy rings to gather <UNK> <UNK> and to seek him out she also makes a deal with the cia to get her brother simon james <UNK> out of prison he'd helped henry escape the country in the original henry fool film multiple <UNK> events occur in rapid succession spy rings shoot each other to death henry is discovered being held in safety by a <UNK> fay <UNK> her brother but <UNK> risks her son's life and the cia gets its <UNK> for putting fay in danger br br hal hartley obviously loves to play with themes and he does so to the extreme here even character names grim fool <UNK> <UNK> have <UNK> meanings of their own that are quite funny the over the top espionage films of ol' are given plenty of screen time too as guns <UNK> in stop motion sequences never striking our heroine even though she's right in the line of fire br br now that i've <UNK> praise on this creation i will say that parker <UNK> excessive portrayal of fay grim isn't the best part of the film which is a shame considering how much time she's on screen i realize this was probably what mr hartley wanted an <UNK> woman with hand gestures to the italian extreme but it was still painful to watch at times br br even so fans will probably <UNK> fay grim and beg for more though this wasn't my favorite hal hartley film i know i'm ready
<START> god this film was just so boring apart from the music which i really loved i mean what was the point in actually making this movie please anyone who reads this review do not watch this film it is a waste of time br br <UNK> can act but was really pathetic in this film i am actually ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie it was just really bad br br <UNK> is just another pretty face with no lack of talent what so ever she can't act at all and there was no point of her being in this film as for the other girl <UNK> she was okay i guess but could have done better br br what a waste of time please buy the great music and don't watch this movie
<START> riveting drama scripted by william <UNK> based on his stage play in which farrah fawcett plays <UNK> attacked in her car by rapist joe james russo she manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do she realizes however that joe did get her <UNK> and knows where she lives when her <UNK> pat <UNK> <UNK> and terry diana <UNK> are off at work joe pays her a visit to finish what he started after joe <UNK> and <UNK> her in a variety of ways she gets a chance to strike back at him and <UNK> him knowing full well she's in another his word against yours situation and that no rape technically took place she has no intention of taking it easy on him until he <UNK> to pat and terry what his intentions were br br the movie ultimately amounts to a showdown between its two opponents as it goes on <UNK> displays such <UNK> that one has to wonder if she hasn't become as unhinged as her nemesis fawcett does a <UNK> enough job while russo is truly excellent as the <UNK> creep who does his best to manipulate the situation with only two characters on screen for much of the running time the film has an intimate nature that does suggest that it would work even better on stage director robert m young doesn't shy away from the <UNK> and more exploitative elements of the situation the film does become uncomfortable to watch at times and by the time <UNK> has the upper hand things change enough so that it no longer becomes quite so easy to encourage her to go for blood and one hopes that pat can make her see reason br br <UNK> i felt was a pretty good movie that at least <UNK> interest and a fairly high level of intensity <UNK> and <UNK> are both fine in support <UNK> has a great moment where terry reveals herself to be a rape victim and the pace is consistent granted the dialog isn't always very sharp but the material is compelling every step of the way br br 8 10
<START> well i had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this <UNK> of <UNK> why because i have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is it's unbelievably bad just to let you in on how bad it is i'll offer this little detail about the movie during scenes of mayhem which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies they <UNK> scenes from the video game yes you heard me right this movie really sucks in fact it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days and to see corn filled crap like this there is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional <UNK> shot and really cheap kills i'm really disappointed with this knowing that i watched it ok i'm <UNK> it's so bad i can't even find the words rating zero out of
<START> awful awful awful br br a condescending remark at the start and a few nasty <UNK> photos does not a good movie make once again i'm amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don't have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap br br i sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that i could at least balance my criticism but the only one i could think of was that the opening track by pink was pretty good i wonder if she has seen this br br watch this at your peril the boredom may kill you
<START> i agree with the above comment i love the realism in this and in many movies not just movies on eating <UNK> the producers seem to forget that they take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again which i dislike because its not reality not meaning to say things can't get better and not meaning to say things don't in this movie but it doesn't spend most of the movie creating all these problems and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again when people have eating <UNK> people don't just admit it and want to get better and then life is <UNK> it takes time and i like how in this movie we grow with the characters we go through the difficulties with them getting better and worse because it is a very important part of the movie it gets into the minds of people with eating <UNK> and shows the complications and pain in a very realistic way and i loved that i also love how it shows the <UNK> and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating <UNK> it is scary to see how people react when they find out especially if they <UNK> of it i thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told and <UNK> one of my favourites
<START> <UNK> the child starts as a plane crashes the only survivor of flight <UNK> was a young boy named donald boo boo stewart who is adopted by news reporter erika sarah <UNK> her cameraman husband scott <UNK> adam vincent after they covered the incident for channel 6 news at first donald seems like any normal kid but death seems to follow him around after <UNK> from a nun <UNK> scott begins to believe that donald is evil the cause of all the deaths br br this straight to dvd horror flick was directed by jake <UNK> under the <UNK> jake jackson one has to say <UNK> the child is really rather poor whenever i see the asylum is responsible for a film i get worried i get very worried since their track record is awful they seem to <UNK> in making or <UNK> low budget horror films which are usually rip offs of some recent successful big budget horror film in the case of <UNK> the child you don't need a degree in rocket science to realise that it's a complete rip off to cash in on the recent the omen 2006 which was released the same year the script by benjamin henry austin laurel is terrible simply can't match the ambitions of the the hollywood equivalent i mean just what exactly does donald the <UNK> expect to achieve from a middle class family in a small town it's hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of <UNK> world is it every character in <UNK> the child is some form of the main character's from the omen the adopted parents the priest who tries to warn them the sinister babysitter there's a real lack of incident there's barely any gore the plot is poor i mean donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random needless what were all the disgusting pictures donald drew all about where did the babysitter come from there's just nothing that ties everything together it's just a disjointed mess that just becomes very boring very quickly the references to the number 6 also becomes annoying are very <UNK> br br director <UNK> does alright i suppose it's competent if nothing else there's virtually no blood or gore there's a few <UNK> of blood a cut off hand someone gets a <UNK> saw stuck in their face but it sounds a lot better than it looks on screen it's certainly not scary there's no atmosphere thanks to a <UNK> bland contemporary setting in a suburban house there's no tension because we never really know what donald is trying to do there <UNK> there's no threat from him br br technically the film is alright it's reasonably well made but since the actual film is so poor it makes little difference the acting isn't that great but at the same time i've seen worse br br <UNK> the child is a poor mans the omen rip off i'd sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week not good definitely not recommended followed by the sequel <UNK> the beast 2007 which also went straight to dvd
<START> the one of the most remarkable sci fi movies of the millennium not only a movie but an incredible future vision this movie <UNK> a new standard of s f movies <UNK> and kill
<START> i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the <UNK> i guess as any kid would be i was delighted with the imagination <UNK> and energy of the film several years later i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the <UNK> years in addition to the script the production <UNK> the fantasy genre this is <UNK> the <UNK> at his very best when you see thief as a child you know that you <UNK> had a great time when you see thief as an adult you know that you <UNK> seen a masterpiece it s as timeless as the story it treats an amazing work br br thomas mccarthy
<START> the wooden horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by british <UNK> during world war ii it is superbly acted with a <UNK> sense of humor especially the lines expressed by the acid <UNK> leo <UNK> anthony steele and david <UNK> later george banks in mary <UNK> are marvelous as the two heroes the direction is taut and fast moving throughout highly recommended
<START> disney and the wonderful folks at pixar of course offer a nice <UNK> story combined with the best of computer animation i admit that maybe the <UNK> of the bugs were a little more static than in <UNK> and they only had four legs in <UNK> six but backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking but let this be a lesson it was not the computer who made it such a success it was the man behind the machine who added the nice little twists which i missed in <UNK> some highlights were of course the <UNK> at the end so keep watching at the end it's worth it which were highly amusing and original the line <UNK> entirely on <UNK> was intended for the more <UNK> viewer
<START> do you like stand up then stay away from this br br during the early rounds there are in fact good comics but unless they got some cute qualities they got a <UNK> chance any controversial material and you are out and i think i hurt as much as the <UNK> comedians when i see who the crooked judges are letting in br br 1 out of my top 4 made it further than the <UNK> half of the <UNK> have given me 0 laughs several of them have lifted their material elsewhere something the judges doesn't seem to have problems with br br it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv but incredibly hard to watch without <UNK> what it could have been br br if the producers changed the name of the contest to last clown standing all my criticism would loose <UNK> maybe an idea
<START> this is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change as usual the lovers sally field as almost over the hill soap opera queen <UNK> <UNK> and kevin kline as <UNK> employed and <UNK> talented actor jeffrey anderson are working at cross purposes seemingly unaware that they are <UNK> in love etc <UNK> a little to bette <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in all about eve 1950 and a whole lot to the slapstick theatrical tradition sally field goes over the top towards hilarity as she <UNK> her way to love and happiness kevin kline one of the more underrated leading men of recent years is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome vulnerable <UNK> and lovable all at the same time br br the <UNK> center around <UNK> fear of losing her audience as she has entered her forties and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece aspiring actress <UNK> craven <UNK> <UNK> who turns out not to be her niece with ensuing plot complications <UNK> manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf mute before discovering her true relationship to <UNK> and to jeffrey anderson as well but never mind br br as a romantic <UNK> or foil to the leads are robert downey jr soap opera director david barnes and cathy <UNK> montana and nurse <UNK> david barnes is oh so hot for her but she cares only about one thing getting rid of <UNK> so that she might shine more <UNK> on the set to this end she gets barnes to do all sorts of things to wreck <UNK> career but through <UNK> and or a perverse logic all his attempts go awry much to the delight of the viewer br br <UNK> goldberg plays rose <UNK> the show's chief writer and <UNK> alter ego and <UNK> while carrie fisher has a modest part as the hard as nails producer of the show br br i thought this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world that i have seen young doctors in love 1982 which <UNK> tv's general hospital and was pretty good <UNK> is funnier with a <UNK> script and plenty of laugh out loud one liners and terrific performances by field kline and <UNK> jr but see this for sally field who is outstanding
<START> a timeless classic wonderfully acted with perfect location settings <UNK> a marvelous atmospheric movie a simple story <UNK> with humor and suspense i wish that a video was available in britain i have seen this film on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with oh mr porter
<START> i took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making i always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies especially as i'm such a <UNK> myself it's good to get an <UNK> opinion from someone who hasn't yet reached the been there done that approach to every movie she sees i'm pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother daughter evening out far far better than going to see some brain dead chick flick which i gather is what we are supposed to enjoy according to the <UNK> br br <UNK> directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the <UNK> of paris a city i haven't visited in 20 years but i wish i had they are loosely linked by joining shots and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world some of the films work better than others but as other reviewers have said it never <UNK> too far into <UNK> some are funny some are sad some intriguing and some just plain puzzling i'm still trying to <UNK> some deep inner truth to the flying tiger hidden dragon <UNK> <UNK> some are just fun and perhaps shouldn't be assigned too much meaning the vampire and the tourist for example possibly my only criticism of the whole film is that it makes paris look too good it can also be cold wet <UNK> indifferent and miserable or in summer <UNK> hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a <UNK> in a can <UNK> up for hours to see every attraction but i'm <UNK> picking br br my personal favourite by far was the <UNK> brothers film shot on the <UNK> <UNK> station and starring a perfectly cast steve <UNK> as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a <UNK> <UNK> absolutely perfect and very very funny without <UNK> having to say a word i also <UNK> enjoyed the piece about the two <UNK> artists which was probably the closest the movie got to being <UNK> that certainly <UNK> on the edge of <UNK> but it just stayed on the right side <UNK> <UNK> and emily <UNK> gaining insight from an encounter with oscar <UNK> tomb left me pretty indifferent and juliette <UNK> trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very very uncomfortable i thought both the bob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> piece and ben <UNK> gena rowlands fell a bit flat but maggie <UNK> was good has she <UNK> the market in <UNK> i watched <UNK> baby last week br br but i felt the two social justice pieces for want of a better way of putting it worked very well by that i mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone else's baby across town and then the film about the african <UNK> struggling to exist on the <UNK> of an indifferent society who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young new <UNK> yet another murder <UNK> in a world which sees thousands of <UNK> dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life every year i thought both pieces very well observed br br the final film <UNK> <UNK> in which <UNK> <UNK> plays a <UNK> worker from <UNK> <UNK> the story of her first trip to paris  in very badly <UNK> french  to her night school french class moved me a perfect ending to a good intriguing if not quite great movie br br paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea but it works pretty well
<START> he now has a name an identity some memories and a a lost girlfriend all he wanted was to disappear but still they <UNK> him and destroyed the world he hardly built now he wants some explanation and to get ride of the people how made him what he is yeah jason bourne is back and this time he 's here with a vengeance br br ok this movie doesn't have the most <UNK> script in the world but its <UNK> are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society of course like every <UNK> movie since the end of the 90's the bourne <UNK> is a super heroes story jason bourne is a captain america project like who's gone completely wrong in the first movie the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one he now fights against what he considers like evil after a person close to him has been killed his girlfriend in <UNK> by them that's all a part of the super hero story including a character with realistic but still impressive he almost <UNK> super powers br br and the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world there's no <UNK> in the <UNK> movies characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye is as in the best seasons of 24 an american enemy who's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely <UNK> him funny how mad <UNK> are now the n 1 enemies of <UNK> hollywood's stories br br beside all those interesting <UNK> the movie isn't flawless the feminine character of <UNK> <UNK> is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes but all that doesn't really matter for the bourne ultimatum is an action movie and the action scenes are rather impressive br br everyone here is talking about the <UNK> scene and the <UNK> pursuit and everyone's right i particularly enjoyed the fight in <UNK> that reminds my in its exaggeration and <UNK> the works of tsui <UNK> visually inventive scenes lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on <UNK> contemporary <UNK> the bourne ultimatum is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick
<START> i'll be honest i finally checked this movie not because of the stars though they were reasonably watchable and compelling particularly the three leads or even the compelling story of a <UNK> in the presidential secret service something i've been informed through the dvd extras of this show has yet to ever happen assuming that's true that's remarkable i got it because it was directed and has a choice cameo by none other than detective <UNK> lewis well okay clark johnson one of my <UNK> from homicide life on the street and a veteran mostly tv director i'd say that he does about as good as he can with a project that is watchable but pretty average despite the possibilities br br veteran and ace secret agent pete <UNK> michael <UNK> has to find out both who is <UNK> him and who killed his friend targeted and blew up an air force one <UNK> and is <UNK> for the <UNK> david <UNK> anyone remember <UNK> his affair with the first lady kim basinger clearly one of the <UNK> first ladies we've ever had fictional or real is certainly not helping his standing he's got to both <UNK> out the real mole in the service and avoid the <UNK> dog like hunting of his former best friend and fellow agent and chief <UNK> sutherland almost still completely in 24 mode throw in some other pivotal service agents martin <UNK> and the <UNK> somewhat hard to buy as the gig eva <UNK> and shady foreign characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that doesn't aim as high as it <UNK> and reaches the desired if <UNK> results br br the summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays out without giving spoilers the dvd extras to me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most myself included interested
<START> this is one strange <UNK> together film you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one i'm not surprised there's no credits on it who would want to be associated with this film the acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over it all makes very little sense as i said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that wasn't shot that needed to be and all the music was very ill fitting library music cheap i guess very very odd i might actually buy a dvd of it though if it could let me in on what the hell was going on and what happened to this movie
<START> i was too young to <UNK> when i first saw this movie but i saw it for like the second time about 7 years ago my sister told me i had to see it now my whole family has it <UNK> we quote it at least once a day i <UNK> love this movie i still laugh after all this time sure it's about a really really drunk <UNK> that is irresponsible the whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie and that he is willing to give it all up for love i highly <UNK> this movie to anyone who wants a laugh a lot of laughs its <UNK> sweet and if your a movie buff it will <UNK> change your idea of funny watch it with a group of your friends or your family and i promise you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some <UNK> lines in your head it will make you laugh for years to come br br it is really hard in my family to find a movie that everyone likes but this movie i feel made us closer and i know it will do the same for you
<START> this movie is just plain terrible slow acting slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just shouldn't have been on there the best part was the showing of iron maiden singing in some video at a theater and thats it the ending was worth watching and waiting up for but that was it the characters in this movie put me to sleep almost avoid it
<START> i really dislike both shrek films since their both pg and have words in them i would never say myself so i disliked them br br but when it comes to spirit <UNK> of the <UNK> which i just barely watched for the first time last month i became a fan of animated films other than pixar spoilers ahead in spirit <UNK> of the <UNK> a horse <UNK> is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard one night he sees a strange light in the distance and he sets off toward it this action eventually leads to his capture and several more things throughout the movie we hear a narration it's through the thoughts of spirit though the horses never talk this is what makes the movie so goo they the movie makers <UNK> real horses to do the sounds the horses made none of those sounds were made by humans br br spirit meets rain a beautiful <UNK> and little creek a native american who owns rain little creek later <UNK> spirit and rain they go running home br br i have never been a big fan of brian adams but i intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future br br watch this film and you won't regret it my score 10 10
<START> i must say when i read the storyline on the back of the case it sounded really interesting but when i started to watch the movie seemed boring at first and even more at the end some scenes are way too long and the story has not been worked out properly
<START> hearing about how hilarious this movie is i finally rent it at br br the video store and for 75 minutes maybe i laughed 3 times this br br movie a collection of skits that make fun of television is an br br <UNK> mess the jokes fall flat the humor deals with br br issues from the 1970's that just aren't relevant anymore and br br the jokes go on way too long almost like the new snl skits the br br past few years yeah chevy chase is in this but maybe of all br br about 1 or 2 minutes i liked the fact that this was very br br raunchy and had nudity <UNK> but couldn't it be funny do br br yourself a favor and rent kentucky fried movie which is a far br br superior film made in the
<START> i'll say it again this movie was totally lame kids will like it sure but adults <UNK> the whole thing was basically a rehash of the original which is to be expected since they pretty much explored the whole concept in the first movie but still did they have to completely rehash the entire movie i mean everything is re done from the little mermaid the worst part of it is morgana <UNK> crazy sister who appears out of nowhere and threatens melody which is ridiculous since <UNK> is there with his magic <UNK> why didn't <UNK> do anything about it because the plot required him to do nothing i could go on but i won't the whole thing is a shameless attempt to <UNK> in more money from the little mermaid and was obviously thrown together without any thought because they knew it would sell overall it is a terrible waste of time
<START> this is a really strange film and that is not a bad thing it is a combination of a neo realistic film about the homeless and a fairy tale i'm sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange but i loved it once again this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people not actors and gets a great ensemble type performance although not nearly as sad as <UNK> d both movies have a very similar point to make this one just does it in a very <UNK> way ignore the cheesy special effects after all it was made in the early 1950s and special effects aren't terribly important anyway or at least they shouldn't be in films instead just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride unless you are a total <UNK> you'll have a ball br br by the way since i first reviewed this film i have seen another <UNK> directed film that is an absolute must see and that is the children are watching us while not a fantasy or light in spirit like miracle in <UNK> a great film nevertheless
<START> wow the plot for this film is all over the place there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin and as a result none of it seemed particularly believable br br the movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town she's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway when a big time actor arrives in town she <UNK> him in hopes that he can give her a career boost but her husband is worried about <UNK> as this actor is a <UNK> so the <UNK> bursts in on them and hits the actor and the actor dies as a result he's convicted of first degree murder not <UNK> but murder 1 now pregnant and in need of <UNK> kay goes to new york but broadway jobs aren't to be found so she's forced to take any job even <UNK> unable to adequately care for her young daughter she gives it to another woman to raise however eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks <UNK> but the jealous <UNK> starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play <UNK> she makes her way to england and becomes a real star years later she returns to new york to get her kid but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother at the same time her husband's lawyer now thinks that if he gets 10 000 he can get the man out of prison as another reviewer wrote is this to <UNK> people how can 10 000 get him out otherwise maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up wow this is enough for 2 or 3 films and all this occurs by the 45 minute mark believe it or not there's quite a bit more to it if you really care see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds br br this is sort of like <UNK> sink <UNK> throwing in practically everything and hoping somehow it will all work unfortunately the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and <UNK> despite ms <UNK> best efforts it's the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd rate plot it's almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie overall unless you are a die hard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the 1930s this one is one you can easily skip not terrible but certainly not good br br by the way the child who plays <UNK> daughter upon her return to new york <UNK> jason really was terrible i think she was supposed to be i think
<START> i really have no idea how to comment on this movie the special effects were lackluster the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all it was on the back of the box i don't think i can remember a movie being this bad in a long time and i'm a big fan of lesbian sex and <UNK> even that couldn't save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand or lay in this case in front of a camera br br i was pretty much let down by the overall zombie effect since apparently in this movie zombies are so <UNK> that running over a couple here and there and casually talking about it at a gas station one with an in house <UNK> <UNK> but no interior bathroom the zombie movie genre isn't even a factor until the end even then a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girl's clothes doesn't really <UNK> being a zombie movie br br on to the vampires apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female which is ok by me i'm not sure how vampires are out in the daylight or the why how of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road still holding his gun with a stake through his heart just waiting for the queen of the vampires to flick it all the way through the last segment in the old <UNK> made no sense and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire do you think we did the right thing by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie that about put it over the top br br the acting and special effects were at an all time low also you could almost see the <UNK> that the fake blood was <UNK> out of during the <UNK> of the zombie who got ran over by the general speaking of the general where did they find this kenny rogers look alike anyways no idea what he was the general of aside of generally confusing and misplaced br br all in all watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste 3 just my 0 <UNK>
<START> when my 14 year old daughter and her friends get together for movie night there's one movie they insist on watching over and over again you guessed it k <UNK> the third installment in the highly successful k 9 franchise starring everybody's favorite tv dad jim belushi br br folks i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape but a dvd this has been played so often that it's starting to skip no joke but of course you'll have that when you own a film so charming so brilliant br br of course we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved cop dog genre with turner and <UNK> however even that film doesn't measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k 9 movies br br some <UNK> <UNK> say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series <UNK> i say while you might suspect that a third installment direct to video at that may not seem like something worth watching you'd prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie br br i won't give away the plot but i will say that belushi and his <UNK> partner give their best performance yet one that will have you howling with laughter it's a shame john belushi isn't alive to see what great <UNK> his brother has made in the acting world br br i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her <UNK> at her next <UNK> party don't forget the puppy <UNK>
<START> be warned this movie is such a mess it's a catastrophe don't waste your time with this one i warned you br br the acting story dialogue music basically everything is so over the top it's absolutely annoying and ridiculous it made me want to throw up if the dialogue acting story wasn't doing it it's everyone being shot crooked you'll feel like you're watching a comedy the problem is the parts that are supposedly funny isn't even funny the acting story cinematography you can feel everything is just trying <UNK> too hard but it never succeeds practically every shot is <UNK> but so what this movie just feels like a student film no wonder they shot this in <UNK> because it would be a waste to spend more money to shoot this on film br br if you're easily amused or like poor acting writing editing directing full of clichés everything that's forced in your face oh and did i mention poor acting well actually it's not all the actor's fault it's the director then i guess you'll like this movie br br i had to watch this for a class i would have turned it off right away if i could if you still can't tell by now i hated this movie it made me want to throw up and get my time back at least i didn't have to pay for this garbage br br jeff goldblum you know the guy from jurassic park independence day is in this movie but he sure went downhill from then accepting roles for movies like this catastrophe
<START> a wonderful film version of the best selling book and smash broadway play about the lives of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> two african american sisters who both lived over the age of 100 and told their story of witnessing a century of american history ruby dee and <UNK> <UNK> give very good performances as <UNK> and <UNK> respectively amy <UNK> also is good as amy hill <UNK> the white new york times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book etc many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present day ones are very powerful if not quite as inspirational as in the book that is the only real <UNK> combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly such as the inter racial background of the <UNK> mother and why their father was so stern but other than that a very well done excellently performed powerful movie
<START> people please don't bother to watch this movie this movie is bad it's totally waste of time i don't see any point here it's a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again
<START> this is possibly the worst version of the play i have seen several times on stage apart from the movie br br a very nice idea for the set up the american south can give a credible backdrop for the extreme reaction round hero's supposed <UNK> br br but the execution <UNK> is a very mannered <UNK> giving a particularly poor performance <UNK> a fine actor is not much better as <UNK> br br the <UNK> performance is in the role of don john it makes keanu reeves look good perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and his men but the acting makes you want to cringe br br successful set ups include the scene where they fool <UNK> into believing <UNK> loves him were the acting competent it would be superb but the use of the river and the visual humour of <UNK> moving closer is well produced br br overall i had to force myself to keep watching but it certainly didn't keep my attention br br very disappointing br br with respect to latter comments above i am nearly 40 i've been watching stage and screen productions of shakespeare for over 2 decades might i suggest when trying to defend your friends you speak to the piece rather than attack other reviewers when you are so <UNK> armed in terms of fact i can assume though from your <UNK> regarding youth that you are of sufficient age where the mannered acting of <UNK> days is more to your taste br br my personal favourite pairing was <UNK> and <UNK> on the london stage unlike <UNK> <UNK> a skilled and charismatic performer can act
<START> as far as i am concerned this silent version of the merry widow is the worst version ever made there is no <UNK> or love or <UNK> about this version it is all macabre <UNK> sinister nonsense it reminded me of nazis falling in love who cares br br this silent version by von <UNK> is not a faithful adaptation of the original story in this one we have <UNK> john gilbert and his gross relative the prince <UNK> after this silly american actress played by mae murray possessed with a modern <UNK> <UNK> and implausible feminist manner that threw me off again and again i like my romances light and beautiful with slow build ups not harsh and sadistic like this one and come on those <UNK> <UNK> lips get rid of them girl br br go see a live performance of the show if you would like to get a real idea of the <UNK> of the original <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> failing that wait till tcm shows the <UNK> macdonald maurice <UNK> sound version it's much better
<START> worst movie ever can't believe i wasted <UNK> of my life watching this crap the only reason i didn't turn it off was i wanted to see the gangster dude on the cover and he wasn't even in it talk about false advertising the people that gave this movie a ten are either dumb stupid or cast members or friends of cast members br br i gave it a solid 2 because no one else did br br i have to write more and i don't even want to wasting my time talking about this rubbish please don't watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs bottom 100 movies i can't even tell you how bad it really is think the worst movie ever that you've seen then times that be ten and thats this movie it sucked if you just think i'm being bitter then watch it i dare you this movie should be used to torture war criminals or <UNK> if they watch this even two times and they'll be <UNK> the <UNK> and begging for mercy
<START> from the q a before and after this is what i could gather some irish guy wants to make a movie nothing in particular just any movie so one night at a party he hears some ex <UNK> tell him a classic bit of rock <UNK> roll <UNK> the one about how <UNK> <UNK> corpse was stolen from <UNK> by his loyal <UNK> so he could honor <UNK> wishes that he be <UNK> out in <UNK> wow br br what a great idea for a movie rock <UNK> roll well country grave robbing escapes friendship the 70's i guess we could get johnny <UNK> from jackass cause it's kind of a prank right and <UNK> wants to do a movie too why he must have thought he had the next snatch on his hand br br but this story's not really that exciting we need something for <UNK> to struggle against like a psychotic <UNK> after his money but <UNK> was married at the time that's o k no one knows that besides we could get christina <UNK> but what if the audience doesn't like the idea of stealing a corpse well we'll get his dad to join the chase but give <UNK> in the end but <UNK> dad killed himself when he was 10 in fact his orphan status and tragic childhood are key parts of the parsons mythology mythology we're making a movie this is creative problem solving br br it's an uncomfortable experience for anybody even vaguely <UNK> on or interested in the subject <UNK> presence is <UNK> jarring first her invented character is a beverly hills bitch before her time she might as well have walked around the whole movie a cell phone in her hand and secondly what kind of man would parsons be if he ever associated himself with that kind of <UNK> facts aren't just distorted or left out but <UNK> they could have easily found the villain they wanted in parsons <UNK> who was attempting to <UNK> the body back to his home state where law would favor him in <UNK> up the considerable inheritance br br and the music oh the music i love the music is <UNK> up the bridge of a song here the chorus there forced to the background and in the end horribly covered by the <UNK> new indie band <UNK> my girlfriend asked the unnecessary but <UNK> question after the movie was anyone up there the writer the producers the director actually a <UNK> <UNK> fan well no he'd never actually heard of <UNK> parsons but of course blah blah blah i learned to love it and here's some <UNK> i read in a bio online another guy <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> by saying he and keith richards <UNK> on acid together and wrote wild horses together a mixed up bunch of facts as off base as the movie another person asked wasn't it morally questionable to rewrite history when most people would only know about it from this film well he had the real <UNK> <UNK> he was even set and the parsons estate gave <UNK> and all these other people who got <UNK> said it was great br br but what i really wondered was and asked in the <UNK> <UNK> voice of a truly <UNK> parsons geek was if the movie's so cheaply made a million had they not considered the original <UNK> parsons <UNK> as an audience the director and writer seemed to think he was a nothing figure with no <UNK> though i doubt any <UNK> magazine reading country rock 70's music fan would agree but a bunch of brits made it i guess and they just didn't care about <UNK> american music or even knew it existed this isn't just not a truthful parsons flick it's not even in the right spirit it doesn't even fit the legend at the very least it should have had the sentimentality of one of his songs and plenty of people would love to be told br br i should mention the movie was received well from the bunch of stoned college kids just off the <UNK> and into johnny <UNK> but if you're a parsons fan ignore the title it's just a movie for jackass fans
<START> i for one have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of pushing daisies this season and hope that the <UNK> strike won't brutally end the <UNK> of a very good show ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent <UNK> is a private investigator with his own unique quirks like his love of <UNK> charlotte chuck is the once dead but not anymore childhood friend and sunny spot of <UNK> life <UNK> is the jealous but good hearted waitress oh and add the dog jim <UNK> brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show chuck ned and <UNK> along with <UNK> and occasionally the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the assistance of <UNK> special gift of bringing dead people back to life the show is funny clean and romantic in a very cute and good hearted way and i'd recommend it to anyone
<START> i'm at this very moment <UNK> whether i should even finish watching this <UNK> of a movie they had a pretty interesting idea with the buried movie set and that was it so far this incomprehensible mess has no real story there is the buried set some wolf headed monster running amok an <UNK> and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is what i would have missed had i had the good sense to <UNK> this nonsense is a <UNK> <UNK> chase some really bad c g i some incredibly stupid dialog more bad c g i and the hero fighting paper cut outs other than the original idea this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities my mistake for continuing to watch <UNK>
<START> for those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight i first offer these four words don't waste your time <UNK> express was <UNK> filmed slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a hong kong <UNK> king i can't remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane it's an absurd effort with <UNK> ridiculous dialog a man wanders into his <UNK> apartment and offers the stunning revelation that tears can be <UNK> with a <UNK> but water takes time to <UNK> up the same character is also seen carrying on a deep meaningful <UNK> with his <UNK> soap stuffed animals dirty <UNK> etc the shaky wandering hand held camera work was another annoying feature i could have done without and if that isn't enough to make you <UNK> in your popcorn we hear the old 60's <UNK> california dreaming by the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence br br quentin tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to america through his rolling thunder productions company though i cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother he was known to have <UNK> i'm happy to love a movie this much a lot of us though hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile <UNK> in the future
<START> i still can't believe this movie they got so much unbelievable things in it that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to make it br br the story is a joke but in the sense of being funny but more like no story at all how can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery a prison movie town <UNK> sex jokes and a fbi agent you can't br br beside the terrifying directing the most noticeable thing are the actors i watched this film and thought <UNK> this really marlon brando no it can't be 5 minutes later is this charlie sheen wow maybe brando is true 5 minutes later this can't be donald sutherland 5 minutes later no not mira sorvino this movie is too bad for all of them at the end no no no this can't absolutely not be martin sheen not for 10 seconds of such a movie ' then it was over and i down with my nerves so many good oscar winning usually convincing actors in such a stupid dumb awful movie i rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in this one they couldn't got so much money br br only just an unbelievable silly idiotic movie br br 3 10 1 4 5 1 6
<START> <UNK> look at a <UNK> in 21st century vienna mixing the stories of six groups of characters by former documentary maker u <UNK> is a provocative <UNK> and intense piece of observation cinema br br after the world wide spread of big brother reality shows <UNK> takes modern <UNK> to an unsettling profound level hard to like but <UNK> piece of european art cinema might seem cruel and seedy yet manages to convey the <UNK> <UNK> feeling of modern society in a <UNK> manner br br a must for lovers of world cinema
<START> this is a <UNK> it <UNK> nicholas cage the plot is intricate and totally absorbing the ending will blow you away br br see it whenever you have the opportunity
<START> this flick was a blow to me i guess little girls should <UNK> to be nothing more than <UNK> models home makers or <UNK> since that seems to be all they'll ever be portrayed as anyway it is truly <UNK> to see an <UNK> work and life being so <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or perhaps it should have been expected <UNK> entire character and all that she stands for had been reduced to a standard hollywood female character a pitiful physically flawless helpless little creature displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being <UNK> here <UNK> yet was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality to portray the artist as someone in love with her real life rapist someone whom she in reality accused of <UNK> her even when under torture just plain <UNK> me off if the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have <UNK> from <UNK> her story on a real person
<START> with such actors as ralph richardson raymond massey <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> scott how can you go wrong very unusual <UNK> especially the modern ones the realization of the modern <UNK> is very effective here you have ray gun <UNK> from building vehicles that help clear the area so new <UNK> can be made although she's much younger in this film it's not very hard to figure out who the future mrs <UNK> from the bbc series all creatures great and small is going to be really effective <UNK> of both raymond massey and ralph richardson the musical score is by the renowned swiss composer <UNK> <UNK> and it is also unusual for the time 1936 it looks like they used really large sets or the effects make it seem that way lastly it's a really good story
<START> first of all it's very <UNK> to try describe way of history only from positions of guns <UNK> and steel the same tried to do <UNK> from <UNK> positions br br the reason of western success can't be just dumb luck the <UNK> of <UNK> plants and animals we see that all around the world any <UNK> and <UNK> are complete useless if they aren't wisely managed in the japan there isn't huge natural resources but japan is one of the top world <UNK> the same situation in <UNK> but in <UNK> country with rich oil resources there are only middle low success both of this nations had and still have access to western technology and <UNK> but why such gap br br in the end of movie <UNK> <UNK> that it's very important to understand factors of guns <UNK> and steel to understand maybe the main factor of world's difference is not <UNK> but people ability to understand and use things the mental ability to understand and in this case <UNK> is only <UNK>
<START> i cannot believe how bad this piece of garbage is i want my 3 99 back words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap the dubbing in no way shape or form <UNK> with the actor's mouths the movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970's vintage camcorder i have shot better movies with my cell phone camera the gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot the acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a saturday afternoon and <UNK> to get completely ripped then tried to put on a play in your garage don't get me wrong i wasn't expecting <UNK> and i love zombie movies but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable avoid
<START> i'm going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with <UNK> on this one this is a second rate <UNK> vicious western that <UNK> and <UNK> trying to put across its central theme of the wild west being <UNK> and kicked aside by the steady march of time it would like to be in the tradition of butch cassidy and the sundance kid but lacks that film's <UNK> and charm andrew <UNK> direction is limp and the final 30 minutes or so are a real <UNK> with some incomprehensible <UNK> on the part of heroes charlton heston and chris mitchum someone give me a <UNK> if you can explain to me why they set that <UNK> on fire there was something <UNK> about the whole treatment of the rape scene and the woman's reaction afterwards certainly did not ring true coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge but all of his fellow <UNK> are underdeveloped they're like <UNK> <UNK> to be knocked down one by one as the story <UNK> forward michael parks gives one of his typically <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> performances but in this case it was appropriate as his modern style sheriff <UNK> the <UNK> that technological progress can bring about
<START> the plot is about the death of little children hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter in the end the serial killer get caught that's it but before you find out who <UNK> you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors it is unbelievable how bad these actors are including hopper i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time just don't watch the movie i've warned you
<START> over her dead body was a nice little movie it was decent and entertaining while still being pretty funny there were a few <UNK> but i found most stuff fresh at first i didn't think it was going to be good at all when it started out if you can get past the first 20 minutes though the movie starts getting more interesting this film wasn't burst out in laughter hilarious and wasn't oh my gosh wonderful it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was i don't see how this movie was bad it's rating is just a bit too low i could've dealt with a 5 5 but a 4 8 also giving this movie a 1 is <UNK> it was pretty good and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1 which is what most people gave it
<START> i read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir <UNK> cross i found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film br br this movie is a neo noir since it's modern day and it's in color two things that <UNK> would make it be <UNK> for film noir status br br the biggest negative to it however wasn't the cinematography that was fine but the muddled storyline hey some of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stories were similar but i didn't care for some of those either the filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes no wonder it was the keep up with this story it was ridiculous what happens is that by the 45 minute mark their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore i know i didn't
<START> this film is outstanding and wonderfully scored <UNK> oscar for music was richly deserved many people don't know he won one i think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on dvd a great surprise prince does a fine job acting and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera morris day wendy and lisa are good in their supporting roles very cool landmark film
<START> i have begun to melt so i will make this review as short and sweet as possible br br there's this astronaut and he goes up in a <UNK> with two other guys ya know except something happens that exposes him to radiation and then when they come back well never mind what happened to the other guys but our astronaut has begun to melt no not just burn up but melt like an ice cream <UNK> in july well ok maybe not that fast but ya know what i mean br br anyway he gets all red <UNK> and the fact that he's melting makes him really mad i guess he also checked out the melting man <UNK> because suddenly he knows that in order to keep from totally melting away he has to eat human flesh so he starts ripping people apart br br there are other characters but in a movie where a man <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> do you really need any others what's important is who will he <UNK> next and what will be left of them how long will it take for him to just melt away to nothing why was this movie made in the first place where did they get the money when will you fall asleep while watching it br br i've very nearly <UNK> but i still have enough time left to tell you that this movie is dreadfully boring even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross the makeup is neat but everything else is <UNK>
<START> first i liked that movie it seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments the costume designer albert <UNK> did his best the same as wonderful set <UNK> robert r <UNK> this man really had a very good taste but the script writers disappointed me extremely the best ending would be the scene on the ladder but instead of it they decided that the father and his daughter should be together don't like the ending the father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex wife knows about it and finds it alright it would be ok if the <UNK> would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body but they did not they only <UNK> him of memories the actors were good they were really funny <UNK> shepherd was charming robert downey jr was very funny in the dancing scene but some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting for example <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years it's a long time she was true to him she loved nobody but him and when she met him and was just about making love to him after a scene with her friend philip train ryan <UNK> she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years it would be a good movie if not the ending and some missed human psychology
<START> dont read any plot <UNK> because in words the plot might seem trivial brain dead and pointless the film is excellent the acting by both denzel and <UNK> she will go sky high trust me on that are just fabulous and the plot is mind blowing actually fabulous is a small word to use for such talented actors the film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film if you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films you still haven't watched your favorite one yet trust me in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling the film is awesome see it rent it buy it or whatever just don't miss it
<START> still the definitive program about the second world war the world at war isn't just long but also very informative the series contains 26 episodes each episode lasts for about 45 min and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war most episodes are about the war in europe and there are several episodes about the war in the pacific other episodes include information about the wars in africa <UNK> the atlantic and the home <UNK> of germany great britain united states and soviet union there is one episode that's dedicated to the holocaust the series starts off with the episode a new germany 1933 1939 and tells about the rise of the nazis in germany and german <UNK> <UNK> prior to the <UNK> of war the series ends with the episode remember the <UNK> influence in a post war world remember is a fitting episode to end this great program every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits the credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme there are many fitting music pieces throughout the series each episode is like a mini film the footage is fantastic and so is the way it was put together in addition some of the footage is in color the information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining br br the series was produced by jeremy <UNK> for <UNK> television uk <UNK> in 1969 it took four years to produce such was the depth of its research the series was narrated by laurence olivier one of the most famous and <UNK> actors of the 20th century the series interviewed leading members of the allied and <UNK> <UNK> including <UNK> accounts by civilians <UNK> men officers and politicians amongst them albert <UNK> karl <UNK> jimmy stewart bill <UNK> curtis <UNK> lord <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> arthur harris charles <UNK> paul <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> stephen <UNK> jeremy <UNK> says in the making of the world at war that he sought to interview not necessarily the surviving big names but their <UNK> and <UNK> the most difficult subject to locate and <UNK> to be interviewed according to <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> karl <UNK> the latter admitted to witnessing a large scale execution in <UNK> presence br br the world at war is often considered to be the definitive television history of the second world war some consider it the finest example of the documentary form in a list of the 100 greatest british television <UNK> drawn up by the british film <UNK> in 2000 voted for by industry professionals the world at war <UNK> 19th the program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war after watching a few episodes i liked the series so much that i tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other i've seen some of them several times there are two other great documentary series that i know of that may be of interest to the viewer one is called the great war 1964 that's about world war i the other is called cold war 1998 that's about the cold war obviously
<START> elvira mistress of the dark 1988 br br directed by james <UNK> br br starring <UNK> peterson w morgan <UNK> daniel greene and edie <UNK> br br plot elvira <UNK> peterson <UNK> her tv show and heads to the small christian town <UNK> <UNK> to collect on her dead <UNK> inheritance hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in vegas unfortunately for her all she gets is a creepy old house a <UNK> and a magic <UNK> while in <UNK> elvira tries to make money breathe some life into the teenagers win the heart of a stud daniel greene avoid being burned at the stake and keep the <UNK> from her creepy uncle w morgan <UNK> who is planning to use the book to end the world br br my thoughts i love both <UNK> peterson and her alter ego elvira she is a very successful beautiful and funny woman and as elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive not to mention she has an amazing pair of <UNK> in this movie her charms are put to good use br br i loved the whole <UNK> out of <UNK> feel to the film you got elvira with her low cut black dress her big black hair and her enormous <UNK> and she's in a christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup this also makes her love story with bob daniel greene a lot more entertaining br br w morgan <UNK> is equally great as <UNK> uncle nemesis vincent out to steal the book to use it for evil he has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from elvira br br what really makes the film is not the plot but the many jokes everything from <UNK> jokes to horror <UNK> is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a scary movie sequel i hear there are about <UNK> <UNK> jokes in this film and any fan of roger corman b horror flicks will love the <UNK> in this film br br if you love elvira you will love this flick also check out <UNK> haunted hills
<START> in an apparent attempt to avoid <UNK> the original movie an excellent cast that should have made this <UNK> funny classic neil simon material better than the original failed on every level br br the chemistry between goldie hawn and steve martin that was magic in <UNK> was nonexistent in this effort
<START> no one better spoil this piece of work awesome movie written expertly by the likes of ira <UNK> and depicted with the best performance of christopher <UNK> career and one of <UNK> very best this is simply excellent i wish i could catch a staged version somewhere maybe someday i will i hope this grossly underrated overlooked film has not become too difficult to locate because it a <UNK> for any <UNK> agatha <UNK> or lover of great film one of very few movies i couldn't instantly solve or predict and worth a second or even third viewing deathtrap gets a 9 10 and earns every <UNK> of it we need and deserve more movies like this
<START> i did not set very high expectations for this movie which left me pleasantly surprised the story is a little strange sometimes but overall i think it has an acceptable credibility the action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to <UNK> a a bit of patriotic feelings common to us movies this may not be the best movie ever but it's <UNK> for sweden and i hope to see more similar ones in the future
<START> i think this is probably one of the worst movies i've watched in a long time br br trying to get the <UNK> characters' with different people is such a bad idea if they couldn't get sara michelle g and ryan p in this one they should have just cut their <UNK> and said to heck with it instead they get new actors that are horrible at what they did i seriously felt like i was at a high school or bad college play with the <UNK> of acting these people put forth br br where do they get some of these people was this their first movie it sure seemed like it br br this movie also parallels the original in a few lines of speech i had just got done watching the first one and popped 2 in i was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show i've seen in a while i don't hardly ever ever turn off a movie but this one definitely went off after about 30 40 min
<START> really bad why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery i like comedies as much as the next man and i loved a christmas story the fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writer's <UNK> has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level charles <UNK> is woefully miscast as the father for starters for another it does not seem to have the same pacing it just doesn't flow well everything seems tired and forced the joy of life that <UNK> the first film is completely absent here you just want the movie to end i wouldn't even recommend this movie for curiosity <UNK> who enjoyed a christmas story it's that bad 1 10
<START> when i first watched <UNK> i found it fresh and interesting but then i noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is good bad episodes became predictable and main characters are not interesting again we see a hyper smart boy beaten by his older brother parents who don't understand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy also this show has no logic a super modern robot who works on two <UNK> size <UNK> and can use a lot of weapons but the biggest problem is the difference between <UNK> and super <UNK> <UNK> we see two different robots and it <UNK> main idea of the show robot must learn how to behave himself in human society
<START> i'm 60 years old a <UNK> lead rhythm and over the last forty years i've been in four bands it's all there the fights the foul ups the rotten food the worse <UNK> always travelling little or no money and every one was drunk or high but the <UNK> the fans and the music made it all worth it just like strange fruit i'm too damn old for it now and the <UNK> in the hands and <UNK> mean no more <UNK> but for the length of that video it all came back and it was all there the birds the <UNK> and the booze and i was young again it's just like billy <UNK> voice over god likes that 70's stuff rock on forever
<START> what a bad bad film i can't believe all the hype that has been <UNK> on this pretentious amateurish excuse for a real movie i left the theater before the end stunned by how bad the direction and camera work of that movie were and to read <UNK> <UNK> that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a <UNK> attempt at pulling the <UNK> over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and <UNK> br br at least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film making than anything else br br avoid at all costs you'll want your time back i know i did
<START> this is a japanese film but there is quite a bit of english also spoken in here it's a pretty film with nice visuals featuring the <UNK> beauty of hawaii br br however that was the only redeeming quality for me the story was generally boring who wants to watch a young woman <UNK> for 90 percent of the film because her picture husband is a lot older than he advertised he was granted that could be a <UNK> but get over it br br only in the last 10 minutes does she do an about face and become fond of him by then for most viewers it was too little too late we'd fallen asleep by then
<START> a shift in <UNK> is <UNK> to enjoy modern british films one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the <UNK> that american films are judged <UNK> has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it but at warmth british films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming <UNK> br br this film fails not in its content but only in <UNK> itself to the <UNK> so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their <UNK> it's a couple of decades later gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind he teaches at his school <UNK> against human rights <UNK> when students he's fired up find <UNK> in their midst he must face whether he's just all talk br br this is a <UNK> film in that there's not the usual <UNK> character of any american movie that you expect to do whatever he does but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles maybe it's certainly no protest by numbers though being too warm where u s film may seem realistic because they're urban and gritty this and other british films of recent years those that don't try to match america for visceral thrills are real because british humour reveals truths
<START> <UNK> should really get a life without mr brady she <UNK> me and has been one of the main reasons why i know longer tune in to the show it's pretty brainless show and every little argument or <UNK> seems to be put under the scope and <UNK> to death this makes them look sound they are anything but ready for marriage and yet i know these <UNK> are all part of life i guess to some people this is entertainment if this happens to fall into next season i will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash though i would not be terribly surprised can't even stand the commercials for this show anymore i hope they're getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week however the a girl has one heck of great butt
<START> after having seen the canadian <UNK> british 2004 production of beowulf grendel which i thought brilliant and stunning i approached this the first of 3 newer beowulf movies due out this year with <UNK> as soon as i heard <UNK> and saw the <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> these were <UNK> era <UNK> and danes not <UNK> they came later and even the <UNK> never wore <UNK> on their <UNK> <UNK> make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you then there's <UNK> palace which looks like a set for a movie about <UNK> or rome not <UNK> century <UNK> the swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods i spotted weapons that might have been used by <UNK> in kingdom of heaven and one character was even wielding a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> movie sword from beowulf grendel beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing the biggest <UNK> was a secret weapon <UNK> complete with <UNK> scope and exploding <UNK> that looked like something bought from <UNK> <UNK> the special effects monster and his mom were so on <UNK> that beowulf could never have torn off an arm as he did in the poem thank the gods for <UNK> <UNK> i could go on but i won't
<START> caught this by accident on a t v showing and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was by comparison the original a man called horse was spell <UNK> because it held one's interest throughout but this piece of nonsense words fail me it was bad enough to have some kind of a story presented with all the impact of a wet <UNK> of bread but that error was <UNK> by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the so called <UNK> spoke for goodness sake couldn't the film makers have found enough north american indians who were also actors and near actors to perform as indians in this <UNK> instead of the <UNK> they actually used i also found it quite embarrassing watching richard harris <UNK> all around the countryside at the obvious <UNK> of the director standing just behind camera telling him to run and jump from pointless point a to pointless point b just to make up film footage and minutes absolutely terrible in all respects
<START> to make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director you need at least one of the two in this eye of the <UNK> we have none br br i don't even remember the name of the director he <UNK> have done much in his career i like very much donald sutherland but he absolutely cannot be the main actor in a movie he falls short sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than 15 minutes i would say for instance that sutherland was excellent in <UNK> of oliver stone when he talked to kevin <UNK> on the <UNK> of a park for 10 minutes non stop without even taking a breath wonderful but sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is no good br br kate <UNK> she is probably good for tv series the dvd is awful terrible colors terrible light i couldn't even appreciate the scenery of storm island for how lousy the photography was br br this ken <UNK> story was good but it's a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie
<START> the only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern france and the voice of <UNK> <UNK> singing the theme song stephanie powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent as has been pointed out she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age <UNK> lee <UNK> is good although she also is <UNK> in her later years the talented joanna <UNK> is under <UNK> and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son robert <UNK> finally marries grandma stephanie powers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him don't know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal the most credible performance is given by ian richardson who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs it <UNK> <UNK> that the handsome male <UNK> in this epic would remain ever single while they <UNK> <UNK> the subject of their affections to finally <UNK> to accept them can anybody believe that handsome robert <UNK> would remain single for decades waiting for stephanie powers to finally accept his endless marriage <UNK> the ww2 engagement between the <UNK> and the marquis is laughable to begin with the germans did not <UNK> the <UNK> section of france until late in the war it was controlled by the <UNK> french puppet government we see the french resistance staging a daylight raid on <UNK> villa to steal sheets after which they all <UNK> under a bridge waiting for a <UNK> <UNK> of nazi troops to surprise and <UNK> them if you want to see a well acted mini series set in a foreign country don't watch <UNK> daughter a far better alternative would be the thorn birds
<START> i'm really tempted to reward the case of the <UNK> tail with a solid 10 out of 10 rating but that would largely be because i think italian horror cinema of the 1970's is so much better than the cheesy crap i usually watch but even without an extra point for nostalgia this is still a genuine <UNK> and <UNK> a high rating for its excellently convoluted story uncanny atmosphere blood <UNK> killing sequences and superb casting choices in my humble opinion this is actually sergio <UNK> finest giallo and that has got to mean something as the strange vice of mrs <UNK> all the colors of the dark <UNK> and your vice is a locked room and only i have the key are all top notch genre achievements as well but this film is just a tad bit superior with its ultra compelling plot revolving on an insurance fraud gone <UNK> out of control following her husband's peculiar death in a plane explosion lisa <UNK> promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and she's eager to leave the country as soon as possible due to the bizarre circumstances the insurance company puts their best investigator peter lynch on the case and he follows her to <UNK> there lisa becomes the target of many <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when it turns out several people are hunting for the money i'm always overly anxious when briefly <UNK> <UNK> because i don't want to risk giving away essential plot elements in the case of the <UNK> tail the events take an abrupt and totally unexpected turn before the story is even halfway and i certainly don't want to ruin this for you many red herrings follow after that but sergio martino always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and even though not a 100 satisfying the denouement is at least surprising it's also a very stylish film with imaginative camera work and excellent music by bruno <UNK> <UNK> s favorite giallo <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> oddly didn't make it to this cast she stars in no less than 3 other supreme martino <UNK> but anita <UNK> lizard in a woman's skin who saw her die is a more than worthy replacement for her the charismatic and hunky george hilton is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and  duh  <UNK> man <UNK> if you're a fan of giallo don't wait as long as i did to watch this film
<START> first of all we know that bruce willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far and counting the story begins in the not so far future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth the story seems to go towards sf but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story about that movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good but that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves cause its pretty good as far as the direction goes it is <UNK> movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better so if you are getting ready to see a sci fi movie or some action you'll miss it b there should be more movies like this
<START> i guess this is meant to be a sort of <UNK> or <UNK> of beauty and the beast but i can't say i've ever watched a movie that began with several minutes of graphic horse sex wow anyway it seems that a young woman and her aunt have traveled to this castle in france where the woman is to be married to the son of the castle owner who is the man who takes care of making sure the horses get their rocks off it seems that there are legends in that area of a beast that was rather uh <UNK> i guess you could say with the ladies or at least one in particular there are all kinds of references <UNK> away in that regard but every time the soon to be <UNK> young bride gets her curious little hands on one the <UNK> father <UNK> it from her sight anyway the young bride to be goes upstairs to sleep while the family is waiting for a <UNK> to show up to the wedding a family member i guess and as she dreams she dreams of a beast in the woods that has its way with her the effects in this leave a little to be desired and any attempt at <UNK> not that i know much about that is kind of rendered laughable especially when certain featured <UNK> appear about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat this has a rather strange and abrupt yet twist ending with not really any clues or much build up to it but it was kind of fitting and definitely not what i expected i don't know this is kind of a tough one to get through but it has its moments and is definitely weird 7 out of 10
<START> where the sidewalk ends is quite a good film noir crime drama and is shot well in black and white and on location as well br br a <UNK> accidentally kills a bloke who is suspected of murder and to protect himself he covers this up and blames it on another person he doesn't like who has committed a lot of crimes in the past but towards the end he owns up but not before falling in love with a woman he meets who is the lover of the person he killed br br the cast includes dana andrews while the city sleeps curse of the demon gene tierney laura the ghost and mrs <UNK> gary <UNK> mysterious island karl malden the streets of san francisco beyond the <UNK> adventure and craig stevens the deadly <UNK> good parts from all br br where the sidewalk ends is worth checking out if you get the chance excellent br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> johnny and june carter cash <UNK> this film which is a traditional rendering of the <UNK> stories the music is great you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like i've been there too and june gets into the part of mary <UNK> with a passion <UNK> narration is good too br br but br br 1 the actor who played jesus was miscast 2 there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music 3 because it is <UNK> i doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again br br i'd love to buy the cd br br tom <UNK> texas usa
<START> i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words clueless and appalling nonsense i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment one has to suspend one's disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love have a child and live together happily ever after but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one's heart <UNK> is it so impossible there are far more implausible events described in other movies the acting is good the script is funny the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of <UNK> on to explore whether the man <UNK> any <UNK> homosexuality
<START> this is almost typical lynch however what makes this film slightly unusual for lynch is the fact that it looks very raw almost amateurish but i believe lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments br br however a lot of typical lynch <UNK> are present such as floating camera work haunting music long excruciating pauses hanging <UNK> dim lights growing darker at a slow almost <UNK> pace extreme close ups themes of women in trouble over bearing <UNK> all knowing characters facing off with characters who are <UNK> <UNK> oblivious in the dark and so on br br the performances are great and the short is thought provoking as usual lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation many questions are left unanswered and this <UNK> the imagination br br another brilliant effort from lynch i only hope he makes some shorts more along the lines of his <UNK> <UNK> 2 commercials they were inspired
<START> this is the kind of movie england can do in its sleep and that's meaning it as a compliment because of the success of very british comedies of manners <UNK> at the end or beginning of the <UNK> century most notably adaptations of e m <UNK> novels this very <UNK> <UNK> like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992 it was an exceptional year for actress miranda richardson having appeared as the wife of jeremy <UNK> who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in damage and as the ira terrorist who eventually <UNK> a wig and gets a nasty <UNK> in the crying game here she plays a quiet <UNK> type of woman in rose <UNK> one who with <UNK> lawrence who plays <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on a trip that is filled with self discovery they are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies one caroline <UNK> played by the enigmatic polly walker who resembles a very <UNK> louise brooks and not just in the style of hair she wears and mrs fisher joan <UNK> this <UNK> will eventually <UNK> together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming dreamy <UNK> it almost <UNK> it but this is fine it's the movie it wants to be alfred <UNK> and jim <UNK> then relatively new to american audiences fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters and all in all mike <UNK> makes with his movie a living thing of near magical elements full of quiet moments and wonder
<START> i watched this film over a hundred times it is really best serbian movie made ever i wood like to recommend this movie to everyone it is very good comedy i surely like it
<START> this film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called grey owl in 1930s canada i found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as <UNK> and <UNK> it picks up late in grey <UNK> life and follows him through his most <UNK> and influential period br br the film is about a canadian indian <UNK> who finds himself promoting the plight of the over trapped <UNK> he also <UNK> the <UNK> in natural lands and the <UNK> of <UNK> resources this is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received he becomes a well known <UNK> and the masses are ready to listen br br the casting of pierce brosnan seems rather odd but is not outrageous anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does annie <UNK> <UNK> is a strong actress whose place beside brosnan is <UNK> natural compared to the forced <UNK> in recent bond films br br i would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama beautiful scenery or <UNK> causes it is a movie for families as well however children under 10 depending on maturity would have trouble following the plot
<START> a young scientist harry harrison is continuing his late father's scientific research into <UNK> <UNK> with flying colours but his <UNK> dominate mother and her doctor lover want to sell off the serum when he finds out there is an accident involving harry losing an arm so he tries out the serum and what <UNK> is a <UNK> deranged arm that has a mind of its own br br oh we've seen this oh so many times before but what lifts this very campy and quite <UNK> <UNK> junk is the performance of movie icons <UNK> <UNK> and oliver reed actually it's not a bad flick by <UNK> films just there are better ones out there which are similar in vein <UNK> ties simply lacks it own distinctive style the oddball nature and unpleasant splatter <UNK> re animator and even a touch of slapstick stuck out like something from evil dead 2 br br the comic story is truly whacked out with it's black humour but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor surprises do crop up especially the <UNK> final outcome which is well accepted as i thought it could have <UNK> out with something more accessible for a low budget production the fx makeup can look rigid and very goofy but there's some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringe even a brush of sexual tension <UNK> the story thanks to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> performance as the mother oliver reed is quite <UNK> deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off extremely well they were both immensely <UNK> as the couple you loved to hate billy <UNK> is delightful in a <UNK> performance as harry director damon <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the film and <UNK> some stylish scenes of gripping and <UNK> horror br br yeah it's juvenile and basically silly nonsense but you got to hand it to it for some <UNK> entertainment
<START> blood surf aka <UNK> is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes <UNK> miller <UNK> <UNK> kate <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> joel west matt <UNK> maureen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> susan africa <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the acting by the actors is fairly good the thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed fairly good as well same thing goes for the music the film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end this is a fairly thrilling film if you the the cast in the film monsters giant animal films horror thrillers mystery and interesting films then i recommend you to see this film today
<START> with very little screen time and money dan <UNK> manages to do so much this movie in its heart warming simplicity touches the beauty of love from a fresh angle <UNK> lust
<START> a meteor drops from the sky and <UNK> a <UNK> that long ago used to <UNK> the area around <UNK> lake as the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster br br recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like lost <UNK> of <UNK> and alien <UNK> are kind of rendered <UNK> when you have films like <UNK> lake monster available for screening it's the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it this is a real drive in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as star wars changed the way we look at special effects the monster a mix of stop motion and a life size head is a <UNK> quaint little beast the filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem sure its clear that its all fake but isn't movies about suspension of disbelief actually i think its about really cool monsters which this has br br i like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way if you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no <UNK> this would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films <UNK> creek etc
<START> my choice for greatest movie ever used to be <UNK> night of the hunter which remains superb in my <UNK> but it may have been <UNK> by shower which is the most artistically <UNK> movie i have seen the way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water and the way that water can be made inspiration and comfort and <UNK> and etc is the essence of the <UNK> it is possible to argue that the the <UNK> and shower themes are similar and that <UNK> <UNK> in the former represents the <UNK> form of christianity as the <UNK> of the <UNK> represent the <UNK> form of <UNK> i would not in any way argue against such an interpretation both movies are visual <UNK> in their <UNK> of idea and image yet shower presents such an <UNK> view of the <UNK> of everyday life that i give it the nod i <UNK> both
<START> it's hard to believe that in 1997 david duchovny was at the top of his fame with x files one of the best sci fi series ever being at the top of the glory nine years later he is almost forgotten and his <UNK> to make it on the big screen failed miserably i cannot even explain why he is a fair actor but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from br br at the same time angelina jolie was much less known and she was really lucky that a film like <UNK> <UNK> did not led her career into a dead end fortunately for her 'the bone <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were waiting beyond the corner and when lara <UNK> came her career was launched br br there is not too much to be told about this film it's the only big screen film of andy wilson and there must be a reason all is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an ex doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob the off screen voice is especially bad with a <UNK> text that kills any <UNK> of cinematographic experience from the film you probably will not meet the film but in dvd rental stores or on tv try to look for something better
<START> vertigo co stars stewart in his last turn as a romantic lead and novak elevate this stewart's other christmas movie movie to above mid level entertainment the chemistry between the two stars makes for a fairly moving experience and further revelation can be <UNK> from the movie if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for the private pain that <UNK> many people's relationships all in all a nice <UNK> with legendary stars 7 10
<START> gere and danes star as 2 workers for the department of public safety who keep track of released sex <UNK> gere who plays <UNK> refers to them as his flock gere is an over obsessed vigilante whom is on his way out he is training new <UNK> allison to take over his job gere sees his flock as very sick disturbed <UNK> he asks them questions that are not on the list and tries to act like the police and solve crimes he keeps getting warned for this behavior hence the reason he is being replaced during his final few days on the job a young girl goes missing and <UNK> is sure it is one of his flock whom has gone <UNK> him and allison narrow a list down and discover some of the <UNK> have gone <UNK> so he decides that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police that part is a little far fetched br br there is some sick twisted stuff shown in this film like when <UNK> and allison go to this building where a bunch of sick people do disturbing things to each other also there are the people who kidnapped the girl at the end of the film we see what sick freaks they are however i wouldn't call this movie excessive because not really much is shown on film br br final verdict if you like thrillers and films about serial killers and cops chasing killers then you will like this
<START> there's nothing i hate more than self <UNK> <UNK> kevin smith deserves to be hung up by his <UNK> for inspiring every white middle class <UNK> to make a movie about why they can't get laid i don't really mind <UNK> and low budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and <UNK> it really burns my <UNK> the money put into this could've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like john <UNK> if you watch project <UNK> you'll immediately recognize a talented <UNK> who is fighting against the system anybody could grab a camera and make a <UNK> picture that doesn't manage to say anything really at all when will we be saved from the <UNK> and <UNK> of the world the revolution can't come soon enough go watch a real first time effort by buying <UNK> or searching out friends with benefits thank you and good day
<START> we don't have this on television in england but i walked it over the internet on youtube it's dumb immature and boring this is from the creator of <UNK> jim douglas <UNK> i never got into that cartoon but i must admit it better than this the <UNK> hasn't done anything for years since now for doug <UNK> this is a comeback travesty and an all time low the story is about three cats who <UNK> a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master they are <UNK> and keep on <UNK> on what their want to spend their money on boring the animation is dreadful the main characters are meant to be cats right but they don't look nothing like cats just weird animal monster looking creatures with big mouths pointed teeth and <UNK> eyes the human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly the theme song is terrible and irritating also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows it surprised me how this show got 7 5 10 votes of other imdb viewers television really isn't what is used to be but now most of them is dumb cheaply made and boring some of you on the website might not agree with me well i'm sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that britain don't have too tolerate this crap oh yeah if you have digital you have to but i don't so it not my problem loser 2 10 and it's very lucky to get that because i've given other shows worst
<START> good old black and white graham greene based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred time more interesting than the <UNK> that's being <UNK> by hollywood today bacall lights up the screen of course and boyer is entirely engaging they don't make movies like this any more
<START> on the contrary to the person listed above me i felt that this movie was really funny particularly in the scenes were there is a lot of mix up i don't want to give the plot and the storyline away to the people that haven't watched it yet but i will say that <UNK> <UNK> does not have an extensive role such as past <UNK> movies for example <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does an amazing part in the little role given to him john abraham does equally well akshay kumar has proved that he is no less in this movie like he had from <UNK> and almost all his movies after <UNK> even though all three <UNK> in this movie were at a debut they did a pretty good job of acting particularly <UNK> who is very good looking and hot i would say that if you liked <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> this movie is a must watch
<START> i'm usually not too into a specific show save for the o c desperate <UNK> hey i am 20 but no kidding after one episode of reunion i was hooked br br i can't even say how <UNK> i was that it's time <UNK> conflicted with <UNK> speech last night because i was really looking forward to the 1987 episode which will now air next <UNK> again that conflict was <UNK> because being a new show it needs to build up a following and having the second episode pushed back a week kills some momentum br br that said tv doesn't always have to be emmy worthy to be enjoyable i don't expect reunion to take home any <UNK> but i do expect it will be able to capture my attention all season ever watch the first few episodes of a beloved show years later sometimes you wonder how you ever got hooked character building takes some time br br the one episode for each year idea is wonderful in my opinion the only other show i can recall doing something similar is 24 with each episode being an hour and having an <UNK> year is more realistic than a day that <UNK> please give this show a shot relax about art form it's just tv
<START> an unusual film from <UNK> <UNK> and one that's strangely under appreciated the mix of fantasy kung fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes a <UNK> rider get chopped in two and his <UNK> and legs keep riding the horse several horses get chopped up it's very unexpected br br the story is very simple <UNK> and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red <UNK> temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple the general has a similarity to <UNK> in apocalypse now as he <UNK> <UNK> philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood br br the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak blood is everywhere the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time sometimes the movie <UNK> into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it's never bad enough to ruin the film br br find this one it's one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties just remember it's not child friendly
<START> even for a tired movie model as the nature vs man cycle that <UNK> so <UNK> in the 1970s ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective though entertaining for reasons it was not <UNK> it is <UNK> preposterous apparently these ants that are <UNK> near an <UNK> have been eating <UNK> waste for decades and have now adapted by <UNK> <UNK> bites hundreds of these bites being fatal watching actors of some <UNK> clumsily fall amidst tiny black <UNK> is painfully funny in a not so good but very bad way so many scenes just look ludicrous a boy trying to fall in a <UNK> whilst being attacked suzanne <UNK> crying out in horror while <UNK> in bed robert <UNK> and <UNK> george breathing through pieces of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> leg and the list goes on and on the peril shown <UNK> from ants <UNK> from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls the cast for the film is not bad on paper but none of these actors seem to believe in the material poor myrna loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror i hope she found a good use for the money for it is obvious that was the only reason a woman of her <UNK> would be in this nonsense although it is quite a bad film it is watchable once for me and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities start <UNK> actors embarrassing themselves that made for tv feel and the <UNK> creatures of nature <UNK> vengeance on man this time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected really quite dreadful
<START> holy crap what a terrible terrible spanish thriller i've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night i watched an hour or so before heading to bed i was pretty intrigued by the whole thing i finished it last night and couldn't believe where i stopped it the night before literally i stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill br br like i said i was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when simon receives the package in the bar i picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a menacing game of laser tag <UNK> then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game <UNK> <UNK> you can tell the spanish industry was definitely behind director <UNK> <UNK> co writer of <UNK> two big previous hits there is an excellent score and great photography but this scenario <UNK> of silliness how anyone sat through the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me
<START> <UNK> is one great movie probably the best movie i have ever seen i watch it over and over again i must give it 10 10 stars because like i said this is probably the best movie i have ever seen this movie popcorn coke best mix you can imagine if you want to watch some movie then i clearly recommend this one first i <UNK> it i liked it so i buy ed it and now i own it and watch it probably every day my sons like it and think that this is the best movie ever seen this movie is about guy in fantasy world i don't want to spoil all the movie so you can enjoy it after you read my text lovely movie lovely characters lovely story and just great stuff a must watch movie hope you enjoyed my comment <UNK> br br jim make
<START> <UNK> before i saw this film i was unfamiliar with helena bonham carter br br i had to do some research in order to assure myself she wasn't actually <UNK> as was her character with well what she was <UNK> with i was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady she pulled it of <UNK> br br who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants and needs of a unique young lady could be interpreted as tender and romantic well they can be when the right performers present them in the proper manner as they did in this wonderful movie i forgot to mention how <UNK> beautiful miss carter looked in this movie i have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever <UNK> the face of our earth but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie br br i hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as i did thank you for letting me express my opinion
<START> i must say this movie is a <UNK> and <UNK> knock off when watching it i got the chills i even wet myself a little when that korean guy with the <UNK> in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time any way back on track chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash <UNK> and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of christmas past this movie is so bad i put my new born child in a box and left it in mr norris <UNK> he can raise my kid i'm not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck norris is a karate expert ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life
<START> i really enjoyed this i'm a big fan of movies that mess with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate and this was a stellar example but then terry gilliam is always good at that well almost always let's just forget about <UNK> and the brothers <UNK> shall we br br i particularly liked the way it handled the time travel theme and the <UNK> of <UNK> the way events in the past and future <UNK> and fed into each other br br it was also really well done <UNK> the art direction was really great and i wish i'd been able to see it on the big screen the future scenes had a similar feel to brazil in a lot of ways and even the present scenes were often really visually compelling br br but perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it featured two actors i normally don't much like bruce willis and brad pitt and they both delivered amazing performances here pitt especially i'd seen one or two films before that made me realize he could in fact actually act contrary to what i'd originally thought but this one really <UNK> them i actually found myself asking my friends at one point are you sure that's brad pitt this is probably the most memorable performance of his career though admittedly that may not be saying too much
<START> this is one of my all time favorites great music and some funny bits i laugh every time at <UNK> the maid pretending to be a <UNK> holding her <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> furniture with it as she <UNK> i just never can get past her french accent never being a problem as they try to pass her off as the <UNK> daughter br br seeing a teenage mel <UNK> and the very young frank sinatra singing is such a treat my mom saw frank sinatra at a theater about the same time this movie came out she said they couldn't clear the bobby <UNK> out between movies in those days you didn't have to leave between <UNK> this movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young frank was and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well and victor <UNK> gets in a bit of his routine in which is a bonus br br this is a fun movie with a sweet simple storyline very enjoyable
<START> don't get me wrong <UNK> was revolutionary and is definitely the best <UNK> game to be based on the <UNK> franchise but the series had fallen into a <UNK> <UNK> enter everything or nothing which puts bond in third person when i wrote my earlier review for from russia with love i had finished <UNK> and just started <UNK> and judged <UNK> a bit <UNK> even though <UNK> definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise <UNK> definitely is superior in terms of in depth controls and <UNK> variety missions range from standard running and <UNK> to driving an <UNK> driving an <UNK> martin driving a <UNK> that is <UNK> to explode <UNK> two different types of tanks a la <UNK> riding a motorcycle flying a helicopter <UNK> down a <UNK> <UNK> by laser <UNK> and free falling after a <UNK> damsel sure vehicle controls are a little clumsy but the issue here is the variety br br as movie adaptations <UNK> and <UNK> were all that i could have hoped for but <UNK> original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem <UNK> shannon elizabeth <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and john <UNK> <UNK> their movie roles of m and q respectively and pierce brosnan while no sean connery adds credibility to the <UNK> proceedings all characters resemble the stars with the disappointing exception of <UNK> <UNK> who's in game model doesn't do the real life model justice <UNK> theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes br br the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies willem <UNK> character is a former colleague of christopher <UNK> baddie from a view to a kill richard <UNK> appears as jaws the <UNK> henchman from the spy who loved me and <UNK> in three fight scenes the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have br br single player <UNK> mainly consists of standard on foot missions as bond like bond you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing the game provides plenty of opportunities to <UNK> stealth with plenty of wall and object cover unfortunately unlike <UNK> only one button in <UNK> controls both <UNK> and wall <UNK> so bond may end up <UNK> low when he's supposed to be <UNK> around a corner and vice versa the game also allows players to go into bond <UNK> mode while you <UNK> your <UNK> everything around you will go into super <UNK> mo allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be <UNK> with while this takes some getting used to eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular bond moments such as shooting down a <UNK> to take out four <UNK> underneath and greatly add to the bond movie feeling br br there are 3 available difficulty levels <UNK> agent and double oh on <UNK> you can <UNK> through in a few hours on agent a few weeks on double oh a few months the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission <UNK> high scores on missions will <UNK> gold and <UNK> awards and effect features such as vehicle <UNK> and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a <UNK> of <UNK> but when all is said and done no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie br br multi player unfortunately is not as thrilling <UNK> still has the best multi player mode of any bond game <UNK> main multi player is a co <UNK> campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser <UNK> agents on a less important mission than <UNK> a more standard third person death match can be <UNK> from this mode but the single player mode is the most complete bond experience to date the ending as with most bond games is <UNK> while the final mission is one of the most <UNK> of the game the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing also levels that require bond to be <UNK> become largely a matter of trial and error still for any serious bond fan not playing this game is <UNK> to missing one of the bond films
<START> the more i think about it there was nothing redeeming about this br br movie i saw it 9 months ago so my memory might have made it br br worse than it was but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of br br 10 br br after seeing the movie i met the director he seemed so clueless br br as to what he was doing or what he had done and as far as i br br could tell he didn't care for the film either even he agreed that he br br didn't really know what he was doing and he was forced to do br br certain things because it was filmed <UNK> br br i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that it br br built for itself 9 people all have to be connected in some way how br br can we get from point <UNK> to point <UNK> so in order get from the br br prostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they 10 br br minutes on each character's relationship to another person it br br makes one feel <UNK> by the 2 <UNK> badly drawn br br characters br br i just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie steve br br <UNK> there is one scene where he is amazing that's it as i br br say 4 out of 10
<START> i was lucky enough to see this at a pre screening last night <UNK> 20 and i was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and genuinely heart felt acting br br while the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh unique and distinctly <UNK> in style it isn't something that can easily be compared to films of the past it's a unique take on a sort of classic middle aged depressed love story br br i was particularly struck by the casting of the film down to every last extra in the family it was a beautiful and talented cast the three daughters did a wonderful job the talent was <UNK> <UNK> between them and none of them out <UNK> the other two br br it was truly a delightful film appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming it was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films
<START> the premise of this movie was decent enough but with sub par acting it was just bland and dull br br spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death it was accidental so although it was a murder it wasn't like the guy set out to do it also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree there is no emotion in this film the first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister and hearing her message it was dull and boring br br with some <UNK> and better acting it could have been pretty good
<START> david mamet is a very interesting and a very un equal director his first movie <UNK> of <UNK> was the one i liked best and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations and so does the perspective of the viewer br br so is <UNK> which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama the principal characters are two cops one jewish and one irish who deal with a <UNK> charged area the murder of an old jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the israeli independence war <UNK> the jewish identity in the mind and heart of the jewish detective br br this is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious the process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe the group of jewish <UNK> is operatic and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic the end of the film itself is mamet like smart but disappoints from a human emotional perspective br br joe <UNK> and william macy give strong performances but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily <UNK>
<START> joan crawford had just begun her working girl makes good phase with the dynamic paid 1930 she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were <UNK> because they were <UNK> to characters that had been the in thing a few years before but were now becoming <UNK> joan was listening to the public and <UNK> her <UNK> as an actress the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were <UNK> upon of course if you became rich through <UNK> means but suffered for it that was alright br br this film starts out with a spectacular house boat party bonnie jordan joan crawford is the most popular girl there especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear however when <UNK> father has a heart attack because of loses on the stock market both bonnie and her brother rodney william <UNK> realise who their real friends are after bob <UNK> lester <UNK> a poor man's johnny mack brown offers to do the right thing and marry her they had just spent a night together when bonnie <UNK> with abandon that she wants love on <UNK> she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job br br she finds a job at a newspaper and quickly <UNK> by her will to do well her working buddy is bert <UNK> cliff <UNK> and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is <UNK> and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer jake <UNK> clark gable rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces <UNK> the <UNK> to the first person he sees drinking at the bar which happens to be bert he is then forced to kill bert and after <UNK> he goes into hiding the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find <UNK> killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of <UNK> <UNK> joan does a very lively dance to <UNK> joe much to <UNK> disgust the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying bonnie <UNK> phones in her story br br this is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all natalie <UNK> who as <UNK> shared a famous cigarette scene with gable early in the film was a stylish other woman who had her <UNK> in the early thirties william <UNK> had a huge career he had started as a teenager in a douglas fairbanks film in the mid <UNK> a lot of his roles though were weak <UNK> characters in this film he played the weak brother and was completely over <UNK> by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable maybe that was why he never became a star br br highly recommended
<START> the day has finally come for me to witness the <UNK> of <UNK> fate as an assassin <UNK> of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she <UNK> through so mercilessly during the first saga br br that's as <UNK> as i'll get when talking about azumi 2 death or love because when i <UNK> over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying <UNK> and complained about the credibility of <UNK> <UNK> portraying a blood driven assassin after watching azumi 2 i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before br br not only does the determination of each assassin feels <UNK> and uninspiring but also many important elements are <UNK> from the entire experience in azumi 1 we saw the <UNK> use various stealth tactics which is their number one <UNK> as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift <UNK> and <UNK> abilities to escape but i won't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly <UNK> this time around and many more obstacles are planted in <UNK> way to prevent her from reaching the <UNK> and displaying any signs of charisma by the way <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go minus the cool weapon and sense of menace br br this brings me to the final blow which is the action simply disguised in the title as the <UNK> side of the epic in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising <UNK> with flashy looks and even <UNK> weapons to no one's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily in azumi 1 the young <UNK> were mostly <UNK> the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and <UNK> in comparison to the fights in azumi 2 was at least <UNK> and worthwhile some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve <UNK> due to the <UNK> of each encounter i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further <UNK> br br the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution br br as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation i won't lie and i'll admit to my <UNK> and <UNK> towards the first azumi film but i'll step right up and say that after watching azumi 2 the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece for what it's worth azumi 2 death or love could have gone straight to video with its <UNK> <UNK> budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the <UNK> journey of desperate <UNK> doing their best to <UNK> the peace with an <UNK> courage to die trying
<START> the two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities br br first daphne <UNK> in her first appearance in a film young and <UNK> with looks that still <UNK> her body today steals the very beginning which is all she is in and that is that she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects br br second the score by then known composer christopher chris young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star yeah i know one star more is not much but in this movie's case it is a lot br br the rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a <UNK> that is due for being torn down getting <UNK> one by one by an unsuspecting killer blah blah blah we all know where this is going br br watch the first <UNK> minutes with daphne <UNK> then turn it off
<START> i saw this on a flight over to the u s and was a little <UNK> at first as a few people had said there were so many characters in it that you didnt get to know any of them however i didnt find this at all the film is fast but this is due to the nature of the director and the star the chase scenes are excellent and yes it may be predictable but <UNK> that true of most films the main villain is a bit of a let down christopher <UNK> is not as convincing as he could have been but that said its still a good film
<START> the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film it is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements take for instance the switch between black white and color if done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a <UNK> and only <UNK> from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's the ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was <UNK> everything had to turn out right in the end i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time i'm glad i watched this in class and not on my own time i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob <UNK> music those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick i hope you take my advice and stay away from this
<START> the movie within the movie a concept done many times in the history of cinema it is accomplished here as well as in any br br if you love carmen you'll love this version br br if you love flamenco you'll love this version br br the plot of the classic opera is played out in the actual rehearsal of the opera by a flamenco <UNK> the music is authentic the direction wonderful br br if you like dancing you'll love this version br br there is tragedy there is passion there is intrigue br br there is br br carmen
<START> although i have to admit i laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies i saw br br the budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors the production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch reminds me of the robot monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on br br in one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off <UNK> hard to believe but the black knight scene from holy grail was more realistic i kept wondering why the victim didn't start shouting none shall pass and it's only a flesh wound i've had worse it was one of the funniest scenes i've seen in the past year br br the gladiator demon was a <UNK> too between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical br br truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film br br
<START> berlin born in 1942 <UNK> von <UNK> was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer she has been described perhaps even unfairly <UNK> as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen <UNK> her artistic strengths rosenstrasse which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews the new york times article was one of the most <UNK> aggressive reviews i've ever read in that paper is not a perfect film it is a fine movie and a testament to a rare <UNK> of successful opposition to the <UNK> nazi regime by of all peoples <UNK> <UNK> germans <UNK> in a berlin street br br co writer von <UNK> uses the actual rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never <UNK> life as a child in the german capital during world war ii br br the husband of ruth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has died and in a surprising <UNK> to an <UNK> jewish lifestyle apparently <UNK> in long <UNK> ruth not only sits <UNK> the <UNK> week long mourning ritual but she insists on following the strict <UNK> of her faith her apartment in new york city reflects the <UNK> <UNK> by her deceased <UNK> <UNK> her american born

<UNK> van <UNK> a domestic crisis might well <UNK> as ruth warns that she'll <UNK> hannah if she doesn't give up <UNK> handsome luis stay tuned br br a cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in berlin hannah is intrigued she <UNK> her mom who <UNK> refuses to discuss that part of her life this is very very realistic i grew up with parents who <UNK> nazi germany just in time and i knew many children whose families in whole but usually in part escaped the holocaust those days were simply not discussed br br so hannah having learned that a german <UNK> woman saved <UNK> life <UNK> off to berlin hoping to find the <UNK> still breathing were she not this would have been a very short film but ruth pretending to be a <UNK> <UNK> 90 year old lena <UNK> doris <UNK> now a widow as the happy to be interviewed but <UNK> up by repressed memories lena tells her story the scenes shift fairly <UNK> between present day berlin and the war time capital br br the young lena of 1943 <UNK> <UNK> was a fine <UNK> married to a jewish <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> martin <UNK> with the <UNK> of the nazi regime he was required to use israel as a middle name just as jewish women had to add sarah to their names incidentally i wish imdb had not given <UNK> name on its characters list with the false israel included it simply <UNK> a name applied by nazis as a mark of <UNK> and <UNK> br br while germany <UNK> most of its jewish population to concentration camps those married to <UNK> were <UNK> for a time until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too most were men a minority were jewish women married to non jews the <UNK> is shown here in all its frightening intensity br br the young lena tries to locate her husband all she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on rosenstrasse the crowd of anxious women builds up some <UNK> seeking help from german officers who predictably refuse aid and also <UNK> abuse them jew loving whore being one <UNK> as a subplot lena more or less <UNK> eight year old ruth who <UNK> when her mother was <UNK> remember ruth is now sitting <UNK> in manhattan the child ruth is <UNK> portrayed by <UNK> <UNK> br br through increasingly angry <UNK> the women finally <UNK> the men and a handful of women are released as in the real story the nazis gave in one of the rare almost <UNK> times when the <UNK> acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda another was the <UNK> of the <UNK> campaign to rid the <UNK> of mental <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but that's another story br br von <UNK> builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal hannah continues to <UNK> the aging lena who slowly one <UNK> begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary <UNK> but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued the child whose mother was murdered br br the <UNK> between rosenstrasse of 1943 a set and the street today in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> berlin provide a recurring <UNK> element today's berlin bears the <UNK> but not the <UNK> of a monstrous past von <UNK> makes that point very well br br the main actors are uniformly impressive <UNK> husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the <UNK> of <UNK> with a likely <UNK> of <UNK> which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters including the local police and military as a one way trip to oblivion the older ruth is <UNK> forced to confront demons long <UNK> in her happy new york life hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death <UNK> a need to discover her family's past these things happen although the <UNK> critic appears not to know that br br von <UNK> hand is sure but not perfect a scene with <UNK> at a <UNK> enjoying <UNK> <UNK> playing is unnecessary and <UNK> the suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister the most <UNK> top level hitler <UNK> to save her husband <UNK> from the wondrous accomplishment of the <UNK> <UNK> and relatives most of the german officers come from central casting and are <UNK> by the <UNK> von <UNK> copy and <UNK> school of <UNK> <UNK> but that's understandable br br the rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and <UNK> and some claim it's a <UNK> case for arguing that many more jews could have been saved had more germans <UNK> unfortunately that argument is nonsense the german women who occupied rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self interested most germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and <UNK> anti <UNK> that's why the rosenstrasse protest was virtually <UNK> whether one buys or rejects the <UNK> <UNK> that most germans were willing <UNK> of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre nazi <UNK> anti <UNK> <UNK> into a <UNK> strain from 1933 on br br the elderly lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was a ray of light in an evil time most of the men and women <UNK> from a near death trip survived the war so a ray of light it was and von <UNK> movie is a <UNK> of <UNK> showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists and always will br br 9 10
<START> <UNK> heaven for lovers of french cinema and by <UNK> french screen actors actresses at its worst it's an <UNK> actors getting to bitch about other actors question the <UNK> of acting as a profession at all etc whilst at its best it's a glorious celebration send up of some of the finest actors currently working from a simple premise jean pierre <UNK> request for water being ignored in a restaurant <UNK> <UNK> off in all directions and allows the cream of french cinema to <UNK> their stuff before the camera even throwing in <UNK> to those no longer around jean <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> including the director's father bernard one of the great <UNK> of french cinema from whom he fields a <UNK> phone call at the end of the film <UNK> and <UNK> yes guilty as charged but also something of a guilty pleasure
<START> this episode from the first season slightly edges towards controversy with the whole gender <UNK> angle i imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before this was finished to <UNK> censors br br the story itself is original and well written and the directing is <UNK> by the fine acting nicholas <UNK> makes his x files debut though not as agent <UNK> but as a victim called michael i especially enjoyed the built up to and the ending itself br br its different but enjoyable ignore any bad reviews you may hear watch it for yourself and make judgement then
<START> i went to see this with my wife and 3 <UNK> old son he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar disney <UNK> in fact i had a very hard time paying attention at all the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long <UNK> that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk out br br not to say that the film isn't an interesting concept it's just told so oddly bad screenplay especially when we meet the family for the first time i know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord they could've <UNK> that sequence by a good 15 minutes seemingly i didn't actually time it by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit
<START> when i was <UNK> through the tv guide and came across twisted desire on the movie section i read it's description three words caught my eye melissa joan hart i find her role in sabrina the teenage witch absolutely vile i hate those kind of programs so i was just thinking that it was going to be a boring old love story starring her little did i know br br it finally started on the television i had my bucket ready in case i were to <UNK> over it's cheesiness or <UNK> you know what i mean at first you think she's just a nice ordinary girl who's in love but has mean parents then when you find out she's manipulated her boyfriend into killing her parents so she could be with her true love you're like <UNK> you just don't expect this sort of role for that sort of actress she played her role very well in my opinion i never expected her to be able to act like such a bitch and <UNK> she did it perfectly <UNK> to her the movie was very good i'd definitely watch it again and recommend it to others
<START> i wasn't expecting a lot from a film directed by sidney j <UNK> and starring dolph lundgren but i was surely expecting more than a got a one liner user comment 2nd rate action movie didn't seem too <UNK> to me for a lundgren film on the other hand i wouldn't have bothered to watch this film if its rating was below 5 0 but hey the movie had a 5 9 out of 10 score which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production br br now i understand that the <UNK> 5 of people who rated this film a 10 excellent was clearly a publicity stunt because <UNK> is the regular <UNK> image garbage you have seen before over and over br br lundgren does not convince as an ex military turned a history teacher assigned to a rough school his acting is just plain terrible <UNK> and contrived <UNK> inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with the juvenile <UNK> kids either they are great actors or compared to lundgren they seem great actors just because they seem natural and believable br br <UNK> has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie a closed for weekend high security high school four teens in <UNK> with a war veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in but the story something like the breakfast club meets die hard or is it panic room is full of unbelievable situations lots of clichés and stereotypical characters and let's not forget dolph lundgren is the main actor br br alex <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> play a bonnie and clyde couple in love and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie even if he seems a low budget version of sam <UNK> and she a <UNK> <UNK> wanna be in a movie where everything fails their <UNK> and style <UNK> enough fresh air to prevent my interest from dropping to ground zero
<START> this slick and gritty film consistently delivers it's one of <UNK> best and most underrated films and it's easily the best <UNK> leonard adaptation to date and if you are scratching your head thinking but i loved get <UNK> you need to be <UNK> in the face in my opinion no one captures the feel for <UNK> characters better then john glover in <UNK> pick up the <UNK> of the story from detroit novel to hollywood film <UNK> the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights be a man have a few beers and watch this movie for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are <UNK> <UNK> punch cat <UNK> city <UNK> and <UNK> pick up my favorite <UNK> films include seconds and the <UNK> candidate i also have a real special place in my cold movie heart for dead bang and black sunday
<START> the man in the white suit is one of those delightful comedies that ealing studies made so well in the 40's and 50's the plot of this one follows a man that <UNK> a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks of course this is a huge breakthrough in the world of <UNK> however things are not that simple as the cloth will <UNK> the way of life of many people including cloth <UNK> the cloth <UNK> <UNK> and even an old lady that does her <UNK> every week the man in the white suit is a film about scientific advances and the way that they don't always help as the old woman says at one point in the movie why cant you scientists just leave things alone br br like a lot ealing comedies this one stars sir alec guinness alec guinness is a fantastic actor he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence and he does in this film literally but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way he is suitably creepy in this film and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character an intelligent and ambitious but slightly naive scientist along with guinness the man in the white suit also features joan <UNK> the deep voiced actress that co starred with guinness in the simply divine kind hearts and <UNK> and michael <UNK> a man that would go on to get himself the role of alfred in the batman films the acting in the film isn't always great but it is always decent and it's fits with the film br br the man in the white suit is an intelligent thought provoking and witty comedy with a moral the comedy isn't always obvious and it doesn't always work but the film is not meant to be a film that <UNK> belly laughs so that is forgivable i recommend this movie basically to anyone that is a fan of movies
<START> a much <UNK> film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an ever <UNK> spiral of domestic violence br br at times difficult to watch while morris day is portrayed as the <UNK> prince as the knight on motorcycle <UNK> he is still called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay that he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but <UNK> hero is credit to the writing prince is so free of ego in this film that not only does he portray himself as a <UNK> <UNK> who beats women but his most famous song is <UNK> as being written by his father and wendy lisa even further two of his compositions computer blue admittedly the <UNK> weakest track and darling <UNK> are shown as being songs that kill off an audience perhaps the only <UNK> to the <UNK> ego is a card that lists the slightly shorter than prince <UNK> as <UNK> br br the nearly complete amateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves and reviewers who <UNK> the actors on the terms that they've never appeared in other movies are completely missing the point and do perfectly well under the direction morris day gets most of the <UNK> for his likable ham though <UNK> <UNK> must also get credit for <UNK> off him well particularly their stage act which is hilarious day and <UNK> even go so far as to make an <UNK> and <UNK> routine funny which takes some doing br br lastly there's prince while i admit to bias i do actually think he's a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a low key version of himself acting isn't his profession this was a film made for entertainment so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role isn't robert deniro and thinking they're making a point is sadly <UNK> i don't want this review to be a <UNK> attack of other people's comments but i've even this film <UNK> as having a low budget and being darkly lit how would a film about domestic violence be shot then with full <UNK> <UNK> and a cgi dinosaur walking into frame br br the film acts almost as a perfect <UNK> of the <UNK> light and skinny tie <UNK> until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and this isn't some retro recreation <UNK> best film with oscar winning music it sees him at his <UNK> and it's <UNK> to realise that even though he would make some fine albums he would never again capture this high
<START> a found tape about 3 guys having fun torturing a woman in several <UNK> ways br br yeah spoiler br br first of all the acting made this short not scary at all the woman seemed to have <UNK> not suffering some of the <UNK> were so ridiculous what's shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair if you are shooting a nonsense tape at least make it good the only part to remark is the end the <UNK> hand and the <UNK> eye the rest of the film is really poor to end the boredom the supposed story about the tape being <UNK> extra <UNK>
<START> i very much looked forward to this movie its a good family movie however if michael <UNK> jr 's editing team did a better job of editing the movie would be much better too many scenes out of context i do hope there is another movie from the series they're all very good but if another one is made i beg them to take better care at editing this story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great i enjoy the story of willie and <UNK> they're both great role models plus the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story
<START> who would have thought that such an obscure little film could be so haunting and touching i am really impressed it's a shame that more people have not seen it i loved as always hans <UNK> score and what a directorial debut by bernard rose yet i wonder if i should call this a horror film it could easily be <UNK> that it is a fantasy or a drama as well well regardless i love the <UNK> potential it has everything and everyone in <UNK> played by charlotte burke dreams represents a real conflict in her life the house itself the tree mark the <UNK> etc it is the many details such as these that make the film so good for repeated viewings i hope i come across another little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon
<START> this movie was so bad it was terrible it was awful i cannot stress it enough the acting directing story characters and everything about it was bad it was so corny and clichéd don't be fooled by the cover or the tag line the <UNK> <UNK> is nothing to laugh at are you <UNK> kidding me it was ridiculous br br the first 2 minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character brendan ok now turn it off what i got from the film was a bunch of ugly annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings <UNK> <UNK> kills them in unoriginal and fake ways br br this movie was a waste of my time and money and it would be a waste of your money and time too i fast forward through most of the movie because it was so terrible i just wanted to see how each bad actor died and it still wasn't worth it just looking at the cover is a waste of time this is seriously the worst movie ever rating doesn't deserve one
<START> just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 2 part 1980 made for tv film attention but the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the <UNK> jim jones who built a church into a virtual empire and then encouraged it to <UNK> into a sleazy cult in which a <UNK> and his <UNK> were <UNK> and <UNK> cult followers committed suicide by drinking <UNK> aid <UNK> with <UNK> br br done very <UNK> but horrifying enough unlike the excruciatingly sadistic cult of the damned <UNK> tragedy features an all star cast including ned beatty as <UNK> leo ryan meg foster randy quaid brad <UNK> brenda <UNK> <UNK> burton and <UNK> <UNK> but it is powers <UNK> in his first big role that really stands out as jim jones he actually becomes the man and his performance is riveting and chilling thus it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years
<START> there's no one else watching the movie my husband and i went to watch it last night it's just a small theater but there's usually a decent amount of people there not this time my husband and i were the only people watching dragon wars last night now we know why br br the movie was by far one of the worst i've ever seen yes the cg was good but that was it the acting script dialog directing editing etc was god awful since we were alone in the room we felt free to talk during the movie that is we talked about how bad it was that it reminded us of the mighty <UNK> power rangers godzilla mortal combat and the lord of the rings it was like we expected to see rita and lord <UNK> portraying <UNK> of <UNK> army br br the creatures were ridiculous you can't just introduce <UNK> of <UNK> dragon lizard things loaded down with <UNK> without explanation the lord of the rings has a wide spectrum of characters but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies not in an hour and a half br br the scene transitions are horrible i didn't fall asleep during the movie but even though it was an overly simple plot i found myself getting lost in the plot holes br br the characters were <UNK> americans but spoke almost with broken english because of the badly written dialog in the script br br the final scene that could have redeemed some value of the movie failed ethan didn't cry when sarah died though he hadn't known her for very long during this life anyways he didn't seem too upset to be left in <UNK> not knowing where he was or how to get back we couldn't for the love of god figure out where he was or how he got there either but if he wasn't upset we shouldn't be either br br oh and why did the dress that <UNK> spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from queen elizabeth one more thing all 3 of the main hero characters were <UNK> brought back to finish the job sarah <UNK> her task and moves on to the <UNK> jack does this as well then why does ethan get screwed he's left alone without the girl without a map <UNK> helicopter to help him get back what's he supposed to do send smoke <UNK> and if he gets back home does he just go back to his job he should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes had br br don't waste your time or money on this movie we only stayed <UNK> the end because we'd paid for it but as soon as the credits hit we were out the door
<START> <UNK> and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade now that it had become the site of a multi million dollar industry and the <UNK> integrated studio system had been established some of those in the <UNK> quarters of this film making factory were taking the time for a little self reflection the last command while its heart may be the classic story of a once <UNK> man fallen on hard times frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema <UNK> <UNK> reality and how its production process could be mercilessly <UNK> it was written by <UNK> <UNK> who had been on the scene long enough to know br br taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywood's most celebrated immigrants  <UNK> <UNK> before coming to the states <UNK> had worked mainly in comedy being a master of the hammy yet hilariously well timed performance often as pompous authority figures or <UNK> old has <UNK> he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter and at first it looks as if this is to be another of <UNK> scenery <UNK> caricatures however as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range showing by turns delicate <UNK> <UNK> dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale he never quite stops being a <UNK> exaggeration the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every <UNK> of his performance br br the director was another immigrant albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry nevertheless joseph von <UNK> <UNK> for himself the image of the artistic and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the von was made up by the way and took a very distinctive approach to the craft of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes we open with a carefully constructed chaos with movement in <UNK> directions which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen then when <UNK> arrives everything <UNK> down <UNK> performance is incredibly <UNK> and <UNK> and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored order br br <UNK> appears to show a <UNK> for violence allowing the <UNK> moments to take place off screen and yet <UNK> that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic in fact he really seems to have an all round lack of interest in action in the scene of the <UNK> revolt <UNK> takes an <UNK> and objective stance his camera eventually <UNK> to a fly on the wall position compare this to the following scenes between <UNK> and evelyn brent which are a complex <UNK> of point of view shots and intense close ups <UNK> us right into the midst of their interaction br br as a personality on set it would seem that <UNK> was much like the cold and <UNK> director played on the screen by william powell and in fact <UNK> portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even <UNK> himself would have been in on unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired while <UNK> displays classic <UNK> in the charles <UNK> mode that works dramatically it appears no one told his co stars they were not in a comedy evelyn brent is fairly good giving us some good <UNK> but <UNK> it here and there the only performance that comes close to <UNK> is that of powell himself it's a little odd to see the normally <UNK> star of the thin man and the great <UNK> playing a figure so stern and <UNK> like a male <UNK> but he does a good job revealing a <UNK> emotional intensity beneath the hard hearted exterior br br the last command could easily have <UNK> a few <UNK> in studio <UNK> as tends to happen with any <UNK> commentary on the film making process even a relatively tame example like this at the very least i believe many studio heads would have been <UNK> by the behind the scenes view as it threatened the <UNK> of movie making which was still very much alive at this point as it turned out such was the impact of the picture that <UNK> won the first ever academy award for best actor as well as a best writing nomination for <UNK> <UNK> and according to some sources although the issue is a little vague a nomination for best picture this is significant since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of self indulgent back <UNK> by the hollywood elite but elite or not they <UNK> good material when they saw it and were willing to reward it
<START> i am still <UNK> at the thought of ever seeing this movie again br br i have seen action films i have even liked quite a few of them but this one goes over the top br br not only does it have the worst male actor ever sly stallone playing the lead role but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground would be hell of a lot easier that it requires a person with iq less than his <UNK> to believe it br br furthermore the plot has no real twists at all a three year old kid could guess what comes next it is a set of cliches of action genre with sly performing even worse than his other movies he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film now there is an actor who can't act a surprised b sad c anything else than his basic face br br i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it explosions are outstanding but then you can see better on the 4th of july landscapes are <UNK> but then there are documentaries about the <UNK> and <UNK> so you can see better sights that way rather than waste time on this flick br br go watch some other movie instead there are hundreds even thousands better action movies
<START> in my mind this remains one of the very best depictions of superman on tv as well as one of the most faithful to a particular comics period br br this series paid homage to both the superman films of the '70s '80s and the superman comics series <UNK> of 1986 <UNK> man of steel superman <UNK> 2 action comics adventures of superman etc the opening score and titles were stirring based on the john williams score from the films updated for a saturday morning action series <UNK> <UNK> one of the main <UNK> to the comics <UNK> writer of adventures of superman was a perfect choice to be involved in this animated series overall the series had a more mature feel while continuing to be very kid friendly br br superman was presented as believable strong and iconic his recurring nemesis was lex luthor in his <UNK> <UNK> incarnation the daily planet characters lois jimmy and perry were portrayed well one of my favorite appearances was by wonder woman and the story <UNK> around her home island of <UNK> paradise island both her design and that of her mother <UNK> were in keeping with the similarly <UNK> wonder woman comic book series of the era and it seemed like an equally well done animated series could have been developed for her if handled the same br br the one thing that is hard to believe is that this has not been released on dvd <UNK> ray it deserves to be
<START> there should be a sub genre in the western called 'the robert mitchum <UNK> <UNK> brilliant <UNK> usually <UNK> westerns <UNK> his film noir persona to <UNK> some <UNK> dark character sketches and bring an <UNK> world <UNK> more familiar from the films of sam <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> is one of his best directed by orson welles <UNK> richard wilson it is a stark <UNK> beauty full of chilling <UNK> and terrifying <UNK> of savage violence as mitchum comes to tame a town <UNK> by a <UNK> with a private army <UNK> <UNK> from soft spoken stranger to deranged murderer with a host of dark emotions in between is a marvel of <UNK> physical acting
<START> it's sad to view this film now that we know how the <UNK> got <UNK> by international capitalism biko died for nothing much woods achieved little yes outright apartheid was <UNK> but all the <UNK> of power was reserved by the minority whites leaving the <UNK> government more or less <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> writes in the shock <UNK> in the talks between the black and white <UNK> the <UNK> government had a <UNK> <UNK> first drawing on the <UNK> washington <UNK> that there was no only one way to run an economy it portrayed key <UNK> of economic decision making such as trade policy and the central bank as technical or <UNK> then it used a wide range of new policy tools international trade <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> law and <UNK> <UNK> programs to hand control of those power <UNK> to supposedly <UNK> experts <UNK> and officials from the <UNK> the world bank the <UNK> and the national party anyone except the <UNK> fighters from the <UNK> the <UNK> results are horrifying with not much change accomplished and aids <UNK> viewing cry freedom in this light is deeply ironic actually tragic the <UNK> has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem
<START> i think it was ebert who gave stella four out of four stars but other than his i have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class <UNK> love and sacrifice three themes most great romantic stories or films have in common br br here the major theme is class division stella is a story from depression era america that said it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion that this remake if you ask a stanwyck fan or two was not exactly appreciated fans of the original never gave it a chance furthermore this version of stella was made in the 1990s not exactly a time of great financial trouble in america as the depression was br br now is the time to remove the <UNK> <UNK> glasses in the midst of a new era of <UNK> and poverty in america and see that this powerful story still rings true is as <UNK> and relevant as ever in its updated format br br yes class <UNK> is the major theme here stella is among the working poor single with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams she works in a bar doesn't have much money lives in a crummy apartment you get the drift in the morning she doesn't really want to get out of bed on her wall pictures of movie stars she <UNK> br br a man sees her dance at the bar he's wealthy educated from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with <UNK> his major concern is what <UNK> league college to attend <UNK> is how to pay the rent how to be <UNK> ' they have an affair they like each other stella ends up pregnant stella tells the guy the news his response how about an abortion she replies i just wanted a room full of <UNK> he supplies the <UNK> and the <UNK> but she sees his heart is not in it and has too much pride to accept she sends him <UNK> br br her daughter is eventually torn between the two <UNK> the love she has for her mom and the <UNK> and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father stella alone and <UNK> and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday makes the ultimate sacrifice she gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter and perhaps live <UNK> and with hope knowing that at least her daughter found something to live for br br now for the movie everything is right about it beautiful score <UNK> cinematography great set design contrast between the two <UNK> the messy apt and the <UNK> <UNK> wonderful and heartfelt performances by the whole cast with bette midler in particular oscar worthy br br this is a film which is much more significant and well made than you've been led to believe
<START> no movie with dennis hopper gary busey erika <UNK> tom berenger dean <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> deserves a rating under 5 on here this is a poor mans version of movies like 16 <UNK> or the timeless midnight run except the prisoner being transported here is the very easy on the eye ms <UNK> tom berenger plays another gruff maverick military type well and william <UNK> plays his rookie about to be <UNK> foil well the plot on the face of it is absurd because i lost count of the times <UNK> should have and could have escaped but this is an entertaining feel good movie and there are good cameos from all of the above actors that keep the movie rolling this isn't really a family movie as there is some swearing and a rare nude scene with <UNK> but this is a lot better than some of the other <UNK> that came out around this time
<START> i consider myself a huge movie buff i was sick on the couch and popped in this film right from the opening to the end i watched in awe at these great actors i'd never seen say great word the filming was beautiful it was just what i needed i hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others the director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout <UNK> for making a film like this one just wonderfully awkward beautiful kind characters who are flawed and <UNK> all at once just great i can't submit this without 10 lines in total so i will simply go on to say that i wish for more from this director more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer i didn't want it to end the end
<START> it's all about <UNK> i loved her in this and didn't she look fantastic i love these lifetime sunday afternoon popcorn movies this is like one of those <UNK> where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times the richard character was completely creepy i've dated guys like that well not totally like that lol i wish <UNK> hadn't have gotten killed he was a <UNK> and very easy on the eyes i love these stalker type stories it always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked my husband doesn't usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it i can't wait to see what <UNK> does next
<START> i am curious of what rifle <UNK> was using in the movie and also the caliber of the bullet that he was suppose to be firing if this is loosely based on carlos <UNK> <UNK> i am guessing that it is a <UNK> round i am also curious of the rifle itself he also made a comment in the final sniper movie about the rifle that the <UNK> man let him use that <UNK> to his father <UNK> mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made i would like to know which rifle that is also i know that this particular rifle was made around wwii or beforehand i just couldn't get a close enough look at it watching the movie to identify it br br as for mr <UNK> kills his longest shot was 1 <UNK> miles and he had <UNK> confirmed kills and 14 <UNK> kills after his wounds somewhat <UNK> from being burned in vietnam he spent the rest of his career teaching <UNK> in the <UNK> the skills that they would need in the field his <UNK> career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters that train in the <UNK> i found out his name from my friend who is a former marine any information would be great
<START> this film is definitely an odd love story though this film may not be much to shout about nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of <UNK> life with shots of st <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> town centre depicting the true essence of the area what starts <UNK> like a regular episode of the popular british tv series <UNK> soon turns into a gritty gangster <UNK> action flick nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends up as fairly decent weekend entertainment a good one to watch and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character
<START> this movie was definitely not one of mary kate and <UNK> best movies i really didn't like it and i was kind of disappointed in that movie for some reason it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast in some parts it got so boring that i had to fast forward it it didn't have any <UNK> or any exciting parts like their other movies
<START> this movie was 100 boring i swear i almost died from boredom at the theater it <UNK> funny and didnt really <UNK> that much action in it either it was boring and i hope whoever out there that liked this movie god be with you in the future when you find out what this movie was really like and try to jump off a bridge or something like that
<START> it's easy to make really general comments about a film like this the fact that it's one of the only remaining japanese films from this era causes people to say that it started japanese cinema and was unlike anything the west ever made the latter of these two comments is particularly false as <UNK> himself admitted to ripping off <UNK> on more than one occasion but style was meant to be <UNK> and doesn't take away from this film's importance what we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles opening the doors for a truly brilliant <UNK> of <UNK> and realities for this purpose the <UNK> is the ideal setting and the writers knew this this is a landmark film and every effort should be made to track it down br br 5 out of 5 essential
<START> gandhi my father is a well made movie it nicely portrays the life of <UNK> <UNK> son harilal his character his differences with his father his love for his family his desire to stand on his own his failure his ego <UNK> <UNK> completely <UNK> the role of harilal just not him everyone did well in the roles they played <UNK> <UNK> is the best on screen <UNK> i've ever seen but i will cut three points as there were few shortcomings br br first movie was fifteen twenty minutes longer than it should have second the movie needed more research into <UNK> character somewhere the character looked <UNK> also his relation with his brothers was not shown there was no mention of any other child of <UNK> in the whole movie i believe the character like harilal should be having at least some differences his brothers as well considering the <UNK> nature of harilal br br anyways despite some shortcomings i liked the movie recommended
<START> only the most <UNK> doris day fan could find this one even bearable to watch when one thinks of the wealth of material available for a story about new york city's most famous <UNK> a film that could have dealt with numerous real life stories of what people had to cope with this <UNK> the bottom of the barrel for lack of story telling originality br br once again doris is <UNK> because she suspects she may have been <UNK> on the night of the <UNK> when she returned to her <UNK> <UNK> took a sleeping <UNK> and woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same wandering into the house by mistake br br nobody is able to salvage this mess not doris not robert morse terry thomas patrick <UNK> or lola <UNK> as directed by <UNK> <UNK> it's the weakest vehicle day found herself in committed to do the film because of her husband's <UNK> and unable to get out of it too bad
<START> what starts out as a gentle country yarn <UNK> and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as edward <UNK> initially charming <UNK> gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western br br an <UNK> <UNK> norton wanders into town and charms a young girl <UNK> rachel wood seemingly <UNK> her from a dead end existence with her bad <UNK> father with a <UNK> romance but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye br br edward norton  a real <UNK> actor with changing facial hair to match playing a country <UNK> accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he's merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent he certainly makes it appear <UNK> to make all the nuanced little <UNK> as we learn more about <UNK> however with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where <UNK> is coming from and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused <UNK> rachel wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her <UNK> at norton br br down in the valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace and by never really making the <UNK> motives clear the audience's <UNK> for the characters remain uncertain should we like this drifter or not even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear this ambiguity is to the film's <UNK> as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a <UNK> <UNK> had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess fans of old fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the <UNK> tone <UNK> fans of norton aside or fans of the lush scenery of the san <UNK> valley give this a miss
<START> i found <UNK> <UNK> to be <UNK> entertaining and not only to those of us who lived through that <UNK> era of late '60s early '70s rock my 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time i drag out the dvd don't worry it's only been three times and she loves it too br br it is a truly loving poignant and hilarious nod to the era and every actor hits his her notes with perfection it was my first introduction to bill <UNK> and i am glad his somewhat similar turn in <UNK> <UNK> brought him more attention bruce robinson was incredible as brian bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug damaged rocker stereotype it was interesting to see that robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer br br i live in <UNK> <UNK> california and after the first time i saw the movie i <UNK> into billy connolly at the local mall he lived here at the time and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time he invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time we even talked of the idea of an american oriented remake before wisely <UNK> that why mess with the original br br my only problem with <UNK> <UNK> is that it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience
<START> this film is so much of a rip off of the <UNK> demons and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching the acting is terrible the action scenes are <UNK> up the script is almost painful and budget non existent br br if you think this film is good then you <UNK> seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons
<START> despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation this is probably one of most uninspiring disney films i've seen and i don't slam disney films very often spirit is a wild <UNK> who repeatedly gets captured either by the <UNK> or by indians both of which try to break him spirit ends up <UNK> a bond with the indian and that in a nutshell is the story with exception to the beautiful animation of the horses neither i or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film it's ironic that it's titled spirit as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of an extra point was given for the soundtrack which was enjoyable with songs by bryan adams and hans <UNK> and although this film is rated g you will still probably have to end up explaining what breaking a horse means to your five year old i did br br
<START> of all the reviews i've read most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre neither marie or <UNK> ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual as most of us are however hard it may be for anyone to admit alexandre is getting away with life perfectly being totally taken care of getting and giving what he wants the girls are allowing this <UNK> loves sex marie is his <UNK> is there anything wrong with any of this is anyone in love really i don't think so though french new wave cinema is prone to <UNK> and so on it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in <UNK> position in an urban area can ask for i'm looking for a <UNK> anyone interested
<START> a comparison between this movie and 'the last <UNK> is made by some but <UNK> is <UNK> than a stretch of <UNK> highway in west texas and like the scenery in the desert there's nothing much to <UNK> it not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy <UNK> this time around no one in the cast comes off too well with this lame script that's not surprising dennis hopper the director won't give much space to this one if he ever writes a <UNK> i don't think
<START> this is the first of the complete dramatic works of william shakespeare bbc series i've seen and if all of them are like this i might watch no more being practically the full text of the play is everything this romeo juliet has going for it lacking in all other <UNK> alvin <UNK> reveals himself as a dreadful director both in the technical and artistic aspects in the former because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid take in consideration for example the badly edited first shot of abraham and <UNK> in the opening scene or the <UNK> entering of <UNK> <UNK> cell asking where's romeo with him being so very in front of her that she'd clearly see him even if she was blind and in the latter because every single one of the performers is <UNK> even if some of them are good actors rebecca <UNK> looks exactly the way i've always imagined juliet to look like and she doesn't seem to be a bad actress for a teenager but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind patrick <UNK> as romeo is even worse being not only as dull as juliet but also way too old and not even good looking coming across as a combination of malcolm mcdowell and the <UNK> doll putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written alan <UNK> in his screen debut plays <UNK> like if he was darth vader which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that shakespeare intended no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings this <UNK> is so mean looking that we don't believe the characters' pity after his demise as for paris i kept thinking of prince <UNK> from <UNK> only <UNK> johnson manages to do the character of the nurse some justice br br at <UNK> minutes this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters because the characters don't empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles the best screen version is still franco <UNK> but to be fair this bbc one isn't nearly as bad as <UNK> like george <UNK> flamboyant <UNK> version or the crime against humanity that is <UNK> <UNK> feature length mtv video 4 10
<START> a disappointing end to a season that started so well br br <UNK> part 2 and other notable episodes were amongst the best seen on tv in any series where as this was rather bad br br well i am not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment but the cheesy guitar music at that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original series br br its almost as if the corporate <UNK> didn't like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up they failed and rather <UNK> everything br br lets hope this is not a trend for the future br br still at least we saw the return of a certain person even if somewhat <UNK> and <UNK> done
<START> as many others have stated this is a terrible movie from every aspect of movie making how they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazing br br many people have complained that it was shot on <UNK> video cameras yes it was shot on video but not <UNK> video what made it bad was the lighting white <UNK> shooting technique and editing br br there were so many different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production mess harsh inconsistent lighting over use of hand held shooting ala woody allen choppy editing another allen technique but poorly done without real purpose br br the lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing very amateurish br br the <UNK> sex scenes had no acting value at any level br br how this video ever made it to print is beyond me it is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is
<START> watch the original with the same title from 1944 this made for tv movie is just god awful although it does use as far as i can tell almost the same dialog it just doesn't work is it the acting the poor directing ok so it's made for tv but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hands on the superb original especially as you'll be spoiled to the plot and won't enjoy the original as much as if you've watched it first br br there are a few things that are different from the original it's shorter for once but all are for the worse the actors playing the parts here just don't fit the bill you just don't believe them and who could top edward g <UNK> performance from the original if you want only watch it after you've seen the original and even then you'll be very brave if you watch it through it's almost <UNK>
<START> an inventive suspenseful exercise in <UNK> a japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms not completely successful but taut surprising and well acted one might find the film somewhat reminiscent of saw  two men trapped in room and <UNK> against each other  but unlike that film it <UNK> to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film it's like watching a lab experiment some might find the contained suspense tedious but this reviewer found it enthralling the sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized this is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system just right for a late night movie fest when one is in the paranoid mood it certainly kept me awake that night
<START> i am glad other people enjoyed this movie cause i know it doesn't have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office i thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why bogdanovich directs with the <UNK> of touches the cast especially <UNK> camp is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film you've seen worse movies
<START> i first saw this movie on a local station on the sunday afternoon horror show back around 1969 or 1970 uncut i was just a little kid at the time but i loved it and wasn't really that scared by it i thought it had such a cool and highly original storyline thinking back i'm still surprised that it was shown during the day on t v uncut in those years i've sought out this film ever since seen it over and over again and always loved it one would think john waters would have <UNK> this film it's got to be not only a scary film but one of the <UNK> <UNK> films ever made at that time and surprisingly you don't hear about this one as having the cult following that a movie such as blood feast or the hills have eyes have acquired over the years it has a cult following but it should have really become a cult classic in my opinion as far as i know this came out a little before blood feast came out making this probably one of the first true gore films in fact this movie has elements of <UNK> gordon lewis and a little russ meyer thrown in for good measure br br anyway i recommend this for anyone who likes trashy sleazy black and white horror films from the early <UNK> i think the date at the end of it read 1960
<START> i've been watching this every night on <UNK> this past week this is a terrific revealing portrait about the drugs <UNK> and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's <UNK> easy rider the beatles the death of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are all here <UNK> has fashioned a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during the drug years from the <UNK> bay area to studio <UNK> this documentary shows the evolution and <UNK> of the drug business and the death and new life it <UNK> into the american culture from marijuana to <UNK> to cocaine this documentary shows the ways drugs were getting into the country the hippie movement the conservative resistance and how drugs <UNK> the arts music movies etc featuring tons of fascinating interviews and news reel footage br br drug films the trip easy rider up in smoke <UNK> madness blow boogie nights
<START> i guess i'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film is it one of the best of the nightmare series maybe not but i had lots of fun with it freddy krueger reaches his evil <UNK> potential since parts 4 and 5 kind of <UNK> the series down i felt this so called final installment new nightmare is the real finale brought the series out of its <UNK> there are some great nightmare sequences including one where <UNK> meyer plays a <UNK> who gets <UNK> falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which freddy controls this is both a highly original and hilarious sequence especially when we see him out of the <UNK> <UNK> around like super mario and freddy <UNK> out the funny one liner great graphics and since the movie was made about 10 years ago it brought back memories when freddy started controlling the game with the <UNK> anyone who remembers the first 8 bit <UNK> remembers the <UNK> br br the cast is superb lisa zane is perfectly cast in the lead i haven't seen <UNK> <UNK> since the running man and i think the last time i saw that film was about 5 years ago he's another great <UNK> actor who possesses a powerful screen presence and who can forget the cameos the best one is by johnny <UNK> from the first nightmare playing a <UNK> for an anti drug commercial br br the 3d sequence at the end is really awesome so for those who are looking to check this film out please rent or buy it on dvd hopefully all the <UNK> come with the 3d glasses but i'm sure the video edition has the 3d element removed br br i personally didn't see many things wrong with the film it even <UNK> on freddy's <UNK> the film is a great mix of humor and scares and the gross out effects are terrific could this have given better justice to the franchise of course it could have but rachel <UNK> did a fine job and finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done br br and in closing i loved the montage over the opening credits fans of the series will be delighted and will look at it as a tribute to beloved freddy br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are <UNK> and <UNK> the dvds themselves we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from broken in disc form and yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation br br with regards to the latter the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non <UNK> transfer otherwise we get the film in its original 1 85 1 ratio <UNK> no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected indeed given <UNK> hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact br br the same is also true of the soundtrack here we are offered both <UNK> 0 and <UNK> 1 mixes and whilst i'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the original the fact that <UNK> had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior indeed though the <UNK> 1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience <UNK> to the manner in which it <UNK> the score both are equally fine and free of technical flaws br br as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them take a look at the <UNK> on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous <UNK> loads of <UNK> and various <UNK> indeed given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute <UNK> rather than <UNK> into a lengthy documentary there really is little to discuss the <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> for example is exactly what it claims to be and the same goes for the rest of pieces as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of <UNK> pre production production and post production and whilst it may have been <UNK> to find them in a more easily <UNK> overall <UNK> <UNK> in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view br br of the various pieces then it is perhaps only the <UNK> which need any kind of discussion then again there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks the one involving the actors is overly <UNK> and doesn't take the film too seriously <UNK> pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing and the technical ones are well extremely technical of course we also get some <UNK> with what's been covered elsewhere on the <UNK> but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces <UNK> their welcome indeed all in all a fine extras package
<START> i can see why laurel and hardy <UNK> might be offended by this rather gentle <UNK> <UNK> but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic l h bronson <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and there's a reasonably good supporting cast i enjoyed it
<START> man i really love the new dvd that universal put out i've never seen the sentinel look this good since i had to put up with crappy grainy vhs tapes for years unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear and avoid the <UNK> dvd at all costs it sucks br br anyway troubled fashion model alison parker <UNK> raines moves into haunted nyc <UNK> only it's more than just haunted it's also a <UNK> to hell and the <UNK> keeps an old blind priest john carradine to keep watch over it and make sure the <UNK> and arch angels don't escape br br this has an all star cast full of old <UNK> actors like <UNK> <UNK> arthur kennedy jose <UNK> etc as well as cameos of upcoming 80s stars including christopher walken jeff goldblum who's voice was mysteriously <UNK> and tom berenger and you won't even recognize jerry <UNK> from law order i had to do a double take when i didn't quite place where i'd seen him before br br nice gore scenes of alison <UNK> the eye and nose off her dead father's rotting corpse that's been possessed by the devil and there's a neat ending where <UNK> <UNK> people try to haunt alison into committing suicide so she won't be the next one to guard the <UNK> it seems <UNK> troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the <UNK> to become the next sentinel br br an excellent creepy 70s classic from director michael winner that shouldn't be missed i also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy br br 7 out of 10 br br
<START> edward <UNK> and christina <UNK> are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this movie br br this is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important br br pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main <UNK> is to take photographs of the exotic <UNK> of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and more br br but pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to <UNK> the town's people who are <UNK> main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to her br br well this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it <UNK> a watch only because it offers something different than hollywood's typical standards br br to describe in a few words this is the typical christina <UNK> and john waters movie that's it br br oh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying <UNK>
<START> i liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem i quickly found is that one pretty much knows what's going to happen within the first 20 30 minutes the <UNK> will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody br br there is no real twist which is fine but the final reveal doesn't make a great deal of sense either how can she be <UNK> with <UNK> and fear for the whole film if she's an evil id from beyond the mirror br br admittedly the scenes <UNK> the <UNK> were chilling when they first appeared and the <UNK> murder is also effectively creepy but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script <UNK> atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80 90 minutes does not really cut it in fact it gets quite dull
<START> when i rented this movie to watch it i knew that it was not going to be a <UNK> movie instead i thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating and you know what it worked kurt <UNK> did what i though was a remarkable role in showing the <UNK> soldier that he was i recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time the story was boring the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy i'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school <UNK> project but it certainly played like one it is not even particularly successful in its central <UNK> of trying to appear as a single continuous take the <UNK> <UNK> camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts
<START> this movie was advertised on radio television magazines etc almost every hour or every issue so when we went to the <UNK> <UNK> our expectations were very high but oh boy how sad this movie is it is a movie in hollywood style about a movie in a movie shades shows so clear we aren't ready to produce <UNK> hollywood <UNK> i am not a movie critic but i think a good movie starts with a good script and the script is a nightmare like my subject line says it is nothing and then <UNK> you could just stare to the television as well without really seeing anything that was the feeling we've got when we saw shades shades is a bad production
<START> i have to admit that holly was not on my watch list for the <UNK> film festival however after the artistic director of the festival specifically recommended this film to an audience of over 200 people prior to the screening of another film i decided to go to see it wow br br this film is dealing with the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does so without any compromise i have found myself crying a number of times during the movie and laughing at others speaking about an emotional roller coaster br br the lead actor <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> newcomer who was only 14 at the time of filming and had to tackle this incredibly complex and difficult role she reminded me of <UNK> castle hughes from whale rider but the role here is much more demanding as she has to play a child prostitute chances are that she will win numerous awards br br the main story is about a girl who was sold to prostitution by her family and held as a sex slave in a <UNK> in cambodia she meets an american played by ron <UNK> in a strong dramatic role that we are not used to see from him who after spending some time with her decides to help her by that time however she is sold again and he is going on a search for her around cambodia the story turns and twists and the audience can never predict what will happen next br br the acting was strong across the board with a very interesting international cast <UNK> <UNK> very convincing as a sex tourist <UNK> <UNK> touching as a social worker and chris penn one of his last movies the asian cast was also superb br br although the film deals with this difficult subject matter it focuses successfully on telling a compelling powerful story it was shot in cambodia some scenes in real operating <UNK> which adds to the feeling that you are almost watching a documentary it seems that the <UNK> used a lot of hand held camera and close ups and overall it made you feel like you are right there as part of the story br br after the screening i was listening to other members of the audience as they left and it seemed that they were all stunned this is not an easy film to watch and i <UNK> the filmmakers for not making a hollywood film br br it is by far the best film i have seen in the <UNK> film festival opinion shared by my husband and a couple of other friends
<START> you'd think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it however this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light it talks about the risks associated with the <UNK> <UNK> and mentions <UNK> nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle as if the <UNK> and the <UNK> had anything to do with each other it makes the computer <UNK> problem the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all and it takes the thirty seconds call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out when it's actually thirty seconds before an <UNK> is mandatory br br if you want to see a documentary or <UNK> of apollo 11 go for from the earth to the moon or one of the <UNK> documentaries but skip this one
<START> this is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting mr torn and ms <UNK> do an outstanding job i think they should have it on tv again so a new audience can enjoy it wonderful performances br br it gives you a real feel of what the <UNK> had to go through both physically and emotionally great <UNK> of movie br br it was done when ms <UNK> was very young i had always thought of her as a comedian but this certainly is not a comedy and she is just wonderful there is very little dialogs but that just make it seem more real mr torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling i must see movie
<START> do not waste your time or your money on this movie my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent the flick about some <UNK> who get trapped in a cave so we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad it was i can't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can't make yourself i honestly feel emotionally <UNK> it went from being a semi low budget movie in which a college girl gets <UNK> by a boy she's dating to an all out porno flick and really not a good one i went from hating the woman's rapist to almost feeling bad for him almost all in all an awful movie that was definitely rated <UNK> 17 for a reason don't waste your money and don't let your kids watch it
<START> othello the classic <UNK> story of love betrayal lies and tragedy i remember studying this story in high school actually i found othello to be probably my favorite shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was the fact that shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship love and racism perfectly i mean when you really do study this story you could go into so many <UNK> on why othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye but later on for my report i also watched this version of othello and i have to say that it was absolutely brilliant <UNK> and kenneth just capture the story so well and understood it's darkness br br othello is the big time soldier in his city he is loved by everyone including the king but when the king finds out that othello <UNK> off with his daughter <UNK> the king is <UNK> but <UNK> it othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend <UNK> his side man instead of <UNK> who has stood by othello due to his insane jealousy he's out for revenge still pretending to be <UNK> best friend he just <UNK> hints at othello that <UNK> is cheating on him with <UNK> never says that they are just makes othello think that it's happening othello is driven insane and doesn't have pleasant plans for <UNK> or <UNK> and <UNK> is more than happy to help him out br br othello is an incredible story i highly recommend that you read it it's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it othello the movie is also great and once again i recommend it it captured the story perfectly and has a big <UNK> type of feel or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between othello and <UNK> how quickly he believes that his true love would <UNK> him this is a terrific movie great acting good sets and good direction this is what shakespeare meant when he wrote the story br br 10 10
<START> what can you say about this movie it was not terrible but it was not good two days earlier i had watched <UNK> and that was one of the best gay films i have ever seen so this was not the best time to watch a mediocre gay flick br br the story was silly and the acting was ok it was not bad enough to turn off but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotyping it was not very well cast either br br would i recommend this movie no you would be wasting your time and money i don't understand why movies like these are made and who is funding them spend your time watching <UNK> arc on <UNK> instead i think this is where this movie was trying to go but never got there
<START> this movie was featured on a very early episode of mystery science theater 3000 but when i see this film i don't think about that wonderful tv series i believe this was a surprisingly good early 40's horror flick with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a <UNK> year old public <UNK> horror movie i actually enjoyed watching bela lugosi and his bizarre staff including his wife who requires fluid from the <UNK> of young would be brides an old <UNK> and her two bizarre sons one a giant idiot the other a comical dwarf <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> freaks i also enjoyed the <UNK> young female reporter who is kind of a stereotype but still fun to watch my only problem with this otherwise decent film is it's plot even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie i don't want to spoil any of this film so go out and rent it or better yet buy it for a couple of bucks
<START> <UNK> is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made but not the bad kind of bad movies this one is so awful it's fun to watch and laugh kurt thomas clearly does not have a <UNK> career in acting he should go back to <UNK> but who can forget such memorable scenes as the high bar with <UNK> the stone <UNK> horse or the five minute chase scene through the village of the <UNK> in slow motion i don't think it was meant to be this bad but who can tell it's not art but if you want something <UNK> and <UNK> that will make a good conversation rent <UNK> makes for an evening of fun
<START> watching this movie made me think constantly why are they making such a problem out of some broken <UNK> there are a million <UNK> to slow down the car in the movie speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop br br there aren't many good things to say about this film all the usual narrative <UNK> make their appearance the actors are very bad the story is as <UNK> as a <UNK> etc that makes this movie a waste of time and money br br
<START> i watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago i still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity the first few scenes alone were hilarious i won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it i wouldn't want to ruin the laughs needless to say the entire time i watched this movie i was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing towards the end we all got bored however as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off there is no plot and not a trace of decent acting the characters are about as well developed as those in a <UNK> learn to read book they even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting
<START> two thirds of nearly 2 000 imdb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six <UNK> was this a record or merely a <UNK> vcr although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination but for some reason i imagined it as largely <UNK> and until recently never felt the urge to watch it my mind was changed by <UNK> von <UNK> original book my wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things but i gradually came to appreciate that this one was <UNK> <UNK> although in no way <UNK> and was also very well written i realised my wife would enjoy watching the film and so decided to buy her the <UNK> i am now very glad that i did and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who <UNK> a quiet <UNK> work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre <UNK> italian atmosphere the story is set in the immediate post <UNK> period and starts with two married london ladies who decide to pool their <UNK> and enjoy a holiday together away from their families in a rented villa in italy force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses not only between these four very <UNK> mature ladies but also with the occasional male visitor if you want action thrills dramatic sex scenes natural or man made disasters or <UNK> style romances this would not be the film for you but imdb users have <UNK> and very <UNK> demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch and if you care to give it a try you may as i did come to rank it among your much loved films br br it is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which i am already familiar in many cases i find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that i actually found my pleasure <UNK> by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book effectively <UNK> before my eyes perhaps italy itself has some part in this the last time i had this experience was when i was watching tales from <UNK> <UNK> on tv generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the <UNK> character development rather than on any background events this works very well although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story great credit is due to the director mike <UNK> and all members of the cast particularly those well known british actresses who play the four principal ladies
<START> james stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge which ties in with the fate of the films other star the winchester rifle stewart is it goes without saying excellent adding some cold hard obsession to his usual laid back cowboy the story follows the fate of a winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he is hunting br br we meet a selection of <UNK> gun fighters indian <UNK> and bank <UNK> as we follow the <UNK> path through indian battles bank <UNK> etc the supporting cast are all solid with dan <UNK> standing out as <UNK> johnny dean the live wire <UNK> with an itchy trigger finger also as a trivia note a very early appearance from rock hudson as an indian chief br br the end showdown is a classic a tense rifle battle fought at long range in and around a rocky <UNK> throw in some good old western action fist fights <UNK> and <UNK> chases it makes for a <UNK> western adventure 8 10
<START> los <UNK> is the story of two <UNK> brothers who have moved to <UNK> from the south after their mother dies the confident and <UNK> <UNK> the elder brother gets a job working for a sleazy strip <UNK> owner after taking the naive victor there for his <UNK> birthday br br as <UNK> <UNK> under his <UNK> <UNK> both brothers get involved with the <UNK> sexy and manipulative mistress <UNK> as the film unfolds characters are <UNK> as we begin to see the subtle and overt ways that each one <UNK> the next br br the film is well made with good cinematography and fast pacing it's also pretty sexy with a lot of nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes it uses the now popular technique of <UNK> different scenes from different points of view out of <UNK> sequence many people hate movies like this because they don't understand what's going on <UNK> pulp fiction <UNK> dogs and many other good films use this device the plot itself is really nothing new there are elements of body heat pulp fiction and many other good film noir br br as the different layers are revealed our <UNK> of the characters and their motivations <UNK> while the plot may be somewhat cliché it is also clever and entertaining br br i would call it an enjoyable movie worth watching but nothing memorable i haven't seen many films from <UNK> and it's always interesting to see film noir from other countries other than that rent it if it's available but don't lose any sleep if it isn't
<START> i won't argue with anyone who <UNK> this film <UNK> as is january <UNK> performance but please check her out if you haven't already in the <UNK> tv series <UNK> men starting later this month she's excellent as is the entire cast i'll <UNK> assume she took on the taboo role strictly for the money and realizing what a <UNK> mess it was going to be turned in a minimal acting job to avoid <UNK> don't know if that's the case but i now know for sure that she can act br br at first watching taboo i was convinced her flat delivery was a <UNK> choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or the plot no such luck hard to believe the director didn't suggest to her at least once that not changing expression for 17 <UNK> scenes could cause <UNK> br br ironically her winning performance in mad men comes as a character who at least in her early appearances is very repressed reserved unsure of herself and rather <UNK> not unlike her taboo role but as the tv series progressed she began to <UNK> into someone who questions her traditional early 60's <UNK> mom role can't wait to see where they take her character in the 2nd season br br to sum up avoid taboo like <UNK> but definitely check out mad men
<START> i was greatly moved when i watched the movie how <UNK> could keep such hope and faith was amazing so many people only care about what they want and fuss about all the things they don't have and they are such small things like <UNK> money a new car i've seen people in tears because of a <UNK> this movie brings everything back to the <UNK> love hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really <UNK> you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food a roof over your head and your loved ones around you you are truly blessed and the saying stop and smell the <UNK> truly has a new meaning and i know <UNK> will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith <UNK> and humor with me thank you <UNK> i know you <UNK> the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above
<START> this film was absolutely awful i even feel uncomfortable calling it a film its the typical <UNK> movie with zero plot and a bunch of <UNK> whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to figure stuff out i have tried to give <UNK> a chance but lets be honest its just horrible br br i am not out of sync with cinema i appreciate <UNK> films <UNK> is one of my all time favorite films so i do not mind if a film is cheaply made so long as there is some any substance br br everything in this film is horrid the acting the writing or was it all improvised the direction but most of all above everything else the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense the camera was never anywhere logical there was no <UNK> i got to admit being a guy i had heard there was nudity in this film so i thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there's nudity <UNK> i know i'm a jerk well thanks to the uber crappy camera work you never really get to see anything and the things you do see trust me you do not want to see this film made me want to vomit on numerous levels br br the dialogue made me want to vomit the camera work made me want to vomit but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some <UNK> critics well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit
<START> zane and <UNK> will keep you on the edge of your seats i don't typically go for military war movies but this was worth my time br br it was serious but it was also humorous <UNK> character proved to be heroic and honest no matter what you know that he's got your back br br <UNK> character developed throughout the film he wasn't just a suit he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun br br the ending through me a little though it didn't really go with the action throughout the film but i'm glad that i saw it nonetheless br br it's worth checking out
<START> lily powers works at a <UNK> until her father dies she then goes to new york to work at an office building there she notices that if she wants to get any higher she has to give the men what they want and what men want is her well you know alfred e <UNK> baby face 1933 is a movie of high sexual content for a movie of that era anyway this was one of the last pre code films that were made barbara stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as lily other actors of this film include george brent <UNK> <UNK> donald cook ned stevens <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> henry <UNK> j p carter margaret lindsay ann carter and <UNK> harris <UNK> the young john wayne is seen as jimmy mccoy jr this movie deals with a brave topic and it does it good baby face is historically significant movie and therefore good to watch
<START> although i really enjoyed jim <UNK> latest serious performances the truman show man on the moon i've always thought his real <UNK> lies in physical comedy this is not to say he is a fantastic talented actor those <UNK> at the academy awards seem to dislike him so much he has never had a truly deserved nomination or award well any institution that <UNK> for 11 oscars a bore such as titanic shouldn't be taken seriously br br on with the review the grinch is the <UNK> best looking best acted more enjoyable seasons film since the nightmare before christmas both movies seem very similar too with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing christmas both make their principal actors seem like the villains one in a higher degree than the other both pack a strong moral lesson and both are truly enjoyable br br that is until you realize that jack <UNK> is a doll and the grinch is a human being but a human being that is so incredibly <UNK> so fluid in his movements so cartoon like so unreal that never gets in the way of the movie he can be hilarious he can be a sad soul he can be angry he lives in a 3 dimensional world where 3 dimensional people live he jokes he laughs he cries and ultimately he saves the christmas i loved this film to bits and cannot wait for it to come out on dvd this is one of those films you will really enjoy 10 20 years from now as timeless as they come
<START> <UNK> as it may be this movie actually made it to the <UNK> bringing shame on my proud country any attempt to watch this movie without stopping or <UNK> will be a <UNK> attempt one cannot bear to see more than one hour of this then having either fallen asleep or visited the bathroom for <UNK> br br note if you haven't seen anything else from <UNK> please remember this br br some things were never meant to be but still some idiot goes ahead and makes it anyway
<START> the team of <UNK> cooper and ernest <UNK> produced a documentary of 50 000 <UNK> people and their animals on the summer <UNK> to winter <UNK> the basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a forgotten people and how they lived during what we in the west knew as the roaring <UNK> a more <UNK> contrast could not be imagined raging river and <UNK> mountain <UNK> are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die to make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place a signed <UNK> of authenticity is offered up at the end the version that i saw had fascinating iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film having said all this the film is probably of more value to the <UNK> than the casual viewer in search of a good <UNK> entertainment the crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple re takes the western inter titles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an <UNK> peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day off duty entertainment by desert police becomes a <UNK> ball the producers went on to make the <UNK> drama chang <UNK> and the totally commercial king kong 1933 the <UNK> theme is used again in people of the wind 1976 and in <UNK> 1999 recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into and then highly recommended for them
<START> yeah right br br i spent the first hour waiting <UNK> for the movie to take off it was horribly boring and consisted mostly of people riding randomly around the hills with no apparent direction then the hero comes into the picture born as an asian but when he grew up he became white obviously white he wasn't even close to passing for asian he looked like justin timberlake it was extremely distracting and the story did nothing to help the cause pointless battle sequences and lame dialogue it's an hour and forty five minutes long and by the end i was trying to eat my own face i watched this because people at the video store where i work are always asking me if this movie is any good now i have an answer it goes something like this <UNK> no good god no it's horrible don't do this to yourself i would recommend another movie perhaps one that's entertaining
<START> sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to <UNK> the war painted natives this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured later comes a <UNK> battle with the <UNK> the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here
<START> mary tyler moore and valerie <UNK> still can turn the world on with their smiles the combined talent of these two wonderful stars make this combination reunion <UNK> movie work watch it and look forward to hitting sixty mary defies the youth oriented society with wit and charm a touch of drama adds 2000 realism a tv series follow up would <UNK> the new characters and give us a chance to <UNK> see lou grant <UNK> sue ann murray and <UNK>
<START> there are some extremely talented black directors spike lee carl franklin billy dukes denzel and a host of others who bring well deserved credit to the film industry then there are the wayans brothers who at one time 15 years ago had an extremely funny television <UNK> living <UNK> that launched the career of jim carrey amongst others now we have stupidity <UNK> for humour and gross out gags toilet humour as the standard operating <UNK> people are not as stupid as those portrayed in <UNK> man' they couldn't possibly be a baby with a full set of teeth and a <UNK> is accepted as being only months old baby comes with a five <UNK> shadow that he <UNK> off it is <UNK> that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her husbands <UNK> back oh <UNK> that is just hilarious as a master criminal <UNK> man' is the stupidest on planet earth he <UNK> a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman's purse and then has to pursue her co star <UNK> <UNK> why <UNK> offers the best line i'm surrounded by morons based without credit on a chuck jones cartoon baby <UNK> bunny this is far too stupid to be even remotely funny a clue as to how bad this film is damon wayans appeared on jay leno the other night prior to the bat awards and he did not even mention this dreadful movie when will hollywood stop green lighting trash from the wayans brothers when they get over their white mans guilt in all <UNK>
<START> after seeing this film at the sf independent film festival i couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy jim <UNK> gave a talk q a about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation how to get distribution for a film which portrays <UNK> women non whites working on <UNK> controversial issues teen <UNK> teen <UNK> racial identity single mother <UNK> and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid thirties white male the multi racial multi <UNK> audience of mostly adults <UNK> about the film's fantastic storyline detailed characters and fantastic portrayal of real teen life most of the teens however had left the building leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids as a starting point for discussion rather than as many adults there felt a film teens should see because it's about them hence distribution questions how do we get our hands on it the internet <UNK> would be a great path this is a film that will be buried like <UNK> or other radical modern teen films and <UNK> seemed <UNK> as for his credits as a writer director <UNK> was <UNK> sensitive and detailed in his work <UNK> himself to the crown heights neighborhood in which the film is set working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be with the results being <UNK> realistic
<START> a guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus she refuses him but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway and there it starts a relation that is slightly <UNK> by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero it can't be a secret that things between them are going to be <UNK> br br in short a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film and imo it succeeds at being a nice film it's no masterpiece but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion the two lead characters <UNK> around each other in a crazy love fest that is even with the superhero thing going believable br br so thin story but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time br br 7 out of 10 broken hearts
<START> this movie should have been named need for speed the movie for those who have not played the games need for speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot this applies perfectly to <UNK> the only thing about this movie that was a level were the cars the acting seemed forced and scripted the premise was flimsy at best and the plot was almost nonexistent i only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and while it was pretty bad it could have been worse and at least it was entertaining i just wish they had showed eddie <UNK> crashing the <UNK> somewhere in the movie all in all don't pay for it don't go out of your way to see it but if it's on showtime or hbo and there isn't anything else on it's a decent distraction
<START> let's bowl started out on local television in the twin cities it came on late at night something you'd stumble across while channel surfing after your <UNK> bottle of <UNK> br br even the ads were <UNK> produced featuring <UNK> outside <UNK> bar holding a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over to you steve <UNK> not sure why but that one always made me laugh br br there was a <UNK> contest featured under the <UNK> of <UNK> a <UNK> between two <UNK> but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips <UNK> played it straight counter balanced by rich <UNK> bizarre and hilarious <UNK> <UNK> highlights included segments like how to properly <UNK> of an old <UNK> ball chuck them into a lake and <UNK> on dating where the duo date a couple of <UNK> and <UNK> ends with the bitter complaint i could have done that myself br br another segment what the duo did on their days off featured steve in beer can <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out from the <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> to climb the <UNK> at <UNK> falls dressed in his tight pale blue <UNK> and over sized <UNK> hilarious br br <UNK> <UNK> comments about league <UNK> and his struggle to apply the correct <UNK> to various <UNK> were also highlights br br let's bowl was picked up by comedy central and had some good moments but the network never really knew what to do with it running it during prime time and <UNK> the <UNK> competition which was never the point of the show the constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters ernie the pig butch etc were more <UNK> than anything else the whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced even jon stewart <UNK> let's bowl on the daily show not enough lame <UNK> jokes an <UNK> treatment for a show that deserved far better br br how often does a let's bowl come along in the world of modern television a <UNK> <UNK> mix of comedic genius and total crap the networks have the total crap part down cold but it's a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark strange funny little gem like let's bowl br br here's hoping they'll put it out on dvd
<START> i'll come clean the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic <UNK> is a favorite actor of mine when i heard the title of the film i thought it was going to be different perhaps in not such a good way br br but i was wrong after reading what few reviews were out there about this short i was actually excited about seeing it i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later needless to say i was not disappointed br br the film follows jack a <UNK> who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality and what is all in his head i won't give away what happens but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it's realism br br the directing is fantastic focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought provoking moments br br all in all i give this great film 9 out of 10 for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve
<START> this romantic comedy isn't too bad there are some funny things happening here and there and there are some rather memorable characters in it br br the acting however is amateurish with the exception of the <UNK> while some scenes are great fun others are simply embarrassing in particular i found the romantic part of the story poor br br all in all i guess it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies it's not really a bad movie and the ending did feel quite good just don't expect anything out of the ordinary fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill
<START> during the whole pirates of the <UNK> trilogy <UNK> paramount pictures really dropped the ball in <UNK> this anthony quinn directed cecil b demille <UNK> movie and getting it on dvd and <UNK> ray with all the extras included it is obvious to me that paramount pictures <UNK> are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in new orleans <UNK> which would have helped make the <UNK> city once again famous for it's pirate connections when the <UNK> at paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then i will be a happy <UNK> paramount pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now
<START> i love the series many of the stereotypes portraying <UNK> as <UNK> are very apparent but such people do exist all too frequently the portrayal of southern government rings all too true as well but the sympathetic characters reminds one of the many good things about the south as well some things never change and we see the good old boys every day there is a lucas buck in every southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen and the <UNK> <UNK> white trash are all too familiar aside from the supernatural elements everything else could very well happen in the modern south i somehow think <UNK> <UNK> must have been in <UNK> county
<START> i found this movie to be very funny i loved how it made of the politics of modern day sports this movie is not as funny as south park but it is pretty funny and since i am a sports fan i loved how they made fun some of the more ridiculous things in sports this movie is great for non sports lovers too probably better for them actually since they have to go through life wondering why people follow sports so closing when there are so many insane rules and <UNK> to sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing i also found the actual game they came up with to be interesting it is sort of like horse with <UNK> and psyche outs for the person shooting overall i highly recommend you see this movie and believe that you will end up loving this movie however if this style of comedy is not your favorite you probably won't like it but that is with any comedy movie
<START> the rating is only a 5 because it's a movie that could have used better acting and direction or at least music however for the achievements of walt <UNK> it deserves a 10 a previous poster calls the movie cheesy however i think it's a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees the film makers were apparently more interested in getting the story out there than to have a hollywood shiny feature film and for this i applaud them the fact it is non mainstream reflects the life of <UNK> as well this film is more documentary than for the sake of acting to be fascinated with a story such as this when you rarely hear of these types of stories that shape current day mental health is the most important thing i found it a highly enjoyable look at history
<START> whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never <UNK> any books about lucille ball especially her autobiography i've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in <UNK> and <UNK> to her later years with <UNK> i could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages in all i believe that lucille ball is one of those <UNK> people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves if i were <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> jr i would be <UNK> at how many mistakes were made in this film the filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me
<START> one of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and stunning quote do you believe in love at first site br br a trace of <UNK> was evident in this picture further <UNK> the films flawless integrity <UNK> aka joey played by eva longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn't even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography lol br br the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt the heroic rescue by <UNK> <UNK> as he saved the young <UNK> kid with the speech <UNK> which i may add was acted to perfection james <UNK> use of sound effects is <UNK> even to this day the drug bust he performs early in the film is pain <UNK> realistic when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang <UNK> brothers from the <UNK> gang and the <UNK> cut throat mafia this was by far one of the most <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has committed to filming br br personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be <UNK> it in the near future thats if i can find it anywhere lol
<START> i <UNK> with myself whether to rent this or not i'm always afraid of renting something i've never heard of don't remember this being in theaters great cast that's what <UNK> the <UNK> 30 minutes in i almost stopped watching it the first few minutes are fun to watch but unbelievable it only gets worse after that the writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable i give it a 3 a 1 for the writing only because there are words and a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script oh my god this movie sucks
<START> if you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non communication and false ideals then this is the film for you if you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest then you should probably look elsewhere there are many films that do this far better for example try some of the darker films by bergman the filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one <UNK> dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its <UNK> and pathetic end if you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours like cleaning your house for example
<START> this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching <UNK> in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was <UNK> give it a 3
<START> went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon 4 unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldn't see the <UNK> holding him up as he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks br br too cartoonish and very disappointing
<START> if i accidentally stumbled across this script in <UNK> form i would read it and maybe laugh i would not however laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to laugh although i am still not altogether sure where these are i don't care if this is woody allen this writer cannot write dialogue or at least he cannot <UNK> write dialogue then draw performances from actors capable of drawing laughter from even the most <UNK> of <UNK> for example br br <UNK> i'm an art <UNK> i'm looking to get a job in an art gallery br br ok so it states the fact but honestly do you know of any art historians who would say that how would you answer br br really an art gallery who would've thought it br br the entire script is <UNK> with the kind of <UNK> quasi <UNK> that i would not have expected from such a respected character writer i admit that i have no knowledge of allen's other work and judging by this one i don't want to start learning the characters are <UNK> without exception an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition or really really poor character writing you be the judge
<START> the back of the dvd box says ellen page co stars in this movie she does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role i don't consider it a supporting role either but rather a bit part also the plot has many unexplained elements some examples are why does the main character reject her oldest son why does her youngest son drive head on into the train he says its for a sucker bet which doesn't explain anything obviously the screenwriter doesn't know the definition of a sucker bet this film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion save your money and view it for free on tv if you think it needs to be seen
<START> usually i'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has <UNK> but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real <UNK> test to sit through guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so <UNK> corey <UNK> performance was abysmal as usual nicole <UNK> was not much better this has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number 1 fan of an actor actress in this piece of trash stay away
<START> no matter how you look at this movie it is just awful br br if you view it as a horror then it is an <UNK> movie with the monsters being hand puppets br br if you look at it as a comedy then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame br br if it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a b <UNK> br br if you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero br br as you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining as mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a <UNK> type movie this however has the worst looking monsters of that genre <UNK> looked pretty good so did the <UNK> heck even the puppets from the <UNK> looked better than these the characters in this film are <UNK> unlikable the hero is a <UNK> security guard his girlfriend is always complaining they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend and another friend who is a <UNK> at one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with <UNK> this movie is just utterly stupid i like the scene when they are in the <UNK> club <UNK> which is obviously not a club but more likely a diner and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21 give me a break i am 25 and i look younger than any of them
<START> the title of this obscure and almost <UNK> forgotten 80's slasher inevitably reminds me of the <UNK> mega smash monster hit song with the same title hence a piece of the lyrics in the title section of this user comment also i didn't have anything else to say that was useful anyway but hey the forest isn't totally hopeless and not even that bad actually if nothing else at least it <UNK> the admittedly <UNK> first rule of 80's slasher kill someone within the first 10 minutes of <UNK> sure you've heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before but don't let that <UNK> you from watching it as the forest has a couple of things more to offer than just an <UNK> sinister cover image it's actually a bit of an <UNK> 80's slasher the main characters aren't ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards <UNK> the concept isn't always successful let alone plausible but it's more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of california but due to a stupid bet the wives travel <UNK> from their husbands barely set up for the night they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children the children themselves and finally the father who's out hunting for human flesh the demented family may be real or imaginary but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive they have already <UNK> the men too encounter the family and they find out more about the slightly <UNK> background the forest is a weird and unusual film to say the least it's not exactly a masterpiece of plotting but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to open minded fans of 80's horror the murders are fairly gruesome and will filmed including a <UNK> throat and a painful saw massacre and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful the more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists the less it makes any sense so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer the acting performances are just above average the music is okay and at least director donald jones also responsible for the 70's exploitation <UNK> <UNK> in chains tried to be a little more creative that the majority of 80's horror films too bad it ultimately fails
<START> as with most of ben <UNK> movies the comedy is dry and story is predictable that is if you want to call this a story many points were left connected with no thought at all i want to thank the director for not explaining the points better i say that because that would mean the torture would have lasted longer as for any of ben <UNK> failures this one is no exception and is <UNK> only by the other actors even then the acting for the most part was contrived and was not believable the trip down memory lane with actors i have not seen in years was not worth the price of admission all thought it should be told they too are quickly joining the ranks of the has been my choice was to wait for my car to be fixed or watch this movie i made the wrong decision all in all i would give it a one laugh mainly because that is all i got out of it
<START> this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description but to me it was a bit of a let down very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together <UNK> way they landed definitely not in <UNK> order also nothing of any consequence was being filmed i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer's part which is different from the typical hollywood film but this one <UNK> me to no end i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn't do anything for me i still don't really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person's life i guess he succeeded but i was looking for more needless to say i can't recommend this movie to anyone
<START> antwone <UNK> story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children abandoned by a troubled mother antwone has never met his father growing up with church going <UNK> who use the n word not only to <UNK> and hurt but also as a term of <UNK> as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold up enduring racial <UNK> and being <UNK> while serving in the navy <UNK> anger is slowly turned into positive power when <UNK> by a navy psychiatrist and a love enters his life br br the scene where antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film stunned by the unexpected confrontation the woman <UNK> in silence to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life without crime <UNK> to drugs <UNK> children left and right all despite his utterly <UNK> circumstances br br if that scene wasn't powerful enough the very next one drives it home and opens the <UNK> gates a reception to welcome home antwone dozens of smiling faces and open arms <UNK> that he is part of this great family br br one of the messages delivered by this wonderful film is that there are many well meaning and sincere people working to help <UNK> and <UNK> children even if some of the homes and <UNK> don't seem to care and appear self serving many do give it their all the character who found <UNK> file once he <UNK> the circumstances of his birth is one of those bright lights in the darkness of the system br br the dvd includes a french language track various <UNK> choices as well as additional features and information about foster <UNK> br br as a <UNK> i appreciated the location footage no matter where you are from you will be deeply moved by this <UNK> gem
<START> i thought that this movie was pretty lame if you're looking for <UNK> you may like this i myself don't mind a fair amount of cheese but this was ridiculous the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak br br the only thing entertaining about this movie was the day <UNK> zombies but even that isn't reason enough to see this flick
<START> della myers kim basinger is an upper class housewife that lives in a private <UNK> in the <UNK> with her twin children and her abusive husband kenneth craig <UNK> della gives all the attention to the twins <UNK> their house and her appearance and <UNK> kenneth on the christmas eve she drives to the local mall in the night to buy <UNK> paper for the gifts and she does not find any parking space available when she sees an old car <UNK> on two spots she leaves a message to the owner calling him selfish jerk when the mall <UNK> <UNK> car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four <UNK>  <UNK> lukas <UNK> the <UNK> american <UNK> jamie <UNK> the chinese american <UNK> leonard wu and the latin <UNK> luis <UNK> when the security guard of the mall <UNK> her he is shot on the head by <UNK> della <UNK> up her car trying to escape from the criminals however she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang she takes the <UNK> and hides in the wood fighting against the gang to survive br br a couple of days ago i saw the trailer of while she was out and i was anxious to watch the dvd unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie and i am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clichés della myers is presented as an insecure and <UNK> housewife and <UNK> as wife the <UNK> is her only interest in her concept of family she is chased by four mean criminals but she <UNK> them with a <UNK> that seems to be the <UNK> <UNK> belt therefore the plot is so absurd that <UNK> the gang of criminals is formed by the favorite cliché of american movies with an <UNK> american a chinese american and a latin together with an american lord to be politically correct kim basinger has a decent acting but their children are too young for a fifty five year old woman my vote is four br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> while she was out
<START> here again is yet another diane lane movie where she <UNK> on her husband is this the only role she knows how to play this time it's set in 1969 and she <UNK> on her husband with the <UNK> man i am so not surprised because that is so very predictable then her husband gets mad and throws the milk i wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the <UNK> as well i wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie then after some milk throwing she says sorry and sees the <UNK> man again duh then while she is making it with him her son gets <UNK> by <UNK> my mom always told me not to throw rocks at a <UNK> nest this kids mom didn't have time to tell him that she was too busy with the <UNK> man
<START> <UNK> improbable and foolish <UNK> that at least has some redeeming crisp location photography but it's too unbelievable to generate much in the way of tension i was kinda hoping that stanwyck wouldn't make it back in time because really she was <UNK> with the wet in more ways than one husband and she had an idiot child as well why not run off with <UNK> but the <UNK> question remains what sort of wood was that <UNK> support made of if a rotten piece of it pulled off didn't <UNK> stanwyck always <UNK> professional does the best she could with the material but it's <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was the biggest hit movie of 1971 filmed almost entirely in <UNK> the capital of <UNK> the movie depicts not only with the theme of a broken family but also a relationship between a brother and a sister as well as drugs and the hippie movement which made many people think that it involved the <UNK> the movement for <UNK> consciousness br br the movie begins with scenes of drugs and being informed that the woman dancing in front is the <UNK> sister going back to the past the brother and sister are happily playing around the house only to hear their parents arguing this soon leads to a split in the family the brother goes with the mother and the sister with the father br br as years pass the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that she no longer lives with the father and that she has moved to <UNK> here <UNK> the brother not only finds love but he also finds his sister <UNK> but he finds out that she is not only in the wrong company of friends but is also on drugs as she wants to block all memory of her past with help of <UNK> his love the brother tries to get his sister away from all this but has to overcome many obstacles including people who <UNK> to all sorts of levels to stop him this is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself <UNK> <UNK> and also stars <UNK> <UNK> her first movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a k <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the music is superbly provided by the late r d <UNK> whose last score was 1942 a love story during the filming <UNK> <UNK> asked <UNK> r d <UNK> to <UNK> something special for this film days later <UNK> came back with the composition of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the song was an instant hit
<START> when i finally had the opportunity to watch zombie 3 zombie <UNK> 2 in europe on an <UNK> region 2 japanese dvd i was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is the transfer is just about <UNK> as good as it's ever going to look unless anchor bay gets a hold of it the gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx the sound is also terrific it's only 2 channel <UNK> but if you have a <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> 2 you can really appreciate the cheesy music actually a very good score and the effective although cheap sound effects it never sounded so good and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment br br i never realized just how much blood flows in this film it's extremely brutal with exploding head shots exploding <UNK> filled mega <UNK> a <UNK> to a zombies throat a woman's burned off <UNK> how come it <UNK> burn the guy also <UNK> <UNK> zombie babies and so much more i lost track br br this is no doubt for hardcore zombie action fans especially of the italian kind there is some excellent set pieces and cinematography to be found i think people don't give it enough credit if you see a clean print and not some horrendous pirate copy it's a whole other experience entirely br br this film never lets up for a second and i realize it's inconsistent <UNK> the dubbing is horrible the acting is stiff and it's sense of <UNK> is celebrated in grand fashion but that's part of it's charm br br to me this is one of the best horror films ever made you can't make a film this bad so good on purpose it's accidental genius of the highest order if they played it for laughs it would have been a disaster but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific cult classic that thumbs it's nose at any and all traditional <UNK> standards br br tons of action sequences exotic locales excellent set design good sometimes great cinematography wonderfully cheesy acting and inconsistent but still interesting plot great makeup effects beautiful women who can kick butt excellent music and sometimes hilarious sometimes creepy but always entertaining zombies how can you go wrong with this film it has it all a cult classic that stands the test of time
<START> this film is so bad dialogues story actors and actresses everything that it's hard to imagine that we'll see a worse movie this year or in the following years <UNK> brother set in australia among italian immigrants has nothing but shallow clichés about italian culture to offer and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the film the message of the film ugly people have to marry ugly people beautiful people have to marry beautiful people is truly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is quite good in films like <UNK> or <UNK> in <UNK> but here his pseudo italian accent is hard to bear see this film at your own risk trash as trash can
<START> absolute <UNK> was a film for the younger generation a multi time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in britain and how these troubled constantly hitting each note <UNK> problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow it could have been dubbed the <UNK> <UNK> of the 80s but it disappeared it made its very shallow mark on the world <UNK> under the radar and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section the comedy section or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn't need chain money to survive alas that wasn't where i found it  but i found it watched it tried my hardest to sing along with it <UNK> into <UNK> eyes but found myself faded by the end did it not survive the test of time is 1950s london too far removed from our current society is <UNK> too creepy i think absolute <UNK> falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang but <UNK> to a mere <UNK> by the end br br absolute <UNK> opens with a huge number that takes us through the non gritty streets of london which involve <UNK> <UNK> prostitutes on every corner dance throughout booze like rivers and the <UNK> ties on nearly every individual sounds like a place we would all hate to be  right director <UNK> temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a <UNK> of our main characters the one we follow most is colin played by eddie <UNK> who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> these two have chemistry and while <UNK> looks like a pre <UNK> <UNK> to me they worked there was a huge spark between them the chemistry was like <UNK> and i believed that these two could take me down a road i had never traveled i was ready  but then something happened temple takes us out of the <UNK> takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning and completely <UNK> the roles without any dedication to the first <UNK> runs away colin becomes a <UNK> and <UNK>  well  i am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain  i can tell you that much temple gives us this flashy city this opportunity to see those that inhabit it but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger we learn about colin mainly but nobody else i could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom and what importance fashion had to that era also were they teens really  they all seemed like they were pushing their late <UNK> but maybe it was my tv br br character development thrown right out the door temple tries to <UNK> by giving us bigger more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about one of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example temple uses a split house to show us the lives of <UNK> parents of which i didn't know it was them until after the film and a song which screams <UNK> great song too many characters not enough time suddenly dragged into another scene of missing <UNK> and it just falls apart in your hands then if that wasn't enough we are <UNK> our heads to the beat of some great songs <UNK> our <UNK> trying to understand where our characters are or are going and temple throws in hatred anger and politics into the final act while i was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme i didn't think racism would be on the top of the bill suddenly friends are missing people are angry and there is some random guy running around fighting colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race somebody help me out here it seemed completely rushed and overwhelming  nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off to me the ending of absolute <UNK> was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number that first part set the pace and temple could not keep up br br overall i must say that temple can direct a music video but i don't think he was quite prepared for the feature film i don't think this film will ever make it into full cult status and will probably remain <UNK> or in the dollar bin for years to come it is a fun film to watch initially but when we get to that final part it just explodes from the inside i wanted some cutting edge work but instead what i found was a freaky <UNK> coupled with characters i cared nothing for i could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s but by the end it just felt forced i think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to motivation by the ever freaky <UNK> in this film it may have helped <UNK> this feature into better cult status i am glad that i watched this film once but that is all that my small brain can take i loved the way that temple caught me from the beginning but he couldn't control his characters way too many and the songs didn't seem to match the final moments of the film it came out of nowhere and it was <UNK> if this was a film about racism it needed to be from the beginning absolute <UNK> was a welcomed adventure but i don't think i will be <UNK> this film off in the future br br grade out of
<START> this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous and i have never seen such bad acting in my life the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys especially drew fuller i don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie i didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted <UNK> porn i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch i was very disappointed the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion
<START> almost as tedious to watch as it was to read evening is a <UNK> produced failure until meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a <UNK> perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the <UNK> in the young ann that gave her <UNK> to the <UNK> world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying br br i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the <UNK> storytelling but alas it gave me a headache
<START> after a chance encounter on the train a young couple spends a single night <UNK> the streets of vienna discussing life and love the primary reason to see before sunrise is to watch a young julie <UNK> deliver her lines as celine this sexy <UNK> <UNK> brown eyed blond is sort of a cross between <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mitchell as they were in their mid <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> celine is practically the ideal woman unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> loving we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak for her sincere intelligent remarks are occasionally <UNK> further her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing br br if there is a fly in the <UNK> of this good movie it would have to be her <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ethan hawke as jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing <UNK> sort of a <UNK> g <UNK> of the nineties attempting to appear detached and <UNK> he sort of drags himself through certain shots his pants fit poorly his <UNK> shirt is coming <UNK> his <UNK> dark hair his most attractive feature needs a good <UNK> and someone really should have showed him how to properly <UNK> his youthful <UNK> nevertheless he is supposed to represent an <UNK> youth on a two week train ride around europe so the look he has <UNK> is probably pretty genuine his <UNK> cynical observations and <UNK> sense of humor seem to impress the <UNK> romantic celine although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence we know he is getting somewhere br br after blowing their collective <UNK> on a series of <UNK> bars and silly <UNK> they agree that because they may never see one another again they should make the most of it jesse <UNK> a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his <UNK> lady love may <UNK> to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up br br given his <UNK> luck in the romance department it is especially <UNK> when jessie as the very definition of a naive jerk <UNK> allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp he <UNK> himself with a half baked plan quickly <UNK> at the <UNK> station when he <UNK> her <UNK> to reunite at the same spot in half a year when the <UNK> time comes you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another perhaps even married and pregnant for whatever reason she probably won't show while jesse who ends up working at target or if he's lucky the local library will go back to vienna desperate to see her again only to wind up alone br br despite what for me was a very <UNK> conclusion before sunrise is a beautiful movie i highly recommend both it and the sequel before sunset
<START> i found this film by mistake many years ago wondered then still do why it didn't get the acclaim it should have well written beautiful acting one ironic twist after another and there is <UNK> in what the <UNK> characters are attempting i would not recommend this film for people with short attention <UNK> it requires sufficient intelligence to comprehend that there maybe a <UNK> of truth in this story
<START> well i come from <UNK> where it 's almost impossible to have a <UNK> but my imagination tells me to be very very afraid this guy <UNK> <UNK> has done a great job with this movie i don't know exactly how old he was but he didn't act like a child well done now about the <UNK> it wasn't very realistic but <UNK> you if you want to have a nice time in front of the telly this is the movie
<START> some news <UNK> and their military <UNK> try to tell the truth about a <UNK> of zombies despite the <UNK> controlling the <UNK> the <UNK> of the film don't understand that the george romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films land of the dead <UNK> this satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more <UNK> for this scenario what's <UNK> or subtle about seeing a military guy <UNK> to death and destruction anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter cut with the film nope furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible the characters thoroughly unlikable and the plot inane add this all up and you have the worst most incompetent zombie film since c h u d 2 <UNK> it's hideous head br br my grade d
<START> <UNK> and big foot <UNK> engine company getting <UNK> goat 1 2 br br i used to lap these up as a kid but catching an episode of the series <UNK> three cartoons back to back now i e several years later they <UNK> the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn <UNK> of the seven <UNK> 1953 i can see how they don't hold up all that well the character of <UNK> isn't exactly sympathetic to begin with <UNK> <UNK> distinctly overbearing and <UNK> antics failed to <UNK> much interest either  in short the scripts were <UNK> thin fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot they're strictly juvenile fare yet i doubt today's kids would even have the patience to stick with them furthermore the animation style is unattractive br br taking each short per se i guess they improved from one to the other after the initial shock one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot  <UNK> is <UNK> with a <UNK> army goat whose immense <UNK> causes him no end of <UNK> hardly original i know but always an amusing <UNK> one interesting element here was that the shorts were <UNK> with <UNK> delivering <UNK> bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience
<START> so <UNK> yep this steven <UNK> read steven king yarn about a man who gets his just <UNK> from a gypsy elder who he just killed the story itself is there no doubt about it but i don't know why i didn't enjoy it more than i could have i guess what really distracted me was the actors i mean who's the lead robert john burke who's he and <UNK> crying out loud can someone please stop hiring joseph <UNK> for every italian <UNK> role there ever is and while we're at it does every <UNK> have to have a <UNK> cooking italian mother the only good acting job done here is under 10 pounds of makeup michael <UNK> as the gypsy elder he's pretty good but the rest i make you all better actors
<START> watched this french horror film last night and pretty much liked it the whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written <UNK> in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier somehow without leaving his cell as they look through the diary they discover it <UNK> into the black arts and <UNK> that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom what they find out is something completely different and horrifying to say the least i like low budget horror films that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way and tell a good story this movie does just that despite taking a while to get going the result and the horror they <UNK> is very interesting to me and i enjoyed the ride not a lot of gore but that wouldn't fit the story although the gore it has is pretty good
<START> my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of <UNK> and very <UNK> <UNK> it from the idea of relationships as a lot has been written about the movie already it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved br br i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very <UNK> way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even <UNK> 24 <UNK> the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an <UNK> impact on the other has been very <UNK> dealt with br br on the plot front making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish br br i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind what the actors bring out is what becomes of them right or wrong even the idea <UNK> would find it difficult to justify to become the character the life the actor gives has to go beyond <UNK> and the story here both the actors do just the right job kudos and before sunset is another <UNK> which makes this one even more beautiful
<START> this movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks i've seen the length wasn't nearly long enough to include a good storyline also the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous the mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after <UNK> over an action figure and the dad is shot by a police officer i can see where some originality might have been what they were going for but it could have been better also the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over after hearing all of <UNK> name and <UNK> out it was <UNK> i wanted to gag yes it's interesting that <UNK> was a woman but look at the name it's a <UNK> name it should be given to a male character all in all the movie was a bore and could have used a better plot
<START> i actually didn't enjoy this movie br br i saw it at a camp and we didn't rave about it we laughed at it sure some parts are touching but the acting is terrible the effects are terrible and the whole overall movie idea is terrible now i know it was based on a book which i haven't read but i hope that the book was better than this because frankly i thought that this movie was very bad and boring like i said i went to it with a bunch of people from a camp and we were excited to be there plus i got a <UNK> drink but nonetheless i <UNK> to stay awake the only thing that kept me up other than my fear of being embarrassed once i woke up was the <UNK> that were quite pointless as well i just really didn't like it
<START> this is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original this sequel isn't nearly as fun as part one and it instead spends too much time on plot development tim <UNK> is still the best thing about this series but his <UNK> is toned down in this entry the performances are all adequate but this time the script lets us down the action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting so i need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a <UNK> movie unfortunately the laughs are few and far between and so this film is watchable at best
<START> good lord whoever made this turkey needs to be buried alive i'm sorry but the other reviewer must not have seen this movie he must be watching something else or have never seen a movie before 9 out of ten stars he's saying what this is as good as ben <UNK> or gone with the wind unintentionally funny <UNK> unbelievable characters absurd situations looks like it was shot in griffith park which works out pretty well mash was shot in griffith park crappy script just about everything that could possibly be wrong with a movie all rolled into one package should be required viewing for all <UNK> film makers as an example of how a movie could be horribly wrong it reminds me of something a <UNK> student may make for a film class br br give this one a pass unless you do drugs and are into high camp
<START> after a long period in the space looking for the remains of planet <UNK> superman brandon <UNK> returns to earth he misses lois lane kate <UNK> who got married and has a son with richard white james <UNK> meanwhile lex luthor kevin spacey plots an evil plan using <UNK> he stole from the <UNK> of <UNK> to create a new land and <UNK> the usa br br after so many delightful movies of superman with the unforgettable christopher reeve or tv shows like lois and clark and <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> a great expectation was created for the return of superman in this bryan <UNK> version unfortunately the awful story is too long and boring with many unnecessary parts lack of emotion and overrated in imdb in addition the romance between lois lane and superman is something <UNK> ridiculous the twenty two years old actress kate <UNK> is wrongly miscast playing the role of a mature reporter and experienced mother of a five years old boy brandon <UNK> is two years younger than tom <UNK> who plays a teenager clark kent in <UNK> the character of parker posey kitty <UNK> is actually a silly caricature last but not the least and in spite of being a terrific lex luthor kevin spacey is forty five years old therefore older and older than the rest of the lead cast the corny conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible my vote is four br br title brazil superman returns
<START> this is a brilliant documentary that follows the life of <UNK> and his creating <UNK> its based around a series of interviews <UNK> in 1971 and covers every thing from his early life and nazi collaboration to the final moments of his life br br brilliantly edited very cinematic and fast paced enough to not get boring this film will give you a new appreciation for the work of <UNK> br br the film makers make the film more than just another documentary using the latest state of the art technology and for a change putting it to good use br br recently more and more documentaries have been making it to cinemas but this one as to be amongst the best
<START> as a great admirer of marlene <UNK> i had to finally watch this very very dull picture it is miss <UNK> first color film and the world's most beautiful blond is a <UNK> bad start the story is a tremendous bore involving a subject which itself <UNK> <UNK> me stiff religious guilt who needs it suffice it to say perhaps that of all <UNK> films and i have seen most including <UNK> this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching the color photography is ok this is a very early technicolor release but to no purpose ridiculous casting c <UNK> smith basil <UNK> enough said the only thing of any interest at all is john <UNK> outlandish caricature of a performance as the sand <UNK> who <UNK> all that will happen the supposed happy ending is one of the most depressing ever conceived yet another example of david o <UNK> highly <UNK> reputation did he ever make a really good film other than that one and for one final annoyance the soundtrack of the mgm dvd is a mess with volume levels seemingly <UNK> highly <UNK>
<START> richard <UNK> early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow in his stand up he jokes about it getting great laughs it seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose the toy is about the <UNK> he ever chose aside from i guess another you br br a movie where a white man buys his son a black man nice little bit of underlying political <UNK> before <UNK> was such a thing it's seeing richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end i wanted to see <UNK> get even with this brat instead it becomes the misunderstood kid <UNK> at least <UNK> had his moments ignore this and watch <UNK> with gene wilder or any of his '70s stuff this is a waste of any movie <UNK> time
<START> for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time no exceptions james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master <UNK> through films such as aliens the <UNK> and both <UNK> it is clear that he was a brilliant and <UNK> director as far as action and science fiction goes he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film but titanic is so much different to his other <UNK> of brilliance the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it the acting is wonderful as <UNK> <UNK> who plays jack and kate <UNK> who plays rose became <UNK> overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more <UNK> because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is <UNK> and jack's story alone no one else emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home the music has become iconic and legendary it is composer james <UNK> finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that <UNK> you away on a journey of a lifetime my heart won't go on from this one
<START> this is just a terrible <UNK> it really is a bad film there are no funny elements no jokes that are funny i don't know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be <UNK> or <UNK> ' perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers but i have seen thousands of better films namely leonard part six now that's funny i don't know how the brothers is even considered <UNK> to be listed on the internet movie <UNK> its more like a home video than an actual film br br jokes aside just skip this film a root <UNK> is more enjoyable that this cliche ridden unfunny material
<START> br br i must admit i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of <UNK> last night though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem i am a true horror fan as true as they come and found <UNK> to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced but one of the great parody comedy films of late br br my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements the film was not overly clever in it's <UNK> but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could i am certain this was intended as humour hoping this was intended as humour br br and of course there was the gore br br the use of the <UNK> garden <UNK> was brilliance besides the expected stabs and <UNK> in short there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths enough to please even the <UNK> of this films worth br br the appearance of both <UNK> <UNK> short that her appearance was and molly <UNK> was just another reason to see the film both performances were fantastic as well as simon <UNK> 'the <UNK> in a brilliant role as the <UNK> <UNK> br br all in all i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years as well as a beautiful satire parody <UNK> in cheek till the very end br br loved it go see it
<START> as far as i know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal i'd agree with him this is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy man with a special body part helping him oscar and <UNK> winning and golden globe nominated daniel day lewis plays christy <UNK> crippled man with cerebral <UNK> who spends most of his life on the floor in a wheelchair and carried by his family he has a special left foot though he can write with it paint with it and hold things with it he learns to speak later in the film it is very good for a guy like him also starring home alone <UNK> oscar winning and golden globe nominated brenda <UNK> as mrs brown and <UNK> winning ray <UNK> as mr brown it was nominated the oscars for best director for jim sheridan best writing screenplay based on material from another medium and best picture it was nominated the <UNK> for best film best make up artist and best adapted screenplay daniel day lewis was number 85 on the 100 greatest movie stars he was number 20 on the 50 greatest british actors he was number 9 on <UNK> finest actors and he was number 15 on the world's greatest actor and the film was number 28 on the 50 greatest british films outstanding
<START> that's right under 9 on average but maybe under <UNK> for some others i was 11 when i originally saw this on video and at such youth i wasn't able to notice the shoddy cartoon quality or the fact that those classic characters we have all grown to love are not the same or as good to see just about everything is so <UNK> here belle is i'll agree not even beautiful but just a plain looking woman with <UNK> skin she wears the same bright blue dress all the way through with not one glamorous dress on wardrobe is to say the least annoying my ears may bleed if i had to listen to her everyday <UNK> in both the original and the christmas edition was suave and elegant but here he is a <UNK> unfunny <UNK> <UNK> despite being the no nonsense <UNK> he is famous for is a complete sh t and the most <UNK> character i'd say he always seems to find <UNK> that <UNK> grating pie hole of his very difficult in this one and whose clock face should really have been used for turning back in time to the unforgettable two film in this series poor poor mrs <UNK> was not brought to life by angela lansbury one of my favourite classic actresses but by anne rogers who captured none of mrs <UNK> character no <UNK> to her not if she did her best when the beast <UNK> it sounds so <UNK> fake with clearly no additional <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> by a <UNK> i am aware that this is only a third feature following two other films so of course it wouldn't be as good but i'm sure that more of a contribution wouldn't have hurt the disney artists who indeed have achieved such remarkable styles of animation over the years it's alright i guess and i do watch it sometimes though only when it suits me it's quite difficult to make a recommendation for you reading this because it depends on how old you are but remember this will not at all be what you may expect following the earlier spectacular movies and to think that on my video of it the text on the back cover said <UNK> brilliant animation it's a nice little flick but for one thing it's also highly poor and for another those 3 words ought to have been saved for the next re release of the original
<START> i found this movie hilarious the spoofs on other popular movies of that time were some of the funniest i have seen in this sort of movie give it a try if you saw the movies that this movie is <UNK> and you get the humor you should enjoy the movie br br i and the others who watched the movie with me felt the funniest part in the movie this is not a spoiler because i will not tell you what actually happens was a scene with the flashy <UNK> from <UNK> when they first discover the device and do not know what it is does and then again later in the movie you'll understand when you get there br br my only complaint about the movie is that i have never been able to find it in dvd so that i could buy a copy
<START> i don't know about you but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the often violent interaction between the two characters mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york and as far as i am concerned this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat br br as magical as <UNK> exploration of the <UNK> <UNK> might be for the other t j fans who have commented here on imdb i couldn't wait for this self indulgent rubbish to end so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvd br br in fact the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost <UNK> the <UNK> hanging <UNK> off the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above a busy road
<START> i went to go see this at the esquire theatre in <UNK> oh and i hate my life now br br christopher reeves would have been a more believable boxer br br as a film it was painful but seeing <UNK> <UNK> in person was to see desperation at its <UNK> br br my favorite part of the movie was seeing <UNK> <UNK> in the face with what appeared to be a c <UNK> the jury is still out on this it was from a <UNK> and it was in slow mo yep br br shoot the left side of the face only people become famous by demanding things <UNK> <UNK> b <UNK> <UNK> a chicken suit for a bit of reverse psychology <UNK> the streets of <UNK> bashing his own film he should this is correct to bash the film br br my soul felt <UNK> after this movie br br <UNK> <UNK> is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult or smart enough for that matter that is the feeling you get from the what the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> neo <UNK> that came to see this <UNK> <UNK> piece of work br br it's an emotionally <UNK> experience just thinking about writing about this film so goodbye br br anonymous
<START> i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say even though this movie did not get the best comments this movie made my day it got me thinking what a false world this is br br what do you do when your most loved ones <UNK> you it's said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance same way some people are such that they are never grateful this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about <UNK> and working for <UNK> br br a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster the surviving brother decides to take revenge through this process we learn about the <UNK> of this world nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone br br amitabh gave the performance of his life the new actor <UNK> gave a good performance the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show her role was small but she portrayed her role so <UNK> that one is moved by her performance <UNK> had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself br br a great movie by raj kumar <UNK> his movies always give some message to the audience his movies are like novels of <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> novelist who's novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil because they have a real message for the audience they are entertaining as well as lesson giving
<START> father of the pride was the best new show to hit television since family guy it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at <UNK> animation like the simpsons the show centers around a nuclear family of white lions in this case it also contains many memorable supporting characters including roger the <UNK> <UNK> vincent the italian american <UNK> the eccentric white <UNK> blake and victoria the faux patriotic <UNK> brothers and <UNK> the elephant the other stars of the show are the <UNK> and roy they are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a <UNK> manner making the most mundane activities entertaining the combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues drugs prejudice etc is the source of the <UNK> brilliance br br the blame for this show's failure lies with nbc they <UNK> to broadcast the episodes in no particular order perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote rather than the more logical production order several times the show was <UNK> for an extra half hour of such dreck as the biggest loser as if 60 minutes of that was not enough it is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while fear factor and american idol dominate br br luckily the complete series was released on dvd and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following 10 10
<START> this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have <UNK> some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds i wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end if you don't want to know much about the plot don't keep reading br br <UNK> character <UNK> is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she otherwise a good actress cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent brad johnson also an excellent actor is matt who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce he is gentle convincing and compelling in this role br br the two meet on the beach through her daughter <UNK> and initially <UNK> <UNK> matt of being a child <UNK> just because he talked art with the kid all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love br br the chemistry between the two leads is not great even though the talent of these two people is not in my opinion a question they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical two people meet tragedy bigger tragedy a secret is revealed another tragedy and then they get together i wish there was more to it than that but there it is in a nutshell br br i wanted mindless entertainment and i got it with this in regard to the genre of romantic films this one fails to be memorable a secret affair with <UNK> turner is far superior not a steele book as are some of <UNK> earlier books turned into film
<START> small spoiler <UNK> br br when i looked at the votes for creep today i was surprised about so many imdb users rating this movie 1 i am wondering what do people expect of such kind of movie are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it br br creep is a horror movie and it is a pretty good one this automatically means it has a absurd story full of holes outrageous <UNK> and simple one side characters so why complain about it just take some popcorn and coke make yourself comfortable in your seat and then enjoy to be scared to death the first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly <UNK> there is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some <UNK> just because of a sudden sound of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the back of you in my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie br br when kate meet her <UNK> the quality of the movie drops but it still doesn't become a bad movie the second part of the movie is not scary at all but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed as long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the discovery channel so if you want to make yourself a very very <UNK> hour just watch the first hour of creep and then leave the cinema or turn of your tv you know the rest of the story anyway don't you the bad guy will die and kate will be the only survivor but even if you watch this movie up to its end you will not be disappointed br br and if you want to push anxiety to the next level do what i did after watching this movie leave the cinema by dark night go to the next subway station and take the last train home
<START> this was a pretty decent movie this movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained just a typical hollywood film this movie will never win an oscar or anything and definitely doesn't deserve one but i thought it was pretty good it's kind of like the show 24 but set into movie format if you like the whole we've got to stop the terrorist from killing the president kind of movie then you will enjoy this flick i personally think that storyline has been done way too much but the sentinel does add a little twist with the mole in the secret service all in all this movie won't leave your jaw to the floor or change your life but who says every single movie has to be like that to be good
<START> i watched 3 4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here it was fairly easy to watch at <UNK> it had good casting kevin <UNK> role of the <UNK> serial killer was very believable he was both <UNK> and chilling the rest of the main characters weren't so bad either br br this is your typical stalker suspense movie a married couple cannot <UNK> so they go to a <UNK> clinic for help a <UNK> genetic material <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> and in typical stalker form <UNK> into their lives br br as i said most of the movie was fairly good we see conan grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother of course things don't work out for him the way he planned not a bad plot line br br but the last 15 minutes were just horrible i am pretty <UNK> with movies especially at <UNK> but i was just amazed at how bad the ending was written i actually <UNK> <UNK> br br all in all not the worst movie i've seen but i wouldn't be able to sit through it again unless i <UNK> the ending the only <UNK> quality here was kevin <UNK> role one of the best serial killers ever br br try looking around at the other channels before watching this but if nothing better is on i'd give it a try
<START> <UNK> what a painfully boring sci fi movie and that's especially <UNK> because the opening 15 minutes were so action packed and full of potential during the intro we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a <UNK> full of top secret files as he's about to reveal the supposedly horrible <UNK> events that take place in the lab he's executed <UNK> from then on the <UNK> <UNK> back and forth between two locations the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator or something and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing more like dull pointless and vague scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds anyway they all hide dark secrets from their <UNK> and people suffer when get revealed yet i fail to see how these <UNK> could ever result in a humanity threatening device perhaps i missed something but i doubt it the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow as really none of them have personalities so basically the brain machine just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully <UNK> room the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren't for a thousand <UNK> shots of buildings the <UNK> from the lab to the villa and vice versa are <UNK> every single time by a five second shot of the places either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all sci fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves staring at a <UNK> pool with a mansion in the background for the <UNK> time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying i assure you james <UNK> performance as the <UNK> with mental issues is rather decent but one man definitely can't save this thing from being an absolute waste of time avoid
<START> yes about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a <UNK> tom hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in hollywood here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through yes this movie is about the <UNK> of playing a game that makes a group of people use their <UNK> and try to come up with interesting scenarios basically an after school type special about the <UNK> of the game <UNK> and dragons cleverly <UNK> here as <UNK> and monsters apparently the makers of this film thought that <UNK> should not have fun of any sort unless they were going to go out and do <UNK> drinking drugs having lots of <UNK> sex and <UNK> other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing no these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain <UNK> no not that if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be <UNK> by certain groups out there yes i think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time granted it could be a movie against addiction but there are a lot fewer people who died taking <UNK> and dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month
<START> go immediately and rent this movie it will be be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust no one will have touched it in years it may even be a 50 special it's worth ten bucks i swear buy it there aren't very many films than can compare with this the celluloid version of that goo that forms at the bottom of a trash can after a few years yes i gave it a <UNK> ' but it really deserves much lower 1 10 <UNK> were not designed with stuff like this in mind
<START> this film like the first one the man from snowy river has the same good and bad features perhaps even more so than the original unfortunately the bad <UNK> the good br br the good magnificent scenery better than the first film i love those high country shots in australia tom <UNK> is still a likable guy as jim craig bruce <UNK> did a nice job with the music too br br the bad once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine jessica <UNK> <UNK> who is a world class <UNK> with an extremely annoying face and manner about her in this film we also get a big <UNK> in who pays the father previously it was kirk douglas now replaced by the always <UNK> brian <UNK> speaking of that it is a disgrace that a walt disney film would includes <UNK> of the <UNK> name in vain that was one reason was almost totally down the <UNK> in the 1980s this film like the first one
<START> just a few words this movie really sucks it's like those tv movies with bad cast and plot it's amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the iii don't waste your time watching this crap even if you like the tremors movies
<START> this early john wayne lone star western has a bit more going for it than the run of the mill <UNK> wayne had been making for lone star up until that time for one it has his old friend paul fix in it fix being a much better actor then the standard lone star villain brings a much needed <UNK> to the surroundings instead of the usual <UNK> line <UNK> often delivered in these <UNK> the plot about mistaken identity <UNK> robbery and murder is as trite and <UNK> as you'd expect it to be in a 1930s low budget western but wayne's <UNK> good looks <UNK> charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable <UNK> <UNK> eddy chandler isn't quite believable as wayne's <UNK> partner and there's a running gag about something that happens whenever chandler and wayne are about to get into a <UNK> that grows tiresome on the other hand wayne's love interest is played by none other than mary <UNK> the little mary of the early little <UNK> fame she is a grown up 20 year old now blonde and cute as a button most of wayne's leading ladies in these lone star <UNK> <UNK> were fairly bland and <UNK> but mary is <UNK> cute and yes sexy there's a scene in the general store where she works in which wayne asks her to get him a bottle of nerve <UNK> which happens to be on the top shelf so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf wayne's <UNK> her <UNK> little <UNK> as she <UNK> the steps then again as she comes down then again a few <UNK> later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly <UNK> for a film made in <UNK> wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt anyway it's an interesting little b not great but not as choppy and random as many of his <UNK> productions of the time the final <UNK> isn't handled all that well and chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while but all in all it's worth a look if only to see a cute and sexy mary <UNK>
<START> there are some bad movies out there most of them are rather fun criminally insane 1 was one of those flicks so bad that it was enjoyable and had re watch value to it criminally insane 2 has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me that's saying a lot because i am not the type of person to say anything is the worst but trust me this was just completely awful and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long br br the movie has a rather incoherent storyline but who cares about story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she isn't being fed well you don't see that in this movie except for all of the flashback sequences that are from the first one the new storyline could have been really funny with <UNK> being sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone in there but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that point you are already falling asleep br br the camera work in this movie is just atrocious this literally reminds me of something i shot with friends of mine back when i was 15 the sound quality is something else as you can't understand a word most of the characters are saying to give an example of how bad it is go into a new york subway and try to understand what is being said over the loud <UNK> that is what this movie sounds like not that it matters what they are talking about anyway because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood br br now i know that saying this is the worst movie out there is pretty harsh but words can't describe just how bad this movie is if you don't believe me see it for yourself 1 10
<START> as others have commented i checked this out after <UNK> and ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year what a gift i then went out to buy it just so that i could <UNK> it out br br best quote dwight <UNK> stops his truck when he realizes that someone cage is on top of his cab when cage peers down he <UNK> i'm sorry if i scared you <UNK> <UNK> his pistol in <UNK> face with does this look like i'm scared great bit of humor after an exciting and temporary escape br br there really was a sense of fun to this the constant <UNK> of the welcome to red rock sign <UNK> a <UNK> and a smiling head shake the music created a hunting eerie quality to the film reminiscent of twin peaks unlike twin peaks though it doesn't spoil things by going too far into the outlandish needing to top itself br br i admit watching the credits 15 20 times you see they had <UNK> thousand miles from nowhere perfectly chosen playing as a <UNK> train <UNK> around down to the desert floor with snow <UNK> mountains in the distance this was incredible fluid framing further i've never seen a better <UNK> of sight and sound on film also it totally fit the story
<START> i'm ask what a f are <UNK> the real tv never i see some b in my life is a dirty f bad and other a things but anything more is just a piece of american s all time britney saying <UNK> s i wanna see his <UNK> i wanna f and stuck his d <UNK> and he thinking <UNK> like i gone to still her <UNK> it's just another show of s any one more the only good are what britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it's just like i say another s show in this s <UNK> out the money pure sex all f time i just see for i sleep on the before show for this i wanna my f money
<START> no not the administration of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but the mini series <UNK> <UNK> lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time most of them broadcast between 11 p m friday nights and 1 a m saturday <UNK> as to why i watched the whole thing i can only <UNK> to weekly sudden <UNK> attacks of <UNK> br br most of the cast are <UNK> who are likely to remain unknown the only two recognizable names are shirley jones and rachel ward who turn in the only decent performances jones doesn't make it through the entire series lucky woman ward by the way is aging quite well since her thorn birds days br br the one main thread to the plot who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of <UNK> murder but is freed after six years in the <UNK> is stretched out for so long and <UNK> so <UNK> that you won't especially care who <UNK> it there is a great deal of steamy sex several murders and all sorts of rude behavior virtually none of which is either interesting or credible most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented the writing and direction is on a par with the cast br br if you stick around to the end the post card is a very minor hoot br br consider yourself warned
<START> what was the purpose of this film i suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a big <UNK> for doing nothing even my favorite actor bruce dern couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie a <UNK> ex <UNK> falls in with a weird woman and her relatives he starts out as a fix it man for the woman and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme it was so confusing i can't even write a decent critique if you see this one my sweet make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep
<START> this gripping tale of <UNK> love jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on dvd years after its <UNK> broadcast with a <UNK> picture and <UNK> sound my only <UNK> are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger <UNK> accents are difficult at times luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun the primary actors are <UNK> cast <UNK> green brings an enigmatic smile a go for broke <UNK> and an athletic <UNK> to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work <UNK> <UNK> is one of the most striking 50 ish women imaginable her acting rivals her beauty the love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them each of the supporting characters is <UNK> drawn and excellently portrayed as well the mix of <UNK> dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries as russell baker notes in his introduction you may not be morally improved by viewing reckless but you'll have plenty of fun the sequel a part of the dvd box set provides a wild yet satisfying two hour denouement you won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before
<START> yes this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the <UNK> then they introduce <UNK> a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986 as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now kid becomes buddy with robot and robot <UNK> the kid's kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited <UNK> supply and <UNK> that do not have the <UNK> to reach into space this camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the <UNK> get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things give it a rest they are there for fun not to become <UNK> just yet just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp however you do get to see <UNK> phoenix in a fairly early role so in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas but with the introduction of <UNK> and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me probably for a few others as well who else would like to see kate <UNK> face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature
<START> the only reason i don't give this movie fewer than 3 stars is because it isn't quite on par with a movie like <UNK> the hands of fate this movie's greatest crime is the fact that it is head <UNK> boring terribly <UNK> british the premise of this movie sounds potentially promising the whole <UNK> concept but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting it was more a movie about research funding and <UNK> than <UNK> <UNK> the actors were wooden <UNK> and <UNK> as was the love affair between the two scientists which was anything but intriguing i never was able to tell what the attraction was between them as the chemistry was non existent nor did i really understand why the <UNK> faced main guy decided to slaughter everyone he met at least now i know that i should always give someone a fair hearing before i cut off their research <UNK> else they go <UNK> about killing <UNK> with goofy hand gestures
