<START> angels who got a little <UNK> were banned from heaven and now <UNK> in a british forest where they seduce and chop up teens talk about high concept on the plus side this little mother gives us tom <UNK> but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen time his five minute presence seems a tad long the angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie but though they might have the body of an angel their faces sure look like joan rivers on a bad day mediocre acting and amateurish gore effects don't help and the night scenes <UNK> recall paris <UNK> most famous movie so bad that it is really bad
<START> i had high expectations following my beautiful <UNK> bend it like beckham and less so east is east the <UNK> of british <UNK> fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen as well as a number of excellent tv and radio series goodness <UNK> me etc this one falls flat <UNK> of a good start it rapidly went down hill br br ultimately this was a horribly typical bbc effort complete with strong <UNK> accents <UNK> over acting characters a those were the days soundtrack and lots of issues in an attempt to be worthy br br i found myself cringing at many points during this film the writing is predictable every possible cliche was dragged out and aired in fact i have trouble thinking of any cross cultural cross <UNK> devices that could have been used that weren't the characters were thin and cliched the eccentric non <UNK> minister the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman the over weight overbearing aunt the <UNK> indian parents the working class <UNK> the <UNK> profound grandmother the <UNK> riding thug the script was weak with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two <UNK> racist white characters taken and why it had to be set in the 70's apart from needing an excuse for a 70's soundtrack is a mystery possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979 i don't know br br even these things aside good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity instead the usual bbc comedy suspects were <UNK> out to ham it up bend it like beckham had far better comic acting and serious acting in fact than this with a virtually unknown cast br br in summary a lazy cliched script over acted in a dull predictable story give it a miss br br
<START> sure the history in this movie was <UNK> but it's far from being the only bit of history <UNK> for the masses <UNK> sided with the americans because he considered himself a frenchman and therefore hated the british not because of any sense of <UNK> for a nation that had taken over new orleans only a short time ago he broke his <UNK> and returned to <UNK> which caused his <UNK> to <UNK> he was more of a petty criminal and <UNK> than a hero or a <UNK> but who cares this is one movie that's sheer entertainment and face it we all wanted jean to go for the <UNK> <UNK> rather than the <UNK> daughter of the <UNK> <UNK> once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance
<START> i think that <UNK> <UNK> though she may try hard is not very good at all i guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price i mainly watched it for the performance of <UNK> <UNK> whose work i know very well br br he was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch when he wasn't on the screen the thing went dead this was filmed in <UNK> he gave me the creeps but be assured that in real life he is a kind funny compassionate man he even said playing that role gave him the creeps br br i'll watch anything with him in it but <UNK> <UNK> never again she was as exciting as <UNK> on law and order maybe a very nice person but no actress
<START> alan anthony <UNK> an english multi millionaire with a few <UNK> loose thanks to his first wife's infidelity and <UNK> death during <UNK> <UNK> sexy red headed women to his castle offering them <UNK> of cash to stay the weekend once back at his <UNK> pile he gets them <UNK> proceeds to <UNK> them with a bull whip and then kills them br br but when he meets blonde <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and falls for her ample charms he decides to give up his murderous ways and get married their <UNK> bliss is short lived however thanks to <UNK> <UNK> mental state which becomes increasingly fragile when his dead wife evelyn starts to appear outside his window and a <UNK> of gruesome murders occur within the castle grounds br br so let's <UNK> a <UNK> 70s euro horror with loads of tasty women in various states of <UNK> spooky gothic <UNK> and misty <UNK> a sadistic rich psycho with a <UNK> for drop dead gorgeous babes with cracking <UNK> several vicious murders including a great bit where one victim has her head <UNK> in with a rock and her <UNK> eaten by <UNK> normally a <UNK> like that would guarantee me a good <UNK> why did i find 'the night evelyn came out of her <UNK> so dull well for starters the plot is way too convoluted there are red herrings crazy plot developments and suspects <UNK> and it all becomes a bit too much by the ridiculous <UNK> which we discover that all along several people have been plotting to get their greedy <UNK> on <UNK> wealth and that our red head killing nut job is actually supposed to be the hero of the <UNK> head was hurting too much to care secondly <UNK> <UNK> direction is pretty <UNK> stylish yes but as slow as <UNK> at times br br and then there's the bits that are just too damn silly possibly even for a giallo the death by <UNK> snake bite surely one of the most bizarre choices of weapon ever <UNK> aunt agatha an old crippled relative who is played by a pretty young woman the hiring of a group of identical curly headed <UNK> as <UNK> the poor attempt at convincing the audience that the film is set in england mentioning <UNK> and hiring a crap police uniform for one of the extras is not enough and then of course there is the <UNK> of finding a bag of <UNK> acid laying next to a swimming pool br br 'the night evelyn came out of her <UNK> isn't a total waste of time how could it be with so much female flesh on show but there are much better <UNK> out there watch this one if you're a fan of the genre and you've already seen the <UNK> don't expect too much
<START> the actual crime story at the core of in cold blood might seem a little <UNK> for those who are <UNK> on the classic serial killer stories <UNK> <UNK> dahmer or just the more notorious cases out in hollywood <UNK> <UNK> the essential facts in the case don't amount to anything terribly convoluted perry smith and dick <UNK> here played by robert blake and scott wilson respectively met by some luck <UNK> to rob a man's <UNK> safe out in kansas and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and <UNK> came away with <UNK> dollars aside from their returning to the us after fleeing briefly to mexico there isn't a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either they were caught by some stroke of ironic chance a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after smith and <UNK> helped out a boy and his old man collecting <UNK> for change and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead the story ended in 1965 br br but it's the handling of the story moments of <UNK> the performances a pure cinematic touch that brooks and his absolutely marvelous the late great <UNK> conrad hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much <UNK> or too much melodrama save perhaps for near the end which is pitch perfect the air of tragedy hangs over the story and not so much because of the killings themselves no matter how brutal they are as the third man that is <UNK> up as the narrator <UNK> by smith and <UNK> <UNK> up but because of the <UNK> of the story you feel somehow for these criminals who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a b movie these aren't good people but they aren't necessarily monsters either at least all the way through br br it's also an excellent <UNK> <UNK> as we see smith and <UNK> on the road down to the clutter <UNK> the actual night time scene of the crime taking place late in the film then on to mexico then back to america towards las vegas we get to <UNK> in the personalities of these two probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an <UNK> it's actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two sort of akin to the <UNK> quality of <UNK> <UNK> characters and it's also a sign of daring for the period there's no <UNK> like he did this because of that and this or the other we see how smith had an abusive psychotic father but that smith loved and hated him the complexity there is too much for the movie maybe even too much for <UNK> book which i should confess i've still yet to read though i plan to and we see <UNK> is this creature of slick confidence i e getting the suit and other things with bad <UNK> but without any deep <UNK> explanation to it all br br the streak of <UNK> in in cold blood is some of the <UNK> of the 60s and it's the luck of brooks to have its stars as blake in his top of the pops performance this and lost highway oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years his quintessential pieces of work and <UNK> breakthrough before becoming a character actor while they're surrounded by fine supporting work they themselves are <UNK> absorbing driven more or less by greed and fantasies of <UNK> with treasure and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends is this a <UNK> of the story if there could be one that it's more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can't be classified of good vs evil getting <UNK> smith <UNK> for his crime before being hung and he points out but to who this is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of true crime the <UNK> chills and it's quite possibly the best american film of 1967
<START> yes i call this a perfect movie not one boring second a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with perfect lighting crisp black and white photography a fitting soundtrack an intelligent and <UNK> set design and a story that is engaging and works it's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest the mark everyone should <UNK> to reach br br barbara stanwyck is simply stunning there was nothing this actress couldn't do and she always went easy on the melodramatic side no hysterical <UNK> with this lady i always thought she was a better actress than screen <UNK> like bette davis or joan crawford and this movie confirmed my opinion always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career and this one is by far the least interesting br br the title fits this movie very well it is about desires human desires i think everyone can understand actually no one seems to be scheming in this movie all characters act on <UNK> everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here br br i liked what this movie has to say about youth about <UNK> and about the necessity to compromise the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock's shadow of a doubt it creates a similar atmosphere of <UNK> and at the same time <UNK> small town america the story has a certain similarity with fritz <UNK> considerably <UNK> movie clash by night made one year earlier where <UNK> stars in a similar part i can also recommend it
<START> i found this to be the most enjoyable muppets movie because i felt it was the most light hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines the muppets try to go on broadway to sell an original musical they've written but along the way they run into the usual problems including <UNK> memory loss here while there aren't as many great cameos here as in the original muppets movie there are some including joan rivers and <UNK> coleman simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious the original songs are also good here and the ending is satisfying there is not much else to say about the film but muppet fans should see it for sure it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by all br br 1 2 out of
<START> i ran across this movie on the tv and could not turn it off peter sellers plays an unlikable fellow who falls for an extremely warm and cute goldie hawn who wouldn't the way that <UNK> character holds herself from the beginning of the movie to the end is <UNK> even today this movie gave me a different angle into human relations and also i found it very funny peter sellers role was a difficult sell but i think he pulls it off well
<START> i saw this recently on a faded old vhs tape and remembered it <UNK> looking at it now it seems charming br br when it was first released it was recognized by pretty much everyone as a spoof of coming out as a gay teenager to hammer the point home the mother is seen reading a <UNK> copy of 1 teenager in 10 the most popular coming out book of the time david warner <UNK> it up as the <UNK> vampire hunter gay hating <UNK> who is of course a self loathing closet case the list of sight gags and in jokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into the producers were having some good natured fun and hoping no doubt to <UNK> up as well as to <UNK> br br but i have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film nowadays in some places where there is education and culture the terrifying <UNK> that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past but i'm sure there are plenty of dark nasty <UNK> of our continent where it's just as bad as it always was
<START> i was pleased with the cast of <UNK> players the story is one of standing up for a cause even if you are at personal risk in doing so in a time where violence and pain are often in the movie <UNK> this movie focuses on the old fashioned good cop although similar plots have been done repeatedly these guys pull it off well kick back and enjoy <UNK> is a master of taking over a movie
<START> this film is a joke and <UNK> should be ashamed of himself trying to pass this off as a modesty blaise film if you are having trouble sleeping then all means rent this film the stick figure they call a actress who is suppose to be modesty blaise has got to be the most boring person on this planet maybe she could be used as a hat stand in the back ground of a real film <UNK> five minutes of nothing thank you who ever invented the fast forward button if you see this film if you can call it that coming your way run i can't help but think what 3rd world country could of used the money wasted of this crap this film is boring the actors are boring waste of colour a waste air they breath if you would like to see <UNK> blaise film then watch the one they made in the 60's maybe that what the director should of done
<START> what was the point of this movie what was the plot i do not know <UNK> can't act people don't know how to direct and i am <UNK> a genie who <UNK> come on maybe <UNK> or <UNK> park will be in a movie like this i remember i watched this just to kill time it didn't really interest me i just remember thinking who put <UNK> in this movie the whole story seemed stupid too it made no sense whatsoever i guess an <UNK> moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen i can't comment much more because this movie is so terrible there's nothing worth commenting about i wish this movie would go away
<START> somehow they summed up the 60's ten years that <UNK> changed our country in four hours and what a painful four hours it was they <UNK> the major events and happenings and they claimed it was about two families yet you barely saw the african american family if i were nbc i would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash what was amusing was this happy go lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways but managed to attend every major 60's event through the country and the second family was such a non factor they devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family that poor son please nbc do not make any movies about any other <UNK> leave that to <UNK> and the history channel
<START> this film although not totally bad should have been filmed where the actual events took place grand island <UNK> was <UNK> by no less than seven <UNK> on the night of june 3 1980 grand island is <UNK> in the nearly <UNK> flat <UNK> river valley in hall county the makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of <UNK> and moved the whole event to a non <UNK> town called <UNK> the people of grand island <UNK> survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie
<START> this is an anti <UNK> propaganda film made for tv br br the muslims are good the <UNK> christian <UNK> are bad br br that's the message br br using entertainment to get across a propaganda message is nothing new br br this movie lays it on thick br br and apparently many viewers and reviewer lap it up br br i know better br br the <UNK> under general <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> saved over 500 shot down us <UNK> from the germans in world war ii br br <UNK> decided to <UNK> <UNK> and put british backing behind communist <UNK> <UNK> followed suit and as a result after the war ended <UNK> was delivered over to communist <UNK> br br and us ally <UNK> has been <UNK> by the media ever since br br this movie is part of the anti <UNK> propaganda campaign <UNK> by george <UNK> and his international crisis group <UNK> which <UNK> in the <UNK> war in which <UNK> was bombed by <UNK> because of totally false claims by the <UNK> of mass graves in <UNK> filled with victims of the nasty <UNK> the fact that there were no such mass graves and the <UNK> muslims had no business being in <UNK> <UNK> are facts that most of the media won't print br br i chose this movie to watch because the one sentence description on the video cover looked interesting br br imagine my disgust when i discovered i had been fooled into renting another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at <UNK> br br instead of this propaganda someone should make a movie about the <UNK> of the <UNK> administration to come clean with the <UNK> and with the american people about its <UNK> in the delivery of weapons from iran to the muslim government in <UNK> br br i won't hold my breath waiting for such a movie
<START> first of all don't go into revolver expecting another snatch or lock stock this is a different sort of gangster film br br i saw the <UNK> the other night and this movie definitely split the audience it's the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking what was that that was awful and the other half will leave thinking what was that that was cool personally i like films that i don't understand i e <UNK> drive and usual suspects so i enjoyed revolver br br it definitely wasn't perfect though i saw the big twist coming a mile away at least part of it and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed also some scenes like the animation and the scene where <UNK> goes on a killing spree actually one of my favourites although awesome scenes to watch seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch not because they fit in with the movie br br however there were many good things too i thought the acting was superb from all the main actors jason <UNK> ray liotta vincent <UNK> and even andre benjamin who was a pleasant surprise this movie definitely kept my interest with one great suspenseful action packed scene after another when ray liotta was being held under the table wow well you have to see it the script was extremely well done and the soundtrack as with most guy ritchie films was great br br though a step below such movies as fight club <UNK> drive and usual suspects it was still an awesome fast paced psychological action movie with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over
<START> this film is great as often heard it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal but unlike some other people i am clearly not of the opinion that it is depressing <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> fascist society quite the contrary while there are indeed some very heavy scenes in <UNK> and some characters are to be called very bad persons at the same time you watch love beauty and humor in <UNK> <UNK> film and that's exactly what <UNK> <UNK> for me from other films that try to show the lives of the <UNK> <UNK> in an intense realistic way their <UNK> their wishes their dark sides <UNK> clearly never tries to prove that the lives of the working class people are trash in my opinion viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid of <UNK> that nearly <UNK> live is as <UNK> and <UNK> as we would like other people to believe and that every live has its dark and often depressing sides the most beautiful scene the old <UNK> man watching his old girl dancing 'the oriental <UNK> as he is calling it i think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is that's <UNK> fascist the characters in <UNK> or viewers who are turned off by the body of a 70 year old woman dancing with all her charms for her lover
<START> the us appear to run the uk police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that <UNK> officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub this has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of real uk police that has ever been <UNK> on the unsuspecting public i can see that mr snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like charles dance was doing in it is a mystery br br worse than the worse low budget b film of the 50's an hour and a half of suicide and time i will never get back br br avoid it like the <UNK> plague
<START> as has been noted this formula has been filmed several times most recently as you've got mail with tom hanks and meg <UNK> <UNK> ryan of the several versions this is my least favorite the problem i think is that the studio <UNK> on the stars charisma which doesn't quite cut it here br br the chemistry <UNK> the two leads never comes to a <UNK> in this movie there are no real sparks van johnson and judy garland remind me of day old <UNK> pleasant but bland and when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow judy in particular is disappointing she looks like she has no neck i don't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it's head into it's shell all <UNK> up and everything i couldn't figure out what van johnson was getting so hot about i would have made a <UNK> line for that cute <UNK> player and van wasn't great either i've always thought of him as a rather generic hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to <UNK> that image here br br if you're a fan of the stars or the early <UNK> then you might like this movie but there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there and they offer you much more than a <UNK> of stale <UNK>
<START> if there was a 0 stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste the fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse the basic task of <UNK> up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine but <UNK> the experiment all i see is a bunch of <UNK> surfers and <UNK> <UNK> about music and culture i don't know or want to know about the challenges are pathetic and silly the whole point of reality tv is to show reality if you set a <UNK> don't make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in <UNK> night <UNK> make them do an actual challenge and as for <UNK> prize money thats fine if they actually <UNK> it these people are nuts if only they would make the show better the actual idea would be glorious but that ain't gonna happen
<START> since <UNK> tiger hidden dragon came along there's been a lot of talk about a revival of the hong kong movie industry don't believe it the people now making movies in hk give new meaning to the word crass running out of time 2 is a perfect example <UNK> <UNK> is the name draw here but he spends most of the film just <UNK> <UNK> and flipping a <UNK> he <UNK> the <UNK> over and over and again and again why who knows sean <UNK> plays a cop who chases after the <UNK> flipping pretty boy but once again who knows why there's a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a <UNK> or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a <UNK> or shopping centre than in front of a camera nothing makes any sense there is no action there is no sex there is no comedy all there is is a name <UNK> <UNK> and you know what who cares
<START> this is one of the most insipid lackluster unoriginal and pointless movies ever made it almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn't even try to make an appealing movie this is nothing more than a <UNK> of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of <UNK> and the <UNK> which i think is the best film of them all as for this waste of film stock burt reynolds <UNK> his way through the entire movie jim <UNK> is wasted the other actors aren't given very much to do the car races are obviously stock footage the humor is uninspired and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours <UNK> ace is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it
<START> i saw this movie at the 18th <UNK> film festival and it is one of the best i've seen this year seeing it on a big screen and i mean big not one of those tv screens most cinemas have with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience as the movie takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story into the picture br br the movie presents a set of characters which are loosely inter connected their stories cross at certain points and the <UNK> of story lines reminded me very much of the great robert altman and his exquisite films but the true hero of the movie is obviously the city of <UNK> which provides the backdrop for the entire movie it houses the characters contains the <UNK> and roads on which they walk and sets the background atmosphere for all the events all in beautifully filmed scenes br br the movie returns again and again to certain themes shoes for instance and in essence <UNK> makes his <UNK> more and more understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses he combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters and <UNK> matches the feeling of the scene to the background a set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters one excellent example is the scene in which <UNK> takes anita across the street for the first time it might not work on a small screen but it gave me <UNK> <UNK> easily on a big screen br br the message of the movie is very positive and <UNK> the movie is light and funny at times the music along the movie is usually pop with a few <UNK> pieces i hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day although i seriously doubt i will br br all together i came out of this movie with a sensational feeling and i'm not easily impressed you'll have to take my word for it for this and more i give this movie a solid 8 10
<START> ossessione is in very bad state but is now <UNK> a full <UNK> at digital film lab in <UNK> the material used is a master positive 2nd generation originally from the print visconti managed to hide from the <UNK> it has been <UNK> on the spirit <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> data then <UNK> using <UNK> revival <UNK> <UNK> after this the rest is <UNK> labor and we do not <UNK> finishing before early spring sometime next year it should be available on dvd and hopefully also released on <UNK> dvd this film is beautiful and we hope the <UNK> effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come
<START> that hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say it's funny on its own terms and pretty funny unintentionally too only two of the sisters are really bad boy are they bad too one is given to <UNK> poses and <UNK> comments where <UNK> she goes the other is got up to look like marilyn monroe she has those sensual slightly <UNK> lips and not to give anything away she is even more bad than the other br br all three sisters are played by <UNK> the man who stumbles into their lives is played by john <UNK> he had something of a career br br this looks today like possibly the first mainstream soft core porn ever <UNK> well of course not the first but the <UNK> at that time br br the girls wear as little as possible and let's not forget about the female audience members <UNK> is shown <UNK> with an electric razor whose fetish was this bare <UNK> he also is shown <UNK> wet in a <UNK> br br there's a real plot here too the girls' family see is cursed they are prone to suicide or dramatic deaths that can be made to seem like suicide br br the movie is not bad i truly don't know where it was shown maybe it was made for drive ins somehow and i could be wrong i felt that the typical male audience was not the primary target here the women are scantily dressed they often resemble lurid covers of <UNK> like police detective or <UNK> of dime novels br br but the guy seems to be the central focus not everyone in the movie likes him but all the girls love him and i think the audience is meant to also br br it's lots of fun and on its own terms too
<START> this movie is not your typical horror movie it has some campy humor and death scenes which can be sort of comical i personally liked the movie because of its off beat humor it's <UNK> not a super scary movie which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid afterwards i liked the performance of the <UNK> guy and of lester very believable i think i'm going to <UNK> my hair red like that girl in scarecrow very cool anyway overall worth renting for the campy humor and non typical horror experience
<START> i gave this <UNK> film a 2 because of the attractive actors and semi sexy love scenes otherwise if you can't read like a speed reader you will never get through the subtitles that try to keep up with the spanish speed talking and what the hell is going on in the plot if you can't read the subtitles endless stares and goof eyes and constant <UNK> just boring after an hour or so some good cinematography but also some so dark you think your screen has burned out how this won anything i will never understand difficult to talk about acting since the lead actors seem to just stare and look lovingly at each other when they are not pushing each other away the character <UNK> is so attractive that it is difficult to believe that anyone would push him away and what is with his mother i just plain didn't get it most of the time except that there were three guys that all seem to have had a history with each other but never figured out who was whose ex
<START> <UNK> was a major hype and revelation in 2007 because they won the <UNK> song contest with a not so heavy metal song called hard rock <UNK> and appeared on stage dressed like hideous monsters but let's face it their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents the <UNK> contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and <UNK> probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and  even more importantly because their whole act sort of <UNK> <UNK> the whole <UNK> event the absolute last thing <UNK> first and hopefully last horror film brings is change and <UNK> dark floors based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles is a truly unimaginative and hopeless <UNK> of clichés the immense budget dark floors supposedly is the most expensive <UNK> film ever definitely <UNK> greatly macabre set pieces and impressive make up art but what's the point where there's no story that is worth telling the film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people among them a father and his young daughter with an <UNK> illness become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown when the doors open again the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already trying to reach the exit the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles like <UNK> corpses screaming ghosts and heavy metal monsters <UNK> from the floors the only three points i'm <UNK> out to dark floors are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film for as long as the sinister events don't require an explanation the atmosphere is quite creepy but as soon as you realize the explanation will a be very stupid or b never come the wholesome just <UNK> like an unstable house of cards <UNK> costumes never really were scary to begin with except maybe to traditional <UNK> fans and in combination with a story more reminiscent to asian ghost horror they just look downright pathetic and <UNK> with all the national <UNK> and truly unique exterior filming locations i personally always presumed <UNK>  the land of a thousand <UNK>  would be the ideal <UNK> ground for potentially horrific horror tales but i guess that's another <UNK> on my account
<START> cypher is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future while <UNK> not complex this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty <UNK> and corporate conspiracy to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf br br the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre <UNK> man morgan sullivan jeremy northam who applies to the <UNK> group to work as an undercover <UNK> after an initial <UNK> with <UNK> security chief sullivan is then given a new identity jack <UNK> and sent to a business <UNK> with the task of recording the speeches given by various <UNK> concerning the marketing <UNK> of each of their respective companies upon successfully <UNK> his first assignment sullivan <UNK> is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered however on one of his business <UNK> he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster liu whom he had met on his previous assignment and from there things go extremely <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of a diabolical conspiracy involving <UNK> espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of <UNK> main <UNK> thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies br br spoilers end here br br what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic household settings while a lot of shadows and dark <UNK> were used for settings involving deception and cover up i was also very impressed with jeremy northam not too often have i seen him in the lead role and the fact that he plays a <UNK> married man straight out of <UNK> was brilliant personally i think he's one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn't been given more challenging roles lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak and <UNK> tone additionally the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job however my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated for example i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack <UNK> had developed a more intimate relationship with his second wife overall this is a cleverly developed cloak and <UNK> story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional <UNK> and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work this film provides a scary look at how <UNK> might operate in the near future i'm surprised that i had never watched this hidden gem before this is a brilliant not too overly complicated spy thriller and therefore i'm giving it a 9 out of 10
<START> in the small american town of <UNK> dr anthony blake david <UNK> the imdb listing for this character is wrong it's definitely dr blake not dr <UNK> is the director and <UNK> of the famed <UNK> research <UNK> and also <UNK> a local t v programme called <UNK> <UNK> he uses this t v show to <UNK> the viewers and make them commit acts of violence dr blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it's spinal <UNK> as a tail <UNK> usually the brain is just sitting in a tank eats mice and the odd bad actor each time it eats someone it gets much bigger meanwhile at the local high school gifted but <UNK> teenager jim <UNK> tom <UNK> has been caught putting <UNK> down the <UNK> jim is sent to dr blake at the <UNK> for help with his attitude and <UNK> problems while there dr blake <UNK> jim up to well something i'm not actually sure what this whatever it is is attached to the brain at first jim is able to resist the <UNK> mind control the brain feels that jim is a threat to itself and it's plans once out of the <UNK> jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend janet <UNK> preston as <UNK> preston but is handed back to dr <UNK> assistant <UNK> george <UNK> soon after by officer marks harry booker the brain wants to kill jim because he is the only one capable of <UNK> it's mind control techniques and with <UNK> <UNK> going national the brain doesn't want anything or anyone to stop it's evil plan for world <UNK> jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain before it takes over the world br br directed by ed hunt who calls himself edward hunt here the brain wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be don't get me wrong as it certainly isn't great either the script by barry <UNK> tries a stab at satire with the brain <UNK> and mind control by t v storyline it moves along at a fair pace and isn't too boring no explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all it's just there and that's it we have to accept it the story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element there's the t v mind control the brain itself jim being hunted by the police his <UNK> and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding dr blake that isn't explained at all production wise this film looks cheap and probably was cheap the acting isn't great but i've seen worse and what is david <UNK> doing in this in fact this role is similar to <UNK> role in re animator 1985 even down to his character's deaths in both films the brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big each stage is just made of rubber it doesn't look particularly good and isn't scary or creepy just cheap there's no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you'll miss it <UNK> the nudity is provided by dr <UNK> assistant vivian christine <UNK> as christine <UNK> before she gets eaten the brain had a certain entertainment value for me but i would think most people would dislike it maybe worth a watch if you can see it on t v for free
<START> my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her she's from china and only heard so much about 9 11 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary i felt awful watching this documentary it was like <UNK> the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes br br but i'm extremely grateful that i watched this documentary because on the day of september <UNK> i'm sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard all of us could only think certain questions why how what's going on oh my god almost all the americans were grateful for the brave <UNK> and policemen that <UNK> their lives to save others but i don't think we thought about what they were really going though this wasn't actually supposed to be a documentary about 9 11 the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple <UNK> away from the world trade centers and got everything outside and in on tape br br on <UNK> <UNK> i thought to myself it's ok the policemen and <UNK> will get the people out that survived to be honest i thought it was an accident i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class someone came into the locker room shouting some building just got bombed in new york we all got dressed quickly and ran to our <UNK> as we watched the first tower burning on tv not only 15 seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident a few minutes later we heard about the <UNK> and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking what are the <UNK> and policemen going to do but it's <UNK> to them i thought they'll know what to do br br the first tower <UNK> we knew it so many lives are now gone the second tower crashed things would never be the same those <UNK> in this documentary showed courage confusion and strength the real raw human emotions they didn't know what to do they were just as <UNK> as those other people who were in the towers they heard the bodies <UNK> on the ground from people jumping out the windows and here i was in a <UNK> just crying seeing all that was going on on tv i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help i know they feel like they were just doing their job but they did more they were hero's every day after <UNK> <UNK> for 3 weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors but they kept on hoping and praying may god bless their kind and brave hearts br br as for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day she asked why i didn't know what to say it breaks my heart that people can be that evil it sounds <UNK> but it was a normal day for everyone one of the <UNK> said in the documentary no one expected this to happen not like that those people in the world trade centers or the <UNK> or the planes that were <UNK> they were just doing their job happen to be there or even just was there for a second passing by they were not just murdered they were slaughtered and those <UNK> did it with a song in their heart then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating why do people do this they celebrated death and the lose of mothers fathers sisters brothers friends grandparents aunts <UNK> cousins etc why br br so thanks to those people for making this documentary you truly think about the <UNK> policemen and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world thank you to all those people you are our heroes br br 10 10
<START> this is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny what is it with the talking car with buttons that say <UNK> <UNK> m <UNK> and <UNK> there was no talking car in the cartoon dr claw is supposed to be evil not handsome and charming why is rupert <UNK> <UNK> anyway were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes it looks like they were badly <UNK> <UNK> cop with the turning a man into a crime fighting <UNK> thing i tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if i watch more than 30 minutes of a movie you don't get a <UNK> i'm sorry i watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap after i was told the no <UNK> policy i decided to watch the rest of the hideous garbage called inspector gadget
<START> in the ten years since <UNK> aired nothing has really come close to its quality in local production this includes the two series of the enjoyable but overrated <UNK> which have brought to life events in the recent criminal history of both sydney and melbourne the miniseries blue murder which also starred tony martin but as someone on the other side of the law may be the exception br br <UNK> is currently being repeated late at night on the abc having not watched the show in quite a while i'm still impressed by its <UNK> story lines and very human characters the cast is excellent tony martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son <UNK> blake who later hooked up with martin in real life as a community worker struggling with alcoholism and alex <UNK> as a young cop whose vice is gambling equally good support roles are provided by aaron <UNK> jessica <UNK> mary <UNK> yes <UNK> herself and a young <UNK> <UNK> br br the abc inexplicably released only the first three episodes on dvd a couple of years ago the logic of this sort of marketing is beyond me but i'm guessing it may have something to do with <UNK> <UNK> with the original producers br br a great series which has aged remarkably well here's hoping the <UNK> dvd department gets its act together br br according to a <UNK> on an abc message board some sort of further dvd release is due in december 2009
<START> in a recent biography of alec guinness i couldn't find too much about to paris with love i'm sure guinness did the film to get a free trip to paris out of it the film has no other reason for existence br br paris of course is nicely photographed with that wonderful opening of guinness and his son driving down the <UNK> <UNK> with the arc de <UNK> in the background unfortunately it goes downhill from there br br there is just no chemistry at all between guinness and the young girl who he has a brief <UNK> with in paris according to the recent biography of guinness by <UNK> paul read guinness positively disliked the girl found her conduct <UNK> as to what <UNK> <UNK> thought of her co star no record is available they have as much chemistry as two <UNK> cats br br guinness does have a good moment in the film which was straight from one of his ealing comedies as he climbs a tree trying to retrieve a <UNK> <UNK> but i wouldn't wait through the film for it br br at least alec got a trip to paris out of the deal
<START> after too many years of waiting anne rivers <UNK> noted 1979 book the house next door has finally been filmed the result <UNK> a bit from the novel which especially in the first story of the trilogy is understandable if unsatisfying as it's a tv film the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good just not as great as the book one of stephen king's favorites and one of mine as well br br with more running time and fewer constraints as a theatrical release all the <UNK> inherent in the original three part story of the ominous <UNK> house could have been explored and <UNK> especially the climactic revelation near the very end br br still the whole cast does well in this thoughtful tale of mindless <UNK> there are a few unnecessary cheap shocks but the growing atmosphere of dread is well developed actually one of the most disturbing scenes involves an abstract painting of the house by its next door amateur artist neighbor who is trying to <UNK> its corruption on <UNK> br br be sure to read the great novel
<START> a group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find <UNK> they stumble on a bigfoot burial ground eventually the didn't notice it in the dark the scenes of the cgi bigfoot are horrid but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely <UNK> i used to think that there just might be a good bigfoot movie to be made but now after so many sad sad movies about the legend i'm having serious doubts to pour salt in the wound of watching this film the one good looking girl just doesn't get naked once and while this one may be better than <UNK> creek 2 no mean feat there it's still sad that the best non documentary film on bigfoot remains harry and the <UNK> br br my grade d
<START> most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life ready to jump off the screen and <UNK> you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog the tim burton <UNK> had it as did in an even more grotesque manner sin city with dick tracy producer director star warren beatty <UNK> on the villains until it becomes part of the <UNK> like a <UNK> homage to 1930s gangster pictures only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker bonnie and clyde dick tracy is filled <UNK> with <UNK> and bright primary colors where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities villains like the <UNK> shoulders lips the brow <UNK> the blank <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gave the names to his characters that fit their <UNK> and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass the film is a <UNK> of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously br br if at the time movies like batman and underrated teenage mutant ninja <UNK> were darker depictions of reality within a comic book outline dick tracy is more <UNK> <UNK> it's a story of cops and crooks or rather a cop detective tracy as he tries to bust big boy al pacino in what is arguably his biggest performance to date and in a sense the one that makes sense for his <UNK> style but with no such luck there's also a little kid called simply the kid charlie <UNK> who somehow brings more <UNK> to this little kid than would've been imagined and <UNK> love interest in tess and then there's the nightclub <UNK> madonna who probably doesn't give any kind of great acting performance but maybe that suits the role fine and she sings excellently when called upon who wont <UNK> unless tracy admits feelings he doesn't have for her then there's convoluted <UNK> with taking tracy down and a mysterious masked figure with a <UNK> voice br br meantime as if doing an <UNK> of a howard <UNK> film in a <UNK> of visual effects and bigger explosions dick tracy adds on the <UNK> and nod comedy and the action like its <UNK> on a tall stack of <UNK> it's a wonder to look at this world which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by <UNK> of computers i e sin city which can be <UNK> compared to <UNK> film we're driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line or whatever there is of it in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little <UNK> <UNK> in the comics of old i'm almost reminded of the <UNK> club during these sequences as story music detail and a few big punches and gun shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said which actually isn't more than it needs to and there's a heap load of catchy dialog from the script one of my favorites the enemy of my enemy is my enemy plus any of <UNK> references to other figures in quotes br br <UNK> this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater and only remembering little bits dick tracy is a hard boiled fantasy to the finest degree it's filled with good cheer for the kids and with some pretty good action <UNK> away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic book movies i e pg 13 fare and for the adults its throw back central done with <UNK> and a solid feeling for the <UNK> even dustin hoffman <UNK> it up and he barely says an <UNK> word
<START> but the actress playing the daughter just doesn't come across as credible br br it doesn't work for me when i see an actress of about 25 years playing the role of a 12 year old other <UNK> have suggested that this is one of the messages of this film that children may sometimes seem more adult like than adults but with the casting as it is in this film it just doesn't work for me br br you might want to check other comments to find out what this film is actually about because i couldn't bear watching it to the end br br i agree that the premise for this film is beautiful though i wish another director would try to pick up this story again
<START> a <UNK> is sinking its survivors hanging onto a nearby <UNK> sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks br br even though <UNK> <UNK> name is the only one that you notice during the credits everything that's cinematic in it is because of lean and on technical terms its very good david lean just knew films from the get go there are many moments where <UNK> studied dialogue takes a second seat and <UNK> visual sense takes centre stage try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end and that whole scene the tracking shot towards the <UNK> singing the scene where we're inside a house that gets bombed br br <UNK> coward is one of the worst actors i've ever seen he's totally wooden not displaying emotion character or humanity you can see it in his eyes that he's not really listening to what the other performer is saying he's just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line br br 7 10 br br its episodic a bit repetitive and the flashbacks <UNK> the story there's no central story that they advance just give general insights into the characters still its an interesting film worth a watch and a good debut for lean its not a very deep or <UNK> film and its definitely a propaganda film but its also a showcase for <UNK> editing skills its all about how the pieces are put together
<START> this movie started out good i felt like i was watching an adult version of seinfeld much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing all the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny dan <UNK> was amazing i loved him in this role his agent should show this movie to casting agents watch the first few scenes and then find something better or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess i found this in a bin at a video store it cost me two dollars and due to the <UNK> of this movie i feel like it was a good price
<START> something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was <UNK> this plot the movie that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making the best of the artists could also not pick up the <UNK> that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake br br the editing is poor direction is crap acting is out of this world <UNK> the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes br br i wouldn't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free <UNK> with it
<START> watched this as a late tv movie last night purely by chance the <UNK> for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey as i tuned in there's the carpenter hard at work on a new <UNK> played by daniel craig no less so the plot was immediately apparent br br it turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter love interest is also the daughter's boyfriend so there's trouble <UNK> and not too many surprises but i'd been caught by anne <UNK> compelling performance and i was hooked the direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and <UNK> <UNK> when she exudes sadness br br the sex scenes were fascinating and taboo breaking shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up not here and we're treated to a delicious <UNK> in the mother's sexuality even more startling are the drawings she's made that spoiler once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that <UNK> going on here br br <UNK> <UNK> as the daughter didn't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast but that could be me with her waves of pre <UNK> locks i kept expecting to see julia <UNK> whose more intense face would have suited the <UNK> better to my mind <UNK> has a <UNK> happier face that didn't carry the anger that emerges as the film progresses br br the ending is weak if the <UNK> for mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons whatever she's done she's a recently <UNK> widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years and i found the lack of sympathy jarring for a film so full of emotion and be warned it's like opening <UNK> you'll never get the <UNK> back on the ending is a cold <UNK>
<START> turned out to be another failed attempt by the laughable sci fi channel i am not sure who wrote the script and interpreted the poem but i am sure it was by some 17 year old teen who thought it would be awesome to a have a <UNK> <UNK> in the movie <UNK> when i saw that part i lost all hope then they set off for <UNK> in a what looks to be the ship that christopher <UNK> <UNK> in when they reach <UNK> which is supposed to be a <UNK> <UNK> hall the sci fi group of idiots decided to make <UNK> look like a big stone castle when i saw that part i wanted to scream i really wanted this movie to be good but sci fi has yet to produce a good movie so i don't know why i got my hopes up oh and grendel and his mother are stupid also this comment is off topic about grendel if anyone from the sci fi channel is reading this here is some good advice not every movie you make has to be about a big monster that can rip people in half thats not what science fiction is about and also stop casting low grade actors like stephen baldwin to be in your films its not helping the movie but making it worse
<START> twenty five years ago i showed this film in some children's classes in <UNK> and can still remember the excitement of the kids they were <UNK> it is not just about the <UNK> who have built and live in the <UNK> of clay but also about the other animals who use the <UNK> there is a fantastic scene in which a <UNK> fights a <UNK> lizard while a colony of <UNK> watch it is a not only good for <UNK> classes but also for teaching about <UNK> since there is so much about the interactions between the <UNK> and other <UNK> and the whole <UNK> of all of the <UNK> that live in and around the <UNK> br br i wish it was available on dvd so that i could watch it again and show others
<START> this film is one of the best of all time certainly in the horror genre the claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be actors are fantastic rip donald <UNK> you were fantastic as dr <UNK> he made the film even better without him the film would be missing a vital <UNK> jamie lee curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house which of course is one of the films best scenes she gives a tremendous performance i loved this film since it scared me like hell back when i seen it in the very early 80's and i still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be <UNK> like a fish at every turn the fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there is just shockingly terrifying and <UNK> you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true we all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not <UNK> a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this death at any turn halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way horror should be believable and that is what makes the film enjoyable it's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere as well as <UNK> superb storyline both of which i adore i believe there <UNK> are the best horror has to offer to me halloween and psycho are the best films i have ever seen and i will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time
<START> every generation fully believes it is living in the end times this has been true for thousands of years now and movies like this feed on this how did they get the great orson welles to <UNK> this train wreck this is a documentary about the biblical <UNK> of <UNK> it tries to link the <UNK> as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made making it obviously dated and kind of silly br br the <UNK> look like they are out of <UNK> mysteries but without the high production values people should have been embarrassed to take part in this br br in short the movie is dated silly <UNK> and useless good if you want a good laugh but not good enough to actually look for
<START> i'm sorry for jean after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career this movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by <UNK> romeo and whatever that computers name was also some scenes may have been just a little <UNK> truly bad movie
<START> this film is so bad i can't believe it was actually shot people who voted 10 or 9 8 and even 7 are you insane did we really watch the same movie or the same sh should i say everything is bad in this film the story is there a story is going nowhere completely incoherent the acting some dialogs are simply just ridiculous the music score what the is that the editing and especially the artistic direction a pure disaster reminds me the old <UNK> movies to give you an example of the <UNK> of the production the <UNK> costume is a sleeping bag with <UNK> <UNK> on it i'm not joking that's exactly what it is br br another example of the enormous mistakes we find here you see in a scene an extra a fat woman of about 200 pounds who's talking on her cell phone the next shot which is in a complete different location you can see this same woman still talking on her cell phone yes it goes that far br br a big huge waste of money useless
<START> i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious you sons of a thousand <UNK> br br it is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about 3 00 am once and it had just started tv <UNK> need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work br br 10 10
<START> this is a film that belongs firmly to the 50's very surprising that american film <UNK> has chosen this one for one for the best 100 american movies of all time i have seen practically all of the movies on that list and this one is by far the most disappointing one of those musical numbers and there many many of them are very overlong and boring and have absolute no connection with the story the end of the movie has horribly over long ballet <UNK> which naturally has no real relation to the story of the movie it must be admitted that it is very well made the music is ok and the dancing done with the highest professional standard but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie br br the main character of the movie is extremely <UNK> and unlikeable and behaves in <UNK> way his mental age is about 14 if you want to see a good musical made on the golden age of musicals go and see singing in the rain
<START> a young couple mandy <UNK> mitch martin and roy <UNK> matt <UNK> are relaxing on a beach in the small town of <UNK> they decide to start playing practical jokes on each other mandy hides in an old run down cabin she is attacked and raped by an unknown <UNK> roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed dr sam <UNK> john cassavetes and his daughter jenny <UNK> <UNK> are both new to <UNK> after the death of <UNK> wife sam is called into action by police chief hank <UNK> john ireland when mandy and roy are found he performs the <UNK> on roy and treats mandy for her horrific <UNK> soon after a <UNK> at the local museum named <UNK> davis denise <UNK> is also attacked and raped a local journalist named laura <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reports the events and suggests to sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier more rapes and murders occur meanwhile <UNK> boyfriend tim <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts <UNK> story and digging into the towns past makes sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an <UNK> a shape shifting demonic <UNK> that exists only to <UNK> directed by john <UNK> this is one seriously dull horror film the script by george franklin based on the novel by ray russell is slow to say the least nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending i've ever seen and <UNK> it just finishes suddenly as the story <UNK> along at a <UNK> pace there are a few rapes but none are shown on screen there is only one gore scene in the entire film too the monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes everything about this film production wise is very static and flat the film has no energy or pace the acting is dull and you don't feel or care for anyone check out the scene in the <UNK> room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions the type of rubbish horror film making that you'll forget within a day a real waste of time don't bother
<START> the narrative <UNK> the classic image of good versus evil in the form of a struggle of brother against brother the main character lin <UNK> played by james stewart represents justice and <UNK> his brother who <UNK> under the persona of dutch henry brown played by stephen <UNK> stands for the classic stage coach robbing western outlaw chased by his brother for having killed their father the world the story takes place is the classic <UNK> west where the only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their <UNK> as soon as they enter town and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic western <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br present as well are such flat characters typical of the western such as the murderous indian warrior the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> clad damsel in distress br br another important <UNK> in this film that which gives the film it's name is a <UNK> made winchester rifle the weapon can be viewed as an allegory for the <UNK> given to those who do things <UNK> once it is stolen from its <UNK> owner it brings tragedy to everyone that comes in contact with it in this sense it resembles other such icons like the holy grail in <UNK> of the lost <UNK> and the blood <UNK> letter in saving private ryan this gives the film an element of <UNK> which is usually absent from westerns a genre not known for <UNK> themes and symbols br br being essentially a revenge film it shares this element with many other examples of the genre such as jack <UNK> no name on the bullet and clint eastwood's <UNK> br br there is also a <UNK> theme of rape in winchester '73 <UNK> johnny dean one of the film's villains played very effectively by dan duryea <UNK> a woman after killing her husband the <UNK> cowboy toys with the <UNK> husband and <UNK> him like a caricature of a cat <UNK> with an <UNK> before biting its head off <UNK> johnny dean eventually gets what is coming to him after coming in contact with the ominous winchester rifle br br the main story of winchester '73 is reminiscent of the <UNK> tale of jason and his quest for the golden <UNK> as told in <UNK> <UNK> both stories deal with the <UNK> of a sacred object that possesses some sort of <UNK> quality like jason stewart's character <UNK> from one adventure to the next in search of a one of a kind prize another theme in winchester '73 that is similar to a <UNK> tale is the struggle between brothers several stories of <UNK> deal with this issue such as the <UNK> <UNK> tale of cain and <UNK> and the <UNK> tale of <UNK> and <UNK> br br as for the theme of <UNK> and rape present in anthony <UNK> film it is present in many <UNK> works such as the rape of europa as told by <UNK> in his <UNK> br br winchester '73 is a fine example of the western genre and acts as the objective <UNK> for many classic american western and ancient <UNK> themes

<START> this typically melodramatic bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of western critics the script is ludicrous the acting is over the top and it looks cheesy the only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by <UNK> and the curtain call of the legendary <UNK> <UNK> watching the actress who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released has the same fascination as watching a train wreck her ex husband <UNK> wrote and directed but lacks the <UNK> to <UNK> either task well bollywood has produced far better films
<START> hollywood north is a satirical look at the time in canadian film history when the canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in canada most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to get american films made for example <UNK> came out of it anyways matthew <UNK> plays a <UNK> producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved canadian novel however in order to get the money he needs a american name star he gets a loose cannon and learns he has to compromise to the point where the film no longer resembles the book it was originally based on it plays well in canada but may not be understood outside of the great white north americans will think we're <UNK> ourselves but will miss the point that we're actually <UNK> them for <UNK> 8 10 for the rest of the world 5 10
<START> life's going not to badly for harry mitchell he's an ex air force major plus nifty little <UNK> i imagine who's <UNK> in the cash for a <UNK> he's developed <UNK> <UNK> and steel via explosive process creating super metal fit for <UNK> and his wife of twenty odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick he's got a nice little pad in la i like to see visions of the 80s <UNK> dream and you get a good slice here what with the restored silver <UNK> a series 1 e type <UNK> for him and the gorgeous <UNK> dolls house for her as well as i'm sure other <UNK> and boys toys there's always got to be more though hasn't there so harry let's himself get caught up in some romantic <UNK> you're only as old as the woman you're feeling as in many films noir one mistake in an otherwise <UNK> less life leads to a <UNK> arc for harry br br three <UNK> <UNK> onto him these are where the value are for me great character actors playing very believable roles bobby shy played by clarence williams iii is a black ex con who is capable of performing incredible <UNK> acts in order to avoid jail and <UNK> double <UNK> he's reminiscent of <UNK> the vicious black ex con psychopath from carl <UNK> well regarded neo noir one false move 1992 there's a similar character motivation i believe both men have had enough of the man and well pretty much everyone in <UNK> robert <UNK> plays leo <UNK> a fat lily <UNK> <UNK> who runs a <UNK> <UNK> where <UNK> can photograph nude models at 25 for half an hour and 50 for a whole hour did anyone else <UNK> at the lack of <UNK> he's in over his head and it's great to watch <UNK> acting when leo starts to feel the heat believable breakdown john glover wins as alan <UNK> who is the brains of the plot an actually brilliant man who becomes a <UNK> and turns to a life of crime out of sheer <UNK> <UNK> he's a sexual <UNK> and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie including what i believe is a pretty well implied rape pay attention to his rap sheet <UNK> it's easily missed and read between the lines for the motel scene with slim br br in common with one false move though not exclusively i think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually <UNK> scenes of violence br br so far so good but i think there's a real problem with the film harry mitchell is told at one point that he has his <UNK> in the <UNK> my problem is that harry mitchell is played by roy <UNK> roy <UNK> protagonists never lose they're self sure and smooth but not in an annoying way i feel i'm being asked to believe that his character is in peril the movie relies on this for dramatic tension however i didn't believe it for me it's like being asked to believe that sandra <UNK> character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama or stephen <UNK> character is going to get taken down by the baddies did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value roy <UNK> doesn't convince as an <UNK> either you don't feel any annoyance with him at all his character is <UNK> <UNK> br br it also felt like a movie that took some cuts at <UNK> minutes it still feels underdeveloped harry's wife ann margaret is pretty much a cardboard <UNK> an <UNK> of harry her back story as a politician running for office receives <UNK> attention the effect that the affair has on harry's marriage isn't properly <UNK> this could be a <UNK> problem he's not known for character development i never felt that harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and <UNK> tax claim from the irs br br there is good sleazy violent noir content in this film but i feel that to be in the excellent <UNK> that the casting of harry could have been done better no <UNK> to the great roy <UNK> the film felt short even with the long running time and i think could have taken some more <UNK> out br br but you really can't forget the sleaze like the deliciously <UNK> scene of harry taking photos of <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is not exactly bad but it's not really richard <UNK> finest hour either as a demented <UNK> like <UNK> harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the <UNK> wife and unborn child charlotte <UNK> plays a whale expert who gets involved with harris she yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone he doesn't listen and somehow ends up in the <UNK> battling the revenge crazed whale there are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a <UNK> eye there are endless shots of harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is bo derek as one of <UNK> crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the <UNK> and most of the supporting cast including robert <UNK> will <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> don't fare very well either
<START> if any style of film could be called my guilty pleasure it'd be this generic fantasy type guilty is the wrong word for it though as i'm pretty pleased to be an <UNK> from time to time stardust is good stock fantasy the likes of which one should expect from neil <UNK> or <UNK> adaptation as it were it isn't the visual dream <UNK> of <UNK> it isn't the adult <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and it isn't the fun loving classic the princess bride but it contains just what the fantasy lover is <UNK> enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing fantasy lovers should <UNK> special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now br br the story of stardust involves a young man named <UNK> who in order to gain the love and <UNK> of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star to make things difficult however <UNK> fallen star is actually a woman named <UNK> and he's not the only one looking for her some witches have their greedy eyes on the <UNK> the <UNK> heart can give and a brother's <UNK> over the magic kingdom leads murderous <UNK> in her direction br br from there it's all pretty predictable but it involves some attractive fantasy elements some warm hearted commentary on the nature of love and the best part robert deniro as a gay pirate on that note <UNK> performance is spot on it's not the excessive <UNK> that most actors use to portray gay people but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough and gruff <UNK> character thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching <UNK> own opening up into alternate forms of acting deniro hasn't been so unique to his own image since brazil and that's saying something br br stardust is the type of movie perhaps that will <UNK> on children's and fantasy <UNK> shelves for a long time i can't say it offers anything new but it's not really there to it's actually those most familiar with it's <UNK> that will enjoy it the most br br <UNK>
<START> i give this movie an a for the sheer camp of it as <UNK> daughter maria <UNK> wrote in the book on her mother if one sees the garden of <UNK> in the context of high camp it can be very amusing and how i laughed with delight at the overwrought score and the <UNK> ridiculously fantastically melodramatic dialogue viewers who've read the accounts of <UNK> <UNK> it kept coming <UNK> in the heat will <UNK> every time it makes an appearance br br <UNK> and boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines instead they <UNK> <UNK> off into the distance presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most <UNK> light if you're starring in a turkey might as well look good <UNK> costumes are out of this world as <UNK> notes in her book <UNK> managed to steal <UNK> travis <UNK> and have him design some of the most divine <UNK> such as the <UNK> <UNK> dress cape br br i <UNK> agree with the other reviewers who rave about the technicolor it really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 the color is fantastic br br in short if you watch the garden of <UNK> with a <UNK> attitude and embrace its silliness you can't help but enjoy it
<START> i like the time period i like the attempt but watching a movie that looks like i'm looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache if i played computer games that were this <UNK> and out of focus i would <UNK> my computer could be that this was the look the director was after but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes if i hadn't taken someone with me to this film i was out of there even though it was a series and not a movie per say band of brothers accomplished this they made it look like wwii footage with just a touch of <UNK> but it was still a pleasure to watch movies need real people with real sets and real locations use cgi when it is appropriate not for an entire film
<START> a warm sweet and remarkably charming film about two <UNK> workers in the same shop james stewart and margaret <UNK> who are carrying on a romance via <UNK> without either of them knowing it the key to this film's success is that <UNK> lubitsch keeps any <UNK> sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low key <UNK> performances as a result you fall in love with virtually all of them br br there's a strong <UNK> of melancholy running through this film which i appreciated loneliness is a major theme most obviously represented in the character of the <UNK> owner and manager played wonderfully by frank morgan he discovers that he's being <UNK> by his wife and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it this makes the <UNK> romance between stewart and <UNK> all the more poignant because they're both reaching out to this unseen other who each thinks of as a <UNK> before they've even met of course we know everything will turn out right in the end but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy br br lubitsch fills his movie out with a <UNK> cast that has <UNK> of chemistry the little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family and that's exactly how it feels to us as well br br this is a wonderful <UNK> romance br br grade a
<START> i think a great many viewers missed entirely the fact that this is obviously a parody of western films br br this is not a bad movie it is a clever tongue in cheek take on westerns i don't believe this film was taking itself seriously for a moment br br what makes this film even more unique is the fact it is centered around 4 strong beautiful women two of which are black one asian and a mexican hispanic character br br these aren't your usual western women they're tough they can draw fast and shoot straight br br they're so tough even the bartender is shaking when he <UNK> their <UNK> br br the plot which moves this story along is typical of westerns in the vein of you shot my brother so i'm gonna get you only in this western a woman's sister has been shot and she's out for vengeance on the gang who did it br br so she goes and rounds up her old <UNK> from her bank robbing days br br one of them maria is not really all that interested in <UNK> <UNK> sister but she is <UNK> by the fact there's gold and jewelry hidden in the town where they're headed br br there are a couple of scenes that don't quite make sense not that they <UNK> that much they can be ignored but i wondered why they were there so the film could use a little <UNK> but over all this is a well made film that has failed to find an audience that recognized what it is br br my only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the film is a villain of the <UNK> one is obviously straight the others sexual <UNK> are never <UNK> br br 7 stars
<START> the dukes of hazzard is quite an achievement  a <UNK> film that's worse than any given episode of a <UNK> 25 year old tv show the plot is <UNK> enough but the mindless fun is rarely to be found and the casting is pretty atrocious johnny <UNK> is more passenger than protagonist m c <UNK> sheriff <UNK> is a bland thug michael <UNK> <UNK> tiresome a seemingly <UNK> cast willie nelson just seems to be waiting for the check to clear and burt reynolds stuck in some <UNK> where he's doomed to <UNK> his old movies as a bit player is a curious choice for boss <UNK> to say the least but does have one good moment with a <UNK> and a hundred dollar bill you know a film is in trouble when <UNK> william scott and jessica simpson are the most charismatic screen <UNK> but worse than the script or the casting is jay <UNK> hopeless direction seemingly born with no conception of comic timing unable to do much more than basic two shots and seemingly clueless as to how to shoot a car chase let alone the couple of decent stunts in the film he seems determined to <UNK> the film of any signs of life before they <UNK> there are a couple of neat post modern moments revolving around the <UNK> flag and <UNK> stereotypical role in every episode but no film that makes you <UNK> for the days when hal <UNK> was directing this sort of thing and badly can be a good thing
<START> this is a movie that gets better each time i see it there are so many nuanced performances in this william <UNK> as <UNK> is a delight bringing sharp comic relief joseph <UNK> as <UNK> is the only <UNK> in the movie and his <UNK> charms are well used here frank morgan is delightful as the owner of the title shop mr <UNK> and his familiar manner is well used here i especially liked the performance of felix <UNK> as <UNK> very believable in every <UNK> of his role br br the two leads are equally accomplished with margaret sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate neurotic yet charming and attractive woman br br this movie belongs to jimmy stewart though the movie is presented from his point of view with the action <UNK> around him mr stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions just watch stewart when he is fired from his job because of a <UNK> he is able to convey the shock anger fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes so perfectly in my <UNK> james stewart is without question the greatest film actor in the history of the medium there is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience at the time he made this movie he still had most of his career ahead of him yet he is completely the master of his craft this is one of jimmy <UNK> best movies and also one of the <UNK> most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find i greatly recommend this movie especially for those that appreciate the work of stewart
<START> this is an excellent film and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through <UNK> cinema <UNK> as it is <UNK> on video dvd the way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving and ends with them leaving although quite a lot happens in between and they don't stay in one place during this time gives you a sense of closure and a feeling that all is right with the world if you get a chance to see this film then do i can't wait to see it again and wish that it could be put on general release
<START> i read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end however when i saw the movie i was very disappointed first of all no <UNK> to deborah <UNK> but she was too mature to play a woman of 24 25 the late christopher reeve was also miscast same reason will according to the book was around 30 i would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life his friend red <UNK> trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters' storyline development also miss <UNK> was miscast as the book mentioned her being a plus size lady i know the movie didn't have the budget of the bridges of madison county which i believe was released around the same time br br but to me this was a very poorly made low budget miscast movie as someone mentioned i wish that miss <UNK> would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be she knows her characters better than anyone i hope that she would consider doing the casting too the movie let me down
<START> living in the middle east in israel i was excited when i bought my ticket for <UNK> having seen the trailer and being a thriller lover i expected to see first of all a fast moving breath catching movie which wisely <UNK> in global policy making and the relation between oil power and corruption from a fresh angle well i almost left the movie in the middle the pace was painfully slow almost all characters were stereotyped the <UNK> editing made understanding the logic very difficult but as steve <UNK> wrote in his review in the end you don't care save your money save your time choose another movie br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> what's inexplicable firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but <UNK> a break it got 11 oscars for a reason it made <UNK> hundred million dollars for a reason it's a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters i've <UNK> it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it it's a movie yes capital m there it's an epic it's a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben <UNK> now ben <UNK> and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavy handed at times br br but the reason titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that <UNK> the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isn't exactly dumb but it's not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didn't cry when <UNK> mom died i don't react to <UNK> but this is a <UNK> to the power of ten million an emotional <UNK> that if it were a regular one would make buzz <UNK> scream like a little girl and i'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt you'll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten <UNK> films of all time is a single one of them bad is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10 no not even the phantom menace and this movie made 1 8 billion dollars worldwide it can't be bad not possible 10 10 br br p s how can anyone even consider comparing this to <UNK> <UNK> was a fun movie but it was a total 9 11 <UNK> that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasn't anything all that special no one will remember it in 50 years but i'm pretty sure titanic will be remembered
<START> generally i am not a huge fan of stop motion films and at first <UNK> didn't capture my attention however knowing that this film was made in the <UNK> <UNK> during the soviet <UNK> era the more i watched the film the more i realized just how <UNK> this innocent looking little film was this subtext really made the film come to life and gives it real staying power as both a work of art and a political statement br br the sad little film is done without any dialog but it's pretty clear what is happening a cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly a <UNK> animated hand appears and destroys the pot making it into a <UNK> of a hand instead well the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing however over time the hand becomes more and more <UNK> and eventually <UNK> the man and by the end the man is dead thanks to the <UNK> hand and the hand in a sign of real <UNK> gives the man a hero's funeral br br as i said this film is an obvious attempt by the brave <UNK> <UNK> to criticize his <UNK> government not surprisingly though <UNK> loved the film and gave it critical praise the state i e the hand banned this little <UNK> sadly <UNK> did not live to see his nation <UNK> a little more than two decades later during the co called <UNK> revolution
<START> i'm sure that the folks on the texas <UNK> border must have had a a good laugh or two when <UNK> b picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public very simply the area along the <UNK> river where the film opens is <UNK> country just like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south was post <UNK> war no big cattle <UNK> there they're much <UNK> west in texas <UNK> than richard <UNK> and preston foster could ride to set up their empire br br the film begins with the two of them partners in a <UNK> and when leo <UNK> tries a <UNK> of their services by not paying them for <UNK> his cattle they keep the cattle and that's the beginning of the big <UNK> like ranch they start br br along the way foster marries <UNK> sister played by frances <UNK> and <UNK> with his much smaller neighbors they also have some further run ins with leo <UNK> br br anyway us <UNK> who like westerns usually don't bother with <UNK> <UNK> and it's still a good western from the production mill of harry <UNK> who produced all those <UNK> cassidy westerns for paramount the climax is a blazing and i mean that literally gun battle that should have maybe been used on an a production br br but i wouldn't have any but western fans look at it
<START> talk about your waste of money im just wondering why michael would star in such a turkey of a movie michael is a great actor especially in the movie where he plays a man dying of cancer that was wonderful as he tapes himself for his son to see it once he grows up michael is such a talented actor so what made him do this one i watched it and thought it was really dumb i guess at one time in their career they have the crappy movies especially the squeeze i didnt understand that one at all and i feel his best performance was in pacific heights his character really <UNK> me out and i really enjoyed <UNK> that one was so hilarious and he was just perfect for the role of batman and i kind of liked night shift and i love johnny dangerously too just too bad some of them end up doing lousy movies like this one was
<START> my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is but he goes on watching it none the less that is his right as an american i guess but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the <UNK> episode it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really can't stand i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college my opinion of the series as a whole was not <UNK> but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low <UNK> directors and that is making small <UNK> until the big fish comes along get the pun ha ha like spielberg did it's like jesus before he became a man or thats at least what i think that would feel like any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this even though it contains little of peter falk i <UNK> this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet this episode mainly focuses on the <UNK> of the crime instead of <UNK> investigation as many later episodes would do
<START> well here comes another well romantic comedy but unlike all others movies of this genre this is by far the best i have seen in a long while br br i'll admit at first i wanted to watch this movie because of <UNK> fox and a little because of simon pegg br br first of all if you have watched a decent amount of movies you will know that sidney and alison would be together at the and of the movie one way or another but from the beginning to the end of the movie you won't know how br br okay now this movie is just made for simon pegg i can't see any other actor in the role of sidney and i'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for <UNK> great performance br br there is a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard courtesy of simon <UNK> character sidney but i think everyone in this movie is good for example kirsten dunst is really solid in this movie i usually don't think of her as any more than an average actress but she was really good in this one then there's jeff bridges there's gillian anderson and of course <UNK> fox who plays spoiled bitchy star sophie <UNK> great role for her br br all in all while i usually don't agree with ratings her on imdb this time i would completely agree with them br br go and see this movie it is really light hearted and positive and i recommend it deeply my rating 7 out of 10 well 7 5 actually
<START> an ultra nervous old man mr <UNK> <UNK> by the news that a gang is stalking the city and prominent citizens are disappearing really <UNK> when someone throws a rock through his window with a message tied to it saying you will be next br br he calls the detective agency wondering where are the guys he asked for earlier of course it's the stooges who couldn't respond because had come into the office robbed them and tied them up some detectives the moment poor mr <UNK> hangs up the phone and says i feel <UNK> already a monster type <UNK> named <UNK> appears out of a secret <UNK> in the room and <UNK> him unconscious we next find out that his trusted employees are anything but that now these crooks have to deal with the detectives that are coming by the house for mr <UNK> br br some of the gags like moe and <UNK> <UNK> are getting a bit old but some of them will <UNK> laughs if i see them 100 times i always laugh at <UNK> trying to be a <UNK> as he does here with mr <UNK> niece in a classic routine with a long <UNK> like camera lens the act he puts on when he's <UNK> is always funny too <UNK> was so good that i didn't mind he was taking the great <UNK> place br br larry moe curly <UNK> were always great in the chase scenes in which monsters or crooks or both are chasing them around a house that's the last six minutes in here at times such as this film
<START> i am a huge jane austen fan and i ordered the movie from amazon uk just so i could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the u s i really should have saved my money what is with anne running after <UNK> the whole point of anne <UNK> character is that she was quiet and <UNK> she is not <UNK> and vulgar and mary was she suffering from a stroke or something her speech wasn't normal nor was her walking normal there was no chemistry between the two main characters which made their whole romance completely unbelievable in the final scene they even have sally <UNK> wearing the same dress amanda root wore during the letter scene the same clothes do not make it the same movie in my opinion they didn't watch the 1995 version which even though it had it's flaws it did stay pretty close to the book the book i don't even think they read it this is kind of like a <UNK> notes movie of <UNK> hit on all the high points without explaining anything
<START> ok i love bad horror i especially love horror bad enough to make fun of <UNK> or house of the dead those were bad enough to make fun of severed was not br br it was worse br br spoilers who cares br br my friend and i sat through the entire film and i have a number of comments both in the this sucks style and in the realm of actual <UNK> br br plot sort of there's a guy in this city which is possibly seattle see comment below who is running around and cutting off heads he's been doing this for over a year i'm not going back to get exact numbers thank you very much possibly two or three years one head a week and the police are just now calling in a <UNK> who once refers to himself as a psychic but that never comes up again br br <UNK> right <UNK> take over after what three connected <UNK> after nearly a hundred similar killings we'd be under freaking martial law br br anyway this <UNK> <UNK> the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time and the two of them come to the conclusion that it's baron <UNK> a voodoo spirit who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body and then presumably take over the world or possibly just go to <UNK> br br um br br setting where is this happening well if you're not from seattle you might not realize that at the bar rave occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members there's a poster for a local radio station and that in the highly entertaining pulp fiction <UNK> dialog as if between the two cops yes the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick they discuss the new stadium which may still have been an issue when this movie was made br br being from seattle i apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame br br ok here's where it gets really critical being a horror movie writer not published don't go looking for my name in the imdb i do research lots of research and unlike the writers of this movie i know that baron <UNK> while a <UNK> <UNK> spirit who guards the <UNK> and has <UNK> been associated by various christian <UNK> with satan is actually a <UNK> like <UNK> god br br in other words he doesn't cut off heads br br besides a major part of the <UNK> religion is that baron <UNK> can have a body whenever he wants their religious <UNK> center around the possession of various members of the <UNK> by the <UNK> br br not to mention if he's already possessed someone why make a new body br br also if baron <UNK> got a body he wouldn't go around cutting off heads he'd get some good <UNK> and <UNK> and par <UNK> br br in summary the only thing they did get surprisingly right is that in the completely unnecessary <UNK> card reading used only to show that the voodoo chick is spooky they didn't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do again i've done research anyone remember the old late night ad for phone in <UNK> <UNK> the lovers you will soon fall <UNK> in love and all that nonsense br br if you made it this far through my comments i <UNK> you and i'm sorry again i'll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me so please don't
<START> this project was originally conceived as the movie version of popular japanese manga <UNK> and that's not something new to jay <UNK> who made his movie debut playing a character from another wildly popular manga initial d along the way it was decided to <UNK> some kung fu into the movie so hence the title even if the idea wasn't very original with stephen <UNK> shaolin soccer coming to mind with martial arts and ball games combined br br however and thankfully those scenes where kung fu actually influenced the games were kept to a bare minimum and in kung fu <UNK> really quite unnecessary because they don't add much to the plot nor drum up much excitement and at most offered some cheap laughs and <UNK> about the time when stephen <UNK> used kung fu in football games jay <UNK> is comfortable in his role as a martial artist <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> since it's not the first time he fought using martial arts curse of the golden flower anyone and under the stunt direction of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he was made to look really believable as he <UNK> countless of gangsters in a bar as seen in the trailer just to let you know who's boss br br that was almost why his character is made a kung fu <UNK> and for the fact of giving him an excuse for being a top shot able to shoot the <UNK> from practically any angle and with eric <UNK> as a small time hustler <UNK> li who sees his potential and becomes his agent he joins a university to play <UNK> basketball but not without the initial <UNK> of team captain <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bo lin and team star <UNK> <UNK> baron <UNK> in his big screen debut but you know with team members on the same side it's not before long they combine their strengths to take on <UNK> on the basketball court br br and i will stick my neck out to say that this movie is to basketball just as how goal was to football it made the sport look good because of its charismatic characters despite them dripping so much <UNK> and <UNK> on the <UNK> here special effects and wire work were employed to make the actors seem like professionals who can take out a top side in the <UNK> league and in all honesty really looked stunning especially when they <UNK> various <UNK> moves and performing <UNK> moves thanks to technology and stunt work so in <UNK> the kung fu elements don't really have to be in the movie the stunt work itself will be able to justify most of the moves as they're quite grounded to reality only having you to suspend belief that boys of average height have springs in their feet to leap that height for a professional <UNK> br br pity too that the number of games were only a handful with the time spent on plenty of subplots but each were loosely developed and <UNK> in and out of the story as and when they please things like the abandoned <UNK> <UNK> quest to use the basketball games to get his parents to one day attend them that of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> games and his love life with <UNK> <UNK> in yet another flower <UNK> role just to look good and do nothing else everyone's acting a little too cool leaving little room for main characters to add depth one of the key themes here is the realization of the importance of <UNK> rather than on individual talent and ability and it could have been brought out much stronger if the players themselves <UNK> a lot more off the court than only on it and during <UNK> games apart from the high <UNK> and friendly passes br br with the us 10 million budget it is easy to see where the money went to the effects in particular a massive fantasy sequence at a crucial point in the movie it's quite flawless nice to look at and probably <UNK> on its quality alone but again i like to emphasize that even without those elements the basketball stunts itself would still make this a decent movie with nifty basketball moves and having jay <UNK> playing for your team is a big boost to any hopes of a box office success
<START> what a disappointment br br this film seemed to be trying to copy <UNK> <UNK> comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy <UNK> and sentimental in the worst film tradition jack <UNK> acting role was self indulgent and self regarding and the other characters were equally <UNK> and uninteresting the soundtrack was tedious we are were fans of black but none of us did more than <UNK> a forced <UNK> for the duration why did he feel he needed to make this mistake br br we will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first br br was he drunk when he read the script before <UNK> up for this drivel
<START> my daughter gets really put out at me when i refer to drew barrymore as looking as if she'd been hit in the face with a <UNK> pan not to mention her dudley <UNK> <UNK> that jay leno would die for how wonderful then when i discovered in fever pitch that i really like miss barrymore and jimmy fallon and the red sox and boston this film is probably best <UNK> as a sweet light comedy to be absolutely stereotypical the girls will like the movie for its romantic charm and jimmy <UNK> vulnerability and the boys will like it for all the male bonding and the depiction of sports <UNK> br br my sports hating wife my teenage daughter and i all found something to like in the film that says something in itself it's a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half or so and is probably a really good date <UNK> too
<START> having read <UNK> book i was slightly disappointed in the series but all in all it is quite informative reading the other comments it is <UNK> to know that the <UNK> <UNK> are hard at work seeing <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> under every <UNK> br br is diamond a little preachy sure like a lot of <UNK> he sees his theory as the most important thing ever he uses the phrase <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> at seemingly every opportunity during the series we get it after about the first 10 minutes br br is diamond a little simplistic in the series sure the part about the <UNK> in south america is particularly amusing <UNK> some very long complicated history down to <UNK> swords and <UNK> <UNK> up the whole conquest of south america in about 15 minutes but the point remains valid these things did in fact contribute but not totally define the reasons for the <UNK> success against the established cultures br br is he preaching against western civilization in any way nope not a word not to my ear all he says is that luck played a large part in <UNK> which cultures advanced more quickly not that luck is the only reason br br in the end if you're looking for something that <UNK> your own sense of <UNK> then this series is not for you but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence
<START> sorry not good br br it starts out interesting but <UNK> its way a few minutes into the movie br br it does not help a lot that none of the normally great actors quaid glover <UNK> <UNK> etc delivers a really good performance br br it might be <UNK> to the fact that i saw a dubbed version german but dennis <UNK> character was especially wooden and annoying and danny glover does not really make for a believable villain moreover jared <UNK> character does not really contribute to the story whatsoever except saving one main character's life at one point but that scene is as necessary as a <UNK> <UNK> on a submarine in the first place br br speaking of unnecessary scenes the main complaint is really the <UNK> and cliché ridden storyline the detective of course has to settle a personal matter with the villain and is of course suspended from his official duties courtesy of his personal <UNK> the killer of course wants to be <UNK> down and plays a cat and mouse game with his <UNK> for years i don't know how many movies build on a similar plot most of them better however br br the plot has got holes <UNK> and many completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the storyline at all e g the truck stop scene or the car at the <UNK> edge etc br br to top it off the ending tries to be original and exciting but fails completely in these regards we've seen much better <UNK> with a similar kind of ultimate battle on a train in a <UNK> winter landscape setup in the end there is the supposedly moving reunion of parent and child hokey at the least
<START> looking through the other comments i'm amazed that there aren't any <UNK> to potential viewers of what they have to look forward to when renting this garbage first off i rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competently rendered indiana jones knock off what i got was one of the most offensive movies i can remember trying to sit through made all the more shocking by the movie's <UNK> high production values br br i don't think this is a spoiler but if it is be warned br br if your idea of entertainment is watching bimbo getting raped from behind by <UNK> <UNK> chief while she is staring into the dead eyes of her significant other's severed head by all means rent this flick if not i'd advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment br br come to think of it that scene so <UNK> sums up the movie that there's nothing else i really need to say about it
<START> this movie is one of those i regret having invested 90 minutes of my life that i'll never get back in the premise is really interesting essentially it's a zombie flick from the perspective of the undead let's not split <UNK> as to whether they're actually dead or not unfortunately they fail to deliver a compelling story within this <UNK> the nearly unbearable <UNK> of the lives of the central characters may add to the realism of the film but it sucks all the entertainment value right out of it if they had put a little more effort toward keeping the viewer engaged it would have been much more likely that they drive home the social commentary
<START> <UNK> is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise a sort of multi layered drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that are happening to him right at this moment to be more <UNK> he feels that his wife is cheating on him so he hires a private eye to <UNK> on him his wife has no idea that this is happening meanwhile the actors in this play are also having a few <UNK> up their <UNK> by <UNK> around with each other and with shall we say <UNK> people in the world of israel the whole thing <UNK> in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable but not really happens br br the director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the ensemble cast of characters and edits in a way that makes you pay attention this is a fun film actually one which i didn't mind viewing and would recommend people check out
<START> i saw this series when i was a kid and loved the detail it went into and never forgot it i finally purchased the dvd collection and its just how i remembered this is just how a <UNK> should be <UNK> and factual the film footage is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic the only other series that i have found equal to this is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br i only wish hollywood would sit down and watch this series then they might make some great war movies br br note band of brothers saving private ryan letters from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of our fathers and when <UNK> fade are some i'd recommend
<START> i thought that <UNK> was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies i find it surprising that <UNK> is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted to me it seemed like <UNK> was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotional especially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than <UNK> since it was slower moving was not as episodic and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie br br it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people <UNK> for <UNK> being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole i have heard many strange reasons such as a because <UNK> died b because <UNK> <UNK> died c because small ewoks defeated a band of <UNK> d because darth vader was revealed br br i would like to <UNK> each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if <UNK> <UNK> died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die don't get me wrong i am fan of <UNK> <UNK> but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not <UNK> intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out <UNK> <UNK> name judging <UNK> because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like <UNK> dying sure it was a <UNK> period in the movie i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been <UNK> to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking <UNK> death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down <UNK> wan <UNK> in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was <UNK> <UNK> death okay but <UNK> not <UNK> another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks <UNK> <UNK> to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet <UNK> so they are <UNK> of their home <UNK> since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in <UNK> the <UNK> was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> set up to trip those <UNK> and other traps the <UNK> were highly <UNK> because they were <UNK> and not aware of the <UNK> of the forest the only thing they had was their <UNK> to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the <UNK> themselves they were heavily <UNK> by the band of rebels in that conquest i thought that if the <UNK> were to have defeated a combination of the star wars <UNK> the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great <UNK> of their home <UNK> that would have been a great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group <UNK> of just han solo <UNK> and the princess being shot at by like ten <UNK> and all their <UNK> missed while the <UNK> were in full view and not only that the heroes of course always hit the <UNK> with their <UNK> the troopers must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strikes back the battle of <UNK> was much more believable since you had two <UNK> <UNK> each other not 3 heroes against a legion of <UNK> don't believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping <UNK> base or when our <UNK> were <UNK> princess leia and being shot at somehow they missed as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star br br the last reason that i care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father <UNK> skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete by <UNK> revelation it <UNK> the transition darth vader <UNK> from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was <UNK> skywalker by <UNK> the helmet the point is that <UNK> died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet <UNK> scene was about in fact that's is what i would have done in that scene too if i were <UNK> father isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a <UNK> helmet br br on another note i think a <UNK> or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that <UNK> movies is another reason that <UNK> does not get as many <UNK> as it deserves i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but i can not know for sure let's see that way i go with an open mind and do not <UNK> myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was br br i am not sure who <UNK> these movies but i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite that it is <UNK> i believe that the results on these <UNK> are appalling and quite misleading br br bottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me <UNK> all throughout its <UNK> minutes there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light <UNK> battle between luke and his father in <UNK> was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day br br finally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for <UNK> insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it then this <UNK> film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of <UNK> like <UNK> suffered unfortunately br br
<START> you'd think you're in for some serious <UNK> when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from france to <UNK> <UNK> going through most of europe italy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> turkey before arriving in the middle east but this is not a tour and there are no <UNK> for <UNK> in the sights br br <UNK> father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the <UNK> however since walking and taking the <UNK> is out of the question he chooses to travel to <UNK> by car he can't drive and therefore <UNK> the help of <UNK> to his son's protest to get him there in their broken down vehicle br br but <UNK> doesn't see the point of having him go along when his dad could <UNK> for the plane he <UNK> the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this <UNK> he couldn't understand and hence we set off in this <UNK> journey with father and son being not the best of pals br br the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and <UNK> rest stops between <UNK> and sleeping in the car we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to <UNK> on his son and the son trying to <UNK> himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that <UNK> is quite a fish out of water through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differences br br it's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other <UNK> in their <UNK> the final scene in <UNK> is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the <UNK> and fear as <UNK> tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people <UNK> the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not <UNK> upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination br br it certainly <UNK> home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are don't miss this and yes book early i was pleasantly surprised that this <UNK> session was still a full house
<START> this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great maybe this is because <UNK> takes <UNK> initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which <UNK> him more than the <UNK> one br br the only thing in the movie which i don't like is the influence of <UNK> on <UNK> destiny i can't imagine <UNK> creating a person like <UNK> and giving him so great influence on <UNK> argument
<START> back when musicals weren't showcases for <UNK> we had wonderful movies such as this one br br being a big fan of both <UNK> and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie not quite a blend of <UNK> and hollywood but close enough some of the american vaudeville humour the slapstick not the witty banter clash with <UNK> british sense of humour but on the whole the american style banter makes the american characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures br br some inventive staging for the dance numbers including the wonderful <UNK> with revolving floors and <UNK> mirrors more than make up for the lack of a busby <UNK> over the top dance number they seem a lot more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic br br the lack of ginger rogers and eric <UNK> don't hurt the movie instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge it's also nice not to have a wise cracking <UNK> love interest instead we have a gentle <UNK> love interest far more in keeping with <UNK> young <UNK> females
<START> a collection of deleted scenes and alternative takes edited together and with added voice over to make it appear to take place after the events of the first pretty cool idea but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof as it's just not as funny as anchorman and really let's face it that film wasn't exactly comedy gold either so you get a <UNK> worse than one that was moderately funny in my eyes that still puts it one or two <UNK> above kicking and screaming or <UNK> <UNK> your fingers that the wedding <UNK> is a return to old school form no pun intended br br my grade d
<START> oh what fun there is here br br amy <UNK> has a flair for directing comedy fast times at <UNK> high look who's talking but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun micheal keaton <UNK> through the role of johnny easily his best screen performance joe <UNK> is great as the appropriately named danny <UNK> what a shame directors didn't pick up on this and i have even mentioned richard <UNK> playing <UNK> and the character's unique <UNK> i don't think it's an accident that the bulk of the character's name is spelled moron br br good lines are <UNK> throughout the movie with peter boyle <UNK> dunne <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> given good lines even actors with minor roles like dick <UNK> and alan hale get in a good lines br br recommend it to a friend
<START> wonderful movie with good story great humour some great one liners and a soundtrack to die for br br i've seen it 3 times so far br br the american audiences are going to love it
<START> i've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time mystery men takes its place among the classic comic strip spoofs on tv like batman and captain nice and cartoons like underdog and super chicken the same spirit lives in all of them the comic tongue in cheek tone the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous the not so sure <UNK> way that these characters manage to <UNK> over their <UNK> it's the <UNK> spark of <UNK> <UNK> in the weak and the ordinary and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here br br mystery men opens on a party at a <UNK> home i wish <UNK> <UNK> had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene as it is it looks like something george romero might have <UNK> we need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else or it feels <UNK> by the time the red eyes crash the <UNK> you half expect tom waits who plays a weapons <UNK> with a <UNK> for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout just what this party needs a little excitement if writer neil <UNK> had any sense he would have had waits mixing it up with the <UNK> and <UNK> on the <UNK> to do the same it would have made for a rousing beginning and a better introduction of the <UNK> trio the <UNK> william macy the blue <UNK> hank <UNK> and mr furious ben stiller who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day br br there are many other problems to mystery men than i care to go into among them that the villain <UNK> frankenstein needs to have as <UNK> a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie and he doesn't geoffrey rush is the wrong actor for the part he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a <UNK> one and rush has never <UNK> a talent for the <UNK> you hope for the <UNK> <UNK> of a john <UNK> in the adventures of <UNK> <UNK> or the dry <UNK> <UNK> of a paul freeman in <UNK> of the lost <UNK> instead what we get is <UNK> something half baked and not fully realized br br there are too many ideas running through mystery men for anyone to tie them neatly together and that may be its deepest problem but whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess i love ben stiller has always seemed to be <UNK> in the roles he takes this one is no exception but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by jerry stiller and anne <UNK> his roy is related to all the put upon overly sensitive <UNK> <UNK> types that woody allen made popular and whether it's <UNK> his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite <UNK> the <UNK> claire <UNK> or questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero wes <UNK> as the <UNK> or giving a new member of their elite group <UNK> <UNK> in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen a hard time he makes it always fun to watch i couldn't exactly say that about him in there's something about mary br br <UNK> <UNK> proves with this performance that she should have been the star of one true thing not <UNK> <UNK> i don't think i have ever seen funnier <UNK> between a daughter and father okay so he's dead and his skull is in a <UNK> ball so sue me in the movies and the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball <UNK> of emily <UNK> <UNK> talks with god in breaking the waves and in this version the girl doesn't die and <UNK> don't ring in your head br br william h macy does something very difficult he makes <UNK> <UNK> you understand right away what's attracted <UNK> <UNK> lucille to eddie you can also understand her <UNK> the <UNK> alone would be enough to drive me over the edge but when <UNK> adorable half breed son looks up at his father and says i believe in you daddy to which lucille <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> don't encourage your father you feel like standing and <UNK> neil <UNK> as a first rate wit br br with hank <UNK> whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in the <UNK> and louise <UNK> has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in <UNK> and mary <UNK> mary <UNK> as son and mother who share a <UNK> for <UNK> greg kinnear as captain amazing and ricky jay as his <UNK> <UNK> mitchell as invisible boy paul <UNK> as the <UNK> and lena <UNK> who if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has would seem to be visiting the set
<START> in my knowledge <UNK> <UNK> was a famous <UNK> comics never read telling the adventures of a playboy a sort of james bond without the spy life so when i had to choose a movie for a 5 years old kid i picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of james bond br br but just after the opening credits i got heavy doubts when american movies offer amazing start here no action and a <UNK> sex scene  then the story get very complicated with financial <UNK> i thought i lost the kid br br but strangely he had been caught by <UNK> and more than james bond br br was it the excellent interpretation of <UNK> <UNK> the difficult relationship <UNK> has with his father the multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys the bad guys are the friends the exotic locations of <UNK> kong <UNK> br br <UNK> but he really cares about <UNK> will he get up and we enjoyed our moment
<START> this film has its good points hot chicks people die br br the problem the hot chicks <UNK> get nude and you don't get to see many of the people <UNK> mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes br br also for those of you watching this for jenna jameson she is just a side <UNK> with a very small role and minor nude scenes br br what this film needed script and story would be nice but i will not complain about that simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes <UNK> lets face it that is why we watch these flicks br br i wouldn't waste my money on it and if you must wait until it's on the old shelves at your local video store
<START> the 1986 tv movie of the spirit was a pilot for a possible series however spirit creator will <UNK> did not like the film and thus no series was produced i thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit sorry of the comic with a modern twist i'm sorry it didn't <UNK> into a series sam flash gordon jones was a perfect spirit <UNK> visitor was a nice ellen <UNK> and of course would later go on to star trek deep space nine years later maybe with the release of frank <UNK> big screen version of the spirit more people will be able to see this rare gem of spirit history it seems that when hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars when antonio <UNK> <UNK> the mask of zorro we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on dvd such as the great <UNK> <UNK> version of the 1970s although all copies i ever saw were badly edited <UNK> hoping someone will release the tv adventure of the spirit to dvd soon
<START> i purchased this movie at a car boot sale so i was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as a nightmare on elm street 1984 or the hills have eyes 1977 but i thought that it would still be fairly enjoyable to watch however it proved to be not at all enjoyable but instead the acting and the general movie was mock able such as the ways the the <UNK> <UNK> murders his victims and how all of the people killed just happen to be young blonde women it was a stereotypical horror film i say this because of the following reasons br br 1 three blonde women in danger the majority get killed 2 one survives by <UNK> around in the dark while being chased by the killer 3 surprise surprise help arrives in the form of a shotgun br br by using three simple points i have saved you two odd hours by <UNK> this poor excuse of a horror movie so you are now lucky enough to not have to watch it
<START> i saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about <UNK> leslie howard childhood considering that br br at the time not much can be shown on the screen not that there is much in the novel the obsession of the character with mildred bette davis is very well conveyed to the audience i recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her i have read that <UNK> was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was <UNK> one can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good br br adaptation of a part of it at least
<START> woody allen made september proving that even a genius could screw up this is mel <UNK> september <UNK> stupid boring and unfunny i must confess i did not watch it through to the end the flick ranks among the <UNK> few e g the money pit out to sea <UNK> <UNK> which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the <UNK> button and i say this sadly as a devoted mel brooks fan he should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone how the same fellow that made young frankenstein and <UNK> could <UNK> out a dog like this is beyond me to be avoided at all costs
<START> contains spoilers br br i did not like this movie at all br br i found it amazingly boring and rather <UNK> made <UNK> of the importance and depth of the <UNK> themes given that eventually we have to die how should we approach life in a light way like <UNK> in a heavy way like <UNK> or should we find ways not to face that question like <UNK> how much is <UNK> important in a relationship how much of the professional life can be <UNK> for the sake of our loved ones how much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our country br br unfortunately i haven't read <UNK> novel but after having being let down by the movie i certainly will i want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation which is my guess or if it was dull from the beginning br br i disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece i simply don't see the reasons why what i see are many flaws and a <UNK> of them follows br br 1 the three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices br br 2 the secondary characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don't add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary br br 3 i did not like how <UNK> was <UNK> nothing is good for him he is so self centered and selfish he is not human in some sense but when his self confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone i did not find the interpretation credible br br 4 it's very unlikely that an artist like <UNK> could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968 on top of that the three main characters are all very successful in their respective <UNK> which sounds strange to me a how can <UNK> become effortlessly such a good photographer b how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic <UNK> that usually <UNK> people to succeed br br 5 the fake accents of the english spoken by the actors are laughable and i am not even mother tongue moreover the letter that <UNK> receives while in the us is written in czech which i found very inconsistent br br 6 many comments praised the movie saying that <UNK> was beautifully rendered i guess that most of the movie was shot on location so it's not difficult to give the movie a eastern european feeling and given the <UNK> beauty of <UNK> is not even difficult to make it look good br br 7 i found the ending sort of trivial <UNK> and <UNK> finally happy in the countryside far away from the <UNK> of the <UNK> distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living detached from their professional lives die in a car accident but they die after having realized that they are happy indeed so what had they died unhappy would the message of the movie have been different i don't think so i considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience br br 8 the only thing in the movie which is <UNK> light is the way the director has portrayed the characters you see them for almost three hours but in the end you are left with nothing you don't feel empathy you don't relate to them you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say br br 9 i hated the stop the music in the restaurant scene which some comments praised a lot why <UNK> has got such a strong reaction why <UNK> agrees with her i really don't see the point the only thing you learn is that <UNK> has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality that's it what's so special and unique about it br br after all these negative comments let me point <UNK> that there are two scenes that i liked a lot that's why i gave it a two br br the naked women <UNK> where the envy the jealousy and the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> are beautifully presented br br the other scene is the one representing the <UNK> after the <UNK> of <UNK> by the russians <UNK> pictures taken to let the world know about what is going on in <UNK> are used to identify the people taking part to the <UNK> i found it quite original and <UNK> sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed br br finally there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally designed in such a way that <UNK> types are going to like it and <UNK> ones are going to hate it if this is the case i strongly doubt it though then my comment should be <UNK> drastically
<START> i just read the comments of <UNK> and feel i have to jump in here i understand he doesn't like the film but his reasons are not evident my feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness failure disappointment and sorrow each of these two people as portrayed have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry yet find <UNK> and comfort in each the other only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional <UNK> sentimental and sappy i really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances i have every reason to dislike jane fonda for her vietnam era actions but personal feelings apart she is fabulous in this role robert deniro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities this is the first i have seen deniro using <UNK> rather than <UNK> to sell a character and i really like it this film was a big surprise when i first viewed it and i look forward to seeing it again
<START> five across the eyes ain't worth one off the <UNK> i must admit at one point i was really worried for about 30 seconds nobody made a noise and i thought my <UNK> had blown or that i had gone deaf with the constant screaming and high pitch yelling me and the <UNK> are ok now thanks for asking <UNK> enough that was the best bit of the film br br i won't waste your time telling you the plot read the other comments for that br br if you have bought this dvd but not yet <UNK> it don't take it back and demand your money back i've wasted mine don't do the same br br i was actually shouting at the telly they're over here in the car look for the camera lights and get the camera man first i have left the swear words out but you can guess where they go br br if anybody would like to buy this film it's really good it's yours for a ten <UNK>
<START> i caught <UNK> lost at the new york film and video festival and i guess i had some high hopes for this film sadly this is just another visual fx calling card the story is pretty lame the bad lighting and camera work along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low quality br br is it really too much to ask that fx shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the fx you can't just get away with cool fx in shorts anymore it's been 5 years since <UNK> made a big <UNK> at least that short quick cool and was even a little funny none of that can be said about <UNK> lost
<START> i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film i am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film this happened quite by accident with the discovery of a movie called <UNK> late one night on television the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was 1 technically amateurish and 2 brilliantly written when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was <UNK> i started to get interesting when he said his main influence was the station agent a movie i'd seen on dvd a week prior i decided i had to go and check it out the result could be described along the same lines as <UNK> although the two films are nothing alike content wise both films suffer from technical <UNK> that are overcome through amazing writing whereas <UNK> is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation less like me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy he's always running one way or another filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up young men still have the same problems they always have the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern <UNK> <UNK> wonderfully honest characters and has them do completely believable things as far as indie cinema goes this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint but from an artistic one it is very close
<START> i'm embarrassed to be writing this review i say that because those of you reading it will know that i sat through the whole thing and that is embarrassing to admit even to strangers but i just had to warn those who read the viewer comments on imdb before they watch a film not to watch this one it's the least i can do this is a bad movie trust me the plot is goofy the acting is amateurish and the directing camera work sets costumes etc are all second rate let it go
<START> ruth gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers that columbo has ever had to deal with and the plot is ingenious all the way around this is one of the best columbo episodes ever <UNK> hartley and g d <UNK> are excellent in their supporting roles and peter falk delivers a little something extra in his scenes with gordon
<START> this movie rates as one of my all time favourite top 10 movies many people seeing it for the first time and knowing little about many of the themes in the movie probably won't understand why i find it so enthralling so i will try to explain br br the movie is very rich in historical detail and cultural insights and while it has a few minor <UNK> they are completely forgivable the story is a retelling of the famous duel between the monk <UNK> and the young prince <UNK> on <UNK> bridge during the fight according to legend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the monk becomes the <UNK> loyal <UNK> this movie is a <UNK> of that story however and involves war dark prophecy and political <UNK> br br one of the main themes in the movie is <UNK> which is the prophecy by the <UNK> that after 1000 years his <UNK> would fail and the world would fall into chaos it was believed in <UNK> japan after the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and the civil war between the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> that the world would fall into <UNK> and everything would collapse it is a time of demons br br next you have the way in which the movie <UNK> the issue of <UNK> sword training by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> defeated <UNK> often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals off this is said to be where ninja <UNK> began historically <UNK> depiction in <UNK> nicely <UNK> all of this br br then there is <UNK> and the various <UNK> of <UNK> depicted including a lot of <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> these are all depicted quite accurately and just to add a little extra the movie manages to convey the power of <UNK> and <UNK> energy in a way that makes it integral to the story i e it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does it in such a way as to make it <UNK> and menacing br br all in all it is filled with fascinating <UNK> and rings surprisingly true to life for the period the scenery and the <UNK> are also completely <UNK> and very authentic the soundtrack is great very brooding and ominous i also thought that the actual acting performances were surprisingly good <UNK> is a great brooding anti hero <UNK> <UNK> is depicted as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own power and <UNK> the <UNK> sword smith makes for and interesting depiction of the common man and his less than <UNK> opinion of the killers who fancy themselves his social <UNK> br br as to the plot to see why it is so good i really suggest you dig up an old book on japanese history and see how this retelling turns an almost lighthearted robin hood vs little john story into a gory tale of intrigue violence and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the comparison to sleuth the earlier stage play turned film is obvious and upon my first viewing i too thought sleuth was better but deathtrap has at least for me many more repeat viewings in it than sleuth br br i purchased <UNK> in the bargain bin at wal mart <UNK> that it had caine and the underrated reeve and was worth the 6 bucks it was one of the finest dvd <UNK> i could've picked up br br it's one of those best kept secrets that movie buffs always are always delighted to discover and it's totally worth repeat viewings br br though laurence olivier and michael caine turned in <UNK> performances in sleuth i was <UNK> impressed with christopher reeve as <UNK> anderson reeve rightfully associated with his now legendary portrayal of superman stole the show in what should've been an oscar worthy performance i've always felt reeve was a type cast actor who didn't get much of a chance to shine outside of the superman films and a few other flawed but entertaining films like somewhere in time but this film shows that his potential was truly <UNK> and put to use thank goodness br br i absolutely <UNK> michael <UNK> performance he was <UNK> deliciously manipulative and sadistic and watching him work with reeve and <UNK> cannon was an absolute pleasure in fact it was thanks to this movie that i got into a michael caine phase and started renting as much of his stuff as <UNK> possible br br as for deathtrap there's enough <UNK> dialogue in here to fill up its memorable quotes section unfortunately much of the dialogue would <UNK> spoil the immensely entertaining plot br br it's really really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own needless to say it's a must see but for me it was the greatest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time br br repeat viewings are a must br br and it deserves to sit alongside sleuth on your dvd shelf br br i'll leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film i wonder if it wouldn't be well just a <UNK> <UNK> eyed of me to enter into such a <UNK> and exciting collaboration where i could count on no sense of moral <UNK> whatsoever
<START> i have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture i'm white and like classic rock however that did not stop me from <UNK> this fantastic comedy its pretty much a sequel of this is spinal tap in the sense that it is the same movie just about rap instead or rock yet it's hilarious there are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat the characters are all very funny and believable i watched just because it made me laugh at 3 a m and any movie that can do that <UNK> at least a test screening one of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent this movie comes from a time where <UNK> deserved more credit overall it's a funny movie with many jokes about racism sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor this is highly recommend for any fan of this is spinal tap they are essentially the same movie just about different worlds and yes the same jokes work in both movies
<START> i am a huge huge fan of john cusack samuel l jackson and tony <UNK> i'm slightly less fond of stephen king but i like some of his work br br this said i should have loved <UNK> br br possible spoilers after this point br br i walked in eager i walked out disappointed br br this is not the fault of the actors <UNK> and jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts cusack in the guy in a locked room scenario br br this wasn't a bad movie but i can't call it a good one either it was a <UNK> mess that had moments of <UNK> that's just wrong combined with moments of <UNK> that's just painful and moments of oh now that's just unfortunate with very little continuity <UNK> between them <UNK> father shows up once and there's no seeming connection to the rest of <UNK> personal life that we see displayed while he tries to survive the room br br a previous <UNK> described the <UNK> <UNK> argument as worth watching and i very much agree but other than that aside from some clever musical <UNK> the room almost <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a little bit and gives him one chance to get out before <UNK> the <UNK> at which point it gives him the one hour <UNK> clock and the titular line from the <UNK> we've only just begun it's mostly stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it type horror that was fun when i was <UNK> and surrounded by friends my age <UNK> each other in the summer while jason stalked camp crystal lake br br the rest of the movie was let's make him <UNK> some of his most painful experiences <UNK> with let's <UNK> the paintings in creepy ways cliché cheesiness br br end spoilers br br i expected better from this movie with stephen king's name attached to it as well as the actors i mentioned above br br we never find out the origin of the evil we never get to see the evil defeated though we can presume maybe it was defeated br br and the ending was just a jarring what moment br br wait for it to come on cable i wouldn't have minded paying for it as a <UNK> but i'm feeling a bit <UNK> for having paid opening night <UNK> for it
<START> the 1997 low key indie <UNK> henry fool would seemingly have been a secure choice of movies no one would bother to <UNK> for a sequel a <UNK> <UNK> drifter thomas jay ryan <UNK> into town his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> inspire a nerdy garbage collector james <UNK> to write <UNK> while henry half <UNK> tries to <UNK> the guy's sister parker posey as the poet <UNK> henry <UNK> nothing special about any of the characters or the story a pitch for harold and <UNK> ghost would have been <UNK> higher odds of ever making it to a screen br br but parker posey ain't the semi official queen of the <UNK> for <UNK> so when writer director hal hartley came up with a new incarnation for his cast a film was born though we catch up with the same characters many years they're in a completely different sort of dark comedy this one's laced with espionage henry may have been an international spy and possible double or even triple agent for years before meeting the others he's either dead or in hiding from agents and authorities of many countries everyone wants his rambling incoherent <UNK> which just may contain <UNK> secrets that could <UNK> nations and <UNK> <UNK> fay is either the wife he left to go on the <UNK> or his widow depending on who's telling the truth <UNK> efforts to find henry and or the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> include a globe <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> hit persons and henchmen at every turn she never knows who to believe or trust nor do we br br while <UNK> these unlikely characters into jason bourne jack ryan territory hartley's script <UNK> the ironic deadpan humor of their first appearance <UNK> clear of slapstick in exposing them to physical <UNK> his sly lampoon of the paranoia <UNK> and musical <UNK> <UNK> of today's <UNK> starts to <UNK> towards the end even so fans of the first movie will be pleasantly surprised by the novelty of hartley's <UNK> methods 5 18 <UNK>
<START> the best thing i can say about this film is that it is well paced it did not fall flat the next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing <UNK> <UNK> to be edward the always marvelous holland taylor and the actor playing <UNK> husband the actor helping to critique <UNK> potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd yet winning quality to the proceedings okay that's about it on the positive side br br <UNK> <UNK> whom i adore is far more believable expressing contempt for messing than in any scene where he's attempting to be either <UNK> or supporting as others noted he appears to have no emotional investment in this enterprise other than <UNK> it up as quickly as possible messing on the other hand sincerely tries to carry the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with <UNK> she is adequate doing so but is simply not strong enough an actress to pull all of this off without help give her an e for effort and a c for achievement given <UNK> indifference the one thing that could've helped messing would have been a brilliantly <UNK> <UNK> esquire performance from the actor playing her ex fiancé jeffrey instead his performance is weak <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br if i tried to analyze this one any further i'd obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved it's harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do and less obnoxious and less creative than the wedding singer but you're much better off watching my best friend's wedding again
<START> fulci experiments with sci fi and fails usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore but not here sum very funny scenes like when the <UNK> are forced to hold onto a bar for 12 minutes and if they drop they are <UNK> the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor the city is an obvious model but not a bad one and the end explosion is at best laughable and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes br br 4 10
<START> at first i thought the ring would be a more than normal movie with it's ordinary plot how surprised was i of course the plot is simple one girl is in love with two men but hitchcock brings it to us on a silver <UNK> with laughter and fear with compassion and anguish the way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest movies north by <UNK> the rope etc the master did it great even before his thirties
<START> on one level this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build <UNK> and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again on a deeper level though it explores a profound desire to <UNK> with the land i thoroughly <UNK> with the artist when he said when i'm not out here alone for any length of time i feel <UNK> br br i considered andy goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists i'm familiar with his works mainly through his coffee table books and a couple art gallery <UNK> but to see his work in motion captured perfectly through <UNK> lens was a revelation <UNK> in time <UNK> creations come alive <UNK> flying <UNK> <UNK> crashing br br and that's precisely what he's all about time the process of creation and destruction of <UNK> and disappearing of coming out of the void and becoming the universe and back again there's a <UNK> quality about him <UNK> on madness you get the feeling watching him at work that his art is a <UNK> for him that if he didn't do it he would <UNK> and <UNK> br br luckily for us goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography otherwise with the exception of a few <UNK> and walls they would only exist for one person
<START> this is an action western james <UNK> leads an all star cast in the <UNK> <UNK> which is filmed in great <UNK> the scenery and costumes are great there is action and adventure stewart plays a wealthy <UNK> who runs <UNK> of a crooked government in the old <UNK> br br the main <UNK> is the stereotypical <UNK> that hollywood has always made into a hero even when this movie was made the <UNK> was the stereotypical hero and the one stewart portrays really has few saving <UNK> he is kind to his two partners and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and <UNK> br br however he is so <UNK> to everyone else it is hard to really care for him or to accept him he is much like the one dimensional spaghetti western characters cut not that bad br br still the minor characters are quite enjoyable walter brennan royal <UNK> harry morgan and others make this worth watching
<START> i read the negative comments before viewing this film and <UNK> went ahead and started watching i admit that i had to <UNK> quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex involved and full of detail that is a good thing but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases explosions gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development in fact what a welcome departure however i am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what i watch br br this film is chock full of character development and plot line the kind that we used to analyze when i was in high school it requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer what a nice change i would compare it to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> in terms of generic subject matter that is it is a mystery about intense <UNK> on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially <UNK> them br br unlike <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality in this sense the movie is a character study like 'the <UNK> with samuel jackson and kevin spacey in that movie their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense yet the plot is <UNK> on the ability of their characters to <UNK> with each other trust each and ultimately <UNK> together against the corrupt police department there is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but <UNK> there are many similarities br br i will say that city hall requires a whole lot more concentration in fact i was struck how parallel it was to past and present political <UNK> i've seen in my life going back to <UNK> the thing is the public knows that something is wrong for sure but following the details is hard to do this movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity i think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film unrealistic expectations br br if one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience it really is excellent i watched it 3 times in a row the acting is superb and the directing is flawless the weakest link is john <UNK> accent
<START> i saw this in theaters and absolutely <UNK> it <UNK> rush gave the best performance as a super villain that i have ever seen since gene hackman as lex <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and paul <UNK> were a match maid in heaven this film also introduced me to william h macy who is now one of my favorite actors hank was great as the blue <UNK> and i especially loved that the character wasn't really british the scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes i loved the fact that the <UNK> talked to the ball some of the funniest stuff involved stiller and his character mr <UNK> false rage and the fact that his <UNK> and one liners were all <UNK> and that they never made any sense i could barely stop myself from <UNK> when he said <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was said but one of the things i most enjoyed was that captain amazing actually dies in the movie i highly recommend this film for any occasion and i give it my own personal two thumbs up
<START> while i have never been a fan of the original scooby doo due to its horrid production values it appears like shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by <UNK> <UNK> without a doubt <UNK> doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children and this includes the <UNK> as well as tommy the <UNK> whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and <UNK> it to speak and then <UNK> the scooby doo characters with it whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show i think death is <UNK> the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny annoying and <UNK> on the nerves and this is only in the better episodes after many years it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess i can see why in the live action scooby doo movie they made the villain <UNK> doo since practically everyone hates him
<START> it used to be my thinking that movies required plots or some other means of making you care at all about the story line or anything that is going on this movie has showed me that you don't actually have to have anything like that br br i could sum it up simply as that but imdb wants me to have more lines it was kind of pretty not compelling in the slightest the way the characters talk in the movie makes you think it should have taken place over a matter of days but there is no passage of time and i'm pretty sure it all happens in an hour br br if you are looking to entertain yourself then buy a <UNK> of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing up it would be a far better use of your time time that you will never get back jurassic park 3 was pulled off better than this movie
<START> a very well made film set in early '60s communist <UNK> the five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong sincere and emotionally deep performances a clear depiction of how the natural trust and <UNK> inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that <UNK> the rest of their lives highly recommended
<START> i was surprised at just how much i enjoyed this most <UNK> delivered drama which <UNK> to its rather unimpressive 6 6 rating i nearly missed as i rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below 7 10 having said that i'm so glad i gave stone angel the viewing it so very much deserved and so should you if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive <UNK> and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form br br i must say that in many ways though not all <UNK> its themes execution style production etc stone angel very much reminded me of the much praised the <UNK> i am so surprised that other <UNK> didn't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie so i can only assume that those who've written comments have yet to see the <UNK> they may not share any <UNK> theme yet i can <UNK> say that if you very much enjoyed the <UNK> you will certainly find much to engage your time most <UNK> with the stone angel but even if you've not seen the <UNK> nor read the book on which this move is based which incidentally i haven't either you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly as long as your favourite genres don't include fast paced action thrillers this is a movie for <UNK> and those who like to <UNK> about <UNK> passing how life changes as the years pass and what might have happened in one's life as one <UNK> back through the years br br this <UNK> underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 8 10 i can only blame its current <UNK> rating of 6 6 10 on the 11 of idiots who gave it 1 10 after all it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of my writing this comment nonetheless if those 11 who gave it the lowest <UNK> possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didn't they look for even a few seconds at the movie's premise and <UNK> lines oh dear whatever the world is coming to don't miss this most underrated gem of a movie but only if you have a brain i e your top ten doesn't include transformers fight club nor the terminator
<START> i was subjected to this atrocity by my wife tried to turn it off after 10 minutes but was forced through the whole thing this must be hands down the most gruesome <UNK> of a movie ever br br there were great script moments such as br br sammy if she gets over here right away she gets a bonus <UNK> a <UNK> sammy no a bonus br br to <UNK> horrible script terrible acting and incredibly illogical
<START> stephen j <UNK> apparently decided a few years ago that he would <UNK> his <UNK> and <UNK> in horror the result dead above ground is an abysmal piece of junk now had i noticed his name in association with this particular film i'd have put it back but no i didn't have my glasses on and therefore i missed it damn i really do need to bring those with me while video shopping first question would be who the heck is the target audience for this it's almost like a scary kids movie but then again there's topless babes and some gore and some bad words <UNK> here and there the main characters are so cute that you want to see someone anyone go after them with farm <UNK> of some kind seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a <UNK> past a child murdering witch that <UNK> children's teeth lived there probably something the real estate agent failed to mention of course now in the modern day there's a little girls ghost around to warn the real live little girl that now lives there that something bad is going to happen it does and there's also two <UNK> that were <UNK> on that property when the new owner took over so they're out for revenge too this whole thing has the feel of some made for cable junk that's for the kids at halloween except for of course the things that aren't suitable for little kids so not only is this mediocre it's confused too a big boo and <UNK> to anchor bay for putting this out too considering their usual track record with fine releases this is a new low the uk gets a phantasm box set we get the tooth fairy hardly seems fair 1 out of 10 absolute garbage
<START> <UNK> down in your favourite chair and switch on the play station as you toss this into the waste <UNK> unit spend a useful 90 min living your favourite game disjointed poorly filmed non directed junk it takes a bits from several other science fiction movies and badly attempts to join the parts into a <UNK> weak story there's nothing new here the filmmakers do not seem to realise that providing simple entertainment would achieve a <UNK> game but a touch of skill <UNK> and flair is required to turn it into a good film any money spent watching this is a waste and personally i would like my 90 min of life back
<START> in a nutshell this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really wants and tries to be something more it wants to be harold and <UNK> annie hall the graduate it wants to be deep and human it has interesting camera shots lighting music editing all of which give it the feel of an important movie the dialog is smart at times there are some laugh out loud moments br br but here's what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late night cable in flight time killer br br 1 david <UNK> how many times can joe sad sack puppy dog stare <UNK> into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying maybe some <UNK> would have helped br br 2 <UNK> paltrow she's really flat here and not just in the chest her role is supposed to be this lively nice caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations is very confused as a result and that is why a sad sack loser like <UNK> has any chance with her but <UNK> plays her very dull combine this with puppy dog <UNK> face above and you have very little chemistry to care about br br i kept <UNK> someone else in this role kate hudson for example br br 3 the script and the plot the stuff that happens just basically doesn't ring true all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and <UNK> bow on top that it seems like a <UNK> blew and the script writers just said <UNK> time to wrap it up got a train to catch so they pulled out the hollywood formula book checked off all the boxes and went home
<START> jimmy dean could not have been more hammy or <UNK> <UNK> hysterical if viewed through the eyes of mystery science theatre 3000 which i rate as a 10 i mean the sight of this <UNK> corn fed <UNK> <UNK> around <UNK> should be enough to send you to the <UNK> if you make it that far into the film this ugly hysterical farce should be placed with the likes of <UNK> call <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> go to <UNK> a <UNK> film like this proves that sometimes actors writers producers etc get behind on their <UNK> or get stoned to the point of insanity it begs the question who was so stupid to <UNK> such a whale but then had good judgment <UNK> and final justice never was then we wouldn't have the delightful spoof voice over in mystery science theatre 3000
<START> this film was a big disappointment br br i take the opposite view of the critics this is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors here the actors bette davis and james cagney are simply not up to the level of the material clark gable and <UNK> <UNK> were every bit as big as davis and cagney and look how it happened one night turned out an all time classic with a very similar story davis proves that she has no talent for comedy good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted <UNK> one note performance <UNK> <UNK> but none of the nuances of <UNK> acting in it happened one night cagney who was a great comedy actor just seems out of sync with his <UNK> davis the script provides some decent lines and gags but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy br br part of the problem is the soundtrack which like the delivery of davis and cagney seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy br br jack carson who played similar roles throughout his career has more <UNK> handled very similar material in a fairly typical supporting role eugene palette delivers a respectable performance in a slightly different role as an old west <UNK> harry <UNK> is very good but in one of his <UNK> performances william <UNK> is quite irritating his character's constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony br br i really love every one of these performers and it is a shame that as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than the bride came c o d
<START> many people know how it feels when a loved one is lost the feelings of pain grief and sorrow can be unbearable however sometimes it is the memories they leave behind that trigger the saddest emotions this theme is superbly portrayed in the short film <UNK> directed by the award winning australian actress rachel <UNK> described as a movie <UNK> much about memories as it is about <UNK> a string of sensitivity and sentimentality is expertly <UNK> into this <UNK> 15 minute film br br <UNK> is a beautifully <UNK> touching and heart warming story of a man's journey in coming to terms with the loss of his wife through the relationship he shares with a very special animal <UNK> the film opens with a rising dawn the <UNK> of birds and a vast landscape introducing the sense of <UNK> harmony present throughout the film a soft music plays <UNK> the entrance of ruth jean <UNK> she wears a <UNK> dress and <UNK> with a sun hat on her head she gently pets <UNK> <UNK> her ears and <UNK> her back the <UNK> of the house is impressive and the attention to detail is <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> can be seen on the <UNK> <UNK> the peaceful rural community will charles <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ruth as she is <UNK> the milk from the bucket they pour the milk and coffee together a sign of <UNK> and <UNK> not a word is said but it is obvious that their relationship is close and <UNK> they paint a perfect picture of happiness br br sadly happiness doesn't last forever the tragic passing of ruth affects will deeply an effective scene of <UNK> cars highlights <UNK> isolation and vulnerability at the end of the day of the funeral soon he sinks into depression and becomes oblivious to his surroundings when everything seems hopeless and lost at <UNK> moment of despair <UNK> becomes the symbol of ruth the genuine connection will has with his late wife it was through <UNK> that will learns to cope with the absence of ruth and overcome the <UNK> feelings of loneliness br br each of the characters is realistically and <UNK> portrayed especially the part of will charles <UNK> <UNK> brings the character to life through personal investment the recent loss of his own wife audrey <UNK> is effectively reflected in his acting every <UNK> of his shoulder and every <UNK> on his brow make the viewer empathize strongly with the character the character of ruth is wonderfully carried out by jean <UNK> although ruth does not say a single word throughout the movie her sweet personality and loving relationship with will are obvious lois <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> give delightful performances in supporting roles as the friendly margaret and mary they also add a subtle humor to the bittersweet story br br an <UNK> from <UNK> childhood the story of loss and discovery is remarkably captured in <UNK> beautifully shot and superbly acted this film will surely make you misty eyed <UNK> or feel like drinking a cup of milk
<START> creepy <UNK> wolf the young red is wearing full make up and extremely short shorts <UNK> got about 20 minutes through and realized it could be a <UNK> dream come true the up beat music sounds a lot like something i'd hear at a strip club i actually think this movie is a sick joke it's not a family movie gross glad i was watching this with my daughter i don't want her to think it's normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together very bad very sad it's sold as a family film joey <UNK> will probably be embarrassed he was in it and what's with advertising it as a special effects spectacular the effects do look low budget <UNK> awful
<START> this film stars among others <UNK> vince offer who also wrote edited and directed and joey <UNK> not exactly names that scream out quality and with such uplifting skits as <UNK> taking a dump it's exactly what it sounds like a guy who <UNK> a <UNK> bank the <UNK> <UNK> with a rotting corpse black market <UNK> featuring a guy <UNK> what are supposed to be them out of a jar lots and lots of gay jokes a skit about a giant <UNK> who is a superhero and forced <UNK> the skits are painfully unfunny such as batman and <UNK> the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude and stupid i truly believe a group of 8 year olds could have easily made a funnier film with the same budget br br apparently this film resulted in a <UNK> by slap shot vince against the <UNK> frankly i wouldn't know who to root for in this case apparently he alleged that somehow <UNK> destroyed his reputation and <UNK> this film no matter that the film is <UNK> junk from start to finish and 99 unfunny by comparison <UNK> is funnier and these are the <UNK> things i can say about the movie br br by the way that is bobby lee from mad tv wearing a <UNK> and <UNK> in the dumb fake porno film it's amazing his career could overcome this
<START> the <UNK> was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its twilight <UNK> ish manner the general rule applies here and this sequel doesn't match up to its predecessor worse than that it doesn't even compare with it br br <UNK> explodes onto the screen in the most un professional fashion in the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as <UNK> is shot in a dream immediately after that the film nose <UNK> after a disastrous first 45 minutes it gradually <UNK> momentum when they enter the matrix and the agent smith battle takes place but it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14 minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big <UNK> worthy twist at the end worst of all is the overlong <UNK> <UNK> scene not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot but it's also a pathetic excuse for porn and <UNK> dance music br br the bullet time aspect of the <UNK> was a good addition but in <UNK> they <UNK> to make it seem boring in the first one there were interesting plot turns but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting the movie is basically just a series of stylish <UNK> that prevent us from <UNK> just how empty it really is it works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better it appears that the <UNK> franchise has quickly <UNK> into the special effects <UNK> misfire that other <UNK> such as the star <UNK> saga have br br the acting standard is poor for the most part the best character of course goes to hugo <UNK> agent <UNK> the only one to be slightly interesting keanu reeves is the definitive neo but in all the special effects there is little room to make much of an impact academy award <UNK> laurence fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue carrie ann <UNK> part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress br br a poor thrown together movie the matrix <UNK> is a disappointment those who didn't like the first one are unlikely to flock to it this one's for die hard fans only even in the movie's own sub genre of special effect <UNK> minority report the matrix etc this is still rather poor my imdb rating 4 5 10
<START> i thought that baseketball was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen it's witty humour made me giggle all the way through and the fact that <UNK> and matt are so over the top <UNK> the film's comedy br br i have just bought baseketball on dvd and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it i have a very short attention span and i think this film has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained throughout the humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours if i remember them later br br so overall i think that baseketball is brilliant movie which everyone should go see especially if you're younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards br br p s does anybody think its weird for me to like them both <UNK>
<START> there are exactly 2 good things to be said about fantasies both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well br br a bo <UNK> extraordinary poetry inspiring beauty she has shots in this movie where she gives even catherine zeta jones a run for her money and that's a high compliment indeed her nudity is brief and <UNK> but just looking at her face is enough br br b the greek island setting with its sun and crystal clear blue waters br br other than that there is no story the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny he touched you where you're a woman and peter <UNK> character is a slimy jerk bo <UNK> the <UNK> of her character but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad it's unfair to blame the actors the fact that she kept saying the name <UNK> in almost every sentence is a major <UNK> oh and although the film is set on a greek island there is hardly a greek word to be heard apparently everyone there from kids to old people speaks english the whole time
<START> the hip hop rendition of a <UNK> <UNK> performance according to the film's musical credits it is an incredible piece of savage consciousness that <UNK> the violence in your heart with each snap if anyone can tell me <UNK> this song live wire snap by <UNK> <UNK> from the ground truth an <UNK> duty to see as the americans who might not support the mission but embrace each soul caught inside this savage <UNK> of purpose they take on the haunting as so many of us can sit back and be angry br br live wire snap by <UNK> <UNK> where can it be found br br desperate to find it br br <UNK> unable to serve
<START> <UNK> starts as a young psychiatric doctor named james bishop matt <UNK> takes up his <UNK> at st andrews insane asylum or <UNK> illness <UNK> as they like to call it there with nearly <UNK> patients bishop meets his boss dr <UNK> bruce payne is put to work he gets ward <UNK> where some seriously deranged dangerous patients are held if that wasn't bad enough during his first round of visits bishop finds a dead body has threatening sounding <UNK> messages <UNK> over his room bishop starts to hear stories from the patients about sinister goings on at the asylum soon finds out for himself the stories have more than a hint of truth about them br br known as asylum of the damned in the us this supernatural horror film was directed by philip j jones i sort of liked it but in the end there were too many unsatisfying elements for me to totally enjoy it the script by matt <UNK> takes itself pretty seriously i quite liked the basic idea behind some of it's ideas but there are a few things which work against it for a start the film is just too slow the story is pretty good doesn't give itself away too early but it takes an absolute age for it to get going i was rapidly losing interest with each passing minute i also thought the so called twist ending was far too predictable the ending itself far too bland forgettable it's a shame because i liked the story the character's the setting some of the ideas but it's simply too slow frankly dull to keep one entertained over it's 90 minute duration it's one of those films which i would like to recommend but in all honesty i can't br br director jones does a good job this is actually a well lit quite atmospheric film i wouldn't say there's anything scary here i'm not sure if <UNK> was shot in a real insane asylum but if it wasn't they did a great job on the sets the film looks pretty good overall unfortunately there is a real lack of gore or action there are two hand print shaped wounds a severed tongue that's it absolutely nothing else in terms of blood or gore which has to go down as a disappointment depending on who you believe which review you read the special effects are either the worst ever or very good well as a devoted watcher of low budget horror i was very impressed with the effects especially the demon thing which looks <UNK> impressive is a man in a suit type effect rather than a terrible cgi computer graphic although it's an impressive suit it all depends on your expectations i suppose br br technically the film is good it looks nice enough the lack of cgi computer effects is something i welcome the acting isn't great though it certainly could have been better br br <UNK> is a film that disappointed me there were some good stuff about it but at the same time some terrible stuff which unfortunately <UNK> the good i sort of liked parts of it but as a whole 90 minute viewing experience i'd find it totally impossible to recommend to anyone
<START> second part actually episode 4 8 of the hit danish tv series is slightly inferior to the first one but has plenty of laughs and scares as well this time <UNK> <UNK> plays two parts as the monster baby and his demon like father other standout parts this time are <UNK> <UNK> doctor <UNK> who must face the horrible revenge of dr <UNK> and once again patient mrs <UNK> tries to solve the mysteries miss <UNK> style ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors <UNK> hugo <UNK> dr <UNK> and kirsten <UNK> mrs <UNK> you wonder how <UNK> ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot sadly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> syndrome <UNK> 2 died shortly after as well look for <UNK> <UNK> in a cameo
<START> perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable greek films i've seen in the last ten years excellent performances especially <UNK> <UNK> is great well written script and effective direction from a very special for the greek very average standards auteur a film obviously influenced by sam <UNK> straw dogs that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and <UNK> situations and <UNK> in the end nevertheless this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of greek movies which should be watched outside <UNK> it's a shame that in <UNK> didn't work <UNK> in addition with other fake and <UNK> big productions like <UNK> <UNK>
<START> marvin rob schneider does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his <UNK> dream but his luck changes when he has a car crush a very bad one and is found by a doctor the doctor has to use animal organs to <UNK> him after this moment he starts to have wild <UNK> <UNK> and becomes a best cop one could ever be by the time he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side in the mean time he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave <UNK> i am not a big fun of rob schneider in fact this is the his first film i have seen however i can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser see his part in ally <UNK> quite funny actually there are some good parts in the movie such as his <UNK> with the goat in such movies the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent i am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously but very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office the animal is not the worst film i have seen to date but fails to get more than
<START> the premise for circle of two is an intriguing one a forbidden love between a sixty year old painter <UNK> richard burton and a fifteen year old girl sarah norton <UNK> o'neill and the question of whether such a relationship is acceptable given <UNK> standards the problem with circle of two however is that it fails to live up to its promise director jules <UNK> and <UNK> should have put more thought into the screenplay when i watched this film i expected to learn something new about love and sexuality instead i got boring dialogue a pointless lecture on art <UNK> where sarah seemed to have more fun away from <UNK> and a closing scene so artificial that its emotional impact was lost this script makes good actors look bad so one can imagine how the film's problems were <UNK> even further with the largely amateurish cast that jules <UNK> assembled <UNK> o'neill was not in her element i did not believe for a second that her character sarah was in love with <UNK> her performance seemed superficial like a contestant at a beauty <UNK> it was as though she forced herself to be happy when the script required her to be happy and to be sad when the script asked her to be sad the only scene i liked with her in was at the very end when she said nothing at all that was probably the closest <UNK> sarah norton ever came to being real but <UNK> was not the only one at fault richard <UNK> <UNK> lacked the charm the charisma and the complexity to attract even women of his own age let alone a fifteen year old the rest of the cast was also dismal even their arguing was unconvincing because they waited to take turns who does that michael <UNK> as the jealous ex boyfriend paul was probably the best thing in this film but his role was small to be fair to the actors <UNK> direction let everyone down but it is also true that a great movie goes beyond the script kubrick's <UNK> did that with james mason and sue <UNK> <UNK> runaway train went beyond the script with jon voight and eric roberts playing <UNK> the directors of these films also knew how to use music to <UNK> their films and reveal something about the characters in them in spite of its own score a combination of antonio <UNK> carl off and bernard <UNK> circle of two never succeeds in doing that br br in conclusion the idea of a forbidden love story between an elder painter and a teenage girl is a good one but its execution in circle of two is terrible in many ways it is a shame that a controversial <UNK> type story  which most film directors for understandable reasons would prefer to avoid  did not have receive more intelligent treatment that a script which actors would have gladly <UNK> was not written that actors who were committed to their part or had the talent to make their characters real could not be found and that the director jules <UNK> who did so much better with films like <UNK> and <UNK> did not have to will to put his foot down and say before we do any filming we must <UNK> the love story and <UNK> the script the only silver <UNK> is that one day an intelligent film about an elder painter and a teenager girl falling in love may one day be made if such a film ever appears this it will be surely spark controversy debate and questions for many years to come
<START> about 15 minutes in my wife was already wanting to leave not so much because of the material but the lack thereof they decided to fill in the <UNK> where the funny stuff should've been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could when this would let up very rare we'd sit back and watch not laughing mind you and wait for the next gross out or offensive remark s after about 35 minutes we both got up and left everything we'd read said how great this was the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it intelligent and said it wasn't a crude sex comedy did he go to the right movie along with be cool it's the only other movie i've ever walked out on and i have no regrets i'm sick of trying to go see comedies in america
<START> in terms of the arts the 1970s were a very <UNK> era in literature and the visual arts it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity that has yet to be <UNK> in music it was a decade that many see as a low point due to corporate rock and disco on television it was a golden age for situation comedies from the odd couple to the mary tyler moore show to m a s h to all in the family but in film it was even a greater period of creativity in all genres that saw the rise of the american auteur directors like robert altman francis ford coppola and martin scorsese from the <UNK> of the old studio systems that had dominated hollywood for over half a century these directors wanted to craft <UNK> arts films for the masses of the sort that had been <UNK> in europe since the end of the second world war yet the studios were trying to keep pace with socially aware films of the sort not seen since the 1930s br br but unlike the films of the 1930s starring actors like jimmy cagney and john garfield usually co starring the dead end kids that dealt with social issues in a gritty realistic way or as realistic as one could get on a sound stage the social consciousness of the late 1960s and early 1970s <UNK> itself most in science fiction films which allowed the left wing of hollywood to <UNK> to the masses under the <UNK> of what most considered little above comic strip entertainment there was <UNK> for this approach for several of the flying <UNK> films of the 1950s dealt with the political <UNK> of the mccarthy era most notably the day the earth stood still and invasion of the body <UNK> and the early 1960s saw rod <UNK> constantly <UNK> the political <UNK> of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show the twilight zone among the studio offerings of this time were the <UNK> sensitive silent running george <UNK> first film <UNK> <UNK> which dealt with <UNK> group think and <UNK> and <UNK> run which <UNK> away at communism and state control versus the rights of an individual some of the film's references are quite <UNK> and <UNK> of the then current arab oil crisis and rampant <UNK> a few <UNK> <UNK> cost 150 and soylent <UNK> its <UNK> colored <UNK> soylent yellow soylent red and the new soylent green <UNK> made from 'the finest <UNK> growth ' in a manner not unlike the gas <UNK> of the time scenes of food <UNK> are eerie echoes of the oil <UNK> at many gas stations during the year of the film's release and the scenes of <UNK> and bodies live and dead lying all about are still chilling as well as influential a later film like escape from new york is an obvious <UNK> the rest of the script by stanley r <UNK> however is rather pedestrian and fairly standard for a <UNK> flick but <UNK> and cinematographer richard h kline do a great job of filling the screen with interesting images and sounds to spice things up the use of soft <UNK> lit visuals <UNK> <UNK> add a <UNK> feel to the new york of the film almost like a <UNK> version of carl <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the only light in the film comes from artificial sources and were it not for the fashion faux <UNK> the film could truly seem timeless br br the end of the film where thorn <UNK> into the <UNK> plant where human corpses are made into soylent green <UNK> is both chilling and oddly drama less in the end the soylent <UNK> hunt thorn down but he survives long enough to utter the film's <UNK> to chief <UNK> yet one does not know if it is enough for <UNK> has already been co <UNK> and has a track record of taking the easy way out yet that fact and its ambiguity shows that the film does not <UNK> its characters' <UNK> and has a depth many later better made films sci fi or not do not have it is also why soylent green is still a film worth watching
<START> mad dog time trigger happy whatever you wanna call it simply doesn't hit the mark maybe its just me maybe i just don't like gangster comedies as i thought oscar <UNK> dangerously and mafia also sucked it's probably more witty sharp <UNK> than all out comedy only its not as witty and sharp as it or the other reviewers make it out to be br br the rick mick <UNK> thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch br br there wasn't enough changes of location or feel for the period they were supposed to be in the majority of the film was either set in <UNK> club or a variety of <UNK> dim rooms what was with that sit down gun stand off thing goldblum kept winning br br the supporting cast was on paper excellent great to see <UNK> <UNK> but characters were killed off before they had time to develop and richard <UNK> cameo was a joke the romance and love element of the film also <UNK> it down br br 4 10 i don't think i'll return to it anytime soon
<START> how sheep like the movie going public so often proves to be as soon as a few critics say something new is good ie shake <UNK> everyone jumps on the <UNK> as if they are devoid of independent thought this was not a good movie it was a dreadful movie 1 plot what plot bourne was chased from here to there from beginning to end that's the plot don't look for anything deeper than this 2 cinematography do me a favor any 7 year old armed with an old and <UNK> <UNK> movie camera would do a far better job i am not <UNK> here this film is a tour de force of astonishingly amateurish camera work the ridiculous shaking of every i really do mean every scene will cause <UNK> and <UNK> 3 believable oh yes definitely this is a masterpiece of credibility i loved scenes about bourne being chased by local police through the <UNK> market streets of <UNK> i've been to <UNK> even the <UNK> can't <UNK> their way through those streets but bourne <UNK> off 100 police with speed and <UNK> <UNK> must be laughing his head off at the <UNK> of his film <UNK> 4 editing i don't know what the editor was on when he did this film but i want some every scene is between 0 5 and 2 seconds i felt <UNK> at the end of the film from the <UNK> effect of the scenes flashing by 5 directing hmmm this is an interesting aspect the film appears to have actually not had any directing more a case of <UNK> throwing a copy of the script all two pages at the <UNK> and told to shoot a few scenes whilst drunk don't worry boys we'll tie the scenes together in the editing room the editor should be <UNK> <UNK> and put in the <UNK> for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6 not one but two senior cia <UNK> giving the tender feminine treatment to the <UNK> and misunderstood jason bourne putting their lives on the line for someone they couldn't even be sure wasn't a <UNK> talk about stupid <UNK> whilst the evil male cia members plot to <UNK> any <UNK> who so much as drops a paper clip on the floor well all men are evil aren't they except for <UNK> of course yes this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity 7 when the you know what finally hits the fan good <UNK> over evil just like it always does eh and the would be assassin gets the drop on jason bourne he suddenly <UNK> a guilt trip and <UNK> from pulling the trigger yeah right at that very moment the evil deputy director just happens to turn up gun in hand and he does pull the trigger how did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath wonders will never <UNK> 8 don't worry there's a <UNK> hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the <UNK> well we can't have nasty politically incorrect cia <UNK> going round shooting people can we how lovely to see a true to life p c film of the <UNK> the bourne ultimatum is utter rubbish

<START> i've seen this movie and i must say i'm very impressed there are not much movies i like but i do like this one you should see this movie by yourself and comment it because this is one of my most favorite movie i fancy to see this again action <UNK> with a fantastic story very <UNK> i like <UNK> character actually she's very <UNK> and mysterious i do like that the bad boy is pretty too well actually this whole movie is rare in <UNK> i considered about the vote of this movie i thought this is should be a very popular movie i guess wrong it was me who was very impressed about this movie and i hope i'm not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one see and vote
<START> this film was choppy incoherent and contrived it was also an extremely mean spirited portrayal of women i rented it because it was listed as a comedy that's a stretch and because the cover said <UNK> mcdowell was acting up a storm in it she wasn't i'm a gal i watched this film with two guys and we spent an hour afterwards <UNK> over how bad it was br br warning plot summary below rampant spoilers br br the movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man to the severe <UNK> of her two jealous single girlfriends they want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her but she's so happy with her <UNK> puppy that you're rooting for them to stick it out and sure enough she decides to marry the guy but her <UNK> girlfriend aided by the <UNK> <UNK> one sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her it works she has a fight with him he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck remember the movie's title so now he's dead two thirds of the way through the film and although our heroine is a school <UNK> who spends her time watching over girls she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant br br she's already broken off relations with her girlfriends because they were so <UNK> alone and pitiful she decides to marry the boring guy did i mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister she had asked him to marry her to the young guy nice huh but now she tells him she'll marry him and apparently he has no <UNK> to being <UNK> around in this fashion but her girlfriends rescue her at the <UNK> and take her home where they not quite confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting <UNK> she has the kid in the final scene they leave it in a <UNK> inside her house while they go out on the <UNK> to drink smoke and be smug i kid you not it's that bad i left out the part about the cancer red <UNK> and the <UNK> ridiculous lesbian moment
<START> br br as usual i was really looking forward to a new tv film on a favourite subject of mine makes a nice change from a strangely familiar documentary about <UNK> or <UNK> on the history channel br br i <UNK> looked forward to pearl <UNK> and enemy at the gates but was <UNK> brought down to earth with the <UNK> of the <UNK> stupid <UNK> power of hollywood and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe br br so yet again i got excited about 'the rise of <UNK> especially as i heard that ian <UNK> was involved as i've enjoyed his books i can see why he quit br br to quote some guy responsible for this rubbish br br the <UNK> book was an academic piece he said it was br br quite dry we needed more incidents br br incidents are they totally nuts hitler's life cannot be said to be without <UNK> yes <UNK> two volume hitler <UNK> were long and detailed but they were supposed to be br br the <UNK> behind <UNK> of <UNK> seems to be br br hitler was a very bad man no he was a very bad man who hated jews and just in case you miss this we're going to <UNK> the fact in every scene in the film br br there was no effort whatsoever to try and explain the mood of the time and why hitler may have adopted the views and <UNK> he did needless to say unlike the generally excellent <UNK> a warning from <UNK> this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the <UNK> communist rising were jewish and that this may have <UNK> his views on the subject and his <UNK> <UNK> of the jews with <UNK> an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the nazi era br br but there was not much understanding to be done the film makers weren't going to go there so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway we certainly don't get the fascinating fact that <UNK> <UNK> to which has hitler briefly being a <UNK> communist immediately after <UNK> that would of course be far too complex for the film to handle and might even detract from the relentless <UNK> was very <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> away <UNK> br br we know he was a bad man however we also know that he was a <UNK> figure both as a public <UNK> and in more private situations he could be polite and even sympathetic and of course <UNK> some views like <UNK> anti alcohol and anti smoking that many guardian readers could agree with he was also <UNK> fond of animals hence why that wholly invented dog <UNK> scene was so absurd br br he was also from all the accounts i've seen a brave soldier in <UNK> whilst we saw him with his iron cross we never get to see how he won it acts of bravery were not in the script needless to say we also get no insight whatsoever into why he was so fired up by his war experiences whilst <UNK> owen <UNK> <UNK> and so many others found it so <UNK> an experience and again like the point above re the jewish <UNK> link this is vital to anyone's understanding about the subject why did he love war so much why did he think it was always a good idea despite massive evidence to the contrary why didn't he care about his colleagues who died or maybe he did but still drew the wrong conclusions br br this film certainly didn't have anything of any interest to say on this either br br as all too often these days the film is a classic example of <UNK> history relevant to the <UNK> and <UNK> stuff or leaving awkward facts out to fit in with 'the <UNK> which all too often is to <UNK> to the lowest common <UNK> where you don't trust your audience an inch so you just ram stuff down their throats knowing sadly correctly that you'll always get away with it because there are so many dumb fools in the world br br history is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colours our present for better and for worse this rubbish was a great opportunity lost again they spent millions on it and the locations and large scenes were impressive but told us nothing at all we didn't know already and promoted no understanding of this dark period in human history br br <UNK>
<START> i had tried to rent this on many occasions but was always with the girlfriend who as a general rule usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment <UNK> looks good but i'm not in the mood for that movie thus <UNK> the almighty solo movie night br br anyway i found welcome to <UNK> a rather enjoyable movie while ultimately fairly forgettable it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments i was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway george clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a <UNK> safe cracker that for the most part left me wondering two things 1 wouldn't every comedy be better if mr clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo and 2 how do they make fake <UNK> that look old and faded and how easily do they wash off the cast all fine actors in their own right put in a great job and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie both plot wise and humor wise but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original so i consider it a success rent this one for a good time maybe grab a few friends and a pizza you'll have a good time br br 7 10 br br on a side note the soundtrack is spectacular it's great to hear the far under appreciated <UNK> <UNK> used and it left me <UNK> snippets of the score long after the credits rolled
<START> this is the biggest insult to <UNK> ever <UNK> officially <UNK> does not exist in <UNK> <UNK> there will never be a female turtle this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own once gone no more the biggest mistake was crossing over power rangers to <UNK> with a horrible episode the <UNK> voices were wrong and they all acted out of character they could have done such a better job better designs and <UNK> and no <UNK> br br don't bother with this people it's cringe worthy material the lip <UNK> was slow and unnatural looking they totally <UNK> <UNK> the main baddie some <UNK> dude was corny the <UNK> looked corny with things hanging off their bodies what's with the thing around <UNK> <UNK> the silly looking <UNK> <UNK> br br if they looked normal acted in character and got rid of <UNK> got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds and better writing it could have been good

<START> if you don't mind having your emotions <UNK> with then you won't mind this movie on the other hand if you enjoy british crime mysteries following clues and seeing how they all <UNK> fall into place at the end you'll be very disappointed br br here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment br br while the police <UNK> the <UNK> cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery the huge truck that stopped and <UNK> the children's view just before her disappearance doesn't get caught on camera this is a critical piece of the mystery it's inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery br br the movie goes to great <UNK> to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children's movements but misses the opportunity to <UNK> the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera visible locations <UNK> to the crime scene as part of developing clues br br in england driving is on the left the director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right several <UNK> away from the flower <UNK> when it could have easily <UNK> immediately behind or even on the side as the huge truck did br br the police <UNK> team is so <UNK> as to find a <UNK> cell phone in a <UNK> drain several miles from the scene of the crime but can't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene even though they <UNK> the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no <UNK> <UNK> br br search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children this from the country that is well known for developing the <UNK> dog for search and hunting br br it is illogical that such a highly <UNK> news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower <UNK> br br it is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and <UNK> so much effort to leave carpet <UNK> clues under her <UNK> for her eventual murder <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her daughter to do the same while she simply could not have <UNK> out of the <UNK> mobile home if she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet <UNK> under her nails she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded <UNK> park br br the suspect that <UNK> the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> drowning of the <UNK> but he was smart enough not to <UNK> with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self <UNK> br br there are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth <UNK> disappointment <UNK> <UNK> is a very weak british crime story
<START> <UNK> from outer space is pretty much summed up by its name running only 27 minutes long it describes a spaceship of gay blacks that come to earth to free the men from women while i see a little significance to the plot it also is really illogical granted its meant to be a comedy spoof on society and science fiction i found myself laughing several times so it succeeds there br br the special effects are horrible when the spaceship is floating above the earth you can see stars zoom by for no apparent reason the <UNK> shown in the beginning look fake the equipment on the ship is illogical there are several <UNK> in the text the actors are unconvincing the characters are messed up in general the whole thing doesn't take itself seriously if you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie its very accessible and easy to see through to the end some parts are hilarious but overall the only thing that you are left remembering is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever br br seeing that its a short film and has some funny aspects its not the worst thing to see but its illogical and holds little long term value i can't really recommend it if you do watch it do so for the unique concept not the quality
<START> you must be seeing my comments over many films under <UNK> <UNK> i am off to make another comment over a movie that is not even worth a minute of talking though this film is basically two hours of <UNK> character drinking himself nearly literally to death the only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised it was just a grim sad waste of time br br willem dafoe is excellent actor peter <UNK> is an excellent actor but this film just sucked slow doesn't make the movie bad it was just bad the <UNK> plot mixed with artistic <UNK> of <UNK> detail aren't <UNK> drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives finally at the end i really appreciate the artistic vision but as entertainment it put me to sleep seriously i fell asleep and had to re watch the film which was even more disappointing i generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others even when they suck but this film <UNK> one it's just too bad that these great actors were <UNK> with this end result
<START> <UNK> is the game <UNK> is the name rarely has the screen been <UNK> with such a blown up <UNK> of half baked conspiracy theories <UNK> <UNK> and new age <UNK> the bulk of the story is set at <UNK> a <UNK> resort in the <UNK> jungle think <UNK> <UNK> meets star <UNK> planet <UNK> inhabited by <UNK> followers of a not so mysterious but surprisingly narrow minded cult of love and peace thanks to gruesome acting and tacky production design the <UNK> colored <UNK> of the mysterious all healing energy is particularly hideous the <UNK> <UNK> looks and feels like a <UNK> 1980s twilight zone episode factual errors regarding church history and <UNK> abound i can't believe hector <UNK> agreed to be a part of this maybe it was made without his <UNK> <UNK> style may the lord have mercy on the director the screenwriter the author of the novel and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book
<START> well basically the movie blows it's blair witch meets sean <UNK> ill conceived fantasy about going to iraq to show the world what the war on terror is really about the script sounds like it was written by <UNK> <UNK> no offense to <UNK> <UNK> the two main actors over act the entire film they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film not that i know anything about those things but it just didn't look like real documentaries i've watched and worst of all christian johnson took a great idea and made it suck it reminded me of the time i tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd i'd rather watch the blair witch <UNK> than sit through that again
<START> the spoilers in this review are offered as a public service because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist the lady barbara <UNK> gets raped and <UNK> down in the end and not a moment too soon i'd have shot the screen myself but i was afraid i'd hit james mason br br the original 1943 novel called the life and death of the wicked lady <UNK> i guess people didn't <UNK> about spoilers back then was written by a woman an english navy brat who was either troubled or cynical or both her heroine is <UNK> beautiful and the author seems to think that if you have beauty nothing else matters but other things do matter such as the fact that lady <UNK> immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is homicide she murders three men in five attempts a serial femme fatale she's got a case of <UNK> personality disorder that should have landed her in either <UNK> or <UNK> br br <UNK> plays her as a <UNK> <UNK> wearing so much makeup that i thought of her as a <UNK> era joan rivers or a <UNK> era joan rivers ha yet lady b is irresistible to all three principal male characters michael <UNK> james mason and griffith jones all of whom do good work as does patricia <UNK> of course all three <UNK> realize in short order what a psychotic bitch barbara is but the plot keeps them all in her <UNK> until one of them finally does gun her down accidentally in what is meant to be either irony or just <UNK> given the dramatic death scene with a boom <UNK> the camera out through the windows and <UNK> i presume we're meant to give a damn about her death but hers is the first corpse we don't care about
<START> this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context it was meant to be a parody of teen horror devil worship movies and the '80s saw plenty of them i saw this movie when it first came out and instantly liked it being a big fan of kiss it was great to see gene in the movie and anything with <UNK> as a metal hating preacher can't be all bad also <UNK> was already a favorite of mine so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack br br the original vhs this was pre dvd cover for trick or treat featured an <UNK> of sammi <UNK> playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a demon looking on it was a special order and the price for the vhs copy at the time circa 1987 was 90 i really wanted the movie but not at that ridiculous price the <UNK> <UNK> cover was only created for the 5 re release the company releasing it probably figured gene and <UNK> were the only recognizable people in the movie so they had better put 'em on the cover same thing with the original little shop of horrors jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star br br i have a trick or treat web site and it's surprising how many people believe sammi <UNK> was a real person <UNK> helped <UNK> that myth by <UNK> their soundtrack album to <UNK> <UNK> br br all in all it was just a good time rock n roll movie definitely not to be taken too seriously but just enjoyed
<START> i wouldn't go so far as to not recommend this movie since the only problems i have with it are due to an <UNK> to the plot devices used in the movie the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems that doesn't make it bad just not something i'd go far br br it is a little <UNK> so i might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for kids movie like this br br however all of that goes out the window when that <UNK> the one in all the trailers comes on screen his time is limited but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys <UNK> could you stick in a little more <UNK> ' every time it's getting <UNK> dull that doesn't save the movie but you can leave saying <UNK> least there was one aspect where i couldn't stop laughing ' br br and of course visually it won't disappoint but that's almost a given with pixar flicks of all of their stuff i'd put this at the bottom but that isn't in itself bad
<START> i would of enjoyed this film but van damme just does the same old same old rubbish time after time poo <UNK> fight scenes as per usually the only thing this loser left out was the russians normally end up being killed in the end this film is utter <UNK> do do of the highest nature please please please van damme get some acting lessons you need them anyone who likes van damme has issues it seems sad that the only way van damme ever gets any acting work is when he co writes the film co produces the film and does the screen play for the film avoid van damme and his <UNK> back nasty wig i give this film a two out of ten because the one with the the <UNK> was better to add insult to injury i wasted a <UNK> on this <UNK>
<START> white man progress <UNK> bad first nations nature animals good simple formula actually in past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status <UNK> now it is used to attack it however that being said i think the movie does succeed in <UNK> hackneyed <UNK> because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone you may not be <UNK> with the movie's <UNK> <UNK> of how the west was won er lost but anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the western <UNK> the movie also conveniently <UNK> the fact that there were no horses in america before the evil white man brought them there anyway i liked it the quality of the animation especially the opening shot is incredible
<START> ever read jim thompson he's hard boiled noir with the most extreme <UNK> and <UNK> i've ever encountered there are rarely private detectives in his work just losers <UNK> and small time con artists this film has thompson nailed if god made any real mistakes in this world it was in giving us a will to live when we've got no excuse for it every character in the film <UNK> on a <UNK> edge between surreal and creepy realism there's sleazy conniving uncle bud played by bruce dern and <UNK> well <UNK> doc <UNK> played by george <UNK> jason <UNK> gives a wonderful often heart wrenching performance as kid collins a none too bright shy ex fighter who's more scared of himself than of anyone else rachel ward is fay the sexy femme fatale who we can't quite figure out it's not your standard film noir nor is it intended to be after dark my sweet along with the <UNK> are two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers jim thompson
<START> this movie is not only the funniest film ever created it's the greatest my hats off to mr and mrs <UNK> and the rest of the wacky wacky cast good morning satan want a <UNK> see it post <UNK> go see it now
<START> one of the worst movies i've seen shoddy camera work crappy <UNK> usage film was grainy script was terrible i mean come on how predictable was the big battle at the end br br some of the fight scenes were okay i guess br br some scenes were so bad it was comical like <UNK> getting the horse and riding at the end lol i mean really a horse oh cant forget how the bad <UNK> roll around in the same vehicle throughout the entire movie one would think that after <UNK> key witness and federal agents they <UNK> been <UNK> down etc etc really don't bother watching it
<START> the first thing i thought when i saw this films was it is not really a film at least it is not what we imagine <UNK> when we hear the word film it is entirely symbolic everything in it has a <UNK> meaning so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way you will find it strange if you are not <UNK> with philosophy religion spiritual life you will think it's just a fairy tale and even a weird one chaotic for me the legend of zu is perfectly transparent and i do like it it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness the fight that is as old as humanity and every one who is in search of the <UNK> in this life is confronted with it the film is obviously made by <UNK> i am not a <UNK> my religion and the vision of the world and human is different but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other it is a really beautiful film and i which we had more films like this films that have a meaning there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly
<START> wow after <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> city after about 15 minutes south park is about more than meaningless <UNK> i guess some people just don't get it i was interested in this movie i read quite some positive stuff and the <UNK> and look of the movie seemed far from the total trash i expected after <UNK> city br br surprise the movie isn't total trash but the problem seems to be exactly that <UNK> rose tries to walk in the footsteps of german horror splatter cinema like <UNK> <UNK> and the likes that means <UNK> is in parts extremely gory and detailed the gore fx are not really believable but ok the acting is ok but in some cases plain sucks the <UNK> chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and doesn't get better till she's shot br br so what is the problem the movie is gory has a typical german underground vibe including the classic <UNK> shots in blood ok fx and a modern feel to it like the <UNK> already promised br br 1 the script is total <UNK> you get a typical <UNK> lost in the woods story with some guys gal camping out and meeting a <UNK> <UNK> family everything is just leading towards the torture <UNK> scenes and seems unbelievably random and pointless this is the first thing that makes <UNK> half hearted br br 2 random is also the perfect description for a lot of the camera work i liked the repetitive cut to the <UNK> in the extended <UNK> torture scene either they had no material or the editor works in a <UNK> store even worse the editing sure its modern and far better than a lot of other movies in the genre but its random you got an <UNK> of that typical exposure effect everywhere and with no meaning its just there all the time then there's some grainy <UNK> film look which also is just thrown in here and there for the sake of it i don't get the meaning br br 3 like the <UNK> mentioned effects there is a lot of repetitive stuff in here for example most of the kills are edited with multiple <UNK> of stabbing and <UNK> its ok once but here its annoying and fake especially towards the end annoying also attributes the music which is <UNK> used without any change in the background it doesn't take long until it makes the movie hardly bearable br br 4 from all this comes the biggest problem of this movie and many others in my opinion if you make a splatter movie with trashy feel its pretty idiotic to polish it with special fx and new school editing it looks like they take it way too serious its no fun because the decent gore fx are plain wasted in this context and where the classic gore fx are ok the computer fx in scenes like the stabbing in the mouth or the <UNK> in the ending look rather silly and 3d splatter mostly sucks to me even in movies with a budget and decent 3d artists br br i often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and <UNK> is just another example it might be time to put it in the tomb its no fun has no character and is too trashy for its look the script is a cheap try on wrong turn and tcm leading absolutely nowhere you can take that literally the ending is just there and as random as many other things here i love you in a splatter flick come on <UNK> tries to <UNK> a lot and fails you can sure fast forward through this movie for some extensive <UNK> acid face melting <UNK> <UNK> and classic friday the 13th style stabbing of a couple while <UNK> in a <UNK> bloody <UNK> <UNK> but its really hard to get through this total failure especially because you can see it could have been something
<START> excellent warner bros effort starring errol flynn in one of his best screen performances it's often <UNK> as his best and i can't really judge fully until i have seen his dawn <UNK> however his work in they died with their boots on takes some beating i'm a big flynn fan he's my favourite actor after james mason it also helps that he's an aussie and i think he's just marvellous a great screen presence and also a great actor he is the <UNK> of gentleman jim as the legendary boxer with the fancy <UNK> but he is also backed up by a <UNK> warm and funny script and <UNK> <UNK> direction every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of it's pace he truly was a born film maker walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant great final scene between ward <UNK> and flynn add to that great production values the gay nineties never looked better and a lovely supporting cast and it's pretty much perfect entertainment alan hale usually played <UNK> sidekick but here is his father and it still all works <UNK> smith is <UNK> love interest the pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other
<START> bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex so he buys a van to aid in this quest the acting is lame the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheap thrills the makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there <UNK> of other films of the time but fell a long way short they even resort to bobby <UNK> on a banana skin because this will supposedly add comedic value br br i'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film if you like <UNK> this is another classic <UNK> kind of role but he's only a supporting actor and there for cliché value
<START> this is the definitive movie version of hamlet branagh cuts nothing but there are no wasted moments
<START> there are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of let's say little monsters or scary looking dolls which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie really br br dr feinstone corbin bernsen has been a successful dentist for several years now but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the <UNK> he <UNK> and he brings his anger and frustration to his work well give a mad dentist a <UNK> and a mouth and you can probably guess what happens next br br as i said brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should in particular the ending is a huge let down last note watch for mark <UNK> you can count on me eternal sunshine in this one br br 5 10
<START> although this was obviously a low budget production the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing one of <UNK> few musical roles to date he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his <UNK> skills as well watch for the <UNK> also starring jason connery a great children's story and very likable characters
<START> this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences its <UNK> are a couple of dud detectives whose <UNK> attitudes lead them down some very silly roads chasing the big murder case you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime no nudity but lots of sexual <UNK> slapstick silliness everything <UNK> go for low budget but very entertaining definite cult classic potential
<START> this is a very intriguing short movie by david lynch and saying the name david lynch is probably enough for a lot of people this is your typical lynch short a blonde and a brunette are in a dark room the blonde has been crying the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde and that's about it br br with a lot of silent moments but with the haunting music from <UNK> <UNK> there is a strange form of suspense this short feels a little like <UNK> dr ' a movie i loved and therefore i liked this one as well it is probably especially for lynch fans but there is a chance you like this
<START> from the moment the film begins already there is a <UNK> as this film takes place on the borders of <UNK> and the middle east and is also an international film one would expect proper accents portrayed this is not done as the majority of the cast sound american also i find the acting to be <UNK> at best the story line a little difficult to follow from the beginning who is who otherwise the film is very accurate in costume and scenery if you want to see a movie to get a feel of what it was like in the past albeit the lack of accents then this movie is worth a rent if you're looking for a movie as epic as kingdom of heaven then look elsewhere
<START> while exploring some <UNK> with his wife a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some <UNK> side effects br br occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent though under used makeup effects don't save this b horror flick from being a sub par tale of man becomes creature the bat people aka it lives by night suffers from its senseless story that's <UNK> plotted and lackluster in pacing the plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens or even a satisfying conclusion for it all the cast is fairly mediocre in their performances br br still i give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations the makeup work of the late stan winston is pretty good too but it doesn't get much of a showcase here a missed opportunity for sure br br definitely one of the lesser man creature flicks out there br br 1 2 out of
<START> please make me forget please please this is the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch i consider the film an insult to my brain as well as my <UNK> who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film i have yet to see what damage it has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences what a load of garbage and don't get me started about the acting someone please help me forget weird science come back everything is forgiven br br i am proud to give this film the first 1 here at imdb and i've voted for hundreds of films many of them c p but this is so bad i can't even believe it someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a film someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film someone read the script and <UNK> for it someone saw the film and decided not to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity these are the questions i want answers to not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well you know
<START> name just says it all i watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in korea he had great admiration for the man the disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the man's life interestingly enough the man's entire life would have made such an epic bio <UNK> that it is <UNK> to imagine the cost for production br br some posters <UNK> to the flawed characteristics about the man which are cheap shots the theme of the movie duty honor country are not just mere words <UNK> from the lips of a high <UNK> officer it is the deep <UNK> of one man's total devotion to his country br br ironically peck being the liberal that he was garnered a better understanding of the man he does a great job showing the <UNK> general <UNK> with the <UNK> side of the man
<START> in this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot it is actually nice to watch because <UNK> does a great job at presenting the <UNK> conflicts and the <UNK> relationships this makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for in fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap definitely not a deep movie even if it wants to be but better than an average college movie
<START> drew barrymore is an actress that has gone through bad periods not only in her career but in her personal life too after being a <UNK> child actress she <UNK> into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality while she has <UNK> from that dark past this movie stays as a reminder of drew <UNK> worst days br br the movie starts with an interesting premise very reminiscent to brian de palma's raising cain with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horror thriller barrymore stars as holly gooding a young woman who is trying to make a new life in california after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother br br suddenly her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love in the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend patrick <UNK> george <UNK> will try to help holly to face the demons of her past br br unlike de palma's underrated thriller <UNK> is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never <UNK> it's purpose it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history while barrymore is definitely not at her best she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance the rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad over the top performances although leslie hope manages to be among the best of them br br the script is full of clichés and de palma's influence is quite obvious while the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly doesn't do any good it has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons and excessive use of special effects br br the make up effects are done by the outstanding <UNK> and are really among the few good things in the movie however the bizarre over use of the effects in the totally out of context ending <UNK> the impact of <UNK> work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing br br the fact that this is a b movie is no excuse for it's low quality as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie sadly all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second worthy for <UNK> beauty 3 10
<START> i was 10 years old when this show was on tv by far it was my favorite the actors were very credible alexandra <UNK> was just gorgeous i just order the dvd 15 episodes they didn't have super powers they just had superior human skills strength hearing sight the 3 actors were very good in their rolls very believable there was a good story in each episode at the time there were no special effects or explosions everywhere so the script was suppose to be good and the characters performs were great there was no fancy stuff like in other shows they didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff
<START> man even plan 9 from outer space is better than this movie this flick doesn't have enough plot for half an hour yet they managed to <UNK> it for an eternity of more than an hour jet li and corey <UNK> are pretty good specially in those exaggerated fight scenes but stuff like the legend of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left <UNK>
<START> dirty harry has to track down a rape victim who <UNK> revenge by shooting her <UNK> in the <UNK> before killing them probably a more apt punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever like she and her sister has anyway an action packed story set again in san francisco and santa <UNK> the chief rapist played by andy drake is suitably vile and gets his punishment at the end of course not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original dirty harry
<START> well made but basically dreary low life melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle <UNK> writer director <UNK> <UNK> with a good deal of <UNK> detail given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesn't do him any <UNK> and he does seem to have been a troubled man as <UNK> also says that <UNK> often disappeared for days on end during the shoot br br the acting is uniformly excellent however despite their relatively young age <UNK> and co star gerard depardieu as the title character were already at the <UNK> of modern french stars a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this day br br i have 3 more of <UNK> films in my vhs to watch pile albeit all in french without english subtitles due to this fact but also <UNK> oppressive realism in spite of its <UNK> artistic merit i can't say that i'm in any particular hurry to check them out now
<START> i saw this movie primarily to see brooke burke as jill who i had meet briefly in la at a <UNK> trade show in her first feature film i was hoping to see more of her but thought she did very well acting her role since she is such a beautiful and <UNK> tv host and model it was not surprising i was left wondering why she was killed and what happened as a result maybe i just missed it br br i wasn't really sure about the genre of this movie and although i liked the actors i felt like it was for a college audience i tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasn't my favorite genre but felt like i had <UNK> the gags it seemed to drag out in some places leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had and like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending br br having written a couple of scripts i know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions how many movies you have seen studied and those you relate with at a point in time br br in a nutshell i found it interesting but not a satisfying plot and ending for me if jill brooke burke would have returned through the <UNK> in the end and kicked everyone's ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating
<START> one of the more enjoyable aspects of asian cinema or indeed most anything done outside these <UNK> than <UNK> united states are the <UNK> that crop up in post world war two japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a <UNK> endless variety of subjects many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion the same thing happens in genre film making as well though again i'm referring to movies made outside the u where we're just too sophisticated in our close <UNK> to appreciate anything that isn't about or by us would an american company for instance back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler el <UNK> or a werewolf paul naschy or a real life martial artist bruce lee as for television forget it while i still love the kung fu series that starred the late david carradine i've always felt that the <UNK> version of asian martial arts was how to put it kindly a bit lacking to this very day there hasn't been a pay per view channel to feature asian martial artists playing asian martial artists in asia there are lots of soft core porn <UNK> as entertainment shows but the so called action channel for instance has yet to <UNK> or to produce a true martial arts <UNK> before brother <UNK> was investigating murders on the bbc there was of all things at least one kung fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery the 5 deadly <UNK> in its own right as fascinating as any other genre based <UNK> western cop show etc this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work it's now available from dragon <UNK> and the print is beautiful and the dvd commentary by <UNK> logan is exactly the kind of intelligent thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve if you're a martial arts movie fan <UNK> one of the greatest movie genres of all time specifically the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s are getting a long <UNK> second life and greatly appreciated second look on dvd
<START> turgid dialogue feeble characterization harvey keitel a judge he plays more like an off duty <UNK> and a tension free plot <UNK> to make one of the <UNK> films of all time you feel sorry for the cast as they try to <UNK> comedy from a dire and lifeless script avoid
<START> br br step aside for hollywood veterans the <UNK> brothers were <UNK> thats what <UNK> <UNK> and thats what it got however like so many of its recent decisions this one was a <UNK> mistake br br the director is so out of touch with todays audience attempting to bring back physical <UNK> and gags in place of funny dialogue is just a disaster i knew it the audience knew it and the cast knew it br br what a shame why did they ever consider changing directors not only that but the two <UNK> brothers played as two of four primary characters without them its just a farce and a sad one br br <UNK> br br
<START> i have loved this movie all of my life it's such an intelligent story also with plenty of classical <UNK> <UNK> the ship that went missing decades earlier was called the <UNK> well in classical mythology this was the man who slew the <UNK> a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures in <UNK> walter <UNK> is clearly the <UNK> himself and his id monster br br i like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a <UNK> of intelligence unlike most modern blockbusters which spend <UNK> on special effects but about 1 50 on a screenplay br br cheers
<START> i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap if you look at <UNK> pictures posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers <UNK> kissing or something to do with friendships whereas <UNK> pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap when i watch it i feel like i'm watching a police version of <UNK> street or something similar i have to say i still like the bill as i'm interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over br br as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill most of the great characters are gone now although a few still remain i think and i'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't its just that they lack the tough looks personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble br br overall being one of the only police programs on television these days the bill will always be a <UNK> interesting thing to watch but like i say it has lost a lot of its <UNK> if thats the right spelling and would now be <UNK> as a terrible unreal television soap br br recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved 2 10
<START> this german documentary in english is about a scottish <UNK> <UNK> named andy goldsworthy he makes art from objects he finds in nature for example early in the film we see him taking sections of <UNK> and <UNK> them together with a little <UNK> into a <UNK> shape that seems to repeatedly go through a <UNK> rock br br of course the <UNK> melt but that <UNK> is a part of most of <UNK> work he goes to a site and gets a feeling for it deciding <UNK> what to make that day he talks of having a dialog with the rocks and other <UNK> that he works with attempting to work with rather than against them it might be stones or flowers or leaves or sticks the <UNK> might last for minutes or years or might not even last long enough to be completed and photographed the work seems to be more of a process than a goal br br the film and the work is beautiful inspiring and thought provoking it moves pretty slowly which is appropriate for the material but you should be sure to go when you have had a good <UNK> sleep but do go if you have the opportunity br br search the web for some other pages about andy goldsworthy or to read about his local <UNK> at <UNK> university there are also several books available with photographs of his <UNK> br br my thoughts skip reading this part if you want to find what this film means to you completely <UNK> i recall a couple of ideas that occurred to me while watching the film which i thought i would share for those of you still reading first the <UNK> nature of much of andy <UNK> work reminded me of the natural <UNK> and flow of human life we're born we live and eventually we die that's natural and that's also naturally a part of <UNK> art br br the other thought was to be <UNK> with the way that goldsworthy has managed to <UNK> his passion and his work so thoroughly into his life most of us have work which is <UNK> at best a life which we hardly notice living and passions which we really mean to spend more time on if we even remember what they are andy goldsworthy has managed to create an <UNK> of all of these aspects of his life that looks like it works very well and is <UNK> for him and those around him wow br br seen on 8 28 2002
<START> this film once sensational for its forward thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual <UNK> has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and <UNK> by <UNK> in many countries given how <UNK> sweden eventually became the <UNK> of its politics once controversial appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later and its sex scenes at one time the subject of sensational <UNK> trials look pretty tame in a modern context nevertheless the film and accompanying documentaries <UNK> its many <UNK> and influences remains <UNK> watchable as an early <UNK> of 60's youth rebellion one part of the film that still holds up its self consciousness with respect to the <UNK> <UNK> every once in a while the filmmakers film themselves making the film the <UNK> <UNK> of this still <UNK> a chuckle
<START> it's a road movie with a killer on board brian <UNK> david duchovny a sophisticated <UNK> writer wants to conduct field research on american serial killers but neither he nor his girlfriend carrie michelle forbes has the money for a cross country tour of murder sites so they <UNK> for someone to share travel <UNK> who they end up with is a young couple early <UNK> brad pitt and his girlfriend adele juliette lewis two better examples of poor white trash you will never find in all of cinema br br indeed early and adele are what make this film so entertaining as they <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and otherwise behave in ways i haven't seen since reruns of the beverly <UNK> <UNK> idea of california people think faster out there on account of all that warm weather cold weather makes people stupid that's enough to convince adele i guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here to which early responds proudly it sure does early continues to <UNK> adele about california you never have to buy no fruit on account it's all on the trees and they ain't got no speed limits and i hear your first <UNK> rent is free state law br br but poor early has some well mental problems which become ever more obvious to brian and carrie as the four <UNK> proceed west across the u s as they enter the desert <UNK> with its beautifully stark landscape kalifornia starts to look more and more like the <UNK> 1986 and early starts to act more and more like john <UNK> everyone's <UNK> <UNK> whose terror seemed so <UNK> br br in kalifornia the acting is uneven <UNK> performance is flat brad pitt is surprisingly effective despite his overacting at times michelle forbes is great as the avant garde <UNK> artist but my choice for best performance goes to juliette lewis with her <UNK> voice and heavy duty southern accent she is stunning as the naive highly animated child like adele br br toward the end the film takes on a twilight zone feel to it as our <UNK> enter a <UNK> nuclear test site with a <UNK> old house full of test <UNK> the plot <UNK> rather <UNK> into unnecessary and preposterous violence an ending that was somewhat disappointing br br overall however kalifornia is an entertaining film thanks to a clever concept great scenery especially in the second half good cinematography great dialogue and that wonderful performance by juliette lewis
<START> alexandre <UNK> remake of the hills have eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006 not only was it a remake of a classic horror film but it was pretty damned good too so nearly a year later we are being treated to the sequel to that remake while original <UNK> wes craven is back as producer and co scripted this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake a group of military <UNK> stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run <UNK> of the mutant family from the first film at least those that remain plus some new ones there's plenty of gore to be had here what <UNK> me about this film is the utter lack of characterization the viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we haven't gotten into them even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time nothing gore for the sake of gore is pointless there has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting nothing that happens here is interesting and what is it lately with rape scenes in films here we get yet another one for no real reason hopefully this is one set of hills that won't be visited again
<START> i came to watch <UNK> part two of steven <UNK> biopic of che guevara without having seen the <UNK> film and without more than a <UNK> knowledge of che's life at the same time i was rather <UNK> that this would be both a heavy going history lesson and an <UNK> love letter to the iconic revolutionary as it turns out this film far <UNK> my expectations br br <UNK> works remarkably well as a <UNK> film the story of che's failed attempt to lead a revolution in bolivia then under military rule is a compelling tragedy the initial <UNK> brought by che's arrival <UNK> to lead the <UNK> war is lost as misfortune follows misfortune the odds stack up against the <UNK> us backing for the <UNK> army hostile conditions in the <UNK> suspicious locals and che's failing health are just some of the difficulties which <UNK> the <UNK> rebellion br br <UNK> portrayal of che is largely <UNK> but this film is no <UNK> the style is <UNK> <UNK> with a subtle and effective soundtrack by <UNK> <UNK> adding quiet drama to many scenes che is undoubtedly the centre of the film but there are very few close ups of his face and we are encouraged to see the people fighting alongside him and sometimes against him too where soderbergh wishes to demonstrate che's virtues we see it in small episodes such as the loyal <UNK> who <UNK> two fellow <UNK> when they question che's <UNK> and <UNK> the sacrifice that he has made in leaving behind cuba to fight again for revolution br br the direction throughout is superb part two feels tightly edited despite its narrow focus and is able to communicate a great deal through images without the need for a narrator to spell things out for the audience at the start of the film we see a few short clips of lavish parties in post revolutionary cuba immediately <UNK> us with ideas as to why che would sacrifice his old life to fight again in another country later on the portrayal of <UNK> <UNK> through the <UNK> <UNK> stands out as a strikingly beautiful scene and helps to create a feeling of the <UNK> of the task before this tiny band of <UNK> br br if there is a problem with the film it is the distance between the viewer and che which though it does allow us to appreciate the context of the <UNK> and the people around him makes it hard for us to understand him better as a person true <UNK> del toro is utterly convincing in the lead role  so much so that it is difficult to remember that you are watching an actor and not the man himself however watching <UNK> as a <UNK> film means that we are given precious little insight into what is <UNK> che's thoughts words and actions it is to be hoped that this is more to the <UNK> in the first part of <UNK> biopic i cannot comment on that yet and certainly the strength of part two is making me look forward eagerly to seeing the prequel
<START> young <UNK> and her <UNK> grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world this interpretation of gabriel garcia <UNK> la <UNK> y <UNK> <UNK> da la <UNK> <UNK> may not rub <UNK> <UNK> the right way <UNK> the story stays intact and still carries the full force of the work the strength of this film is in its acting especially <UNK> as the grandmother <UNK> fans and <UNK> <UNK> alike will enjoy this movie for its real gritty brand of <UNK>
<START> yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thriller br br the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening br br fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and <UNK> is good br br very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story
<START> well i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason i was not disappointed the story was actually pretty interesting the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil and who is using them for good the catch being that during training all of the clan were masked and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names br br the fights are a joy to watch as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style <UNK> my favorite snake <UNK> lizard and <UNK> the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action br br the one <UNK> to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence but stick with it and you won't be disappointed
<START> hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind genuine tour de star wars force luke how strong vader the strength of a small <UNK> in which being the master he is he doesn't even break a sweat <UNK> <UNK> himself <UNK> <UNK> and that's with almost 2 hours of <UNK> his way thru history its <UNK> europe and more br br from <UNK> middle of the night i've invented a <UNK> to the british <UNK> do you have a flag and ancient <UNK> gods jeff the god of <UNK> and many more this is fish flop on the floor to <UNK> your <UNK> funny br br and i confess to having passed on this video dozens of times over the years seeing as a british <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on a chair is one <UNK> of a rental after all especially one going back 10 years now and yet the material is not only timeless but almost <UNK> turning present day into nothing more than an <UNK> funnier <UNK> version of where we were at a decade ago although come to think about it that may just be a coincidence
<START> what can i say it's a damn good movie see it if you still haven't great camera works and lighting techniques awesome just awesome orson welles is incredible 'the lady from <UNK> can certainly take the place of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> gregory peck gives a brilliant performance in this film the last 15 minutes or <UNK> are great and peck is an absolute joy to watch the same cannot however be said for the rest of the film it's not awful and i'm sure it was made with good intentions but the only real reason if i were to be honest to see it is peck for the rest you are better off just reading the old testament
<START> this is the second part of 'the <UNK> a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of 'the <UNK> br br in this one we learn how men and machines could not work and live together it is a little history lesson in the world of 'the <UNK> not as good as the first part 'the final flight of the <UNK> but still pretty entertaining
<START> i've just watched roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be toby <UNK> performance really stood out i found myself actually caring about what happens to matt throughout the whole of the film which itself is a lot of fun very <UNK> with a good mix of well rounded characters quite an achievement considering it's short running time there are plenty of good twists throughout as well it will keep you guessing until the end other characters to watch out for are the totally insane tiny and the <UNK> attractive jesse it may not have the huge budget of a hollywood blockbuster but don't let that put you off you could do a lot worse than checking this out you won't regret it good fun 7 10
<START> this piece of crap might have been acclaimed 60 years ago but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with the native american indians played by white men the right wing <UNK> james stewart was a huge racist in real life just like his close friend john wayne in 1971 stewart had actor hal williams fired from the jimmy stewart show a short lived series that mercifully <UNK> just because williams was black as if that were not bad enough this film is very dated and boring watch dances with wolves instead for a less racist view br br stewart was in his forties when this awful movie was made and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a <UNK> chasing after 16 year old debra <UNK> i'm surprised it was even allowed br br 0 10
<START> i know i should like this film and i do for the most part but as other's have mentioned it is a bit long in the tooth i to also found the raging <UNK> of the all male crew to be a bit annoying it's a wonder they didn't start <UNK> and howling at the <UNK> as well i also have to say that overall the movie leaves me cold it's a very <UNK> atmosphere that <UNK> the film on the plus side the effects are great besides the cartoon monster as are the effects props costumes and of course <UNK> if the robot was not in this film i don't think it would have been as popular as it was is the second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten <UNK> of the <UNK> as many times as i've seen this movie the <UNK> still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were based on what was being produced at that time besides this island earth forbidden planet is miles above the average sci fi movies of the time being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment certainly a classic in its own right flaws and all and deservedly so
<START> intrigued by the synopsis every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover this is not necessarily to be <UNK> as a good sign i purchased ben and arthur without knowing a thing about it this is my second and i assure you it will be my last purchase of a culture q connection video as far as i am concerned this dvd is nothing but a blatant rip off i do not make this observation lightly  i am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and i can state with some authority and without <UNK> that ben and arthur is quite simply the worst film i have ever sat through in my life period my collection boasts over 1 <UNK> films <UNK> on them on dvd and of those well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed i hardly own every gay movie ever made but i am comfortable in stating that i pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often i buy videos without knowing anything about the film sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise <UNK> <UNK> it's in the water <UNK> and normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that i stumbled upon accidentally so when i read on the box that ben and arthur concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the christian right one of my favorite subjects i decided to take the <UNK> sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another culture q connection title visions of sugar <UNK> that film was pretty bad but compared to ben and arthur it viewed like gone with the wind so what was so wrong with ben and arthur plenty to begin with the plot such as it was was totally ridiculous this film almost made me sympathetic to the christian right  we are asked to believe not only that a church would <UNK> a member because his brother is gay but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls like this even makes sense the writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all and several plot points reflect no logic follow up or connection to the story murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay <UNK> right wing conflict on both sides and the acting is so bad that it's difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired the characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay and <UNK> stereotypes to boot the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting this film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever and the <UNK> should be ashamed of themselves the only advantage this picture has over my other culture q connection purchase visions of <UNK> is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue hardly a distinction since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is it is an embarrassment to <UNK> culture and i intend to warn everyone i possibly can before they waste their money on it at 9 95 this film would have been way <UNK> i understand that it's soon to be re <UNK> under 20 which is still highway robbery i paid the original price of <UNK> 95 and i never felt more cheated in my life the only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews  i have seen user reviews for this film on numerous <UNK> and there is always one or two that praise the director writer actor in such a way that it's obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this ed wood wannabe how sad how desperate i just wish imdb would allow you to <UNK> zero stars or even minus zero if ever a film deserved it this is it
<START> i wouldn't be surprised if soderbergh was <UNK> to avoid making pre revolution cuba as <UNK> corrupt as it was merely <UNK> a few <UNK> isn't going to make it with the younger crowd still part one which is almost entirely shot in the jungle does capture the feel of that place especially when <UNK> the <UNK> areas of cuba i liked del <UNK> interpretation of che <UNK> personality and the actor who plays castro <UNK> also did a great job against all odds it's clear soderbergh doesn't look down on these people but it's also clear he's not going to <UNK> their case to <UNK> far removed from the recent past some of the more important historical aspects <UNK> what i've read to my knowledge castro did not court the soviet union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the united states were exhausted but on other aspects he is right on especially as to the <UNK> by the <UNK> as the island went other rebel control the country's <UNK> was left empty
<START> being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre and therefore having seen a large number of these films it is rare that one strikes me as totally unique for that matter it is equally rare that i am <UNK> for breath through the laughter during several scenes the love story is a little thin on the ground but i'd say that's probably for the best as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on comedy and in any case it stretches the <UNK> of credibility just a little more than i like most <UNK> <UNK> to do the four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film but in any film i've seen in a long while i <UNK> for the <UNK> of moments before finally choosing a 10 over a 9 as a rating as i believe that far too many people use it <UNK> and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact i'm also a big meg ryan fan which helps but this is one of the few films i've seen in which i'd say she is <UNK> overshadowed she and tim robbins are cast as the leads but for me play second <UNK> to the antics of the bumbling <UNK> a genuine laugh out loud type film
<START> russell my <UNK> is gorgeous in this film but more than that the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity fabulous love story between <UNK> and <UNK> i replay their scenes over and over again anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people all characters are cast and portrayed excellently
<START> i really hope that <UNK> new <UNK> wasn't trying to make a serious horror or even action movie when they made <UNK> 3 the movie is flat out silly from start to finish even the humor in <UNK> is funny because it's bad definitely a high water mark in the <UNK> bad it's <UNK> genre if you enjoy the very worst of the worst this is for you
<START> when i rented domino i was expected it to be very dumb i hate films that have really flashy editing and cinematography and domino also just got very bad reviews the only reason i watched it is because i like have liked <UNK> knightley mickey rourke christopher walken and tony scott on other occasions i also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories yes the editing and cinematography were frantic the story was weak and the acting was mediocre but i still loved this film for some bizarre reason domino was very very entertaining and often very funny it was horribly underrated when it was released i think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like <UNK> last film man on fire and instead just got wonderful entertainment i actually understand why everybody hated domino so much even though i loved it and recommend it
<START> i am not a parent neither am i a male but i was able to identify with every character's <UNK> and pains br br this is a movie teenagers should watch maybe that way they will start <UNK> the value of family again i'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love family and friendship br br it was very interesting to watch patrick <UNK> in a different role than that of bobby <UNK> and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance he showed at an early age that he is capable of heartfelt drama he should be offered more serious roles note <UNK> his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the <UNK> festival in 2006 br br this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families but i recommend it to the entire family br br i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times because it portrays the values that are important in life
<START> a shaky hand held camera was used presumably to give the film a documentary look but the effect was so exaggerated that i started to get motion sickness just from watching it it looked like someone with cerebral <UNK> was holding the camera no offense meant to <UNK> <UNK> but i don't think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer the camera work was so nauseating and so distracting that my wife and i considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture i checked back a while later it was showing on tv and it hadn't gotten any better i suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad <UNK> you may have eaten
<START> the first of the tarzan movies staring johnny <UNK> the plot has already been <UNK> so i wont go into it again just know that the actors who play jane and tarzan were born for the role if you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day tarzan films as a reference you are missing a real treat doesn't matter how far we've come in movie making makeup set designs no one will ever play tarzan as well as johnny <UNK> did he was and is tarzan
<START> i was on france around march <UNK> and i love to go to this film festivals i knew about this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> but i've never went to it i decided to go and then i caught <UNK> y van 4 br br the film is stunning it doesn't caused the impact on me like with the mexican users because it was french subtitled but it's still shocking br br this film is a satire about urban violence about kidnapping and crime on the streets in mexico it is a crude portrait of the city of a metropolis <UNK> express with a stunning <UNK> <UNK> which was also a satire of kidnapping almost but with a more serious tone has and i think so some kinda connection with <UNK> y van 4 a sort of redemption story and that how much is too much man on fire that was stunningly strong was also not a satire but a crude portrait into the streets of mexico or it is like the brave one a film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard this is like the usual suspects it has some plot twists and turns but that makes it even more believable verdict a film that shocks and makes you believe that there's no security on the streets anymore stunning dialogue impressive direction and astonishing performances <UNK> y van 4 is a film that you won't forget soon leaves you shaking and stunned
<START> i've just read the most recent remarks about this movie and i would like to respond you're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group n w a which dates back to the beginning in 1988 in 1989 ice cube left the band to go solo and ultimately in 1991 the band breaking up when dr <UNK> left which led to a lot of <UNK> starting with the departure of ice cube and dr <UNK> in 1991 this story was somewhat based on that br br further more this movie was a 90 minute laughing spree the way they explained the <UNK> juice song to be a political statement was hilarious not to mention the love song tasty was <UNK> up and when vanilla <UNK> got his ass kicked just like the record company executive is also hilarious and having they're <UNK> getting shot every time too br br people who didn't enjoy this movie probably didn't get it or were complete idiots my opinion
<START> city hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country state or any sort of major political table granted it shines on new york city which is a huge political <UNK> especially nowadays but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the <UNK> on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the <UNK> right hand director harold <UNK> is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done <UNK> rising <UNK> and domestic <UNK> and i think in many ways he <UNK> so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault i mean city hall is meant to be a political drama not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and <UNK> of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out what else or rather who else al pacino the film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the <UNK> office and the inner <UNK> of the city as the film continues it <UNK> its political spectrum to include a <UNK> boss and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city as events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up br br i absolutely hate talking about al pacino i mean even if once he didn't give a good performance how could i ever say it the man is acting <UNK> there is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor in city hall pacino plays the new york city mayor he has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very <UNK> politician he also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches i've ever seen at the <UNK> <UNK> funeral i re watched that speech four times and the first time i watched pacino give it my mouth <UNK> open and i almost wanted to stand up and applaud its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by pacino john cusack who i really do enjoy as an actor turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy mayor kevin <UNK> he is kind of the focus of the film and him and pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance he seems like he's trying too hard his accent is just bizarre and although he is supposed to be <UNK> and <UNK> he doesn't get seem to pull it off maybe he was having an off film bridget fonda on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her performance is very similar to <UNK> in that she just doesn't seem to find her groove with this character danny aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as <UNK> boss with ties to the mafia frank <UNK> martin <UNK> makes a decent cameo as judge under <UNK> walter stern br br the problem with city hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors everyone is okay there is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy and of course you have al pacino in a rather small supporting role but he's absolutely brilliant at it and <UNK> and <UNK> every other actor in the film it almost feels like maybe they are <UNK> by him being on screen with them so city hall could have been this huge political epic drama thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one but it still has to be seen for pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics if you just won't see this movie than find <UNK> speech at james bone funeral because the word <UNK> doesn't seem to give it justice but you can see what makes al pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this <UNK> of a speech and makes you feel it if you're a john cusack fan which i am he's definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice a decent movie but unfortunately potential loss 7 5 10

<START> a seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating the premise seems simple enough <UNK> a girl interested in studying the <UNK> wants to go to school but only boys are allowed to study so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in she does and becomes close friends with <UNK> who is to be married to a beautiful woman named <UNK> <UNK> family learns <UNK> brother committed suicide and the wedding is called off <UNK> now calling herself <UNK> is then selected to marry <UNK> she does but it is never <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> go away for a few days and <UNK> <UNK> reveals her secret to him the movie ends with <UNK> returning to and marrying <UNK> and <UNK> going to america to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise br br the plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long but there are several things that ruin it for starters there is the constant singing i can already hear the critics shouting yes i know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers but the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them the songs become tedious after a while and there isn't as much dancing as one would expect many of the songs are forgettable with no real memorable lyrics and those with any significance could easily have been <UNK> by a voice over only one song stands out from the rest <UNK> can you hear me it is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is so the songs really aren't necessary br br second <UNK> makeup which can be seen during her scenes as a man the <UNK> enhanced <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> are all obvious makes it hard for the audience to believe in the <UNK> <UNK> character that she is actually serious and <UNK> her new friends colleagues and even <UNK> into believing she is a man yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing there seems to be a <UNK> as her character talks or rather sings of how she doesn't think she can pull it off but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing this means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences such as her actions which are clear <UNK> the facial differences alone cannot be included as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn't have a beard or other facial hair nevertheless in the <UNK> if a woman dressed as a man but wore as much makeup as <UNK> character did and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing it would have been deemed <UNK> and caused an outrage chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town or even the country therefore the feminine makeup on streisand does not lend to the character's credibility and only <UNK> the plot if it was only applied to make streisand look more beautiful it should have been <UNK> br br <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> herself reveals who she truly is toward the end we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as <UNK> and only when they learn the truth do they become a little <UNK> by now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a <UNK> made vehicle for streisand to fuel br br lastly there are those who are fans of streisand who will find no fault with this film its plot or the songs to those i must <UNK> disagree while she has excellent vocal and acting abilities i am not a fan of her style of singing however i have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals there are even some songs of hers that i like so i am not a <UNK> nor have set out to bash her i have written this review from an honest perspective from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie several times even and has noted the problems within if streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film she could have done so here by not <UNK> her need to show off and prove how talented beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn this movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities make her appear self absorbed and thus turn the film into a laugh fest <UNK> of her fans or audience

<START> the new batman adventures also called <UNK> knights takes place 5 years after the final episodes of batman the animated series b <UNK> and only aired for 24 episodes this isn't a horrible show but it just isn't as good as the original batman animated series i'll start with all the things that i found not to be very good br br first <UNK> first the animation itself long and sweet <UNK> isn't dark anymore the sky is always bright red and orange b <UNK> did this also but it was drawn on a dark <UNK> do the colour of the sky was more ominous in this show the colour of the sky is too bright it all just looks like any other kids show and doesn't seem unique like batman <UNK> did with it's dark cool art style on <UNK> the art style is ok but doesn't remind me of batman anymore every character is comprised of straight lines <UNK> and <UNK> making characters look less human like in the original series b <UNK> characters look more like drawn versions of real people the animation may be more consistent here than in b <UNK> but it definitely isn't as good br br next some of the episodes seem too <UNK> down and childish but some of the subject matter is even stronger than in b <UNK> two face attempting to kill tim drake robin 2 and some villains get some pretty harsh treatment this leads me to my next point br br because this is supposed to take place in the future as well as the final episodes of the batman animated universe many villains do meet their demise or leave forever poison <UNK> apparently <UNK> when a cruise ship explodes two face nearly kills penguin killer croc and himself so he's moved to <UNK> forever joker falls into the <UNK> tower of an industrial plant though he will return later on the justice league animated series <UNK> moves away to france leaving batman etc just because the series is ending does not mean that they have to get rid of some great characters the <UNK> motives are pretty bad too there are none in b <UNK> we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined that's why they act the way they do in this show the villains are just committing crimes to progress the story it's like batman just doesn't even care about saving whatever sanity there is left in the people that he fights he just beats them senseless this batman is a <UNK> and <UNK> version of the character but since he's been doing this job for years i can see why he is so harsh br br next the <UNK> character models they're awful gordon <UNK> down about 100 pounds is he sick many villains look stupid joker <UNK> <UNK> mr freeze mad <UNK> and killer croc are among the worst although i do think that some characters look better <UNK> scarecrow <UNK> <UNK> is about the same and <UNK> who is even <UNK> now has pale green skin br br with the series having many faults some episodes are great over the edge mad love beware the <UNK> girls night out old wounds legends of the dark knight and never fear are my favourite ones here in my opinion all of the <UNK> featuring batman in the superman animated series were great also br br the absolute worst part about this show is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original on the dvd features of the original batman animated series they talk about how proud they were with the art style and how difficult some characters were to <UNK> but they did eventually succeed with the difficult animation necessary to <UNK> <UNK> for example on the dvd features of the new batman adventures the creators basically say to hell with b <UNK> this is a fresh new re <UNK> it looks better and we love how we nearly ruined the series alright that is an exaggeration when the creators cast away the amazing art style of b <UNK> that really annoyed me br br it's not a bad show but i still don't like it as much as the original animated series at least the show doesn't talk down to its audience so for that reason i still <UNK> it though some of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth watching br br superman the animated series and justice league the animated series are great follow up shows to batman the animated series and the new batman adventures so give them a watch as well
<START> i just watched this movie on <UNK> let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved the acting writing directing special effects camera crew sound and lighting it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie apparently back in 2007 when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth <UNK> that could go completely invisible for 75 million now a days those things cost about 3 billion and they cant go invisible apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour there was a completely random lesbian scene which i didn't mind but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes oh yeah since its a steven segal movie its predictable as hell all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane
<START> i got hooked on this as apparently abc has <UNK> this show to pearl tv in hong kong it caught be my surprise as it was a break from listening to anything chinese but i started getting <UNK> in as the cast and the story lines are just nyc enough and thoughtful nothing too unbelievable though i think it's very very stereotypical of them to write <UNK> as a potential black man with a sheet that has been the most disappointing aspect the rest is great and i'm sad to learn on imdb that i can't look forward to watching season 2 when i get back to the us i'm am just as disappointed as the other <UNK> that this showed much promise and quality and taste but just as shows that show characters getting closer it's probably harder for people to watch if the start watching several episodes in which is apparently a bit too late for the eager networks
<START> creep your journey <UNK> here some very graphic scenes and well yeah that's about all for this film br br no real plot no storyline no likable characters well <UNK> isn't correct considering you don't have a clue who anyone really is i mean they are being chased by some weird looking <UNK> in the <UNK> who is this thing why is he there that's quite scary i guess but do i really care no i don't why don't i because i don't have a clue who these people are and i don't know if i should want them to live or die it's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you which it rarely does br br this film lacks any meaning any purpose it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the <UNK> of build up it jumps right into the action basically some women and her friends get locked in the london underground get chased by a weird creature then they eventually escape from it br br creep has its moments which make you jump the art is good the location is excellent and the sounds are ok but that isn't what makes a decent horror film so unfortunately all that goes to waste br br it's nothing new another predictable modern <UNK> where kate the lead <UNK> consistently does the stupid hey i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation but <UNK> no i'm going to do the total opposite because i'm a dumb blond thing i wish they wouldn't do that it's done so many times it's boring and gets predictable in fact i'm pretty annoyed the silly woman didn't get stabbed by the <UNK> grey alien looking creature br br your journey <UNK> here is the films tag line well creeps journey <UNK> only a short while into the film if you've had a few beers got a couple of mates back at yours then sure watch it by all means but if you want something original and clever avoid
<START> the great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970 this twenty year spell can be rightly <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of the genre there were musicals prior to that and there have been musicals <UNK> but the true classics seem <UNK> to have been made during that period <UNK> in the rain an american in paris the band <UNK> seven brides for seven brothers <UNK> south pacific the king and i and many more stand tall as much <UNK> products of the age perhaps the last great musical of the <UNK> <UNK> is carol <UNK> 1968 <UNK> <UNK> adapted from <UNK> novel this vibrant musical is a film version of a successful stage production it is a magnificent film winner of six oscars including the best picture award br br orphan oliver twist mark lester lives a miserable existence in a <UNK> his mother having died moments after giving birth to him following an incident one meal time he is <UNK> out of the <UNK> and ends up employed at a funeral <UNK> but oliver <UNK> settle particularly well into his new job and escapes after a few troubled days he makes the long journey to london where he hopes to seek his fortune oliver is taken under the wing of a child <UNK> called the <UNK> <UNK> jack wild who in turn works for fagin ron moody an elderly crook in charge of a gang of child thieves despite the <UNK> nature of the job oliver finds good friends among his new <UNK> he also makes the <UNK> of nancy <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend of the <UNK> and most feared thief of them all the menacing bill <UNK> oliver reed after many adventures oliver discovers his true <UNK> and finds that he is actually from a rich and well to do background but his chances of being reunited with his real family are <UNK> when bill <UNK> <UNK> exploits oliver making him an <UNK> in some particularly <UNK> and ambitious <UNK> br br <UNK> is a brilliantly assembled film consistently pleasing to the eye and excellently acted by its talented cast moody <UNK> his stage role with considerable <UNK> stealing the film from the youngsters with his energetic performance as fagin lester and wild do well too as the young <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out the nancy role and reed <UNK> genuine <UNK> as <UNK> the musical numbers are staged with incredible <UNK> and sense of spectacle â <UNK> <UNK> oscar winning choreography helps make the song and dance set pieces so memorable but the lively performers and the <UNK> direction of carol reed also play their part the unforgettable tunes include <UNK> glorious <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> got to pick a pocket or <UNK> <UNK> do <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> â all immensely catchy songs conveyed via very well put together sequences the film is a thoroughly entertaining experience and never really loses momentum over its entire <UNK> minute duration sit back and enjoy

<START> i don't get this the movie obviously has a pretty good budget it has very good cinematography it has nice pacing good editing and pretty good directing too then why oh why didn't they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and why oh why did they hire such lousy actors that can't act their way out of a paper bag this movie could have been good at most times it looks good and feels good but in the end you realize that the movie was no good at all br br so i would say it's a good production but a bad movie too bad actually br br and <UNK> come one really
<START> i am of the christopher reeve generation it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play superman yet but that doesn't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role and george reeves makes a pretty good <UNK> to knock chris off the top though he just barely falls short that doesn't stop me from enjoying this film it has a lot going for it it has all that a movie needs a plot with beginning middle and end plus all those parts are intelligently written the film is edgy both in acting and storyline something a film noir but with <UNK> the story is both exciting and meaningful this is a movie with a message that isn't too preachy i am still amazed this was shot over 12 days oh the glory days of hollywood when we didn't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell the film is polished and expertly made directed by lee <UNK> <UNK> best known for directing with both speed and <UNK> it never lets the constraints of technology slow it down in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from <UNK> point of view also a few closeups of george in process work and a long shot of an animated superman br br this is now available on dvd as an extra feature on the first season of the george reeves television series a dvd worth <UNK> in its own right the inclusion of the film as its original whole is <UNK> on the cake br br give blood today god bless
<START> <UNK> richards directs another full moon surrender cinema masterpiece of <UNK> this time <UNK> <UNK> dressed in rather <UNK> silver outfit is <UNK> with destroying all evidence of sexual activity however she can't resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them the sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack at least for this sort of film the cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too <UNK> <UNK> is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and <UNK> a little down below she also fits in a little lesbian activity to be honest <UNK> deserves so much better than this kind of fare here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> utterly rubbish movie with <UNK> and soundtrack the only real redeeming features mediocre even for <UNK> <UNK> and clearly a new budget low for them also
<START> i hadn't heard of this film until i read an article about it on the unknown movies website which made me curious as a <UNK> and <UNK> myself i'm an admirer of richard <UNK> work i rate <UNK> gift as one of the finest christmas <UNK> of all time and even though who framed roger rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when i got past the age of sixteen i still have the highest of regard for the amount of work care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals but it seems the man has his faults most notably a <UNK> for going over budget and over schedule and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a super talented individual like williams can go given the right circumstances br br <UNK> ann and andy is a strange <UNK> that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a children's cartoon it tries also to be a musical it tries to be a thousand and one other things as well is it a <UNK> is it a mind <UNK> is it a <UNK> to the innocence of childhood imagination until it finally <UNK> under the weight of its own <UNK> ambitions and aspirations it's beautifully animated for the most part though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention but even that doesn't count for much when you're confronted with the <UNK> absurdity that <UNK> much of the <UNK> here br br there are a number of problems with the film but let's start with <UNK> ann and andy themselves they're the stars of the show yet they have no personalities actually we get the message that andy is a wannabe tough guy i'm no girl's toy he sings and that ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner a little girl called <UNK> carries her upside down but that's all we get to find out about these dull as mud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after i use the word weirdness <UNK> because some weird films can be hugely entertaining but this is just flat out strange the toys and dolls in the <UNK> are supposed to be cute and lovable but they're actually bizarre and disturbing the two <UNK> who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this but even they're relatively normal compared to the constantly <UNK> pirate captain whose <UNK> becomes <UNK> and whose <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when he first catches sight of a glamorous french doll yes this is supposed to be a children's film then there's the music none of which is memorable and all of which is sung by actors who can't sing and to add insult to injury there's a lot of singing in this film when ann and andy finally make it out of the <UNK> the first thing they do is sing a long number in the woods about how scared they are about how they'll always have each other and yes we get the message this seems to go on forever but at least it brings some semblance of <UNK> back to the film not for long though because the <UNK> with the <UNK> knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like it's made from worn and faded <UNK> and bad enough that he's clearly a paranoid <UNK> he also starts <UNK> but this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow the greedy a living breathing <UNK> <UNK> constantly eating pool of <UNK> is so <UNK> creepy and ultimately disturbing you'll hardly believe what you're seeing this is as close to a drug free psychedelic experience as i've ever seen on film then after a l o n g time spent with the greedy along comes the psychotic sir leonard looney and his master king <UNK> whose throne resembles a <UNK> i can't believe i'm actually writing a capsule description of a real film here i just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that i'm not <UNK> about an <UNK> whacked out nightmare i had part of the sequence in looney land resembles one of the old <UNK> <UNK> little <UNK> cartoons for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it probably all this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it but there isn't these scenes are just strange and very very long <UNK> only works when there's a strong idea behind it or takes place against some semblance of reality but nothing in these scenes points towards any kind of reality take away this element and you're left with pure self <UNK> br br as the final scenes unravel even the animation begins to look less impressive the pirate ship <UNK> detailed <UNK> about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the <UNK> went missing during the production and there's a non event of an ending that simply suggests money ran out even at a <UNK> <UNK> minutes in length the film feels like a never ending ordeal and it's understandable why it <UNK> on its original release animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how williams managed to <UNK> this one so spectacularly but he did and there's nothing anyone can do about it

<START> this movie has not aged well maybe it's just the impact and <UNK> characterization acting and directing that we've seen with the sopranos but i just viewed <UNK> honor for the first time on dvd alone br br the experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different but i have to say i was just appalled at the ending not just the violence of it but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending br br i enjoy a good shocker but this seemed so out of character also when was this move supposed to be set the cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s and yet the world trade center towers completed in 1973 were clearly visible in many <UNK> scenes br br another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person br br somehow mid 1980s audiences found this film charming and funny mid eighties meet the late <UNK> only of you can live

<START> you are warned this is a spoiler this movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines great direction the shots were well thought out the actors were very good particularly richard <UNK> tho i would have liked to have seen more of him <UNK> <UNK> and john <UNK> were classic dudley more god bless him could have done better john ritter again i would have liked to see more of him in my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating its just too bad that so much money went into this <UNK> when with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed it they must have paid the writers standard rates to produce one chuckle
<START> the notorious bettie page 2005 br br directed by mary harron br br starring gretchen mol chris bauer <UNK> taylor sarah <UNK> david <UNK> br br mpaa rating r for nudity sexual content and some language br br it seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life from ray charles to johnny cash <UNK> are very posh right now the notorious bettie page is the latest of these to be released on dvd it features gretchen mol as the world's most famous pin up model bettie page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain <UNK> in color unlike ray walk the line and finding <UNK> however this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the oscars this year this movie lacks the emotional <UNK> displayed in other <UNK> and most of the more dramatic moments in bettie <UNK> life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested this does not mean however that it is a bad movie in fact the notorious bettie page is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie a solid work of cinema this film focuses more on <UNK> exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography it is filmed with <UNK> and care and mary <UNK> direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about br br everyone knows bettie page played by mol whether you know her as an <UNK> a simple porn <UNK> know her she is a woman who had a very profound impact on american culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time now most people know her as one of america's first sex symbols a legend to many models especially those of playboy and other adult oriented magazines she lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and <UNK> bondage style photos were just the thing to push the american public into an <UNK> in fact the photos launched a full <UNK> <UNK> investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn br br the performances in the notorious bettie page are absolutely wonderful with gretchen mol standing out her performance as bettie page is simply brilliant i understand that when she was announced for the role many people were skeptical her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when i think of great performances now it will she completely <UNK> the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance david <UNK> is fresh off of last year's good night and good luck in which he gave one of <UNK> best performances here he gives yet another fine <UNK> though he is slightly underused i was shocked at how very limited his screen time <UNK> quality over <UNK> is always the most important aspect of any good movie the only performance i have seen from <UNK> taylor was that in the haunting 1999 while most people ignored the movie i found it to be an enjoyable if not completely shallow horror movie and i also have always thought that taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally <UNK> <UNK> here taylor gives yet another credible performance she gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of gretchen mol br br after everything was said and done i realized that the notorious bettie page cannot be compared to other <UNK> such as finding <UNK> and walk the line it is <UNK> to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career from the beginning to the end her personal life is briefly implied but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point we watch the film knowing that page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will <UNK> we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life she is a woman that never looked back and could constantly <UNK> herself after all she was an adult model turned christian <UNK> this movie does not over <UNK> anything it could have included <UNK> moments of page <UNK> hysterically and begging god to forgive her it could have shown page running and screaming through the rain trying to escape the ghosts of her <UNK> yet it does not the notorious bettie page tells a simple story and that is something rare by today's standards fortunately it is quite refreshing br br final thought the notorious bettie page is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography br br overall rating 9 10 a
<START> this movie displayed more racial hatred of jews by david mamet than i have br br have ever encountered in an american film the <UNK> are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died i was so disappointed at joe br br <UNK> calling a bunch of men sitting in a new york jewish center cleaning weapons <UNK> that common sense <UNK> and i stopped i am deeply br br disturbed at the concept that jews are not americans and different i suggest that mr mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a <UNK> of same

<START> i went in to see d war on a <UNK> and with very low expectations the movie failed to meet them br br i don't mind stories that stretch <UNK> remember reign of fire but i do expect them to be <UNK> consistent this film <UNK> from <UNK> to <UNK> without <UNK> for breath all interspersed with special effects that <UNK> far behind the likes of lotr or even godzilla br br a shape shifting <UNK> warrior from korea curiously <UNK> into a <UNK> <UNK> dealer and popping up like <UNK> ex <UNK> to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess a special agent from the fbi who seems to be completely <UNK> up on ancient korean <UNK> because of the <UNK> excellent <UNK> division which has gone <UNK> up to this point lovers kissing on deserted <UNK> where one <UNK> i never meant for this to happen a <UNK> pair of long dead <UNK> who died like star crossed lovers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of robotic soldiers that owe a lot to peter jackson's <UNK> and a <UNK> who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it br br the dialogue is appalling the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was to be honest tedious however for me the <UNK> moment was at the end after the finale when the music for the closing credits was <UNK> this is rather like <UNK> kurosawa closing ran with a <UNK> rendition of my way and let me be clear that i am in no way comparing director <UNK> to kurosawa br br in short a self indulgent lackluster collection of clichés and narrative non <UNK> which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in <UNK> popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer or even a not so serious movie goer i would suggest that this <UNK> the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video but i'm not even sure that it's worth that much
<START> the extended nuclear family united in business as well as in personal life is examined in this serious study of a grown son's conflict with his father's desire that he remain in the family business this <UNK> a <UNK> crisis which may or may not be <UNK> by an affair and <UNK> to a <UNK> couch very fine acting by all a sleeper that deserves wide attention
<START> universal soldier the return is not the worst movie ever made no that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner however perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier the return br br this film is a sci fi action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it the acting is as bad as any movie i've ever seen the plot is terrible and predictable the special effects are pathetic in short anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves us the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces some movies are so bad they're good believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them i'm really not sure what else to say here i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn't already but just in case don't
<START> along with it's partner this is the greatest piece of animation ever created the images and styles are amazing and match perfectly with the story which is a brilliantly realistic <UNK> of our own world where is has been and where it could go quite affecting and sometimes painful to watch it it a masterpiece of the visual art
<START> water <UNK> is a well made first film from france about young female sexuality and friendship <UNK> works with <UNK> slightly <UNK> material that is as off putting to some as it is <UNK> to others the film focuses exclusively on three middle class teenage girls in a <UNK> new paris <UNK> their lives <UNK> around a big <UNK> swimming pool where two of the three are part of a <UNK> water ballet team br br such <UNK> as parents siblings work and school have been neatly <UNK> from the <UNK> the central sensibility belongs to the <UNK> <UNK> but skinny marie pauline <UNK> who is not on the team but thinks she would like to be marie <UNK> floriane <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> blonde and team standout whom the boys are after this takes marie away from her former best friend also a member of the water ballet team the somewhat <UNK> anne louise <UNK> being less special anne is more truly accessible to the boys floriane like this film promises a bit more then she truly offers marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl she suffers <UNK> <UNK> doesn't so much suffer as jump into situations and then <UNK> br br marie is <UNK> by the <UNK> of the water ballet as well as floriane floriane takes advantage of this to make marie first her slave and a cover for her <UNK> then lacking any other friends her <UNK> all the other girls think floriane a slut an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she <UNK> because it leads them on she suffers the pretty girl's fate of being not a person but an object and she can't resist the <UNK> the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her but she doesn't really care about any of them and knows her <UNK> with them are a trap <UNK> marie to act as her pal so her unseen mother won't know she's going out to meet boys she also gets marie to rescue her from the boys later it looked the opposite at first but floriane needs marie as much as marie thinks she needs her anne is left with her <UNK> with her body and a desire to get laid that's <UNK> and more real than the other girls' br br keeping all <UNK> context at bay <UNK> can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate <UNK> of the three girls' goals and interactions on the other hand the film's water madness which includes lots of <UNK> and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots makes it feel completely <UNK> at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever present goals and <UNK> and just do silly pointless girl things it's the offbeat moments that give the film life too bad in a way that there aren't more of them but <UNK> has the courage of her <UNK> and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to <UNK> at the girls who understandably love to <UNK> at themselves br br there's no great revelation or drama on the way but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that marie doesn't just admire but truly desires floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends whom floriane always stops before they go all the way in a typical irony of this kind of plot floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with marie but marie is the one who holds off because she knows it won't have the significance to floriane that it will have to her when it happens it's a <UNK> mechanical affair meanwhile anne has a huge crush on <UNK> warren <UNK> a male <UNK> but of course he is after floriane boys are not an element that's been <UNK> and there always seem to be several dozen ready at <UNK> or on the dance floor but they are just bodies and faces available <UNK>
<START> peter <UNK> has created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the lower east side of new york or <UNK> as it's known by the locals br br mr <UNK> heart is in the right place as he <UNK> this dysfunctional family that is typical of the different <UNK> <UNK> of the country mr <UNK> <UNK> the positive in the story he presents these are basically good kids the children of parents that have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing br br instead of presenting his characters as losers mr <UNK> shows a positive side they all have these kids are not into drugs or are stealing because they are poor had this story been done by hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes instead of children that are struggling but deep down inside they are not defeated br br victor <UNK> as victor vargas was a revelation he is a natural so is july <UNK> her character shows us a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she doesn't want to do <UNK> <UNK> as the grandmother is excellent she conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her <UNK> into the things she believes in and that are so important to her br br all in all this was an excellent picture thanks to peter <UNK>
<START> these guys are anything but the usual suspects they are a total bunch of likeable <UNK> who you want to see get away with it but they are so hapless that there is very little chance of that no one is better than william h macy at portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck this is probably his best performance since <UNK> sam <UNK> played the <UNK> boxer to perfection and the rest of the gang were uniformly good also luis <UNK> brought some great comic relief as <UNK> and george clooney stole every scene in his cameo role the heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious br br the direction was also spot on by the russo brothers there was certainly a <UNK> brothers feel to the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers they have a long way to go to match the <UNK> but this is an excellent start and i look forward to their next celluloid outing <UNK> <UNK> a whore
<START> i saw a lot films about charles <UNK> christmas carol but this one is the best of all there is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book the actors george c scott and others are great unfortunately you can't often watch the film in germany and switzerland
<START> this sounded like a really interesting movie from the <UNK> nazis occult government <UNK> i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the <UNK> code or the boys from brazil or even <UNK> instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awful br br part of the trouble is the casting <UNK> <UNK> character starts off the moving being somewhat <UNK> and afraid she just doesn't do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter <UNK> <UNK> br br another big part is the pacing it starts off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter's suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a <UNK> mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focused br br the real problem is it's simply not a pleasant movie to watch it's slow dull none of the characters are likable <UNK> of imagery and sets some movies you see characters get tortured in this it's the viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome
<START> this is one of those movies that make better trailers than full length feature films the concept was really cool and different the humor was unique i just felt there were missed opportunities to put the punch into this movie so many lines and gags were left hanging too long with no definite ending and really didn't leave me laughing wilson wilson <UNK> thurman were great <UNK> sykes was under used in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time 7 out of 10 for me more of a dvd rental also i was looking for some sort of a feel good music video during the end credits something that has become sort of a trade mark to these romantic comedy films a la something about mary meet the parents but again i was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this could have been a much better film with a little more music and <UNK> punch lines it felt like it was rushed into theaters

<START> this move was <UNK> hilarious funniest i've seen in a while akshay and john kick ass as always and the chicks are hot too the story is awesome lots of great jokes and whoever reviewed this before me is an idiot to him i say that u are not of indian background so u wouldn't understand the humor u moron don't rate movies u don't understand what did u watch the <UNK> version where majority of jokes are lost in translation thats what i thought jackass br br akshay kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his <UNK> he can do not only action but comedy as well and is excellent at it john has proved himself as well this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it
<START> i used to watch this show when i was a little girl when i think about it i only remember it vaguely if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was <UNK> cast also the writing was very strong the performances were top grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don't think i've seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
<START> i must tell you right up front i am certainly not an authority on bollywood films and have only seen a handful however if you've never seen one don't start with this one i have greatly enjoyed the ones i've seen up until this one but i just couldn't stand this one i also must tell you up front that i could not finish this film it was that annoying so why was it so annoying br br 1 there is a character named <UNK> in the film he is even more annoying than jar jar <UNK> which i never would have believed would have been possible he is so annoying he spoke in a <UNK> voice and i think was meant to be comic relief instead he just <UNK> on my nerves and wanted him to die slowly his voice his mannerisms and his <UNK> he just didn't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in and he needed to die br br 2 the heroes had the amazing ability to dodge <UNK> <UNK> bullets with ease i kid you not there was a scene where several <UNK> guys took on a small army of guys with these assault <UNK> and again and again they avoided taking a single bullet and beat up the <UNK> this made <UNK> actions in rambo ii look mundane br br 3 the film was so gosh darn loud in your face and intense it practically made my brain bleed it was as if the film were made by people under the influence of <UNK> crazy camera angles intense music and action action action this movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100 action br br 4 the two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense none whatsoever br br perhaps if you are the most <UNK> action and bollywood fan you can stand this film but as for me i can see why it's on <UNK> infamous bottom 100 list wow this film is bad and intensely bad
<START> the humor <UNK> in the complete title <UNK> <UNK> from the sunday school <UNK> that one would be better advised to prepare before you're dead for the devil's <UNK> i e so the devil doesn't care when you're dead there's no <UNK> in trying to beat the devil the characters apparently didn't pay attention at sunday school and find themselves forced into crisis management having <UNK> crisis <UNK> but even a seasoned <UNK> would have difficulty managing these <UNK> throwing <UNK> is far more unpredictable than flipping a <UNK> when people are involved the list of possible <UNK> becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable sidney lumet films until now hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor but here perhaps had an eye toward <UNK> billing among other lumet all stars like <UNK> and pacino
<START> while i don't agree with <UNK> and <UNK> decision to give up baby jesse and it's something i'd never do they were trying to do what was best for the baby the way this movie is written you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe from all different aspects patty duke antagonist almost <UNK> of as far as i'm concerned but during the movie she really convinces you that she's psychotic or at least that there's something seriously wrong with her her character is the meaning of emotionally disturbed the movie seems to end quickly leaving things somewhat <UNK> but other than that this movie is really great it really makes you think it's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that'll make you laugh but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs see things from <UNK> perspectives and discover a little something about yourself caution you may even grow while watching this movie and it's all worth it in the end
<START> i received this movie as a gift i knew from the dvd cover this movie are going to be bad after not watching it for more than a year i finally watched it what a pathetic <UNK> br br i almost didn't finish watching this bad movie but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie br br trust me when i say this movie sucks i am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> got even <UNK> to make this pathetic movie but it couldn't have cost more than 20 000 to produce this movie all you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera about 15 people with no acting skills a <UNK> that were written by a couple of drunk people br br in the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter tara <UNK> run a suppose to be drunk man over on her way to report on a hunted town he are completely <UNK> they went to a supposed to be abandon house but luckily for the it almost complete <UNK> and a bottle of <UNK> on the door step happens to be there just for the supposed to be drunk man but all is not what it seems br br then the supposed drunk man start telling tara ghost zombies stories br br the fist of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history br br his story br br sgt ben <UNK> let one of his soldiers die of complete <UNK> i think this is what happens after letting the poor soldier private wilson do sit ups he let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapse ben <UNK> br br <UNK> him in a shallow grave br br but sgt ben <UNK> are in for n big surprise his wife girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kills sgt ben <UNK> to take revenge on private wilson next to the grave of the soldier he sort off murdered the soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombie and kill them for taking revenge on his behalf br br the twist ending were so lame br br even if you like b horror movies don't watch this movie
<START> taking old collection of stories poses a challenge for the production team how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring memories from her former audience in my opinion their mission was accomplished a must see for young children pre teens teens and their parents ok there are a couple scary moments that are resolved in short order but parents with young children should sit tight the movie moves on to better things i am going to go with those <UNK> user reviewers who point out that emma roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women not <UNK> about it either nancy <UNK> her <UNK> with career minded <UNK> skills a lot to like in here laughs doesn't take itself too seriously a real mystery to solve one you can figure out yourself as an added bonus and likable characters nancy drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion
<START> i like movies about morally corrupt characters but this was too much the acting wasn't great but that wasn't the real problem the issue was the sinking feeling i got in the pit of my stomach about 20 minutes into the film these characters were hollow they had almost no depth and what little they did have was devoted to the cruelty they displayed to each other in the <UNK> of friendship exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating but you have to give those characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard <UNK> these characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly
<START> this is a pretty bad movie the plot is sentimental <UNK> i suppose the production values are ok decent photography <UNK> direction and all that mark <UNK> was terrible i've never cared much for him and this movie <UNK> that perception it's no wonder that he never really had any sort of career aside from his star wars films i'll just say <UNK> bye mark as he sinks into well deserved obscurity on the other hand a very young annie <UNK> utterly stole the show she showed charm beauty and acting chops all in one performance i remember seeing her in <UNK> recently and taking note of her beauty it's interesting seeing her from ten years earlier anyway unless you are interested in miss <UNK> run away from this film screaming for the hills
<START> spoilers ahead if you want to call them that br br i would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1 10 where to begin we'll start from the top br br the story don't believe the premise the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars and people <UNK> understanding what the mysterious happenings are it's a <UNK> basic go to cabin movie with no intensity or effort br br the screenplay i usually give credit to indie screenwriters it's hard work when you are starting out but this is crap the story is flat it leaves you <UNK> the entire movie the dialogue is extremely weak and predictable <UNK> lines of <UNK> you totally freaked me out and i was wondering if you'd uh if you'd like to uh would you come to the cabin with me it makes me want to rip out all my hair one <UNK> at a time and feed it to myself br br the characters holy crap some have described the characters as flat i want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch they actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards br br the actors worse than the characters are the actors they take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting the <UNK> you totally freaked me out was said so <UNK> and slow like it was <UNK> down i could complain for hours on the actors alone br br technical lighting an eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie too shadowy in areas too <UNK> in others the director shouldn't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly baby steps sound how many sound guys does it take to make a really <UNK> sounding movie 9 with that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has <UNK> there is one scene in particular that really sticks out these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle weak camera learn to use it br br anyway i'm running out of complaining space rent it i dare you rent it and learn from it give it a 1 rating it deserves it br br <UNK> off amanda christmas
<START> 1940 a visit to the <UNK> ghetto in nazi occupied <UNK> recorded by a german <UNK> with the naive co operation of the jewish community is combined with <UNK> footage clips from international <UNK> and <UNK> from related cultural films to portray the world's jews as <UNK> and <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti <UNK> and nazi ideology a <UNK> <UNK> unique expression of racial hatred i personally find this film frightening and highly offensive one can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again
<START> the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the <UNK> has lost his vision his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture the land of plenty <UNK> the coffin i'm afraid by being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental and <UNK> film the characters are entirely flat and stereotyped the writing plot and direction are amateurish at best for the first time in quite a while i was <UNK> for the film to end so i could get on with my life the war torn <UNK> of the uncle the patriotic abstract <UNK> at the sky at the conclusion it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen what happened the days of <UNK> <UNK> writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him i'm afraid let's hope he finds his inspiration again at the toronto film festival which is where i saw the film <UNK> was there to introduce it completely lacking in <UNK> he offered us the following i hope no wait i know you're going to enjoy the next two hours i'm afraid he couldn't be more wrong

<START> i just caught an episode about brad the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his <UNK> racing career went to <UNK> as fast as it started i have to say that the story about his <UNK> career was more heart breaking than his drug addiction here's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an olympic training team for two weeks and immediately upon arriving he insults lance armstrong one of the greatest <UNK> who ever lived and is generally <UNK> and <UNK> to everyone in general understandably he is soon asked to leave most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back but what i wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass br br at any rate i was confused about how the show was put together since it shows brad at the height of his addiction we see footage of him pan handling and sleeping in <UNK> and <UNK> and even smoking crack cocaine i didn't even know that was legal to show but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good tv episode br br at any rate it is an <UNK> show because it shows the effects of various <UNK> and the total control that they can take over people's lives sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the <UNK> indifference although i have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean cut there are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost but still and maybe i should warn about spoilers here everything has a little too much of a happily ever after feel at the end and i have a feeling that that is a very <UNK> <UNK> in real life but still it's a show about people trying to help other people and you can never complain too much about something like <UNK>
<START> it's always difficult to put a <UNK> on any film as being 'the best ' whether of all time a certain genre or what have you but i believe a strong argument could be made that in fact laputa is the greatest animated film ever made it is in my mind the <UNK> of <UNK> miyazaki the most talented of <UNK> animated directors and it best captures his strengths as a director <UNK> and designer as well as <UNK> all of his favorite underlying themes the version i'm reviewing is the 2003 american dub i know <UNK> for a hard core anime fan to not watch it in its native language there is at least one other english language dub out there i have it on vhs i have no idea from what source and that version is the single best dub i have ever encountered of any film but i thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find br br laputa tells the story of a boy named <UNK> voiced by james van der <UNK> here who's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named <UNK> anna <UNK> literally drops from the sky it seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent colonel <UNK> mark <UNK> who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck to keep things lively there's also a <UNK> funny pirate gang after the crystal led by the aging but still <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the plot revolves around the <UNK> ability to reveal the location of the <UNK> flying city of laputa a potential treasure <UNK> of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure it's all very much in keeping with a fairy tale setting but miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story and the plot is <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> moments and <UNK> with his <UNK> morality and <UNK> about <UNK> the power of nature br br the design work on laputa nearly twenty years later is still revolutionary flying machines of all sorts abound utterly impossible but so <UNK> designed that you instantly accept them without <UNK> the world is set somewhere around the start of the <UNK> century with <UNK> and ancient <UNK> alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines but it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution laputa is both the garden of <UNK> and the fire of heaven itself and in that <UNK> lies its appeal its power and its danger br br besides being a <UNK> designed and beautifully rendered film laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography from sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one man <UNK> to ships <UNK> into the clouds as if they were water laputa displays a scope that most films  even with the magic of cgi  can only <UNK> about though we only see a small <UNK> of this world its simple <UNK> <UNK> beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it the film also contains one of my favorite if not the most exciting action sequences ever a guardian robot that fell to earth is accidentally <UNK> and <UNK> havoc on the <UNK> it is kept in all the while trying to protect <UNK> who was the one who woke it up meanwhile <UNK> and the pirates <UNK> in on their little flying machines to snatch her literally from the jaws of destruction from the horrific sight of the robot <UNK> the countryside to the <UNK> last second rescue the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience br br it helps that laputa has an amazing score composer joe <UNK> captures the wondrous beauty of this world the <UNK> innocence the exciting action and the creepy <UNK> of the flying city and its bizarre robot <UNK> though he re recorded it for this dvd release which imo is not an improvement over his original score adding pieces here and there the score matches the visuals perfectly a rare total union of sound and vision br br this isn't a bad dub i'm <UNK> fond of the older english dub and this one over explains things just a tad in spots but i was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those and those matched the japanese pretty well <UNK> in particular is hard to get right but <UNK> is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman her sons aren't quite as good as the original <UNK> does a good job as <UNK> and mark <UNK> while i knew it was him early is more than talented enough to do <UNK> i liked the other english dub of <UNK> a little more but <UNK> good much of the film rests on <UNK> shoulders and van der <UNK> is wonderful listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other english dub because <UNK> matches up very closely with the original <UNK> although again watching a dub is grounds for <UNK> among the <UNK> faithful as much as i love this film i don't think you're <UNK> a great deal simply watching this particular <UNK> version john <UNK> of pixar introduces it up front and my suspicion is that he like so many others simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality br br miyazaki has had success in america in recent years with spirited away and <UNK> one of his few films i didn't care for but to me laputa is still his <UNK> achievement anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work and again this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every <UNK> i'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen while that will probably never happen it's good to know that at least this classic has been <UNK> on dvd
<START> amazing grace has a <UNK> feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building the language spoken is <UNK> but the drama could take place in any modern city it <UNK> family values romantic relationships and age group characteristics with equal <UNK> it does not judge the characters only present them in a straight forward manner as they <UNK> to work out their individual problems in this modern world the quality of acting is very good and the observations made on the characters are <UNK> and sharp i appreciate this flowing film very much
<START> even when i saw this movie at a teenager i wondered just how ironic it was that pia <UNK> starred in a movie about an artist who slept her way to the top as beautiful and sexy as ms <UNK> is even she couldn't keep this sorry ass excuse of a movie from <UNK> not even her <UNK> for <UNK> in which the lonely lady was promoted back in the day could keep this movie from <UNK> the only thing that could have saved this movie a completely different script give this one a miss
<START> the world may have ended unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to <UNK> inability to make movies that go beyond the <UNK> maybe it's because all our really good people norman <UNK> martin short et al go to hollywood in fact it's too bad short wasn't cast in this <UNK> pretentious and banal film he might have given it some credibility the canadian government should realize and this movie is a magnificent example that <UNK> money into the <UNK> does not result in good cinema if the people <UNK> up these public <UNK> had had to compete they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile as it is they have produced yet another <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is an above average jackie chan flick due to the fantastic finale and great humor however other then that it's nothing special all the characters are pretty cool and the film is entertaining throughout plus jackie chan is simply amazing in this jackie and <UNK> man chan had fantastic chemistry together and are both very funny and i thought the main <UNK> looked really menacing however the dubbing was simply terrible the character development is above average for this sort of thing and the main fight is simply fantastic plus some of the <UNK> jackie takes in this one are harsh there is a lot of really silly and goofy humor in this but it amused me and the ending is hilarious plus all the characters are quite likable it's pretty cheap looking but generally very well made and while it does not have the amount of fighting you would expect from a jackie chan flick it does enough to keep you watching plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when jackie dragon and <UNK> man chan tiger are playing around with a rifle and it goes off this is an above average jackie chan flick due to the fantastic finale and great humor however other then that it's nothing great still it's well worth the watch the direction is good jackie chan does a good job here with solid camera work fantastic angles and keeping the film at a fast pace for the most part the acting is very good jackie chan is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable hilarious as usual does some crazy stunts had fantastic chemistry with <UNK> man chan kicked that ass and played this wonderful cocky character he was amazing i just wished they would stop dubbing him jackie rules <UNK> man chan is funny as <UNK> best friend i really liked him he is also a very good martial artist rest of the cast do ok i guess overall well worth the watch out of 5
<START> first and foremost speaking as no fan of the genre the bourne ultimatum is a breathtaking <UNK> superb action movie br br secondly it is a silly <UNK> of cartoonish super hero stuff br br <UNK> the film carries a complex important point about crime fighters turning into criminals themselves no reference is made to abu <UNK> or the executive <UNK> outrageous domestic <UNK> on <UNK> rights none is necessary br br so the latest in the bourne series in the hands of paul <UNK> of the 2004 bourne supremacy and last year's united <UNK> is a significant achievement perhaps held back but not actually <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> of the genre br br breathtaking above is meant both as a <UNK> <UNK> and a description of the physical sensation for more than an hour from the first frame the viewer seemingly holds his breath pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless globe <UNK> utterly suspenseful action there is no <UNK> no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some <UNK> music videos do after just a couple of minutes br br oliver <UNK> in your face cinematography is making the best of tony <UNK> screenplay from robert <UNK> 1990 novel which doesn't stack up well against the bourne identity written a decade earlier br br matt damon is once again the inevitable <UNK> bourne the <UNK> of fantasy cia agents this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity his past and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine nothing like his quietly heroic edward r <UNK> the always marvelous david <UNK> is the nasty top agency official pitched against bourne in trying to hide some illegal take no prisoners <UNK> and brutal <UNK> br br joan allen plays what appears to be the good cop against <UNK> bad one and there is julia stiles as the agent once again coming to <UNK> aid a combination of <UNK> direction and stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue br br so good is the bourne ultimatum that it gets away with the old one man against the world bit this time stretched to ridiculous <UNK> as bourne defies constraints of <UNK> time gravity and physics in general can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building why not it looks great br br all this real world magic <UNK> from country to country in seconds to arrive at some unknown location exactly as when and how needed <UNK> special effect and superhero cartoon <UNK> and yet only a clueless <UNK> would allow facts <UNK> with the entertainment based ecstasy of the bourne fantasy
<START> to be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five <UNK> and <UNK> but the dialogue was more cheesy than <UNK> of <UNK> and the cgi was a little old hat now maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly <UNK> out of <UNK> it would have made the film a little better too to say this was awful is to do this film a <UNK> service if you want to see something that is totally <UNK> you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching <UNK> that is <UNK> mind numbingly awful its actually good several large alcoholic <UNK> are <UNK> though any road up i enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet just don't expect anything along the lines of <UNK> park the lost <UNK> or <UNK>
<START> this is one of the worst movies i saw i <UNK> what are the reasons for <UNK> suck a crap don't waste your time watching this good actors but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues hope <UNK> be no <UNK> 2 avoid this movie by all means
<START> this has to be one of my favourite flicks unlike the weak <UNK> haunted <UNK> anyway i love the way the movie is a <UNK> com <UNK> of <UNK> story br br elvira is a <UNK> dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a good witch <UNK> aunt morgana she <UNK> a ruby ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the bad <UNK> her uncle she befriends four characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in <UNK> there is a show down with her uncle the wicked witch of the west where elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up <UNK> him in the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination las vegas <UNK> home in kansas br br there are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters elvira <UNK> must be aunt em and you must be uncle <UNK> there's no place like home there's no place like home bad uncle <UNK> i'll get you my pretty and your little dog too br br there is a sign that elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of kansas br br but aside from this the fact that one of the sequences she ripped off um i mean was inspired by <UNK> is pure genius and if you don't roll around laughing at her <UNK> <UNK> at the end of her very 80's las vegas show then you haven't got a camp bone in your body this movie is a cult camp classic
<START> the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off however i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy <UNK> in strangers with candy <UNK> character is a true <UNK> very comparable to <UNK> <UNK> blank br br the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast her sister's character is good funny at times but ultimately meant not to steal <UNK> show however the rest of the cast is extremely sub par in comparison br br i'm glad though that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor
<START> this was a great movie with a good story my children 10 7 5 and 4 all loved this movie including myself the music was also fantastic no the horses do not talk but instead the story is told by spirit and to hear a story told by a <UNK> point if view was fun br br i think the title says it all spirit this movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends i would have to say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie and even got so into it they laughed so hard and they <UNK> for spirit in the end br br enjoy spirit with your family and have your spirit lifted with this heartwarming story your kids will love it i think you will too
<START> this was longer than the ten <UNK> all lord of the rings and the matrix trilogy combined my oh my what a nightmare this is the single biggest over hype of 2006 there is not a moment that is not scripted and clichéd movie musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer <UNK> takes the route of chinese water torture in the form of endless music montages shoddy acting and poor directing choices seriously mr <UNK> did you have to do the old <UNK> <UNK> shots it's at <UNK> no wait look its rising up the <UNK> and here is the passing <UNK> notice to show you again and again and again
<START> the movie holly is the story of a young girl who has been sold by her poor family and <UNK> across the border to cambodia to work as a prostitute in the infamous <UNK> red light village in the movie holly is waiting to be sold at a <UNK> for her virginity when she meets patrick who is losing money and friends through gambling and bar fights patrick and holly have an immediate bond over their <UNK> but this is all <UNK> when holly is sold to a child <UNK> and disappears as movie goers we are then thrust into <UNK> pursuit to find holly again holly then shows her <UNK> to leave this lifestyle but her confusion on what is right and wrong holly carries us through the beautiful and harsh cambodia while discovering that holly is not just one girl she is the voice of millions of children who are exploited and <UNK> every year with no rights or protection br br holly is less extreme than its subject matter might suggest such as documentaries that involve 4 year olds and sexual <UNK> but does manage to shed considerable light on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of children into prostitution it is a moving story that helps to shed light on the horrible situation in which many children face and their struggles to trust and realize what is right and wrong br br patrick the antagonist of the film is an american dealer of stolen <UNK> who is also losing money and friends while playing cards and getting into bar fights while on a journey his <UNK> runs out of fuel and he is forced to rent a room at a <UNK> during his stay he comes across holly a twelve year old girl who has been sold by her parents and is being <UNK> into slavery and prostitution holly and patrick begin a friendship of trust and understanding he discovers a clever stubborn girl beneath the traumatized exterior and becomes determined to save her though their strictly <UNK> relationship is <UNK> by almost everyone they meet when she suddenly disappears he starts a journey to track her down without having thought if he can really help her br br holly is able to escape on her way to another <UNK> when she jumps from the truck and runs into a field filled with mines a mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead so holly is then left on her own during <UNK> journey to find holly he meets a social worker who tries to talk some sense into him and shares the facts with him that <UNK> the <UNK> region the idea of paying for her freedom simply <UNK> the demand she explains 30 000 children in prostitution in cambodia next year it could be 60 000 i'm not trying to save 60 000 he tells her i'm trying to save one patrick discovers that the idea of <UNK> her to safety is quickly put to rest when the social worker tells him that the us will not let him adopt and although it takes five minutes to <UNK> a child it takes five years to <UNK> her into society patrick is not affected by the information and he continues his quest to find holly br br the audience is then shown that holly makes it to a small town and is <UNK> for food with other homeless children she is then <UNK> by a local policemen who seem little better than criminals with a <UNK> when they sell her to another <UNK> and then make a deal to a <UNK> businessman who then takes her virginity holly then seems to think that this is her destiny and when patrick finally find her she is willing to <UNK> <UNK> and boom boom her distant friend patrick is utterly confused by this change in behavior but he is not <UNK> in his plan to take her away from this world in the end he steals her away and brings her to a safe land in the comfort of the social worker holly is given fresh clothes if feed and brought to a dance class but she is forbidden to see patrick this intense yearning to be in the comfort of <UNK> friendship she runs away from the safe house and back onto the streets in cambodia br br meanwhile patrick is dealing with the decision to leave the country and flee back to the united states or to stay in cambodia his thoughts continue to <UNK> back to holly and during a visit to a bar an older male sees the picture he is holding and comments on his sexual <UNK> when he had sex with her this <UNK> patrick and he hits the man and runs out of the bar eventually patrick is caught by the police in the eyes of holly who is hiding behind a pole br br the movie holly may make the audience want to <UNK> money towards <UNK> that improve the life for these poor youngsters and even campaign to <UNK> the amount of <UNK> in the region but the film's dramatic weaknesses may <UNK> its chances of being seen by enough people to make a difference overall i think the concept is better as a documentary and it was not as touching as a movie the actors did a great job of showing their raw emotion and the true confusion of the youngsters who are affected by this lifestyle but in the end the harsh lifestyle of the region and the desperate notions of the parents who sell their children to <UNK> their own <UNK> does nothing to help the children's situations
<START> it was life changing it really was the man in the moon is a breathtaking experience to watch the acting was fabulous the story line was great and this was a perfect start for reese <UNK> career i don't see how anyone couldn't love this film sure it's not the best movie ever even though it was close to it but it was highly amusing to watch and i even had a big laugh at one of the jokes and a lot of other little laughs of course there was some cry your heart out moments too but this movie was <UNK> and it <UNK> up your day although you have to get a little depressed from the story every now and then i can't believe this movie didn't win at least one award and i also can't believe that it's been seen by so little people on this site see this movie if you haven't for it is definitely touching
<START> i tried i really did i thought that maybe if i gave <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> another chance i could enjoy his movie i know that after seeing o <UNK> i felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor so i was like what the hell at least you didn't pay 10 dollars at the <UNK> give it a shot br br sometimes it's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root <UNK> without any previous <UNK> to <UNK> the horror of so much pain i often wonder if it wouldn't be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it on other occasions i often think that the world is really flat and that if i <UNK> away far enough i will not only get away from it all but fall clear over and that some evil <UNK> thing will snatch me with its <UNK> <UNK> and squeeze the life and some french <UNK> from 1995 still lingering inside my <UNK> out of me br br is there a reason for <UNK> i'd say not at all just that maybe her creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness one that makes alex forrest look like <UNK> <UNK> look not only creepy but flat out sick to the bone she first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend in <UNK> <UNK> because she wants a child and he believes they're too young she later crashes a funeral of a gay man and get this in order to get closer to him she <UNK> being pregnant while <UNK> herself into the lives of the dead man's mother and lover in the <UNK> of ways oh of course she <UNK> like a <UNK> and throws herself not one but a good three times on his grave and there's this ridiculous business that she <UNK> becomes <UNK> which sums up some weak as bad tea explanation that love knows no gender or something br br i'd say she's as nuts as a can of <UNK> <UNK> but then again <UNK> the director and me for taking a chance on this at least the men look good other than that not much else to see here
<START> i know a lot of people don't like this movie but i just think it is adorable there's not much i can say but the movie is a feel good movie i guess the songs are beautiful the costumes are beautiful the voices are beautiful and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie especially as <UNK> learns about the <UNK> and <UNK> of society if you like musicals i'd say you'd like this one
<START> for anyone <UNK> a remake of <UNK> slaves of new york what are there seven of you here it is was br br this <UNK> movie has <UNK> vapid characters well they're club kids ya big jerk that are in holding <UNK> the big question seems to be just how long can a young adult remain juvenile it took three people to write this <UNK> good god it was easier to come up with citizen kane rather than take viewers back this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene <UNK> in the early 90s br br the idea that a fifty year old woman <UNK> a bunch of self absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self absorbed twenty somethings could imagine it the odd <UNK> about library work is not the sub plot one expects from the equivalent of parker <UNK> <UNK> 2 electric <UNK> her i'm serious about graduate school while a stripper <UNK> on her is hysterical <UNK> <UNK> is always amusing but there are projects that are beneath her i was asleep before it crossed the 40 minute mark
<START> this film is absolutely hilarious basically the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some b movie chemical accident he then heads for town and starts <UNK> the locals its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows but the great thing about this film is it knows that its rubbish the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the giant killer snowman are classic and this is clearly the intention its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point alongside the comic <UNK> there are some other great comedy moments listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad <UNK> his kids to death and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film fantastic tacky fun
<START> if you get it it's magnificent br br if you don't it's decent br br please understand that getting it does not necessarily mean you've gone through a school shooting there is so much more to this movie that at times the school shooting becomes insignificant br br above all it's a movie about acceptance both <UNK> of a traumatic event but also of people who are different for whatever reason br br it's also a movie about <UNK> pain and how different people endure it in this case the contrast between <UNK> rage and <UNK> obsession creates an atmosphere of such <UNK> anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat thankfully the audience is given credit for being human beings our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy <UNK> <UNK> ending br br above and beyond that i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that yet i must admit i cried like a lost little baby during this movie there were certain things about it that hit very close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite <UNK> but that is not necessarily a bad thing
<START> this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in the cinema could not wait for it to end to make matters worse it is given a <UNK> <UNK> so you do not see anyone getting shot just bodies <UNK> to the ground even <UNK> getting killed was cut out too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as i think the makers knew it would flop <UNK> <UNK> acting was great but that <UNK> wannabe and the other idiot who plays <UNK> mate can't even act <UNK> was wasted br br i would not watch this for free again and i advise all others who read this to do just the same you have been warned
<START> the worst film ever made br br after watching this supposedly gay made film i suspect someone rounded up a brain damaged half blind neo nazi and had him make the worst gay film ever all in some <UNK> attempt to attack gay culture i had to stop the movie and call a friend to come over just so i had someone to <UNK> at when i <UNK> the movie out of shock disbelief and outrage at such sheer stupidity br br on top of all the horrible writing and acting and illogical and stupid plot its just a poorly made film a dog with a <UNK> tied to its tail could have <UNK> out better br br seriously after reading the few positive reviews this movie has here i suspect the writer must have a half a dozen imdb accounts anyone who says this film is even watchable as anything other than a joke is a liar or being paid heavily to say so
<START> may contain spoilers but doubt it can actually be <UNK> br br five across the eyes can be summed up in one word amateurish this film tries it's best to be different from most films by the <UNK> <UNK> type of filming it doesn't work it just ends up looking and feeling like somebody had a cheap video camera a van and decided to make a movie the story has no explanation the protagonist is given no real motivation and looks like a lesbian wearing a power suit compared to the five girls and there is no violence to speak of just the sounds of screaming and <UNK> the whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question the five girls really do their best with what they've been given but on the whole come across as pretty terrible actresses although with the material given it's hard to judge if they can actually act they spend the whole movie screaming <UNK> and <UNK> so much that half the time it's hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad it's actually hard to tell who said it this video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terror that literally sums up the whole movie we then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive with one minus a finger the only thumbs up get it finger lol is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices and their pride after making this terrible movie do not judge this by the poster you'll be very let down
<START> i really hate this show i had watched one episode and i knew this show is really terrible the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad i mean it is just a sh <UNK> rip off of <UNK> laboratory and johnny quest <UNK> an obnoxious boy with <UNK> blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog a stay at home dad and a smart super busy mom like oh my <UNK> god their dad is a mother f <UNK> crazy home maker isn't that so gay if my dad is a home maker i would personally die of shame that is really i would br br i have nothing else to about this this travesty but only 3 word count them 3 words to describe it br br <UNK> lame <UNK> stupid and above all <UNK> f k up that's all i could say folks it is definitely making my list of worst animated series <UNK> er if i had one that is
<START> after repeated <UNK> to the cd soundtrack i knew i wanted this film got it for christmas and i was amazed marc <UNK> had such charisma i can't describe it i'd heard about him in that way but didn't understand what people were talking about until i was in the company of this footage he was incredible clips from the <UNK> concert are interspersed with <UNK> sketches such as nuns <UNK> themselves at a garden party as marc <UNK> performs some <UNK> versions of get it on etc i'm still learning the song titles george <UNK> the <UNK> photographer from magical mystery tour plays a <UNK> who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors nothing i can say to describe it would spoil it even though i put the spoilers <UNK> on this review so you would just need to see this for yourselves it <UNK> description br br yes i love the beatles and was curious about <UNK> directing a rock documentary that was 35 years ago now i finally find out it's been on dvd for 2 years but it's finally in my home it's an amazing viewing experience even enthralling br br now the dvd comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and <UNK> from another user br br there's two hidden extras on the born to boogie double dvd release br br 1 from the menu on disc one <UNK> the bonus material and <UNK> the extra scenes 2 on the extra scenes page <UNK> scene <UNK> take 1 and keep <UNK> left 3 when the <UNK> disappears keep <UNK> right until a star 1972 <UNK> appears 4 press enter br br 5 from the main menu on disc two <UNK> the sound <UNK> 6 on the sound <UNK> page <UNK> the 90 25 i think thats right option and keep <UNK> left 7 when the <UNK> disappears keep <UNK> right until a star home video <UNK> appears 8 press enter
<START> the plot is real horrific the atmosphere really <UNK> unusual for a low budget production like that and at least for a german production a little bit of indian <UNK> <UNK> thriller and slasher movie mixed together the development of plot and characters are great the sets very close to reality without any studio atmosphere it could be perfect but at unfortunately some things were a little bit disappointing what don't inevitably have to be typically for low budget movies br br 1 the cast sometimes is not more than average almost every actor look like a <UNK> some of them do a good or a very good job but some are acting like the actors of crappy german court shows but i was very very disappointed of the acting of mathieu <UNK> his acting in a lots of of his older movies his acting was fine here was below average but that could be the reason why he today takes part in crappy german <UNK> or tv series on private channels br br 2 the dialogs are sometimes on soap opera level br br 3 the bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand what the characters are saying i saw it on dvd and was glad to could <UNK> and to listen it again it caused by the set big <UNK> as in the hospital or with the <UNK> group and sometimes the strange <UNK> of the actors br br but all in all it is an interesting movie worth to watch it far beyond the <UNK> movies which are often more terrible
<START> james j <UNK> autobiography the <UNK> of the crowd was the starting point of this lively and well remembered <UNK> biography the author was <UNK> champion of the world <UNK> john l sullivan before the turn of the century the events of the narrative depict corbett as a <UNK> but likable and intelligent young man whose conquest of the world of boxing and social prejudice in his time when he was considered merely the son of irish immigrants a <UNK> bank <UNK> and a nobody surprised everyone it took him several hours of exciting and often amusing screen time to prove his <UNK> were wrong he is an bank <UNK> when the film opens but he somehow <UNK> an <UNK> to a sporting club for the well to do he falls in love with a beautiful but <UNK> girl with whom he always seems to be <UNK> and he lives at home with a <UNK> clan of <UNK> who seem to fight with one another as often as with others when he <UNK> the <UNK> best and a professional fighter <UNK> in to embarrass him he finally decides to become famous by fighting he sets out on the road with his friend who acts as manager and <UNK> and despite a few near <UNK> he wins all his <UNK> and <UNK> attention coming home to pursue his girl again he <UNK> to annoy the boston <UNK> mighty john l sullivan who enters bars and claims he can <UNK> any man in the world few believe he can win a bout against sullivan but corbett dubbed gentleman jim for his <UNK> manners and <UNK> appearance surprises everyone by moving dancing out of range and <UNK> the furious <UNK> power the film's finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten sullivan comes to <UNK> corbett the new champion rises to the moment tells sullivan a few years before it might have been different and shows him nothing but admiration and respect he gets his girl as a result of his two performances but by the end of the film as they visit his s parents his manager is able to tell the world the <UNK> are at it again the films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy the script was written by veteran <UNK> mccoy and vincent lawrence from the corbett novel sidney <UNK> did the cinematography with period set <UNK> by clarence <UNK> and art direction by ted smith <UNK> <UNK> did the music and milo anderson the <UNK> the film was <UNK> directed by action film <UNK> <UNK> walsh flynn also liked working with walsh but did not care for the other director he worked for most often michael <UNK> among the cast were ward bond as john l sullivan in one of his best performances lovely <UNK> smith a bit <UNK> but intelligent as the girl corbett loves and a very able errol flynn as corbett a young man he seemed to <UNK> playing he later said it was his favorite role from the period jack carson was his manager alan hale his charismatic father john <UNK> a rich <UNK> with william <UNK> minor watson madeleine <UNK> rhys williams arthur <UNK> dorothy vaughn and mike <UNK> along for the enjoyable proceedings it is hard to say enough about the logic and light hearted fun this movie's makers have generated it is one of the best liked of all sports biography films and by my standards one of the most enjoyable as well
<START> i'm not even gonna waste time on this one it's not funny not scary practically unwatchable and only <UNK> gory the fx suck though no pun intended this is a <UNK> watch at your peril ask yourself 1 question are slugs scary
<START> this movie is painfully slow and has no plot it conveys the lives of a group of laid off <UNK> one of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job there may be some social commentary here but it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light br br i do not understand why it had a 7 8 when i decided to watch it i watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff no luck the imdb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes anything above 6 5 was worth watching br br and my wife says <UNK> <UNK> does not even look good in this movie he's not my type so my <UNK> does not mean much br br sigh i give it a 1
<START> i really like this movie because in australia chinese movies like these never get shown during prime time i must say this is one of the best serious movies ever which <UNK> the difference between the hong kong people and <UNK> chinese it really shows that there's <UNK> between the two but can only get better as hk are learning <UNK> it also showed me how in <UNK> china the indie rock scene exists and that chinese people do know how to <UNK> the guitar and get the house <UNK> whoever said china isn't ready for rock music daniel wu is absolutely superb with his clean and crisp voice honest acting and a total chick <UNK> i recommend this movie to those who don't know much about asian people to <UNK> themselves from the typical western stereotypes and people who just love chinese asian cinema like myself check it out
<START> sure this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichés but it's entertaining and that's what i watch movies for to be entertained natasha <UNK> is stunning even with the short hair her smile is <UNK> and her beauty can't be disguised as for michael <UNK> i'm sure the women love him the two of them seemed to really like <UNK> other in this film i don't understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them i guess we see what we want to see br br olivia <UNK> and michael <UNK> were fun to watch even if <UNK> british accent did creep into her supposed <UNK> speech to tell you the truth i hadn't really noticed it until i read these comments but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me but she was ideal for her role with that one exception br br it's a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others but who find their soul mates in one another it may be an unlikely story but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube that's why we watch them to escape from the <UNK> of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen i thought these actors did a good job of it but hey i'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily don't get me wrong though it has to be a sentimental scene and this movie had plenty of those br br i give it 9 10 only because i'm saving my 10 10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies or whatever make a note to watch it i think you'll like it
<START> <UNK> is a movie that i plan to show my daughter julia ann ruth morgan some day seeing <UNK> phoenix in this movie makes you realize how far hes come since playing a roman emperor in the film gladiator i am pleased to say that i now have <UNK> with the artificial intelligence of <UNK> who said that i was young and that is true <UNK> <UNK> with my daughter on <UNK> came through <UNK> gate julia ann glow hide daddy the fact that my daughters artificial intelligence is still speaking like a six year old means that my daughter julia ann ruth morgan representing peace to the friendly <UNK> alien creators of humans may not have been taken to a an american <UNK> in time we have the power to change the future with faster than light <UNK> i order that my ex wife and daughter julia ann ruth morgan be taken to an american <UNK> as soon as possible my daughter julia is <UNK> in command of the planet earth and a bridge officer she already said that she doesn't like bullies having had someone steal her <UNK> and <UNK> ii game from my mothers car she gets concerned about other thieves stealing her other toys julia has been growing up fast the time of <UNK> and <UNK> starting life over again on this planet is not until <UNK> julia would be a young lady by then and her artificial intelligence would have been greatly expanded upon if i have to go to a <UNK> to continue the american <UNK> then i am in a command post and not really hiding as a first <UNK> president jack <UNK> artificial intelligence said recently that <UNK> <UNK> could be taken to stop global warming at any time thanks boss thats similar to my daughter <UNK> <UNK> telling me hide and stay <UNK> kate <UNK> is now married to steven spielberg wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society <UNK> if you value freedom of speech like president kennedy and myself then please do not <UNK> this reviewer check out <UNK> <UNK> other movies also
<START> i don't know what you guys are <UNK> but please stop this movie was complete trash br br <UNK> culkin as kevin <UNK> was lovable cute sweet loving and extremely fun to watch he had that innocence but at the same time he was strong as well br br this new kid alex annoying as all hell just a blatant ripoff at trying to match <UNK> charm and grace failing miserably at that br br the villains complete crap harry and <UNK> they were such an entertaining on screen team they were comedic they were humorous and just made you really want to root for culkin even more which is what a good villain is suppose to do these guys joe <UNK> and daniel stern absolutely perfect for those roles on the other hand in 3 we have 4 new idiots that just <UNK> and again try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains not saying they were horrible but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining more on the corny side actually br br then we got the actual movies part 1 and 2 classics memorable perfect to watch around christmas and brings a wonderful christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions it makes you fall in love with the story and care about the characters simply memorable and close to being masterpieces part 3 masterpiece of crap enough said br br all and all i don't know why people like this i think people really don't know what a good movie is anymore its a crappy sequel rip off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid that i wish the robbers would of at least beat the crap out of br br run run away from this garbage and lets not even start with part 4
<START> i've seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie 1 but this movie was beyond terrible br br the acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying usually when i watch scary movies i think it's dumb when the characters hears a noise in house forest school etc and then yells out hello is anyone there but at least they're believable when they do it this movie couldn't even get that right br br this is a movie that'll make other b horror movies like <UNK> and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces br br i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will think again it's awful
<START> this film is a bit reminiscent of the german film the <UNK> story because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero however due to far superior modern technology puppets and cgi are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world one that will blow your <UNK> off due to its realism and scope br br i enjoyed this film but boy was it a chore at first unfortunately for most <UNK> this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd however give it a chance don't think or try to understand everything you see just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film br br in many ways this is exactly the sort of advice i'd give to adults who watch miyazaki's spirited away because it is very similar and features tons of yokai japanese mythical spirits the big differences between the two is that the great yokai war is live action and spirited away is much more child friendly while i do think the great yokai war was intended mostly as a kids' movie in the usa most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it's so violent scary and features some adult <UNK> so who is the audience in the west well older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non western themes and composition this is a rather narrow audience indeed br br while you are watching look for all the strange little touches in fact you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time a few of the funny references i liked were the comment about gamera the scene that came with the comment kids don't try this at home as well as the use of <UNK> beer to allow a person to actually see the yokai hmm perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning br br by the way director takashi miike is a hard one to pin down <UNK> other than to say that none of his stories i've seen have seemed normal some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and i hated them especially audition and <UNK> the killer whereas some of them are magical and among the best films i've ever seen the happiness of the <UNK> one thing for sure it's hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other
<START> when i really began to be interested in movies at the age of eleven i had a big list of <UNK> <UNK> films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts i remember one of the films on that list was a chorus line and could never get it so now to see it is a dream come true br br of course i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there i mean take a chorus line a stage play turned into film i know it's something we see a lot nowadays but back then it was a little different apparently and this film has something special br br most of the musicals made movies today take the chance the camera gives them for free to create different <UNK> and take the characters to different places a chorus line was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie following a big audition held by recognized choreographer <UNK> michael douglas richard <UNK> directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job br br everything happens on the same day the tension of not knowing the stress of having to learn the numbers the silent competition between the <UNK> it all occurs on the stage where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic but they list <UNK> as the hours go by br br like a movie i saw recently a <UNK> home companion the broadcast of a radio show <UNK> here deals with the problem of continuity on or behind the stage things are going on and time doesn't seem to stop again i don't if <UNK> cut a lot to shoot this but it sure doesn't look like it and anyway it's a great directing and editing john bloom work but in that little stage what you wonder is what to do with the <UNK> only one setting <UNK> <UNK> cinematography finds the way making close ups to certain characters <UNK> in and out showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new york br br in one crucial moment douglas tells the ones that are left before we start <UNK> you're all terrific and i'd like to hire you all but i can't this made me think about reality shows today where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving even when they are not good it's hard you must imagine at least here where all of them really are terrific br br to tell some of the stories the characters use songs and in one second the stage takes a new life and it literally is 'a dream come <UNK> the music by marvin <UNK> and the lyrics by edward <UNK> make the theater to film transition without flaws showing these <UNK> feelings and letting them do those wonderful <UNK> by michael bennett the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold <UNK> which is very touching at times so if it's not with a song it will be with a word but in a chorus line it's impossible not to be moved br br during one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition cassie a special dancer played by <UNK> reed takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it the words let me dance for you never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics
<START> ok now lets see what was funny in the first movie i know people with funny accents people falling into the water silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams in this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max no good a whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons no good <UNK> check funny comments between the two teams they tried but failed also there are too may personalities they are following in this movie this film should be about what is happening on the water not on land i am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the <UNK> of the film are exploited to the max no good all in all i give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts
<START> the part of the grinch was made for jim carrey and i was extremely impressed with his performance not being a great fan of his i was <UNK> but pleasantly surprised with the outcome taylor <UNK> as cindy lou who was the <UNK> little girl i have seen on the screen for a long time and she showed a maturity beyond her years in her acting skills i was even drawn to tears at one point i've never read the dr seuss book of the tale so i didnt know what to expect the humour was quite dark overall i enjoyed the film apart from the songs and would recommend it for family viewing especially
<START> forget credibility br br you must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable <UNK> being <UNK> upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in lethal weapons especially when <UNK> <UNK> is directing br br cliffhanger is no exception but the movie has numerous <UNK> breathtaking scenery <UNK> photographed stunning special and visual effects the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film excellent musical score welcome attempts at <UNK> to <UNK> some of the tension and a solid cast two heroes stallone star and <UNK> has the <UNK> share of the footage but the excellent michael <UNK> more than stands his ground a charming heroin <UNK> turner and one of the most <UNK> bunch of villains ever priceless john <UNK> and <UNK> feminine caroline <UNK> but also rex <UNK> in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it leon craig <UNK> good solid entertainment then if no credibility as roger ebert wrote about another film it's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much br br
<START> in all my years of film going only once have i walked out on a film and that was the dreadful stay tuned fortunately the cinema <UNK> the ticket and i went to see buffy the vampire <UNK> instead a minor improvement that film is gone with the wind compared to dick a comedy so unfunny that it nearly became the second film i ever walked out of dick was so unfunny it was even impossible to laugh at it let alone laugh with it br br granted paying to see a movie with a title like dick suggests that it will be filled with inane dick jokes and wind up a huge letdown and yet i had high hopes because of the notable cast daniel <UNK> bruce <UNK> dave <UNK> <UNK> dunst etc etc and a premise that at least promised something fresh what the film delivered was as <UNK> four woefully predictable dick jokes comic timing suffering from <UNK> and a premise that wore thin after the first five minutes in short it was the <UNK> scene from forrest <UNK> stretched <UNK> laid on a rack and <UNK> over 90 excruciating minutes br br as soon as you understand that the two main characters <UNK> insipid <UNK> who gasp and roll <UNK> <UNK> will participate in every major <UNK> event you begin to mentally check off the plot as it progresses 18 and a half minutes <UNK> from the <UNK> tapes check the deep throat <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> check john dean getting a change of heart and <UNK> check the process drags out more <UNK> and about as engaging as the real <UNK> affair with about as much laugh getting to boot and though it <UNK> to be an amusing re <UNK> of the events leading to president <UNK> <UNK> it turns into a paint by the numbers choose your own adventure fill in the <UNK> comedy that says very little and entertains even less br br even the film's strong point the aforementioned cast is <UNK> <UNK> here the most disappointing of all is harry <UNK> as g gordon <UNK> trapped as he is behind the thick <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in this numbingly <UNK> screenplay <UNK> <UNK> a few lines tries desperately to <UNK> from behind the <UNK> nose and <UNK> then disappears dave <UNK> one of the comic <UNK> from kids in the hall two others bruce <UNK> and mark <UNK> also appear in this film ah the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> badly as well his h r <UNK> occasionally lends a much need <UNK> of the funeral plot but the funniest thing about him is the buzz cut he sports perhaps the films funniest bit of all and then there's daniel <UNK> as richard <UNK> <UNK> i mean dick ha ha how <UNK> funny he manages to play a solid <UNK> avoiding the <UNK> such as overdone make up <UNK> nose and false teeth a la anthony hopkins while <UNK> the essence the <UNK> between human <UNK> and <UNK> i seem to be forgetting someone oh yes the two stars of the film those over <UNK> teenagers can't remember their names perhaps because i have repressed their performances nothing could be <UNK> from funny nothing could be more painful than having to endure their <UNK> that ran the gamut of <UNK> and super <UNK> with an occasional <UNK> tossed in br br this film seemed to be a bad excuse to string together a 70s soundtrack and parade outrageous period clothing both of which seem to be the norm these days for films and tv shows set in the me decade but the clothes and the music wind up being an <UNK> substitute for true characterization and plot a kind of extra plot <UNK> that the producers hope will compensate for <UNK> writing br br the only possible use for this film is years down the road when any one of its talented cast appears on david <UNK> or conan o'brien this dreadful cinematic <UNK> will be dragged out to embarrass and hopefully humble the stunned guest star the sad thing is that the real bad guys in all this the writers and producers will be far from the cameras <UNK> possibly cooking up another disaster such as this br br
<START> br br this movie not a film clearly recorded on a cheap <UNK> <UNK> may be one of the greatest cinematic stink bombs in history beware the <UNK> <UNK> the flick as an erotic exploration of sex addiction the film is not an exploration of anything and it is no more erotic than staring at one's own <UNK> the script is pointless and meandering with all plot elements serving as <UNK> between supposed sex scenes however even the sex scenes are lame lame lame except for the first they are around three seconds long then again maybe my version was cut and <UNK> overwrought br br if you are looking for a decent film you don't want this if you are looking for a <UNK> sex flick you don't want this whatever your life's goals desires or perspectives you do not want to watch this movie how they got <UNK> arquette <UNK> kinski and ed <UNK> to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme
<START> i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented i mean i hate to say bad things about an amateur production but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it tone it down a little groundbreaking is a little over the top this is a boston based college production that doesn't even achieve the level of most amateur college film it's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do a silly action film without much creativity it's pretty funny if you're willing to poke fun at it not something you will ever see unless you are a student at <UNK> college
<START> all internet buzz aside this movie was god awful i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller horror movie and they completely missed there were only a few good parts and a couple good lines by samuel jackson other than that it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie now that the movie has actually come out hopefully this joke will die don't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash if you're looking for something that's funny and entertaining then just go to snakes on a <UNK>
<START> i saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white educated and urban the showing i attended had a <UNK> of african americans and it made the difference in audience reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country basically the white folks were afraid to laugh or laughed <UNK> at the funny bits and there are many because they'd be <UNK> at blacks while the blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldn't laugh at themselves in front of the whites br br i on the other hand being asian and thus <UNK> to neither group had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its <UNK> <UNK> values pseudo <UNK> the cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed the songs are too funny to be believed br br this film is one of the best pseudo documentaries to come along including a mighty wind
<START> let's cut to the chase if you're a baby <UNK> you inevitably spent some time wondering at the fact that in 1976 <UNK> had the <UNK> to drop in on john's city <UNK> life and spend the day with him you also certainly wondered how things went i heard the exact same reports that the writer of this film heard from john's and paul's perspective and i admit that i <UNK> the meeting in pretty much the same way this film does but none of my <UNK> could have bought tears to my eyes the way this incredible piece of work and acting does i found it amazingly <UNK> perfectly plausible and 100 <UNK> free now can anyone explain why i didn't hear of this masterpiece before it was shown by the cbc last night i mean it's already three years old for goodness sake and yes if you're a beatles fan this is a must see performance even the subtle <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in the background is inspired
<START> one of the most boring slashers ever if you can even call it that i wouldn't watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porno movie which it completely resembles the fact that you're watching a small group of middle aged people in the woods is really unbearable they made these kinds of movies for teens so who were they really aiming for when they made this sleep fest my favorite part of this movie is the cover art and it's the only reason i chose to seek out this movie which happened to be part of a suspense classics 50 movie pack and after seeing the other movies in this 50 pack you'll realize that it belongs nowhere else so if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods i recommend just before dawn and the final terror
<START> this is my second time through for a perfect spy i watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it i like it still it's natural that it gets compared to the <UNK> other big le <UNK> series <UNK> <UNK> soldier spy <UNK> <UNK> focuses on the game spies play perfect spy gives us the other <UNK> what kind of person a spy is there are a number of themes that these movies share along with others in the genre br br ambiguity moral sexual <UNK> which creates a <UNK> space of true vs false inside vs outside love vs responsibility in a way these characters are <UNK> when they are being treated the most <UNK> by those they love and respect <UNK> in its various nuances br br the theme of fathers and father figures is also important one of the most intriguing characters in a perfect spy is rick the main character <UNK> perhaps <UNK> father throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed a rogue who always manages to climb back up the ladder when he's been <UNK> who seems <UNK> to what others think of him asks <UNK> each time they meet do you love your old man and never do you love me maybe it says this somewhere else but a perfect spy is a love story br br another theme is that of <UNK> the nature of the business is to turn others turn them against their government against their friends and associates turn them against their values and beliefs in each of the le <UNK> movies i have seen the spy who came in from the cold looking glass war <UNK> <UNK> soldier spy <UNK> people and a perfect spy turning and being turned is the foundation of the tragedy br br finally not so much a theme as an artistic touch in each of these films there is usually only a single gun shot or perhaps two shots <UNK> the story violence torture cruelty are always just beneath the surface we see their results not as <UNK> of blood or <UNK> prison cells but in the the objects le <UNK> characters <UNK> to as they are <UNK> sucked down into the <UNK> br br if you haven't seen the films above and you enjoy a perfect spy you are in for a treat i'd also recommend the <UNK> series <UNK> tv the 2nd and 3rd seasons of which begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity the <UNK> file and burial in berlin are nice though light weight for political intrigue try a very british coup house of cards and yes minister yes prime minister br br if only a brit would set his hand to making the three <UNK> there would be a film with intrigue and complexity
<START> when i was young i had seen very few movies my parents in all their wisdom rented this one i was very <UNK> of what the movie was about in fact i wasn't even allowed to watch it my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry so what did i do late at night i <UNK> the vcr kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported <UNK> i was arrested of course i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived i was only given a stern talking to and sent home my parents grounded me of course and made me work to <UNK> the debt for the tv and vcr this <UNK> me apart slave <UNK> really sucks believe me but i had to do it <UNK> all around the house what happened in the end we got a big screen tv dvd player and a surround sound system for my work how did i get the money easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney do you remember finding <UNK> well i wrote that movie and filmed my <UNK> in their fish tanks they <UNK> the plot of course and did it in cgi because they couldn't afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done in the end i never saw the film the head that didn't die and the rating i gave it is my life rating it's doing pretty good
<START> being from the philadelphia <UNK> and extremely interested in local history this film provides an excellent vintage view of philadelphia in the 1940s there are scenes of downtown a train station that no longer exists <UNK> street station which still does exist as well as scenes from the <UNK> part of the city good shots of the old row homes as they appeared then the movie gets a bit <UNK> at times causing the viewer to briefly lose interest but the overall storyline is solid and very moving anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the film bright victory also with local footage of the valley <UNK> army hospital in <UNK> <UNK> and scenes from downtown <UNK> the army hospital has since become a college campus neither of these films are out on any format and i can't imagine why i have them both on vhs from home recording as shown on tcm in recent years i highly recommend them to any other history buffs out there from my area
<START> the stock market crash of <UNK> and the depression following almost ruined the american musical theater in fact it was the final death blow to vaudeville those behind the <UNK> were hit as bad as those in front br br in an effort to <UNK> the show business economy and his own personal economy out of work theater director james cagney comes up with a brilliant idea stage live relevant <UNK> to the movies that are being shown at the various movie theaters that are <UNK> up overnight from the old theaters some other <UNK> get wind of it and the competition is on br br <UNK> parade is my favorite busby berkeley film it gives james cagney a chance to display some of his <UNK> as a dancer as well as a tough guy in his retirement cagney said that while he screened his few and far between musicals a lot he could barely be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films he wished he'd done a few more musicals in his career and i wish he had br br of course the staging of these busby berkeley <UNK> on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason but it's so creative and fun to watch br br dick powell gets to sing three songs in <UNK> parade ah the moon is here honeymoon hotel and by a <UNK> the last two with ruby keeler further <UNK> that screen team ruby sings and dances with powell in the last two and she partners with james cagney in my favorite number from <UNK> parade shanghai <UNK> br br joan blondell is <UNK> no nonsense girl friday at the theater like in blonde crazy she's the one with the real brains in that duo and it's her quick thinking that <UNK> him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones one of <UNK> best screen roles br br look for dorothy <UNK> and ann <UNK> in the chorus as per the imdb pages for both of them john garfield is seen briefly in the shanghai <UNK> number and in a scene at the beginning of the film producer guy <UNK> takes cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a b western starring john wayne the <UNK> voice is <UNK> but what's even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with frank <UNK> who plays another cagney assistant in <UNK> parade i think the brothers warner were playing a little joke there i've got to believe that clip was deliberate br br <UNK> parade is busby berkeley at his surreal best
<START> this is the best version so far that you will see and the most true to the <UNK> work dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre <UNK> not handsome but his acting <UNK> this and zelah clark pretty as she is is also a complete and believable jane eyre this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true <UNK> in literature this is the way to see it i own every copy of this movie and have read and re read the original the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this
<START> a shame that even a talented director <UNK> could not <UNK> a decent performance out of a <UNK> talented actress phoenix esther <UNK> lacks the substance to convey a very <UNK> and clear plot in an attempt to fulfill the <UNK> circle of an actor's plight the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer in an overly long running time the <UNK> of <UNK> struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and <UNK> the storyline into a <UNK> frame of a disastrous display the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out <UNK> <UNK> just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same never feeling a convincing victory over <UNK> pain we never feel a victory in <UNK> talent
<START> i was a bit scared to watch this movie due to its rates but living in italy titles like this never ever come across and i love step so much that i decided to give it try and how surprised i was the story is different from any other dance movie i've seen lately with a deeper meaning than just winning it's touching and well written and well directed <UNK> is such a strong character i love the fact that she never doubts herself she's so mature and focused and aware of her talent and what talent <UNK> wesley has my jaw dropped in the final dance scene the way she <UNK> her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is honestly inspiring also the fact that she's not the typical super hot chick see jessica alba <UNK> <UNK> jenna <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> makes her really appealing and real seriously why is this movie rated so low you can understand between the first 5 minutes that it's a good work really good actually i even cried at the end of the movie and the dancing routines are just sick
<START> there are a number of things that are not correct although this is not too important since what happened to whom and when is still in <UNK> the most blatant liberty with the facts i think is when they start to play at bruno <UNK> <UNK> when in fact they played at the <UNK> and moved to the <UNK> later br br i agree with <UNK> that the film was biased in favour of pete <UNK> version but if he is the story <UNK> then i guess he calls the shots i also agree with <UNK> that the <UNK> pete best plays on say the last word on the subject of why he was fired br br although the film is not such a lavish production as the later film <UNK> i prefer this film because it is more accurate and because it has a better script with deeper characterisation br br there is plenty in the film that is quite substantial such as brian <UNK> trying to hide the fact that he has been <UNK> <UNK> only to find out that the band knew he was gay all along little touches like the band going into a <UNK> and <UNK> corn <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> my favourite scene which does have some <UNK> in fact is where at an audition stuart <UNK> has just bought his bass guitar but can't play it so he stands with his back to the <UNK> and tries <UNK> it but gets caught that's rock <UNK> roll br br well worth watching
<START> let's be honest as a film school project made without budget and real actors this is a <UNK> interesting film as something to be released on dvd for an innocent viewer it's a very poorly produced product if i would be <UNK> changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while as a person who bought this dvd under the impression that i would be getting a proper cinematic product i e a film i feel deeply disappointed it's a <UNK> tv play something along the line of old sixties serials but without that certain charm aside from the leading man mr <UNK> who also is the director the other actors seem to be either <UNK> from the campus a bit too old for that actually or members of the director's household who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting <UNK> but also the make up artist or <UNK> a <UNK> over <UNK> permanent <UNK> or a top hat over <UNK> is a very long way from creating <UNK> it's all shot using a <UNK> <UNK> camera in a small bare studio sometimes using blue screen for <UNK> backgrounds <UNK> generated uninspired score of lame period inspired romantic <UNK> insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion the film attempts to be <UNK> whereas in fact it's merely <UNK> <UNK> of those shots that made it to the editing and believe me the standards weren't too high to start with there are interesting dialogs every now and then but overall it's pretty lame and two dimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew that's how artsy films attempted to look in the 80s mr <UNK> does a much better job as an actor than the director
<START> well well one cant b wasting time just cause of a big star cast i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who some pathetic songs that will be heard by who some <UNK> abrupt <UNK> justified by who race against time u mean waste against time ok so first you spoil your kid then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a <UNK> movie to learn it hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway
<START> during the first 3 seasons fairly odd parents was as tasty as hard candy bright and sweet and <UNK> now it's as tasty as <UNK> <UNK> and unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> is what you'll need after viewing the more recent episodes where all the <UNK> has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs <UNK> once one of the more endearing nick characters has <UNK> into an abusive unfunny <UNK> that the cast of family guy wouldn't even want to know timmy has become a selfish arrogant <UNK> that bart simpson would happily beat the <UNK> out of and given <UNK> <UNK> that would take a lot of beating and poor <UNK> a real <UNK> who's become the victim of her husband and <UNK> she's now labeled a <UNK> for caring about the well being of others plus <UNK> stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he's never <UNK> for it nor does he learn any lessons which pretty much sums up butch <UNK> attitude towards kids they're crude vulgar and not too bright thank god this crummy <UNK> has been cancelled along with butch <UNK> darling danny phantom at least butch got what he deserved unlike <UNK>
<START> legend of zu is possibly the most exciting movie <UNK> seen in recent years it <UNK> all expectations and is truly a work of art with <UNK> visual <UNK> and story of divine proportions legend of zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its <UNK> this movie is <UNK> crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life the acting is perfect for this type of movie if you were an immortal with supernatural powers i would think you'd keep more to yourself br br unlike the comments of many the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic the plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you <UNK> for air legend of zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its <UNK> allow yourself to be completely <UNK> within its <UNK> vision and you will grow to love this movie
<START> i watched this movie by chance get curious by the trailer on tv i like when i discover movies like this little tender stories about ordinary people even if the end is tragic the man in the moon has some funny moments especially in the first characterization of dani with her innocent and pure love affair with court it's really a beautiful moving love story with 3 high points the performance of reese <UNK> who <UNK> her promises in the world of cinema the beautiful cinematography by the old lion <UNK> francis and the fantastic score by james <UNK> howard which is really the soul of the movie his themes which deserved an oscar nomination are so intimate and <UNK> that it seems they had transformed the screenplay in music
<START> another aussie masterpiece this <UNK> into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well it doesn't resort to the big special effects <UNK> like american flicks it focuses more on emotional impact a relatively simple plot that rebecca <UNK> co bring to life it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago strange things begin to happen in the house and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer highly recommended 8 10
<START> it is no wonder this movie won 4 <UNK> it is a movie that <UNK> to any soul it isn't a wonder why it took paul reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to peter falk about his idea i can understand every part of it this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear or thousands br br story 10 10 when sam <UNK> gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him to find something else his son and him take out on a road trip to find her and while they do that they find something lost friendship family and affection for each other at the beginning you know whats going to happen but none <UNK> the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end it is a ride between a father and his son and a husband and his wife it is no wonder it took paul reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romance comedy br br actors 10 10 well you cant say anything else that what i about to say hey it is with peter falk in it he is a legend everything he does in movies are magic when you use peter falk in a romance comedy what do you think you get a perfect outcome it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many <UNK> as the son paul reiser does an excellent job although he isn't a great actor always that doesn't mean that this didn't work actually peter falk and paul reiser plays the perfect father and son the rest of the cast is good enough but you don't see them as much so just say they do what they shall to get this to shine even more br br music 10 10 it doesn't always work when using music sometimes it just doesn't fit but that is not the thing in this movie the music is perfect in tune it makes the movie even more compelling this part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts a great soundtrack for a romance comedy thats for sure br br overall 10 10 there are so many romance comedy movies out on tapes dvds <UNK> ray and what not but this movie is one of the special ones it doesn't happen everyday that you can create a story like this it takes years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it took to make it a great piece that should be bought and kept into the human soul see it when you get old and see it with your father at a old age i think then this movie will spark like no other ever made
<START> i don't know what the rest of you guys watch steven seagal movies for but i watch them because as silly as they are they're at least always good for a laugh why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of br br attack force is by no means a great movie but i felt it was as worthy a steven seagal vehicle as many of his other movies in fact i didn't think it was one of his worst by a long shot it had most of the time a half way coherent plot line and it was most of the time <UNK> exciting the ending really sucked but even that had some <UNK> trashy elements in the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised but i actually thought that the acting characterization if i may use such a big word and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true steven seagal fan would expect seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone faced no nonsense man's man that we've come to expect and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well without ever up staging him this people is what a steven seagal movie does deal with it or even better laugh at it br br 4 out of 10
<START> i haven't written a review on imdb for the longest time however i felt myself compelled to write this when looking up this movie i found one particular review which <UNK> people not to see this film do not pay any attention to this ignorant person nothing is a fantastic film full of laughs and above all imagination aren't you sick and tired of being force fed the same old cycle of bubble <UNK> trash movies sometimes a film like nothing comes along and gives you something you have never seen before i don't even care if you dislike even hate the movie but no one has a right to <UNK> the film imdb has a monumental impact on <UNK> and no negative review should <UNK> the film like that just say you hate it and why you hate it but don't try to tell people that they shouldn't watch it we have minds of our own and will make up our own minds thank you br br if my judgment is any good i'd say that more people will enjoy this movie as opposed to those who hate it br br treat your mind to a bit of eye candy see nothing
<START> who can watch a movie look at lucy liu and not be <UNK> that woman is amazingly beautiful a talented actress that's a tough combination to find now a days and jeremy northam i heard his name plenty of times but i never really noticed him my advice to hollywood is use him more br br now about the movie i watched it in one of my graveyard shift i don't recommend that to anyone it's a bit to complicated mysterious for that i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming i'm not gonna say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie although saying this is <UNK> enough br br now i'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie i love the dark <UNK> story the actors did a good job i love the directors natali work in the past there's not a big audience for this kind of thing that's also pretty <UNK> you know what i'm just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this then again 1 point <UNK> cause there is always space for improvement
<START> despite the title the sword <UNK> and the dvd cover action <UNK> poses of the sword <UNK> this is not a super hero film br br minor spoilers it follows the tale of <UNK> the sword <UNK> who is cursed with having a <UNK> sword in his <UNK> cool you say but no this is real life if you had this power as a child could you control it when say faced by a mad man or when your <UNK> boyfriend is beating her and if you don't control it how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12 br br this essentially is where <UNK> is when we meet him wandering <UNK> after another killing much like a bout de <UNK> he then meet <UNK> and the pair fall instantly in love providing <UNK> with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways however his past is still chasing him in the form of two police officers br br that is essentially the story and there is virtually no action on screen though a lot if suggested br br i really like this movie unlike many hollywood <UNK> <UNK> films we get very little back story there is no bad guy unless you count the sword <UNK> himself <UNK> there is a lot of heart and good character development br br worth checking out if you can find it
<START> as usual hollywood stereotyped everyone in the movie but this one is a classic from the uptight white collar <UNK> to the russian woman well done even facial expressions were great language was perfect even in russian language and nicole did a splendid job hey guys you get what you pay for
<START> i saw it i agree with him 100 but i didn't care for his delivery he just came off as an <UNK> in a poorly edited contrived juvenile <UNK> campaign edit cuts <UNK> etc the camera would be focused on him and you'd see 2 or 3 edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog add in the constant boom <UNK> in the camera shot which is a film no no br br this documentary hits a topic with so many angles so many interesting stories that the movie is just so easily done picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid it is so easy it is just wrong i mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut <UNK> to make them <UNK> themselves you just let them <UNK> more then a <UNK> or two i do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely <UNK> themselves br br i just think he could have done something a little more creative the part with the <UNK> talking about brain activity was never fleshed out it could have been interesting to show brain <UNK> of people during religious fits compared to drugs or sex or he could have played more on the women all <UNK> over the passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new rob zombie movie more could have gone into the history of john smith the mormon <UNK> who had quite the colorful past delve into science v s religion one is a very <UNK> very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories it builds on itself from a solid bottom up a new <UNK> on top of a more proved <UNK> an enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way the other starts at the top and comes down with <UNK> claims it is so because <UNK> i said so br br done <UNK> i'd say turn it into an hbo original <UNK> hit a different religion every week br br it was an eye opener about one thing i must have been blind good <UNK> g w bush no wonder he got elected he had the religious majority and well now that is the blind leading the blind br br bill <UNK> well what can i expect from a guy who hands out at <UNK> in <UNK> beach
<START> i bought this movie for 5 at a used cd store and i kinda regret it i'll start by saying i'm a huge fan of cheesy horror flicks they provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment this movie entertained for the first half hour because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an mst3k style manner quite easily then it got boring br br the acting is the scariest part of the movie while great acting is not to be expected this was laughably bad and honestly provided all of the entertainment that was to be had this is the plus side to the movie where the movie really <UNK> in entertaining is the writing lighting and the editing br br this movie provides way too many what the is going on moments there are many moments such as the mother having strange fits at dinner and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie along the lines of dinner someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat <UNK> food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served during the <UNK> and other inappropriate moments the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside then cuts back in and speaking of darkness outside one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate where apparently it isn't <UNK> unless it's <UNK> and speaking of darkness a big problem with the movie is that it's so poorly lit you can't see what's going on half the time which is more of a frustration than anything in one of the climactic scenes you can't even tell what you're supposed to be seeing that's so shocking br br and when it comes to climactic scenes unhinged contains one of the worst i've seen people say wow that surprised me and that's good i can say that the big reveal did surprise me because i didn't see it coming the reason i didn't see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense i won't ruin it for you but i will tell you that my friend and i spent a good twenty minutes <UNK> to various parts of the movie to find anything that would have <UNK> that at all and all we found were more things saying that it wasn't possible br br all in all this movie is actually better when you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it i love crap horror movies but this was too much
<START> a slow tedious and one dimensional movie good casting with clichéd dialogue boring story line and soulless direction from mr <UNK> the conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the asian continent lacks heart new insights and depth the lead character looks out of place due to her tiny <UNK> and phony looking contact <UNK> the <UNK> employed by the <UNK> sounds forced and a bit too sophisticated for their limited exposure in the ways of education the story goes on and on for hours trying to convince you this little boring flat <UNK> asian girl is the ultimate geisha they actually say in the movie she is destined to become a legend i say hardy the case the movie is just plain boring it is beautiful to look at it has a very few interesting moments as many as you may find by going out for <UNK> basically if you don't believe the <UNK> you wont believe the message and this girl didn't fill the shoe <UNK> boring skip it
<START> i've loved all of <UNK> work even as there is such a small and precious <UNK> of work to take hold even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs <UNK> and <UNK> off of <UNK> of fire are prime examples still rock the <UNK> off of more than half of any given rock act working today this power to <UNK> on stage is given one of the most <UNK> rock band <UNK> ever with their royal albert hall shows last year they may have gotten older as have their fans but the energy is still there with the great <UNK> of classic blues songs as well as their own the <UNK> of white room <UNK> politician <UNK> sunshine of your love not one seems to miss a beat <UNK> <UNK> have a <UNK> that he sometimes doesn't have when on stage with his solo band ginger baker enough said jack bruce is <UNK> enough with his <UNK> still with a kind of power that <UNK> could never get on his own bottom line if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year well some may have seen them it's all on this dvd with cool special features
<START> photography was too <UNK> to follow dark scenes hard to see br br had good story line too bad it got lost somewhere too <UNK> for what was really happening bottom line is it's a <UNK> movie
<START> i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work finally found it yesterday 2 13 <UNK> on lifetime movie channel br br jim <UNK> comments about it being a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths were dead on writers probably shouldn't get a bonus everyone else <UNK> for making the movie br br anybody who <UNK> a romantic movie should see it br br <UNK> screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric to say nothing of her beauty that anything she is in goes on my favorite list her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for br br god bless her her family and future <UNK> br br this movie doesn't seem to available in dvd or video yet but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too
<START> this kind of film has become old hat by now hasn't it the whole thing is <UNK> nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of <UNK> loop br br it sure sounds like a good idea a great ensemble cast some good gags and some human drama about what could have might have been unfortunately there is no central event that <UNK> them all together like there was in the big chill one of those <UNK> movies that <UNK> <UNK> films like this one you end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone the <UNK> this creates is not just annoying it's <UNK> the below average script doesn't help
<START> <UNK> lamas stars as some type of cia agent who captures some exotic beauty named <UNK> kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former <UNK> o j simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble i must admit i'm not a fan of <UNK> lamas or his movies he stinks however when compared to o j simpson and <UNK> <UNK> wife <UNK> lamas seems like ah jean claude van damme i only saw cia because of the <UNK> interest around the o j simpson trial you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels you couldn't escape this movie in 1994 you could go to an <UNK> community and some moron would have this playing in their <UNK> tv the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of o j simpson jumping after <UNK> and <UNK> would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor also where was bobby knight and <UNK> <UNK> to make this a complete camp classic br br out of 4 bad
<START> <UNK> is a film based on the infamous studio <UNK> of the 1970s the <UNK> for the social elite and party <UNK> in the film ryan <UNK> is the main character based on an actual employee of studio from 1977 1982 br br the film's problem is that it's all <UNK> and style and no substance it tries to be a really <UNK> and <UNK> satire like boogie nights but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe mike myers is given the <UNK> task of playing cocaine <UNK> club owner steve <UNK> it's only a slightly comedic role and if this was <UNK> best attempts at <UNK> into drama like lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time it's a total failure br br <UNK> could have been insightful and interesting but instead it's just another dumb teen flick that isn't entertaining or even remotely engaging view at your own peril
<START> <UNK> <UNK> tour de force performance which won her an <UNK> award is at least on par with her effort in <UNK> three years later colin <UNK> is also good and for those who are interested alice garner appears as <UNK> child and michael <UNK> best known for the castle is a <UNK> painter also interestingly <UNK> is currently the host of lifestyle program better homes and gardens and <UNK> is the host of property type programs including hot property hot <UNK> etc this film <UNK> the <UNK> held belief that <UNK> was arguably <UNK> top female actor during the early to mid 1980s rating <UNK> 100
<START> despite being quite far removed from my expectations i was thoroughly impressed by dog bite dog i rented it not knowing much about it but i essentially expected it to be a martial arts action film in the standard hong kong action tradition of which i am a devoted fan i ended up getting something entirely different which is not at all a bad thing while the film could be classified as such and there is definitely some good action and hand to hand combat scenes in the film it is definitely not the primary focus its characters are infinitely more important to the film than its fights a rather <UNK> thing in many hong kong action movies br br i was really quite surprised by the <UNK> of the characters and character relationships in the film the lead character played by edison <UNK> who is really very good becomes infinitely more complex by the end of the film than i ever thought he would be after watching the first thirty minutes the police characters also <UNK> my expectations thoroughly in fact the stark and honest portrayal of the seldom seen dark side of the police force was quite possible my favorite aspect of the film i don't know that i would say dog bite dog entirely <UNK> typical notions of bad criminal good cop but it certainly <UNK> them in ways not often seen in film unfortunately so many films especially hong kong action films i find portray police in what is frankly a very <UNK> <UNK> light this is one of my least favorite things about the genre i was pleasantly surprised to see that dog bite dog actually had some very unique and really quite courageous ideas to present about the police force there are <UNK> scenes in this film that i have never seen the likes of before and doubt i will ever see again and am sure i will remember for quite a while also the criminal characters are shown from an interesting perspective as well there is some documentary footage in the film of <UNK> boys no older than ten being made to fight each other to the death with their bare hands which i thought was one of the film's most powerful and moving moments it says a lot about the reason these guys are the way they are rather than simply <UNK> them also the relationship between <UNK> character and the girl he meets in the junk yard reveals a lot about his character it wasn't until this element entered the film that i really started to see the film as an emotional experience rather than only a visceral one there is something about most on screen relationships that doesn't quite get through to me but for some reason this one really did the actress does an incredible job with this role which i imagine was not easy to play br br dog bite dog also features some really breathtaking cinematography all though it is unfortunately rather uneven there were some moments that i found really striking particularly in the last segment of the film but there was also a good deal of camera work that was just ok another slight problem i had was with the pacing which i also felt was uneven i found a lot of the looking for a boat scenes to be a little <UNK> all though it quickly picks up after that the action scenes are short and not too <UNK> but are truly powerful and <UNK> particularly towards the end the fight choreography is honestly not all that impressive for the most part all though to its credit it is solid and fairly realistic but the true strength is the emotional content behind the fights the final scene while not a marvel of martial artistry or fight choreography is one of the most powerful final fights i have ever seen and i've seen quite a few martial arts films br br i suppose the biggest <UNK> factor of whether or not one will get much out of dog bite dog is whether or not you can connect with the characters all of them are certainly some of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind but there was something very human about all of them that i couldn't help but be drawn to and really feel for them particularly <UNK> girlfriend i should say that i doubt most people will like the film as much as i did simply because i imagine that most people will not like or care about the characters in the same way but i still recommend it highly all the same it is truly a deeply moving and <UNK> film if you give it a chance
<START> the movie starts out fine widower out with new girlfriend and the children br br the movie is filled with stupid director's choices like lets separate i am coming down to do what stupid stupid stupid br br please do not waste your time hoping that it will get better not hardly
<START> i read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie <UNK> this movie was predictable and pretty boring the acting was below average most of the time especially by <UNK> i haven't seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone <UNK> in a movie oh man this movie was a letdown i also read somewhere this might be a cult classic i know there are followers of the director but this movie was just a average piece of film br br the script was lame for the most part the acting was lame this movie was lame br br oh and pray for the guy that used to be in cheers he looks really bad br br the best actor in this movie was probably the guy in office space and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes br br 4 10
<START> i do find it a bit overrated maybe it's just because i've never seen a subtitled version dubbing stinks but i just don't get into it like a lot of other people do the finale is really great though as jackie <UNK> a mall a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping
<START> this is a better adaptation of the book than the one with paltrow although i liked that one too it isn't so much that beckinsale is better they are both very good but that the screenplay is better davies is a master at adapting austen for filming and the production values here are very good it's not quite as glossy as the hollywood treatment but it's close and i thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better
<START> it's my opinion that when you decide to re make a very good film you should <UNK> to do better than the original or at least give it a fresh point of view now the 1963 robert wise telling of shirley jackson's remarkable novel the haunting of hill house is worth the price of admission even today now fast forward to 1999 and the re make i was left shaking my head and asking why the acting is wooden the story <UNK> and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate i had heard that this update was bad but couldn't believe it was that bad considering the source material i was wrong after watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was she said well they got your money she's right don't let them get yours if there's no profit in making lousy re makes maybe they'll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn't insult their audience
<START> melvyn douglas once more gives a polished performance in which this time he <UNK> the role of a detective who can't place love before duty and adventure and the <UNK> beautiful joan blondell who far from being illiterate as one reviewer suggested wrote a novel about her early life is as enjoyable as ever as his ever suffering sweetheart it's almost a screwball comedy almost a thin man type movie almost a series i guess that didn't quite make it to a sequel it doesn't quite reach classic status but it has all the ingredients for a fun 85 minutes with an episodic but <UNK> script fine character actors and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don't notice that williams douglas isn't exactly columbo when it comes to <UNK> i wish there were more films like this
<START> brothers with <UNK> powers yes really duel not just for debra <UNK> affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers br br there are surreal touches the fire <UNK> that act like a singing greek chorus but there is also humour and romance the soundtrack is great similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song they could get but with fire and i don't think i'll ever forget dennis quaid <UNK> dennis quaid setting his own trailer a <UNK> to <UNK> a <UNK> priceless br br best line missing from the quotes section btw <UNK> you've had a clown you never go back ' br br i love this movie i ordered the dvd from the us and if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with <UNK> blond 3 don't put you off give it a try
<START> harvey <UNK> best performance so far the new century very nicely photographed a beautiful snap shot of pre castro cuba the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections it's really about the moment when a boy <UNK> to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger much more complex world that he doesn't yet understand the script is strong and filled with humor the direction is crisp over all a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema the one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync sound english rather than spanish probably to improve sales in the us unfortunately this just makes the film a little less convincing but if you can see beyond this you will find a heartfelt trip to another world recommended
<START> this was a strong <UNK> <UNK> television mystery selection the characters were vivid and well acted the plot and the main setting a student hostel were excellent <UNK> was nothing special but for me did not distract from story one significant point many <UNK> <UNK> don't recognize good acting or good characterization i also think they are rather harsh in their <UNK> of some of the <UNK> mysteries finally i have read few christie novels none in recent years and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about changes from the novel please viewers consider what is presented to you on film not what you think should be there that said the <UNK> mysteries <UNK> in quality but not as much as reviewers and <UNK> would have you believe with the <UNK> exception of the five little pigs which was fabulous in plot character and theme the longer <UNK> films are neither that good or that bad for the record i have seen all the longer <UNK> <UNK> films finally films without <UNK> <UNK> and or <UNK> are neither good nor bad because of their absence there presence however is either <UNK> almost always with <UNK> or irrelevant with <UNK> <UNK> is in the middle
<START> in <UNK> <UNK> the stooges are at there best in this short the trio are <UNK> working in a recording studio they end up getting a look at alice van <UNK> christine <UNK> singing the voice of spring the voice is amazing curly in drags is heard by mrs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moe calls curly senior <UNK> the three stooges end up going to party where curly is going to dress up in drags they play a record of the voices of spring and all is going well until moe destroy the record on <UNK> head they end up using the <UNK> <UNK> until the <UNK> <UNK> them and <UNK> it alice van <UNK> catches on to the boy scream and hides behind a curtain to help them out all is well until the <UNK> wonders how curly is singing without the aid of a <UNK> discovers alice behind the curtain the three stooges are revealed to be <UNK> but <UNK> father discovers his daughter's talent and agrees that she should become a singer the <UNK> are <UNK> out of the room excellent
<START> if you only read a synopsis of the plot this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930's the story would seem quite contrived the subject matter <UNK> the strength and beauty of this film is in the direct <UNK> performances of the cast i have seldom seen jean harlow display such a range of feeling rich and subtle nuances <UNK> over her face if you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the <UNK> there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters the raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed so true the final sequence is almost <UNK> poignant when clark gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son lifts him up and proudly says my kid i couldn't help remember that mr <UNK> own son was born to him <UNK> this is one of the finest examples of depression era cinema
<START> yet another example of what british cinema can achieve a simple story told and acted well brenda <UNK> gives a layered and warming performance as the recently widowed and <UNK> <UNK> grace <UNK> <UNK> by a solid supporting cast the quirky small town card gets played to the <UNK> similar to many tv series and films that have come from the british <UNK> in recent years <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and others come to mind like the <UNK> this film makes use of some <UNK> beautiful rural scenery in this case the wet and wild <UNK> coast br br some viewers might find <UNK> acceptance of <UNK> use a bit challenging others might find the ending just a little too cute and safe but it's an enjoyable <UNK> to be sure
<START> the 1990's begun to have day time talk shows <UNK> up left and right every network had one and they all lacked one thing originality ricky lake was just another show to entertain the <UNK> trailer park mother with a <UNK> cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of <UNK> illiterate children the english language and other <UNK> of mankind where ruined by this shows existence <UNK> ranging from girl you a <UNK> head and so on how could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill <UNK> and dead beat fathers the people who appear on this show were trash the people who watched this show were trash anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto dvd is trash people wonder why americans are becoming huge <UNK> of <UNK> and too fat to even get jobs its having shows like this tell them its ok to be <UNK> overweight and have 12 year old girls act like prostitutes having such trash on tv has ruined morals
<START> that magical moment in life that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood and the confusing <UNK> that marks <UNK> this is what this movie is all about br br <UNK> wonderfully played by reese <UNK> is right at that moment in life when the movie starts she <UNK> over elvis playing his records and <UNK> thinking about love maureen her sister will soon be off to college has no trouble with <UNK> boys is beautiful and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn't she dates a local loser <UNK> father is also after her and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet <UNK> like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn't good enough she wants to be maureen but doesn't see that she is beautiful herself br br the moment <UNK> begins to <UNK> itself upon her life is when she meets court foster for the first time court <UNK> father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers he has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun on one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find <UNK> skinny <UNK> they yell and argue and <UNK> leaves but they see each other a day later when <UNK> mother is invited to <UNK> to visit old friends <UNK> parents <UNK> becomes attracted to court and court to <UNK> she is a <UNK> and is <UNK> has attitude and says whats on her mind br br court is 17 and <UNK> 14 and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between court working the farm by the time court kisses her one day <UNK> is smitten <UNK> father tells her to invite court to the house and he does but things are uncomfortable for court on his sort of date the silence though is broken by his meeting with maureen who has yet to see court one look between the two and its all over the looks of pain and defeat on <UNK> face are both beautiful in their <UNK> to life and painful at the same time the rest of the movie i will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters br br the greatness of the movie is in its depiction of <UNK> moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love and the pain they must endure both together and <UNK> <UNK> eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair painful and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of <UNK> so perfectly this movie has since the first time i watched it stuck in my mind its in the my top 100 movie list and deservedly so i only wish more movies like this were made because if so my faith in hollywood would be a lot better
<START> there's really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis i mean it's shakespeare's hamlet for goodness sake  probably one of the best known plays ever written i'm not embarrassed to admit that i came to this version of hamlet the way most people on imdb have  through mystery science theater 3000 while the show may not be the best <UNK> to use to judge a movie in this case i cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic <UNK> in a word this german made for tv version of hamlet is dreary <UNK> minutes no way it's too dark and depressing to be anything i want to spend almost three hours on i've said it any number of times but entertainment is the thing for me and this <UNK> <UNK> is far from entertaining i will however give it a couple of points for what i felt was some reasonably good acting a 3 10 sounds about right to me br br as much as i enjoy mst3k their comments don't help to make hamlet any more <UNK> there are a few good <UNK> here and there but overall hamlet is just the wrong movie for mst3k shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow as much as it pains me i've got to give hamlet a 1 5 on my mst3k rating scale
<START> this one's a romp many trek fans don't rate this as high as the well known all time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or <UNK> of those really great ones but this one is so well executed for what it is so successful as pure entertainment it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes no matter what mood i'm in several well known future movies <UNK> and tv shows the more bland fantasy island took their cue from the premise of this episode then of course the <UNK> show <UNK> the concept with the <UNK> technology beautifully filmed especially evident in the restored version and on dvd and directed it takes place in the nice park like setting of a planet which the enterprise has just arrived to it's odd that no animal life even insects seems to exist here how are flowers <UNK> for example but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past kirk has a people heavy past it turns out as well as figures from other well known fantasy stories <UNK> even finds an old style police revolver adding to his collection of swords no doubt br br by this point in the trek series halfway thru the first season the main characters had pretty much <UNK> into the old friends we'd come to know over the many <UNK> years here we get to really see them relax <UNK> and work together to figure out this <UNK> puzzle the strong narrative is a mystery again of sorts and the audience is along for the ride as kirk friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them it's almost whimsical following up on the <UNK> style established up on the starship as kirk was finally <UNK> into <UNK> down after showing definite signs of stress and <UNK> the enterprise had it's suggested just completed a harrowing mission then dr mccoy is killed by a knight on <UNK> yes this is dr <UNK> final episode just kidding but it's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story mccoy really is dead for all <UNK> and purposes and like the best trek episodes the 2nd half of this adventure <UNK> to a more frantic more desperate <UNK> of action and suspense this is all <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> response to <UNK> who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after <UNK> death kirk will get to the bottom of all this come what may br br but it doesn't get much easier for kirk what follows is probably the longest staged <UNK> a <UNK> fight for the series as kirk <UNK> with his nemesis from his academy days a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet yet this is <UNK> by scenes of extraordinary <UNK> with another of <UNK> past <UNK> this episode runs the gamut of all human experience rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet it's <UNK> that the script really does explain all of what's happened as opposed to some nonsensical approach which <UNK> many other fantasy sci fi series with similar plot lines unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there and there actually is a subtext to the story that we humans need to <UNK> off our tensions and <UNK> in a particular fashion or we just don't function in a <UNK> natural way also note the appearance of the very cute <UNK> <UNK> and the sudden absence of <UNK> <UNK> who did not return until the first trek movie in <UNK> i believe that after this episode even more trek fans couldn't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters but i leave this episode with a final perhaps <UNK> thought if mccoy was killed <UNK> by spock how do we know it was our real mccoy who <UNK> back up to the ship perhaps this explains why this mccoy was still <UNK> <UNK> about a century later and getting along very well with data
<START> this <UNK> just didn't do it for me while some things such as the battle royal and involvement of celebrities were a <UNK> to the good old days so to speak it seemed to be more of a <UNK> in your house than anything else above average worth it for several matches such as the tag team title match although worthy of note is that the title change meant nothing as it was <UNK> the next night
<START> i had fun watching red eye it's not a masterpiece but it's well directed and structured cillian murphy and rachel mcadams are perfect in the role yes it's the same old story with a different setting but wes craven gave it a good pace at least not another scream with the usual college killer it's nice when you can see a clean coherent thriller even when originality doesn't stand out as its main character particularly from a film maker like craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good tv movie had it not been released <UNK> good job
<START> interesting how much more realistic <UNK> performance is to that of the original james bond novels when compared to the bond films he's neurotic paranoid an alcoholic and a <UNK> to boot this is perfect break for him even so much as to make fun of the bond icon i'm a mess a parody of myself he says it doesn't get any better than that i just finished reading dr no and this is very much how ian <UNK> had portrayed james bond personally i never liked brosnan as bond because he fit the icon too closely there was nothing for him to <UNK> the character with as compared to roger moore or sean connery its great to see brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and <UNK> off the wall a shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with it's an impressive portrayal and having greg <UNK> to ground him is just poetic this movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in my blue heaven but more genuine in their <UNK> <UNK>
<START> nicholas walker is paul the local town <UNK> who's married to martha ally <UNK> but also is a <UNK> <UNK> and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> however in so doing he gets a bout of <UNK> hence the name of the film sally <UNK> is also on hand as a crazy old <UNK> who <UNK> for the good <UNK> in a shades of misery type of way it's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this not the least bit john savage in a <UNK> forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator in a film billed as a <UNK> <UNK> one has to bring both elements into said movie while this does bring the former in <UNK> it sadly contains none of the latter furthermore you can't emphasize with any of the characters and as thus have absolutely no <UNK> interest in them technically not an all together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one br br eye candy <UNK> <UNK> gets topless sally <UNK> also shows some skin br br my grade c br br where i saw it showtime showcase
<START> a film about the harlem renaissance and one author in particular it <UNK> it with a modern day story about a young gay black artist br br if that sounds vague it's because the movie itself is it's well directed fairly well written and for the most part well acted also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black white also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does not shy away from sex scenes not that explicit and no frontal still i mostly hated this br br the film <UNK> all over the place is full of unlikable characters including the main protagonist and this is the killer moves at a <UNK> pace three times i considered leaving the theatre because i was so utterly bored but the director was there so i stayed br br his talk <UNK> shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete i really wish i could like this more there are very few films dealing honestly with gay blacks but i can't unless you're very interested in the harlem renaissance there's no reason to see this
<START> you might be a bit confused if you watch this silly made for from the beginning since the credits list susan <UNK> as special guest star um why would a one off <UNK> like this have a guest star well if you stick with it you'll find yourself paying attention to little else but ms <UNK> butt <UNK> in a <UNK> bikini as the <UNK> family house babe <UNK> on the beach to which that imaginative title <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is especially compelling when she shakes it at the camera while <UNK> and <UNK> her pseudo <UNK> brother in one mildly incestuous scene sadly <UNK> and her <UNK> fight a losing battle the <UNK> tv <UNK> that might have put that bottom over the top was three years off so that sweet <UNK> just gets a supporting role in 1976 fat freddy silverman would have put that behind right out front and used this flick as <UNK> audition tape for charlie's angels as is our susan was denied <UNK> <UNK> and had to settle for a very commendable career playing somber neurotic women br br the view beyond <UNK> <UNK> it must be said is not very compelling the scenery is nice and photographed in a bizarre <UNK> way that briefly fools you into thinking there might be some quirky creative intelligence at work behind the camera nope it's just a typically suspense challenged 70's made for tv thriller that allowed weekly series stars to make some extra cash and collect some cable <UNK> though they obviously didn't know that at the time and show off their range here we're treated to a tv scale nuclear family <UNK> off against tv scale thugs who can't decide whether they're a motorcycle gang or a hippie cult thus the filmmakers split the difference by putting them in <UNK> <UNK> and have never learned one of the primary lessons of 1970s television don't mess with dennis weaver see <UNK> and duel the only potential for depth in this movie is in the aforementioned teenage son character of steve played by the long forgotten if ever remembered <UNK> <UNK> who is supposed to be rebellious and troubled and might feel some sympathy for and attraction to the <UNK> mob that is supposedly menacing his family but steve as played by <UNK> gosh why didn't we see more from this <UNK> is actually just grumpy and moody and isn't one bit conflicted when big d gets serious and draws a line in the proverbial and literal sand for the sleep <UNK> and susan <UNK> there must be some of you out there only
<START> saw this on <UNK> tv here in australia the other week where it was titled laputa castle in the sky i had <UNK> subtitles and i think <UNK> provided their own for that which as usual was of very good quality br br just looked up laputa on <UNK> and it <UNK> what i suspected the floating island of this tale is taken from the classic jonathan swift novel <UNK> travels which was published in the early to mid <UNK> br br anyway this is an engaging japanese fairytale which features an english speaking voice cast it's suitable for young children i think but it does run at just over two hours in length so it may be too long for some though not for an adult like me br br the story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it the children are not the only ones looking for this island they have pirates the army and spies looking for the island too and looking to capture the children <UNK> the girl voiced by anna <UNK> and <UNK> the boy voiced by james van der <UNK> in order to help them find it br br the graphics are magnificent sort of photo realistic at times especially the scenes of <UNK> lit by torch light or the pretty scenes of bright sunny days with white clouds or <UNK> br br recommended
<START> even if you know absolutely nothing about ireland you have to love my left foot and especially daniel day <UNK> performance in it he plays cerebral <UNK> <UNK> christy brown due to this he has spent most of his life <UNK> even when trying to warn people about something they just laugh at him the light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part his left foot he uses that <UNK> to paint and write poetry bringing him to <UNK> br br daniel day lewis and director jim sheridan did very well on this collaboration and also on a later collaboration in the name of the father but the boxer was unnecessary my left foot can make you feel many ways sad hopeful or something else but in any case daniel day lewis gave the performance of a lifetime here a great movie in every sense
<START> i first saw this movie back in the early <UNK> when it was first released room with a view was also newly out enchanted april had so much more to offer i found it much more real and <UNK> the characters more believable for being <UNK> by the end of the film i felt the same as i did when i first saw the bbc production of pride and prejudice i was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation peace liberty or love you get a sense throughout that italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known that they are so <UNK> for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is <UNK> and <UNK> but in the heat of the spring in april everyone's lives <UNK> and unravel in line with the victorian <UNK> and are slowly <UNK> to everyone's satisfaction what a little gem of a film how come it isn't more well known
<START> i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film the humor seems to be destined for corpses it's slow the story is too simple to be true the characters do not raise much sympathy a few non important characters aside nothing surprising happens what did the writers of this script think <UNK> funny let's make some old <UNK> high on pot let's make them giggle let's make them behave like little children <UNK> yes that's absolutely brilliant and original br br this film has irritated me most from all the films i've seen in the last five years
<START> but the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying enjoy br br tom <UNK> is magnificent as dominick a mentally slow <UNK> who loves professional wrestling and his brother eugene played by ray liotta who is a doctor and who works very long hours br br due to <UNK> work schedule dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls he really just wants to be a good boy to do the right thing and to make his brother proud of him he stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started br br not about to give anything away here but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking those <UNK> of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story its loving characters and a great song i cannot quote here that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriate but you hear it in a bar br br i thought tom <UNK> would be nominated for this movie since he was for <UNK> i figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning no such luck liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact but then he does later on all i can say about jamie lee curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in <UNK> about two brothers who you will never forget
<START> saw this movie in an early preview and i cannot stress enough how bad i thought this film was from the very beginning the audience was <UNK> over <UNK> awful southern accent poor al looked really really <UNK> and i can't decide whether this was <UNK> part of his role as a drug addicted <UNK> or perhaps he just didn't get any sleep before coming to the set much worse than <UNK> close ups however is the wretched excuse for a plot early in the film we are given <UNK> that <UNK> character is gay and i suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended later however we are supposed to suspend our <UNK> and believe that both tea <UNK> and kim basinger both of whom are <UNK> through lame roles lust after this elderly half dead looking <UNK> man with the ridiculous accent the worst part overall was the main plot thread which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ever care about in the slightest because this was a preview i will <UNK> my final judgment because of the possibility of re shoots and editing but you can bet i will not pay a <UNK> to see this in theaters
<START> the guy who wrote directed and <UNK> in this shocking piece of trash should really consider a <UNK> change yes rob <UNK> i mean you seriously who <UNK> this crap there are so many talented writers out there whom money could be better spent on i think the idea is great but the acting script and directing is just plain awful the jokes are so not funny i understand that they are supposed to be taking the mickey but do it with style this movie is screaming 1995 saturday night live skits why i say again why do studios give money to <UNK> like rob <UNK> never give a comedian the opportunity to write direct and star in his own movie duh
<START> there is an episode of the simpsons which has a joke news report referring to an army training base as a <UNK> factory here the comment is simply part of a throwaway joke but what patricia <UNK> documentary does is show us <UNK> that it is not that far from the truth after world war two the us army decided to tackle a problem they faced throughout the war that many soldiers got into battle and found themselves totally unable to kill another human being unless it was a matter of <UNK> or <UNK> since then the training process of the us army has been to remove all moral <UNK> and turn <UNK> into killing machines who don't think of <UNK> as people to develop in them a most unnatural state the <UNK> urge to kill br br first off this isn't an <UNK> movie as such whilst it certainly paints war in a very bad light <UNK> focuses rather on an aspect that doesn't get as much media attention as say the debate over the <UNK> of a war or it's physical <UNK> or failures the affect the process of turning a man into a soldier has on that person as a human being it's the <UNK> that to train someone to be a soldier to defend society makes them totally <UNK> to live as part of that society themselves and whilst most of the examples and <UNK> are from the current middle east conflict <UNK> makes the <UNK> to past conflicts especially vietnam painfully clear this isn't about any particular war it's about the problems caused by war in general br br <UNK> the film seems to be split into three sections how <UNK> are drawn into the army and the training they receive how they are treated once they are in combat and what happens once they leave the army once this point is reached you realise that the main target of this film is actually the <UNK> that are inherent in the armed forced <UNK> that are put into place to make soldiers into an <UNK> combat force but <UNK> all humanity from the individuals those interviewed tell the camera how the <UNK> process seems so clean and simple how word like democracy and freedom are <UNK> around but once the training begins they become enemy and kill and destroy how once in action soldiers don't care what they are ordered to do as they are <UNK> with the idea that as soon as they carry out an order whatever it may be they are one step closer to going home they have no political or social ideals to fight for but fight and kill as that's what they've been trained to do br br but the ground <UNK> main goal is to highlight the way the us army <UNK> those who have fought for their country once they return home there is no real <UNK> given to soldiers returning and many are forced to go home unable to cope with what they have seen and done and most <UNK> in place seem to be to make sure the army has no legal responsibility whatsoever for psychological affects their soldiers pick up this is the final <UNK> that once they are used they are cast away br br if there is a flaw in the film it is that <UNK> doesn't attempt to show another side to the argument you would get the impression that every single soldier who ever went to war would come back with post traumatic stress syndrome it would have been interesting to see those of <UNK> less liberal upbringing give their opinions of how the army handles training and <UNK> there is never a chance for the other side of the argument to make itself known br br but other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary and <UNK> use of stock footage and music is perfectly <UNK> to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the <UNK> of war
<START> robin williams and kurt russell play guys in their 30's who put their <UNK> in <UNK> by deciding russell somewhat reluctantly to replay their heartbreaking tie with rival <UNK> years after the fact williams is ok but russell is flat out great as legendary <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> holly palance does a nice and attractive turn as <UNK> wife who could live without this <UNK> film is worth watching just to see the famed <UNK> in action highly recommended
<START> this is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the <UNK> left on earth by the <UNK> or buildings of man it begins with a vast factory complex <UNK> with people making a great variety of little things parts of high tech equipment presumably it isn't really made very clear the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they're <UNK> around outside in little yellow <UNK> the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory and talking with his crew as he does so this is a world of relentless <UNK> it's a relief at least to know these soulless images aren't going to be presented without a human voice as is the case in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cold documentary about the food industry <UNK> daily bread ' <UNK> <UNK> contains images of people <UNK> e waste and a town many towns really being wiped out by the biggest <UNK> ever with a single <UNK> trademark shot of a little girl in the <UNK> of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of <UNK> almost bigger than she is some of these scenes the ones with miserably <UNK> workers <UNK> in dangerous and toxic places might have been shot <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> photographer <UNK> <UNK> but this photographer isn't as interested in seeing people up close his <UNK> places him somewhere in between <UNK> and the cold neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis <UNK> br br all this happens in china of course though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large <UNK> site in <UNK> it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately <UNK> and oppressive there are a good many stills of the <UNK> work or were some of them made by the film crew it isn't made clear br br edward <UNK> is the name of the photographer we see people wandering through <UNK> of his beautiful work big dramatic <UNK> of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow the irony is that <UNK> makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially <UNK> and to the ordinary eye are <UNK> and boring he admits himself that he takes no political stand when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the <UNK> eye of the film's cinematographer peter <UNK> <UNK> work almost amounts to a kind of <UNK> and hence <UNK> but he is showing us places that if we look closely reveal their full dark story of <UNK> and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be br br <UNK> but not entirely fortunately it is <UNK> whose voice overs <UNK> most of the film as it <UNK> over various sites <UNK> <UNK> may have inspired his decades of fine work but they amount to nothing but <UNK> about how we're changing the planet <UNK> are <UNK> on oil which will run out that china has come into the game of massive <UNK> late and so may burn out early with the <UNK> of <UNK> fuel the interest of <UNK> <UNK> would be much greater if there were <UNK> new ideas to <UNK> it the reasons for watching it are two to see glimpses of <UNK> work and the raw <UNK> the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully and to observe scenes from the vast awesome <UNK> and rather horrifying <UNK> of modern china br br because of the limitations of the narration the idea of the title <UNK> <UNK> feels <UNK> developed it even seems a <UNK> new landscapes they are but they are the <UNK> of <UNK> rather than <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> might be better titles there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject and those who want to know more about edward <UNK> might do better to <UNK> his books or <UNK>
<START> i really miss the production of good old fashion spooky films if <UNK> <UNK> and james <UNK> had been given the task of producing such a film it may have been this one save for the lack of an <UNK> known top <UNK> cast this is one of those films that you watch alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn and you don't even bother doing the <UNK> until morning because you just want to hide under the covers bravo to director herbert wise writers susan hill and <UNK> <UNK> top production design by jon <UNK> art direction by john ralph and an excellent cast for making me <UNK> and feel so isolated even though i'm living in one of the most populated cities in the world in the beginning of the 21st century i gave it a 9 out of 10 because with the production and budget constraints of television they really pulled of a great show
<START> this version of anna christie is in german greta garbo again plays anna christie but all of the other characters have different actors from the english version both were filmed back to back because garbo had such a following in germany garbo herself supposedly <UNK> her anna christie in this version over the english version it's a good tale and a must see for garbo fans
<START> my wife and i rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and office space blockbuster and imdb even had it as an also recommended selection if you liked office space br br now i've seen office space probably 15 or 20 times i love it it's probably one of my 10 favorite movies witty humorous and featuring characters that remind me of people i've worked with over the years <UNK> tunnel is similar to office space in that they are both films that's where the similarity ends we sat through probably the first 50 minutes of <UNK> giving it the benefit of the doubt hoping <UNK> praying that it would get better it didn't we couldn't take it any more and stopped the tape thank god it was a free rental i'd have been p ed if we'd actually paid for it we should be <UNK> for having to sit through it now since we didn't see the end perhaps it miraculously comes together and <UNK> itself i doubt it br br <UNK> tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it ever got produced the movie is so unfunny it's painful just mail the <UNK> letters already the premise is <UNK> the jokes are awful we got as far as the <UNK> doesn't work scene and had to stop we couldn't take it anymore this film is an <UNK> for josh kornbluth br br if you are a fan of office space don't waste your time with this turd 0 10
<START> how wonderful yet another movie about america by someone who has visited here probably a half dozen times a day a piece and believes himself to be an expert on the country <UNK> i should take a trip to germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about germany as the land of nazis or some such <UNK> <UNK> boy you should get together with lars von trier and make the ultimate movie about the americans of course we all know it takes a pretentious left <UNK> we are the world european to make a real movie about america br br yeah right for a continent that started not one but two world wars europe sure has a lot of opinions about america's wrong foreign policy br br p s don't worry <UNK> <UNK> boy there's plenty of <UNK> berkeley americans that'll just love your movie of course these are the same people who thinks george w bush is worst than hitler and that a painting of a can of soup is sheer genius
<START> not as bad as it's credited to being <UNK> done far worse  more so disappointing for me such an imaginative concept which is never really <UNK> in to by hooper with his <UNK> direction and even less so in the <UNK> excuse the pun writing it goes so sinister and over the top in a dead serious tone becoming ridiculous and <UNK> letting the whole <UNK> mystery conspiracy laced narrative being easily <UNK> to end on something completely abrupt because of that the pacing goes on to be rather <UNK> and brad <UNK> cool to see him in a leading role seems to struggle with an off balanced performance despite <UNK> out a <UNK> quirky intensity to his off colour character even though it's cheaply done there's a competent technical attitude to it however it doesn't seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to <UNK> in nasty <UNK> which some do work and strikingly steaming special effects flames flames everywhere instead hooper does display some <UNK> frenetic imagery more so towards the latter end and the camera work is <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> score is <UNK> the performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of william prince <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> young jon cypher and melinda dillon also <UNK> buck flower and john <UNK> have small but amusing <UNK> especially <UNK> nothing surprises but it's <UNK> engaging
<START> this is an excellent movie as a canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar the winter <UNK> <UNK> hunting and the like it is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me br br the story of grey owl is well known to many <UNK> credit to director attenborough and screenplay writer nicholson for <UNK> the story br br brosnan does well portraying a complex man a very fine performance annie <UNK> is lovely in her first large role the rest of the cast is solid
<START> <UNK> 3 things a movie needs a good script a good plot and good casting i watched this movie expecting it to be hilariously terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible i lost the will to live halfway through the only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a <UNK> was rose <UNK> who was the reason for me watching it in the first place she did a good job as <UNK> and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was 13 it was a fantastic first effort in a movie the dog was also very good both did a great job with such awful material sandra <UNK> i think was the biggest mistake of the movie she was completely miscast and i don't think she ever quite got the character br br i give the movie 2 out of 10 and thats only because of rose
<START> oh sam <UNK> we know you tried so hard this is your <UNK> <UNK> a shining example to the rest of us that you are certainly worth nomination into the academy of motion picture arts and <UNK> as you state on your 1998 era web site alas it's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt with ben arthur you do just that br br seemingly assembled with a lack of <UNK> or education the film's screenplay <UNK> us toward the truly bizarre with each new scene it's this insane excuse of a story that may also be the film's best ally beginning <UNK> the <UNK> titular characters ben and arthur attempt to marry going so far as to fly across country to do so in the <UNK> of <UNK> finest palm trees but all of this <UNK> is merely a lead in for blood then more blood and more and more blood i mean there must be at least 20 in fake blood make up in the final third of this film br br the film in its entirety is a technical <UNK> from the sound to the editing to the music which consists of a single fuzzy bass note being held on a keyboard it's a wonder that the film even holds together on whatever media you view it on it's such a shame then that some decent amateur performances are wasted here br br no matter sam i'm sure you've made five figures on this flick in <UNK> or whatever drives poor souls such as myself to view this film sadly we're not laughing with you
<START> first of all i'd like to say that i love the <UNK> man sketch on snl i always laugh out loud at tim <UNK> portrayal of leon <UNK> however there is a difference between an 8 minute sketch and a feature length movie watching leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his <UNK> and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show like the ladies man presents which is reminiscent of alfred hitchcock presents is absolutely hilarious there's a great episode where cameron diaz role plays monica <UNK> and leon plays bill and they call it the <UNK> office see that's funny br br in the movie we don't see leon on the show too often in fact he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country and the plot revolves around his quest for true love involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his <UNK> signed by sweet thing <UNK> parsons who is famous for playing <UNK> on fresh prince of <UNK> air works with him on the show and has a secret crush on leon the movie just <UNK> on one boring subplot after another and the gags are boring as well the first time we see leon mention the word wang it's pretty funny when he uses it over and over again supposedly trying to get a laugh the joke has run dry most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before and done better on the snl sketch and played out <UNK> for a whole hour and twenty five minutes they even try to insert a musical number by will ferrell and his gang of <UNK> man <UNK> who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him to bring some life into this witless comedy ferrell has some funny moments and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role ferrell just has that unique comic talent and he's funny at almost anything he does even <UNK> moore gets a cameo watching her you can't but wonder what the hell is an oscar winning actress doing in this movie her name wasn't mentioned in the opening credits probably by her <UNK> and of course a movie of this theme has to include the master of love himself billy dee williams billy dee is charismatic as always but even he can't breathe enough life into this film i also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft r b hits which <UNK> the film even more giving it a horribly downbeat tone as if the script isn't boring enough i mean this is supposed to be a comedy the soundtrack would've been appropriate for something like love jones br br the ladies man only has <UNK> laughs there are exceptions in which snl can produce a great movie out of a short sketch watch both of the wayne's world movies and you'll see how it's done but this movie just like adapting mary catherine <UNK> character to screen in superstar shows the flip side some sketches are meant to be remembered on snl and not on the silver screen br br my score 3 out of 10
<START> i caught this film late on a sat night sunday morning with my brother we had been drinking this is one of the best films for ripping apart i have ever seen from the <UNK> ocean liner actually being a <UNK> on roll <UNK> ferry complete with cast iron everything to the doors with <UNK> <UNK> saying staff then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene this film rocks the continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it it <UNK> you in the face with the holes in the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance cut to his son and new girlfriend the ships <UNK> director who knows kung fu and used to be in the police but was <UNK> for doing things her way true on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion then the dad is there <UNK> them how who cares its magic there is not one redeeming feature to this film the casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table when being chased by the villains there is only one place to hide you've guessed it enter the villains who instead of checking under the one table proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar a corner bar in the casino fantastic they walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our casper to get around them and <UNK> them <UNK> br br get some mates over get a few drinks in put this film on and <UNK>
<START> if you merely look at the cover of this movie it's cool don't the movie itself put me to sleep it was slow paced had minimal violence and a poor use of suspense the acting was bottom <UNK> material and the plot while it would've been cool for a different movie was poorly shown here they even kill the only likeable character in the whole film i give it a 2 out of 10 because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end other than that you might want to save yourself from this movie trash
<START> in brooklyn a century ago the rivalry between chuck <UNK> and steve <UNK> and their competing <UNK> fire <UNK> leads to <UNK> famous bet that he can jump off the brooklyn bridge this is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a bugs bunny spoof <UNK> bugs from 1949 br br this generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some chinese <UNK> <UNK> a time capsule of <UNK> racial attitudes giving the film a great deal of historical interest in my view
<START> i had high hopes for this movie because i enjoyed the book so much however i don't think i would have understood the premise of the movie if i hadn't already read the book the movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of <UNK> government rule but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly the corrupt government officials have comfortable almost <UNK> lives while the common people struggle to obtain the bare <UNK> for survival perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and <UNK> regardless of whether or not they are actually <UNK> or repressed <UNK> <UNK> seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world it has been several years since i've read the book but one hears references to big brother the thought police and <UNK> frequently in the media and casual conversation probably many people using these terms don't realize where the terms came from i strongly recommend that you read the book
<START> despite having 6 different directors this fantasy hangs together remarkably well br br it was filmed in england nowhere near <UNK> in studios and on a few <UNK> at the <UNK> of war everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon br br notable for having one of the <UNK> lyrics in a song i want to be a <UNK> can't you understand it it remains a favourite of many people
<START> errol <UNK> greatest movie not just a sports movie with a wonder last 5 minutes where ward bond shines don't miss it just because you think its an old movie its a classic that could be easily missed do yourself a favour and don't
<START> like most people i love a christmas story i had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason it is awful same locale same narrator same director but the warm <UNK> of the original was lacking charles <UNK> was a poor choice to replace <UNK> <UNK> but i cannot imagine anyone being able to replace him the story seems forced and lacks the <UNK> of the original the interaction with the neighbors the <UNK> is ridiculous in a christmas story <UNK> obsession with the <UNK> gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring <UNK> <UNK> the original neighborhood bully is replaced in this film by yet another kid with <UNK> and a weird hat but with little of the <UNK> <UNK> menacing appeal it would be pretty difficult to equal the original even if this movie had been made with the original crew
<START> this has to be the <UNK> film made in 21st century it is all the way low quality but at the end it falls below everything all the cheap tricks like flashing and darkness are used to hide those crappy computer effects br br all the actors are below average especially the main character anne <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there is a scene where anne is asked why you seem so <UNK> the correct answer is because she can't act no matter what happens the world is about to be destroyed her friend is dying she is fired she has the same stupid grin in her face br br it is not only the movie which is b quality it is also the back cover description at least in <UNK> the text mentions things like <UNK> gray <UNK> capital <UNK> and main character <UNK> <UNK> and anna not anne <UNK> the description sounds like a different movie both featuring character called <UNK> and sea monsters
<START> inept boring and incoherent supernatural thriller in which college student cassie melissa <UNK> is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend sean <UNK> affleck br br i can't begin to tell you how bad this is nothing of any importance ever happens nor is there ever any sort of actual entertainment value i did not like this cast in this particular film they are all sadly unconvincing then again their roles are no good to promote this as a horror film is a joke where are the scares there's no sense or suspense there are a few good songs but that's about it br br how on earth did this project get the green light writer director steve carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that i can sense worst of all the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless br br the alleged killer cut that i watched is <UNK> minutes of pure tedium br br 1 10
<START> this is a plain old spooky ghost story i showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club and they were kept <UNK> until the ending no blood or gore just good old fashioned suspense it starts out right from the beginning and builds and builds the ending is a real twist that caught me <UNK> br br well directed and well acted it is also a period piece set in the 1920s which added to the atmosphere br br i was so impressed i got the book by susan hill from amazon the movie follows the book rather closely br br it's a shame it's not readily available on dvd my copy is vhs this along with haunted are probably two of the best ghost stories i've ever scene which just goes to show that a little creativity <UNK> in your face gore any day
<START> what does the marquis de <UNK> have to do with egyptian <UNK> and mermaid <UNK> <UNK> tobe hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film br br genie is a young <UNK> who visits her nerdy <UNK> father in <UNK> egypt genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker and blatant lesbian who services daddy on the side daddy gets sent back to the site where he <UNK> a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it genie meets a <UNK> of the marquis de <UNK> and falls for a hunky egyptian providing the film's <UNK> scenes eventually genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the <UNK> and bloody climax gets going wrapped around this story is footage of the marquis de <UNK> in prison talking to a portrait of what looks like genie br br robert englund is terrific as both the marquis and his <UNK> his acting abilities have always been <UNK> by his makeup <UNK> so he is allowed to shine here his best performance is still in killer tongue if you have not seen that yet br br the rest of the cast including young genie are pretty and average the script however is <UNK> you will quickly learn that the marquis scenes are completely unnecessary except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set the mermaid cult that eventually saves genie makes no sense whatsoever who the mermaid is is never explained and its link to christianity which is hyped throughout the film is nothing the film is very anti christian as the <UNK> is a bible <UNK> father but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute there are plenty of scenes of <UNK> and violence but hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say i know i have no idea br br so why am i <UNK> this film it is weird there is an extended sex scene for the ladies hunky egyptian rides a horse completely nude englund is marvelous do you like snakes this film is full of them this is like roger corman with a bigger budget knowing hooper somehow came up with crocodile after this is rather sad night <UNK> is not perfect but definitely worth a <UNK> <UNK> look br br this is rated r for physical violence some sexual violence gore profanity female nudity male nudity sexual content sexual references and drug abuse br br
<START> everyone else who has commented <UNK> about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful i wasn't going to comment but the film just bugs me so much and the writer director in particular so i must toss in my hat to join the <UNK> br br i saw the original wicker man and really loved the <UNK> of music <UNK> <UNK> in a modern world and the clash of <UNK> beliefs this said i am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done for example i liked the original 1950's invasion of the body <UNK> but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake both films can stand on their own another example is the thing the original as campy as it looks compared to today's standards has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with kurt russell my all time favorite horror movie so that small minority of people who like the wicker man re make can not <UNK> me of <UNK> this piece of crap just because it's a re make br br this film <UNK> for me neil <UNK> <UNK> and misogynistic <UNK> it also made me wonder how executives wanting to make a serious thriller would green light a product that is so anti female there are too many scenes of cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them <UNK> his investigation of a missing girl would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't <UNK> the original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a <UNK> based religion the threat to the main character came from everyone male and female there was no sexual <UNK> br br the metaphor of <UNK> <UNK> etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient the <UNK> must die especially when <UNK> character has <UNK> <UNK> i kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere <UNK> to stop these women from treating them like <UNK> these were not women with special supernatural powers and half of them seemed to be pregnant the other half old and fat and the rest girls and thin blonde <UNK> so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women physically dominate them there didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy but if they were content being <UNK> why make them unable to speak they could be used as a threat to cage because they will defend the community they are <UNK> because neil <UNK> seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men <UNK> that movie was made already the <UNK> wives anyone classic <UNK> from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh t together and were truly equal citizens br br the problem with the man hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when cage starts knocking women out i belief <UNK> should've left the society an <UNK> one kept the sexuality and <UNK> <UNK> and pushed buttons of <UNK> in regards to the children on that island no one likes <UNK> or children to be sexually exploited so how would a cop react if he saw <UNK> acts performed by adults with children around there would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused thus an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children <UNK> has said he created the fiancé and daughter story thread to give <UNK> character an <UNK> to search i don't think you need that any child abused will make an adult react to save them the irony of course would be that the child cage saves ultimately brings him death br br the dialogue was contrived and campy the whole third act was hilarious the audience i saw it with <UNK> and later <UNK> at the end i just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy <UNK> and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded cage is we don't need that just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child most of us in america have seen law order and other cop <UNK> we come into the movie as if we are <UNK> partner solving a mystery br br so much potential wasted neil <UNK> stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst ridden plays and flicks of that sort stay with your own company of men leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers here is your jar of honey i'll watch that
<START> the first ten minutes of just looking really <UNK> the direction most of this movie takes <UNK> ryan <UNK> is a 14 year old boy living in new york in the <UNK> he has a burning desire to see two people have sex who are the best people he has in mind well his own mom and <UNK> of course how pleasant unfortunately for <UNK> he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his <UNK> wife br br <UNK> next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex however the wife is quite pregnant and they aren't currently sleeping together then <UNK> makes a new friend him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls they have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex the problem is it's not done in an innocent charming 1950's sort of way i am no <UNK> by any means but i found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation <UNK> and <UNK> sex that kind of <UNK> may work in a movie like kids 1995 but in this film it just seems perverted br br gretchen mol is utterly wasted here as hedy a former <UNK> model who becomes the object of <UNK> <UNK> desires jason alexander needs to stay as far away from the director's chair as possible for better or worse 1996 was awful and now this what a waste 1 10
<START> the film maybe goes a little far but if you love the show it's what you expect it's not a bad movie it's actually pretty good if you don't like the show don't see the movie it starts off a little slow maybe but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny there are even a few heart wrenching scenes toward the end after all the protagonists have gone through these <UNK> do get to you also jerry throws in his opinion why his show <UNK> people and <UNK> his show's <UNK> he's got a pretty good point we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv too if they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all we'd eat it up do we not like his guest doing this just because they're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich <UNK> movie stars living in a leave it to <UNK> world
<START> this is a film about life the triumph over <UNK> and the wonders of the human spirit i defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie this is more than just a tear <UNK> its an engaging thought provoking drama with excellent performances from all the cast but especially derek luke and denzel washington 7 years on i'm amazed that luke is still a virtual unknown and washington only directed one other film nevertheless apart from a slow build up the story of this foster child's trials and <UNK> and how it still affects him in <UNK> is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it like many fox <UNK> pictures this was more of a sleeper hit and didn't get the mass critical acclaim it deserves the scene where antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all <UNK> or it could have been unrealistic but washington struck exactly the right tone his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear while <UNK> asked simply why her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything what could she say to defend herself one of the most moving cinematic scenes i have seen
<START> this was god awful the story was all over the place and more often than not i was confused because of horrible editing i felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough they were extremely superficial people with no dimension cheesy cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere the stripper chick was just a distraction even if she was decent looking i don't know what this was attempting to be but how shocked was i when they showed this trash on sundance i almost cancelled my <UNK> you'd think a channel like that would show more quality films there are much much better gay and lesbian themed films out there the celluloid closet is an excellent documentary i thoroughly enjoyed <UNK> the movie i'm sure there are others that have slipped my mind at the moment but what i'm trying to say is that this just wasn't worth it if you catch it on tv ok but otherwise don't bother br br there were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice sad i can count them on one hand otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy as well the lighting was way off in a lot of places i think some of the effects were used to try and add to something that just had practically nothing going for it br br i can't deny johnny rebel is pretty hot without the blond hair of course too bad his acting did nothing for me stick with real porn buddy br br 3 10
<START> it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude <UNK> but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french <UNK> swimming team there are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one <UNK> figure the hunky <UNK> who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused br br pauline <UNK> is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much <UNK> she's kind of odd looking she's not yet out of her adolescent growth <UNK> and has long <UNK> limbs big feet and no <UNK> to speak of she's <UNK> and sports these <UNK> <UNK> lips after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling br br adele <UNK> is older more well more developed physically what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit <UNK> around <UNK> the boys <UNK> her long blond hair but she's not what she seems or is she i couldn't quite figure it out the french are long on <UNK> and short on <UNK> no wonder <UNK> is always <UNK> after her br br there's not so much ambiguity in <UNK> <UNK> character she's on the team too but she's <UNK> and plain and sensitive about it and has an intense crush on <UNK> <UNK> is a good actress and adds to the <UNK> of the character through her performance br br the movie deals with the relationships between these three meaning <UNK> <UNK> hidden feelings and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another this is of course a <UNK> topic it becomes <UNK> during the <UNK> development of a <UNK> relationship between pauline and adele not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on and what little sex there is under the covers sometimes literally br br i don't think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much partly because it's suggestive rather than expressed through action partly because it's complex and partly because i'm not sure i got it all br br let me give an example okay adele is the girl the others envy she's also quite distant and self satisfied on top of that she is apparently <UNK> every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all from the handsome but dumb <UNK> to the bus driver she wants a favor from she <UNK> <UNK> about her expertise in <UNK> when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team adele uses her as a <UNK> during <UNK> with the guys a superior and self indulgent <UNK> you know but then the <UNK> <UNK> slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she's still a virgin really yes really pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally <UNK> that she'd like to rid herself of her <UNK> and she would like pauline to do it for her pauline now drawn sexually to adele performs the task with subdued <UNK> now adele would really like to get it on with a man preferably older and experienced so she takes pauline to a <UNK> where she dances <UNK> with some guy until she follows pauline to the <UNK> room the two girls stand there staring at one another neither having overtly expressed a sexually <UNK> interest in the other but adele stands so close that pauline slowly <UNK> her own <UNK> reaches up and kisses adele on the lips adele steps back smiling and says there now that wasn't so bad was it and then walks back into the club br br that's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele but what the hell is going on initially adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child later like a close friend finally like a potential lover and the minute pauline responds adele walks off satisfied is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in <UNK> <UNK> i don't know br br i've <UNK> louise <UNK> as the third member of the trio the plain and <UNK> <UNK> whose expression always suggests <UNK> but who at least is thoroughly <UNK> and the first of the three to rid herself of that <UNK> virginity but i've only <UNK> her for <UNK> of space br br should you see it by all means just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids for men some of whom have never <UNK> the female <UNK> this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot
<START> i've seen this movie today for the first time and i never heard of it before probably because of it's poor message br br first of all the directing itself is quite good the actors played well and the cgi i'm not a fan of cgi is magnificent but that alone doesn't make a movie no story at all no message behind beautiful exploited talents br br or do i have to make people remember the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story and this is what's missing the whole 7 minutes br br there for a simple 4 rating
<START> sudden impact is a two <UNK> story harry is targeted by the mob who want to kill him and harry is very glad to return the favour and show them how it's done this little war puts harry on suspension which he doesn't care about but he goes away on a little vacation now the second part of the story someone is killing some <UNK> and harry gets dragged into this situation where he meets jennifer spencer a woman with a secret that the little tourist town wants to keep quiet the police chief is not a subtle man and he warns harry to not get involved or cause any trouble this is harry callahan trouble follows him the mob tracks him to this town and hell opens up as harry goes to war meanwhile the vigilante strikes again and the gang having figured it out is ready for her jennifer spencer is caught and harry comes to her rescue during the film's climax sudden impact is not the greatest dirty harry but at the time it gives us a harry that is very much an anti hero ready to go to war just to pursue justice again not the best not the worst but the one with the most remembered line go ahead make your day
<START> i went to see the <UNK> code with a group of other christians <UNK> about 15 people we all expected a good piece of christian film making what we got was an excruciatingly painful drawn out and pretty boring attempt at a film it has good looking production values but also has poor acting a weak script with lousy dialogue and no real sense of direction from the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night we all hated it and some people in our group placed this movie as <UNK> of more cheese than <UNK> none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than 2 hours flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can't save this bad bad movie i'd give it a 3 out of 10 and the rating is only that high because i rented the <UNK> movie werewolf 1996 the night before i saw this movie
<START> it was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including john ritter ben <UNK> and audrey hepburn they looked quite wonderful but that was it they were not given any characters or good lines to work with i neither understood or cared what the characters were doing br br some of the smaller female roles were fine patty <UNK> and <UNK> camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts they showed some talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and better films sadly i didn't think dorothy <UNK> got a chance to act in this her only important film role br br the film appears to have some fans and i was very open minded when i started watching it i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie <UNK> <UNK> and all his early ones from targets to <UNK> so it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this one br br it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and <UNK> get <UNK> involved with each other five years later <UNK> ex girlfriend <UNK> shepherd had a hit television series called <UNK> stealing the story idea from bogdanovich of course there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines br br bottom line it ain't no paper moon and only a very pale version of what's up doc
<START> <UNK> another tired <UNK> <UNK> of an out of <UNK> work never designed to be filmed br br on the plus side toni collette is superb as always being an actual actress you see and there are some nicely handled <UNK> cuts between scenes there are even a few genuinely funny lines and the <UNK> score and editing is competent apart from a bizarre <UNK> into <UNK> and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion br br but ah but much of the cast seems to be on <UNK> and they are almost all very clearly too old and in one case too young for their <UNK> ages worse they are all speaking <UNK> that peculiar <UNK> self satisfied sing song that couldn't be further from the way people actually spoke in <UNK> day think <UNK> sam i kid you not this is particularly sad considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally <UNK> <UNK> that olivier and his <UNK> were so fond of <UNK> at the top of their <UNK> br br and worst of all is gwyneth paltrow she's only ever played one character in her films and she stays true to form here running through her entire range <UNK> to <UNK> in the first ten minutes then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film there is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her <UNK> nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart br br in short there is very little reason to watch emma it's an <UNK> enough adaptation but if you're going to pack a film full of <UNK> i e an <UNK> thin lead who can't shoot a bow or handle a period accent then you might as well do it properly as with the vastly superior clueless
<START> <UNK> grace is left <UNK> after her husbands death so she turns to <UNK> growing in order to pay the bills it sounds promising and the ever reliable brenda <UNK> doesn't disappoint but the material is sitcom thin there's actually a scene where grace asks her young <UNK> to give me one a <UNK> and he thinks she's asking for sex and acts all awkward yes it's humour so <UNK> a nun would be bored saving grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be the stunning cinematography and <UNK> pace evoke memories of <UNK> daughter whilst the light hearted <UNK> of the country <UNK> could be lifted from any episode of <UNK> <UNK> it does speed up after the first hour but by then it's too clichéd to care the climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless <UNK> ex <UNK> i've ever seen
<START> normally i would have given this movie a 6 it <UNK> a very important topic and it does it relatively well despite katie wright which is an accomplishment in and of itself br br i have no idea if she was actually <UNK> to play the character like this or is naturally irritating but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for <UNK> there's no dimension to her other than how confused helpless and clueless she is and how good she is at <UNK> i can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has <UNK> out of control would be <UNK> scared and in pain however <UNK> entire performance is based on <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the rest being whining i couldn't help but feel this particular girl's problem was caused not by the demon that is <UNK> but by her not having a <UNK> i very much doubt that's the point the movie meant to make
<START> having seen <UNK> <UNK> in long way round with ewan <UNK> i was very interested to see how <UNK> would be in his own show i thought <UNK> came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and <UNK> it just show's their human too i don't know a lot about <UNK> but this show <UNK> me right from the start the <UNK> and <UNK> for this event seems immense the event itself seems very dangerous and i'm fascinated to see why <UNK> and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets i love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music i can't believe he broke his collar bone i really hope its not the end i cant wait to see the next episode
<START> saw this movie on its release and have <UNK> it since what a wonderful group of actors i always find the casting one of the most interesting aspects of a film really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress <UNK> <UNK> in this role and wallace shawn is always a hoot the script is smart sly and tongue in cheek <UNK> fun at almost everything <UNK> hills loved paul <UNK> doctor and ray <UNK> <UNK> this was raunchy and crude but thank god unless you're a <UNK> i <UNK> recommend this movie <UNK> for anyone who likes to play six degrees of kevin bacon mary <UNK> paul <UNK> were in rock roll high school mary <UNK> and robert <UNK> were in night of the <UNK> together they were all three in eating <UNK>
<START> think of this pilot as hawaii five o <UNK> it's set in hawaii it's an action adventure crime drama lots of scenes feature <UNK> and palm trees and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> shirts it even stars the character actor <UNK> in a supporting role oh there are some minor differences roy <UNK> is supposed to be some front line undercover agent and the supporting cast is much smaller and less interesting but basically the atmosphere is still the same problem is hawaii five o another <UNK> product already existed at the time and had run for years it filled the market demand for hawaii based crime dramas quite adequately code name diamond head may have been intended as the <UNK> to <UNK> as the older series eventually <UNK> away but it comes across as a superfluous 2nd rate copy it doesn't suck but it's completely derivative and doesn't do anything as well as the original br br there is some decent acting talent involved here <UNK> is an old pro and he gives the role his best shot and he isn't bad but <UNK> is only as good as his material and his director ian <UNK> is in here as an evil spy master named tree and <UNK> tends to be the most interesting actor in any scene he appears in but he's <UNK> his part in here frances <UNK> is reasonably exotic looking but her astounding <UNK> <UNK> features thick accent and wooden delivery aren't the stuff of which dreams are made relying on her to supply the <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> was probably the <UNK> biggest mistake at least for for a series aimed at white audiences brought up with <UNK> brady and peggy lee as our love <UNK> give her another 30 <UNK> and a year with a dialog voice coach and she might cut it <UNK> is well his usual self enjoyable in bit parts but he isn't a person who can carry a feature by himself br br in addition the plot and dialog are strictly by the numbers with nothing to <UNK> them from any other quinn martin production and by this point the american tv audience had seen a <UNK> lot of <UNK> productions i think <UNK> <UNK> was one too many and it <UNK> without a trace it wasn't the really the actors' fault and i hope they walked away from this with a decent paycheck and one more entry on their c v s br br <UNK> <UNK> this for their treatment in their sixth season and they had a lot of good natured fun with it worth seeking out in that version if you enjoy the <UNK> approach to movie <UNK> and lampoon but i can't imagine anyone caring about this pilot for any other reason
<START> this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an <UNK> for awful and good movies it could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue in cheek <UNK> la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up brain dead teenagers and asked them to ad <UNK> the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older <UNK> <UNK> broad on the motorcycle
<START> first of all let me say the i am lds or rather i am a mormon so when i watched this film i automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt i can usually find something redeeming in every movie i watch and this one was no exception it does have its redeeming moments but they are few and far between br br one of the first things i noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though <UNK> was ashamed of our church in the lds church <UNK> are called <UNK> and the basketball court is in the cultural hall never once are either of these two names mentioned the church is never referred to by name and the standards is as far as it goes in mentioning what our church believes br br it makes me wonder if the directors are really lds or lds <UNK> this film had so much potential it could have really shown our church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer but also what we believe instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired if i were not already lds i'd be left thinking <UNK> are stupid idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs br br it is not a film i will recommend to my <UNK> friends br br sorry <UNK> you can do better than this
<START> in <UNK> on this movie i can think of two others to help put it in perspective one relatively forgettable but covering the same <UNK> is coup de <UNK> the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable <UNK> claire denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand <UNK> of <UNK> the complex and <UNK> relationship between france and her colonial subjects br br i was struck with the dignity of <UNK> with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses i was also struck with the love hate relationship between him and <UNK> it is the latter that gives the film its driving force it is the latter that <UNK> this movie to <UNK> br br one never is sure what <UNK> everyone though some of the characters are required of a <UNK> of <UNK> it is this cynical side of the story that ties it to coup de <UNK> theirs is the more <UNK> story perhaps even more interesting in a <UNK> way but denis gives us a <UNK> of how it was with all the tension and <UNK> relationships br br the american black who gives the grown up france a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the western world have when we look at africa he says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother he was coming home but they just thought him to be a little <UNK> france the character and the girl grew up in <UNK> but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was br br
<START> this movie lost me with the <UNK> <UNK> rocket <UNK> <UNK> it was like someone cut and <UNK> a scene from <UNK> i half expected beowulf to say <UNK> i like it br br i watched this because i like chris bruno from the dead zone tv show and he did his part he chose a strange accent but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie unlike any of his <UNK> they kept <UNK> into all kinds of speech from old english to modern english sometimes in the same sentence br br there are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material however even on its own this movie's plot is not good it's just boring which even the low budget doesn't excuse having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story dialog and decent acting those things don't cost much instead they spent their money on half <UNK> cgi and some decent costumes and sets br br life is too short to watch this movie
<START> after <UNK> my thoughts nearly twenty seven times there is a feeling that i can now <UNK> this review for the complex french drama read my lips having written over five hundred reviews i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques <UNK> subtle yet inspirational love story thought was <UNK> over what was loved and hated about this film and while the loves <UNK> it was the elements that were hated that <UNK> further debate within my mind read my lips is a drama to be more precise is a character driven drama which <UNK> social <UNK> with crime <UNK> with the <UNK> of everyday office work here is where this review begins to <UNK> it is all of these items  but it is <UNK> much more as a viewer you are pulled in instantly by <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of this fragile woman named carla whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty <UNK> introduces us <UNK> to her world by <UNK> sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid causing an immediate <UNK> not only from the characters within the film but to those watching without sound the world is left open to any possibility and that is frightening br br as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life we are then <UNK> and given the opportunity to meet paul played <UNK> by vincent <UNK> a <UNK> back hair mustache wearing <UNK> man who was just released from prison homeless <UNK> and forced by his <UNK> officer to get a job this is how carla and paul meet there is that moment of instant unsettling attraction the one where we think she loves him but he is dark and here is where it gets even more fun  and where we think he loves her but she is dark the constant role <UNK> creates the tone of the unknown who as viewers are we to feel the most sympathy for paul sleeps in the office carla helps him carla <UNK> a contract to a rival co worker paul helps her <UNK> ability to read people's lips comes in handy for a make shift idea for paul the <UNK> jumps back and forth keep you on your chair waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave it never does <UNK> cannot just allow this story to take place he continually introduces us to more characters one just as seedy as the next even our rock our solid foundation with the <UNK> officer is in question when his wife goes missing  a subplot to this film that at first <UNK> me but upon further debate was a <UNK> finale for this film yet none of this could have happened if it weren't for our characters <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> look is breathtaking as she changes her image for paul the truth of her beauty is discovered paul the <UNK> in the film continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final <UNK> then just as we assume one carla takes on one last shape br br <UNK> knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters <UNK> and <UNK> could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair the story probably the weakest part of this film is at first random the <UNK> stories seem <UNK> at first but <UNK> lets them connect bit by bit again the entire <UNK> officer segment was <UNK> but that final scene just <UNK> the ends to the means not attempting to sound vague but this complex yet utterly simple story is difficult to explain there is plenty happening but it is up to you to connect the pieces a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held that use of sound and scene was brilliant it was tense it was dramatic and it was like watching a who <UNK> it mystery unfold before your eyes br br overall i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over  i was proved wrong read my lips opens the floor for discussion not just with the characters but the situations one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene and paul in the next when a discovery is made in paul's apartment by carla i found myself deeply angry <UNK> brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development and what he was lacking in plot  the actors were able to carry i can easily suggest this film to anyone but be prepared this isn't a one time viewing film repeat repeat repeat br br grade out of

<START> saw it at <UNK> reel loud festival and was shocked that it won the golden reel award i wasn't the only one considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece i thought there were many other better flicks out there but then i learned that the judges were heavily <UNK> within the area of film theory and other artsy crap while the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece seems as though serious student films need to include one of these categories sex <UNK> struggle and eventual suicide nick and kate cops out and includes all three please be more original br br oh and it might be my <UNK> opinion but the guy from <UNK> sounds a little fake does anyone else thing so
<START> all of you who <UNK> looking at the <UNK> and weaknesses of disney <UNK> last productions here comes something that should <UNK> your wounds once and for all a bug's life brings the proof that purely <UNK> pictures <UNK> a good scenario provides more interest than fake hand made old <UNK> like drawings see the lion king <UNK> and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that <UNK> magical background and atmosphere are gone forever br br a bug's life <UNK> <UNK> for my fellow french <UNK> succeeds in avoiding all the <UNK> that make you <UNK> in the middle of the movie and say hey this thing is computer generated no weak parts a tremendous effort showing its <UNK> in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets an astonishing 3d bird close to perfection in its imitation of reality and that's only to mention the technical aspects br br the scenario my friends the real <UNK> of a motion picture has some <UNK> curiously and obviously thanks to <UNK> team there is practically no musical sequence in a bug's life which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate but most others dislike same thing for the parents or the anime fans like me this movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring steve martin and chevy chase the 3 <UNK> it had basically the same background story a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires <UNK> who finally turn to be actors to protect them etc simple but efficient and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects br br since <UNK> many movies tell tales of insects their lives fears and hopes but i do think that a bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all the <UNK> process has been perfectly well achieved and the whole audience was captivated by <UNK> aka <UNK> in france adventures br br a big thank you for <UNK> team especially for the last 30 seconds it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs actors forget their lines or hit the camera br br and finally especially for those of you who have seen the french version other <UNK> go to the dubbing actors who made a great <UNK> work on this movie a bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment and i think it will soon become part of my collection of videos a <UNK> granted to extremely few movies and that's not a problem of <UNK> room go and see it that's an order
<START> first this deserves about 5 stars due to acting some which would give me a better <UNK> opinion and not an objective one as it should by giving this one well deserved star but then i know that those facts are used for the actor s names to increase the rating of something like this br br i do have a problem with such productions yet another attempt just like <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> feature promoting government <UNK> on your rights how interesting that it comes at a moment when <UNK> <UNK> trying to <UNK> <UNK> information and the americans and <UNK> are fighting against that at this very moments this time is not by <UNK> <UNK> file <UNK> as evil that one was intended to remind you of such feeling whenever you transfer data on the net but by literally attempting in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole seems like fear promotion is hollywood's norm this days especially when coming to thrillers which is the most on demand motion picture genre for past 2 decades or so most viewed best way to try influence the society as a whole such levels of violence are depicted in this 2 features of morally and <UNK> people that it gives a new much needed meaning to anti heroes figures make no mistake this is not <UNK> which was meant to be high quality entertainment stop selling fear please the world would be a better place without it and the dollars made of it br br the opening scene and generally the first 10 minutes really give a <UNK> picture of an <UNK> <UNK> that is <UNK> suffering of sexual frustration the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racist for sure a cliche at least in real life someone would probably get a beating for it you will see what i mean the second scene with claire <UNK> character present is even more extreme at that point i realized in my opinion that <UNK> <UNK> is a very dangerous individual to people around him how many people that have seen or will see this movie have never been hold down regarding both <UNK> out of self common <UNK> typically the movie gives an extreme criminal case that unfortunately did is and will likely happen again sometime somewhere but fingers everyone else <UNK> as well as you could become that etc anyone that is familiar with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone <UNK> by such <UNK> hero here safe sex in its many forms is healthy and not some evil that apparently richard gere character is obsessed with on his way for some sexual <UNK> have we not learned anything from the <UNK> recent <UNK> involving priests and young boys or for how long an american teenager can see extreme violence on pg 13 but he can not even see a woman breast until r 18 yet the industry targets them with this very same sexual <UNK> like american pie series for example raise the kids <UNK> one levels but <UNK> them and drive them underground in developing <UNK> to <UNK> extremes all sexual activities upon mutual acceptance <UNK> individuals better then some <UNK> nut case that blames his <UNK> and shortcomings on the lives of others a new german movie that would work great in comparing this 2 distinct and world apart features on the very same subject here like in that movie you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been br br i am very disappointed with richard gere especially after the recent hunting party a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic hero after real facts as well but then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone's political and social agenda the flock and <UNK> 2 heads of the same hidden beast it just reminds you if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a whole as <UNK> <UNK> has those here to stay clear of them for their own safety they would kill my family faster then any 0 <UNK> chances of paul <UNK> in anyone's life would br br in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about my <UNK> of this particular movie and <UNK> actually so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did nothing <UNK> then a <UNK> movie shooting itself in the foot for once i agree with the rating this is not a feature for teenagers or kids simply because at best would confuse them even more then the common belief of money fame fashion and how that relates to sexuality scream series and movies as such at least have a defined entertainment value even if a dumb one in my opinion but this one is just another trust me i know what is good for you deeply not so well done i might add <UNK> messages
<START> hollow man is one of the better horror films of the past decade the sub plot is original and the main plot is even better the special effects are brilliant and possibly the best i have ever seen in a horror film kevin bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way br br claude <UNK> shocked the world with the invisible man in 1933 well now kevin bacon has shocked us with hollow man one of the most thrilling horror films ever the action is intense and the chills are true you may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a <UNK> night the supporting cast includes elizabeth <UNK> josh <UNK> kim dickens joey <UNK> greg <UNK> and mary <UNK> all of whom do an exceptional job br br spoilers br br dr sebastian caine kevin bacon and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible after animal <UNK> they move on to human testing but someone has to be the subject <UNK> caine is turned invisible but when his team is unable to bring back into <UNK> caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge end spoilers br br the film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century becoming the basis for a spoof joke in scary movie 2 this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go the first 45 minutes or so are slow developing the characters and showing how their experiments work the second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans think of deep blue sea then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man and then change the water into fire and explosions a <UNK> of a killer shark movie interesting hollow man gets 5 5
<START> ain't it hilarious when an average <UNK> leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way that formula never gets old does it it's such a sure fire way to make a classic film just look at major hits like liar liar and big this must have been rob <UNK> line of thinking when he made semi successful <UNK> <UNK> male <UNK> and followed it with the animal since i've already <UNK> the plot through sarcasm allow me to color it in more schneider plays a loser cop who's suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery by a <UNK> <UNK> who loads him up with animal parts causing him to <UNK> like a horse at inappropriate times run like a <UNK> etc this movie is slightly more likable than other schneider starring flicks such as another lame same plot follow up the hot chick but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality tv star as the romantic lead <UNK> <UNK> from survivor and <UNK> a cameo by norm macdonald my favorite scene just does not exist sorry nothing <UNK> good except the production value i just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way you can do it there's a word for that <UNK> actually here's another word cheap
<START> three tales are told in this film that seemed to have been shot without knowledge of this being a combined <UNK> film the makers relate the three vignettes by having them all connected to shrink martin <UNK> although you never see some of the leads with <UNK> br br the first <UNK> has sexy vivian <UNK> a woman afraid of everything under the sun she makes adrian monk look brave having a paranoia laced evening at home alone you will literally scream at vivian for doing some ridiculous things she spends the majority of her time in a <UNK> which shows off her amazing features but her film is the worst if not the most nail biting br br the second <UNK> is owned by bill paxton as he portrays the roommate from hell his geeky roommate allows him to take complete advantage of him and bill does so whenever he can br br the last <UNK> was funny as a man fears that death will take him at any moment much like his pal who <UNK> to death on an <UNK> br br not very interesting as the movie as a whole seems chopped together with very little thought involved a must for bill paxton fans
<START> the year is 1964 <UNK> che guevara having been a cuban citizen for the last five years disappears from the face of the earth leaving a <UNK> <UNK> castro to <UNK> that he is probably dead when in truth he has left cuba to move to bolivia to live an assumed identity whilst living in la paz guevara <UNK> an idea to <UNK> the corrupt <UNK> government there once again steven <UNK> takes up where <UNK> part <UNK> leaves off only better this time the pacing is more on target the job of acting is ever so fine including a turn by a <UNK> looking <UNK> del toro as che guevara suffice it to say it's probably best if you see both films to get the true story of guevara what kind of a man he was i had the rare open window of opportunity to see both films at one screening talk about a long <UNK> as with <UNK> part 1 the <UNK> this film has no mpaa rating but contains enough <UNK> language violence to easily <UNK> it an <UNK>
<START> and i thought the beach was bad with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time nicolas cage don't blame him for the awful script if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie give your self a pat on the back its a cross between the village and a <UNK> script its starts off kinda catching your eye and then as it goes further into the plot it just makes no sense and don't get me started about the ending what was that the only thing that makes this movie exist is nicolas cage usual great humor and his ability to be funny in the <UNK> situations if you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why just say the stupidest thing that comes into your mind and there you go
<START> allow me to start this review by saying this i love vampire movies they can suck <UNK> <UNK> pun intended and i'll still love them because vampires are just cool in movies van <UNK> considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap was enjoyable to me because of the fact that there were vampires you may ask what does that have to do with this movie the answer is that i intend to inform you of how horrible this movie truly is that even a sucker <UNK> for vampire movies like me can despise a movie like this so much br br the movie stars van <UNK> a college professor guy who isn't at all convincing he's a terrible actor like everyone else in this movie and he wrote it to add salt to the wound i honestly to not mean to offend him and i'm sure everyone had fun making this movie but watching it was actually painful i'm not sure why i watched the whole thing perhaps it was a morbid fascination like watching an impending train crash it's horrible but you can't manage to force yourself to look away its main fault is that it's just so ing boring and its plot is so damn ridiculous even for a science fiction horror movie br br but i <UNK> by the way van <UNK> has sex with his mom of course he doesn't know it's her at the time he just thinks it's one of his students which is still illegal and all but not as disgusting and creepy br br if i were van <UNK> i would at least pull an <UNK> myself when i found out i had done something so gross it would've made for one entertaining thing if he just made some comment on it but no the point isn't even brought up at all by any of the characters it's as if the writer didn't even think of it i would've at least had another character laugh at him and say ha ha you had sex with your mom which would be mildly humorous although blatantly immature i'm probably running out of room so a few more words to <UNK> you from ever seeing this film there's a vampire ninja fight with an old man it would be funny but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously it's not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is stay far far away from it if you value your time at all br br i will say one thing positive about the movie the guy who plays van <UNK> is pretty slick with that knife of his there's like a minute long segment where he <UNK> around his knife and actually does some pretty nifty tricks it would be boring in any other movie but here sadly it was the highlight
<START> my guess is that this director writer had something to say let's see what it could have been a frog <UNK> would be creepy b can i get someone like tom cruise to say the c word many times and look like a bad patrick <UNK> c cast my wife and get her to say the f word every 2 seconds this aside i really liked the beginning and the frog storm the rest was a relentless over long under edited over indulgent failure glad so many of you enjoyed it br br
<START> this movie captures the essence of growing up in <UNK> america for a young girl on her own the realism and subtle nuances offered to ashley <UNK> character ruby by the storyline capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the <UNK> of florida from the slam of a screen door to the lack of work the echoes of what life is really like on the red neck <UNK> provide rough choices for the young girl paradise did not come easy but she slowly <UNK> obstacles and <UNK> and learns to be her own woman with a strength that flows from within ashley <UNK> winning smile and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> warmth and command respect and admiration the careful pace of the character development resembles that of <UNK> gold in 1997 starring peter fonda and also directed by victor <UNK>
<START> this movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the coppola family it doesn't seem to know whether to be an a or a b western i mean the hero is called <UNK> cassidy for god's sake william <UNK> must be spinning in his grave br br all the b western cliches are here the two gun <UNK> <UNK> hero in the white hat with the <UNK> <UNK> c'mon thunder the all in black <UNK> villain the heroine in distress the <UNK> in trouble the cowardly sheriff over the top bad guys etc br br the acting with few exceptions is strictly from the <UNK> <UNK> school of acting chris <UNK> who as the hero and louis <UNK> who as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30's poverty row <UNK> the addition to the cast of veteran performers martin sheen robert carradine <UNK> <UNK> and will <UNK> helps a little but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one br br what was the point of the martin sheen robert carradine framing sequences are we to believe that the sheen character was a ghost what was the purpose of the black <UNK> it just didn't make sense br br being a great lover of westerns from all genres i tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film the cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic aside from the hero and main villain the other characters looked authentic br br if the producers were going to <UNK> the <UNK> cassidy character they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written a <UNK> foul mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder the kind of part lee marvin would have <UNK> in br br what else can i say but on thunder on big fellow
<START> this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with <UNK> to war the great american filmmaker and story <UNK> frank <UNK> made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler's rise br br every school child <UNK> every american should watch these films today because they are so <UNK> history has been repeating itself over and over again the lord <UNK> are still alive and kicking the tactics used by the nazis of <UNK> countries through <UNK> and then the <UNK> and now by muslim terrorist groups are still working to these evil <UNK> advantage br br by sitting back and letting hitler as early as <UNK> be aggressive france america and england caused over 50 million people's deaths americans french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let <UNK> break <UNK> br br these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs they don't tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them fighting hitler this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war
<START> it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most however this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham to become the next meg ryan who became annoying as hell in her own right her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was <UNK> compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles this film might have been more as there was suitable budget for settings actors and a decent story line my wife and i both agreed that this was <UNK> at the end as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high better luck next time hope miss graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like from hell
<START> phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the <UNK> of everything rather than actual <UNK> br br at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn't find the jokes or <UNK> funny anymore br br its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually i just lost interest br br i imagine this film would appeal to a <UNK> who is currently <UNK> br br for something similar but better try brother from another planet
<START> or listening to for that matter even the soundtrack is a bore br br honestly this isn't the worst gay movie i've seen that would be regarding billy but it's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel br br this thing drags and drags and drags it's not that the plot is inane in the hands of a good writer it might have worked it certainly could have been much more entertaining there's not one plot point you can't see coming for ten miles down the road the dialog is flat the jokes are old to add insult to injury it's full of one dimensional stereotypical gays br br nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible much less real there was no chemistry no dynamic in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other we're just told they're in love hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren't <UNK> sexually they like the same book huh br br the acting is not totally bad but the pacing is excruciatingly slow i mean almost <UNK> slow but without <UNK> quality in fact that would be a good <UNK> for you if you like <UNK> films avoid this one
<START> says andy nobody gets hurt everybody wins before he says it we know the opposite is true everybody gets hurt nobody wins this is a new <UNK> in american movies or perhaps an old <UNK> brought back at long last think eastern promises there will be blood no country for old men these movies are dark serious extremely well made and don't care about happy endings i love them before the devil knows you're dead fits the general description but creates an atmosphere all its own kelly <UNK> debut script is as close as a hollywood movie will ever get to a greek tragedy paying tribute to fellow veteran director stanley <UNK> sidney lumet expertly and <UNK> turns the <UNK> story into an outstanding old school character drama the opening shots although of an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> wife have the look and feel of a dutch <UNK> painting by contrast the drug <UNK> <UNK> looks more like a string of <UNK> great performances all around only albert <UNK> character charles feels a little over acted eyes wide and mouth <UNK> almost all the time but then he is in trouble deep deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know for <UNK> marisa tomei is super hot but of course you don't need me to tell you that why her character gina would want to be with a guy like andy we're never told but that's okay action is character after all the unique and magic touch of carter <UNK> music makes this fine movie a masterpiece don't miss it
<START> this movie is truly boring it was banned in chinese cinema and i can see why it's not because it's critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality i would never want to pay money to watch this i love movies from <UNK> <UNK> and zhang <UNK> and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of china it totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself the shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there's plenty of them the cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad i looked this film up on the net and it seems like people actually like this film the only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in english it is automatically good i can't see any reason why people would like this this is not an art film it's of waste of celluloid that's if they actually shot it on film which they didn't
<START> possible spoilers br br i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it it reminds me of me at 20 except this is even better like <UNK> says two chicks at one time it brings out the <UNK> in me the casual conversation these two real life chicks rather than <UNK> <UNK> us every step of the way i get into the conversations too even if they are utterly b s at times so what every chick just about that i've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same <UNK> rambling gratuitous self centered b s philosophy it's just a bunch of nonsense and about as sensible as that other b s philosophy chicks are often into <UNK> <UNK> the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women he's into the same b s and <UNK> the brunette chick is actually the most <UNK> person there br br i think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by <UNK> she'd love to pull the little blonde away from alexander but <UNK> plays her all the way she's brilliant she gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them and then she steals the boy child man which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group the brunette knows she's been had by the end when she's dropping her face into the <UNK> of her hands while marlene <UNK> sings in the background that <UNK> there are a million couples in paris tonight but i only have this <UNK> br br but do they get married in the end alex and <UNK> <UNK> i can only imagine a super <UNK> relationship ending in a pre marriage <UNK> they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones br br i like the film though it kept me entertained it's got a nice look and it's sexy
<START> i went to see this one with much expectation quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest even a child can see the missing logic to character's <UNK> today's kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them <UNK> about the events that's precisely what happened with movies like e t and star wars a decade ago how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and <UNK> their own <UNK> seriously don't waste your time money on this one
<START> the fact that this film was put out on dvd still <UNK> to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film <UNK> and rightly so this deserves a lot better treatment br br the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft the rules of the day and winds up with a little girl instead not the conventional way and the problems that ensue afterward the old man had bought the kid at a slave <UNK> and soon discovers the kid is not a boy which he obviously thought was the case br br the old man <UNK> wang <UNK> <UNK> is kind of funny looking with a missing front tooth and an <UNK> grin the little girl <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> the rest of the story is how the two manage after that i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes br br overall it's involving story complete with drama suspense humor and sadness just don't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd until it comes out on widescreen rent it
<START> massacre is a film directed by <UNK> <UNK> burial ground and produced by legendary italian horror director lucio fulci now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest this could not be further from that massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films i have seen come out of italian cinema i was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and i have never had that problem with italian horror films br br massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an <UNK> this scene was used in <UNK> nightmare concert this isn't a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an <UNK> wielding slaughter <UNK> the next hour of the movie is so boring the movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to <UNK> away the last 30 minutes of the movie aren't so bad but still could have been much better the gore in the movie was pathetic and since fulci used most of the gore scenes in nightmare concert there was nothing new here the end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor br br this wasn't a very good film but for a true italian horror freak like myself this movie is a must have since it is very rare 4 10 stars
<START> the first time i saw this movie i fell in love with it the atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost i expected a gore fest but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack it's actually my <UNK> at the moment p the fact that i couldn't predict when he'd kill and when he'd disappear was a major plus in my book predictable horror movies bore me now i know the storyline had some <UNK> but if you're like me you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're laying in bed <UNK> over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion finally as i mentioned the soundtrack is timeless it's one of my all time favorite theatrical scores so i was very happy to hear that rob zombie is leaving it <UNK> in his remake speaking of the remake i read a very <UNK> article on it and now that i know that mr zombie <UNK> john carpenter i have high hopes for his take on this classic this movie is great for any time you have a <UNK> for a spine <UNK> but it's the perfect addition opener finale you name it for an all <UNK> eve movie marathon
<START> not since the simpsons made it's debut has there been a sitcom that i didn't want to turn of in a matter of 2 minutes it has of course been said that the simpsons killed the sitcom not this one though br br the first season was so so as the teenage characters were not quite as outrageous as they later became they even went to school sometimes the following seasons the character where <UNK> out eric the sarcastic <UNK> donna his <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> the dim <UNK> hyde the conspiracy <UNK> and anti establishment punk <UNK> the <UNK> exchange student and finally jackie the spoiled rich <UNK> as for the adult characters there was <UNK> mom the can you believe she is so <UNK> suburban mom <UNK> dad the straight arrow who of course wasn't such a hard ass as he seemed <UNK> goofy dad and her dumb blonde mom everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to <UNK> smith who finds the perfect balance between <UNK> and still makes his red <UNK> quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected <UNK> br br <UNK> grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good it's a tough character to play because it doesn't allow the actor to <UNK> in wild overacting like the <UNK> character played competently by <UNK> <UNK> i enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different br br <UNK> character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the <UNK> time although i will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons br br jackie played by family guy voice artist <UNK> <UNK> is hilarious and she has a nails on a <UNK> type voice which actually fits her character the only sad part is that we didn't see more scenes with her and eric because they were f hilarious together too much story was wasted on her relationship problems since we already got that in <UNK> with eric and donna br br last i will say that the casting of guest actors were always great a few favorites <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend in the mid seasons <UNK> dan the totally awesome leo played by the equally awesome thomas chong another one of <UNK> girlfriends who is totally <UNK> and a special appearance by the teenage witch sabrina as a <UNK> catholic girl br br coming up next on fox whatever
<START> this movie kept me constantly entertained in comparing this to serial mom mr waters has gone back to his <UNK> side this is not nearly as polished br br there is a dark side here a message about how success and fame changes a person but more importantly how it changes the people around you br br there is not a false moment in this film br br the characters are somewhat cartoonish but i want to believe that is what mr waters is trying to achieve br br it is fascinating to watch how mr waters has evolved this is truly his finest work
<START> another reason to watch this delightful movie is <UNK> rice <UNK> who that was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen i soon found out who <UNK> rice was a real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance as they all do in this gripping ensemble piece from 1939 its a different time but <UNK> lies the charm it <UNK> you into another world it starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious <UNK> rice runs the gamut from <UNK> to heroine she is absolutely delightful at the same time strong vulnerable <UNK> from a girl to a woman watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie she made over forty movies and i am going to seek out the other thirty nine alan <UNK> is of the flynn gable mode and proves a perfect match for <UNK> buddy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> provide some excellent comic moments but the real star is <UNK> rice fans of 30's 40's movies don't miss this one
<START> i saw <UNK> york i love <UNK> today and loved it i was really looking forward to seeing this after watching <UNK> je <UNK> and overall i think i liked this one much better perhaps i need to watch <UNK> je <UNK> again i don't know i read few of the reviews here about ny <UNK> and yes the movie is not without its faults when you're paying tribute to a city like new york it can get rather overwhelming and nothing seems fair enough to do the city due justice so without <UNK> on any of the film's shortcomings i'll just write about what i liked br br unlike <UNK> je <UNK> in which each director's short film was properly <UNK> and titled ny <UNK> isn't and many reviewers over here have found the <UNK> of stories and <UNK> of characters here annoying and even confusing i thought otherwise i loved how the stories just <UNK> one after the other and i especially liked the <UNK> of characters it might be <UNK> because it's done so often in films now but i still liked it because i didn't find it forced and the idea that we're all connected in the end has a <UNK> even whimsical quality to it which some might find corny but i find beautiful br br i liked all the films but the one that touched me the most was the one by <UNK> <UNK> with robin wright penn and chris cooper it was so well acted and scripted that the reveal in the end again not <UNK> in the past brought me to tears and i was crying throughout the segment that followed i always liked wright penn and now i'm also a fan of chris cooper those precious initial few seconds when he's standing alone outside the restaurant just before he gets the call speak volumes about <UNK> ability to convey a character by just being there without saying anything br br most of the stories in this film involve characters who are either meeting each for the first time or have met each other just recently with the exception of 4 5 stories in which the characters have known each other for a long time it seemed to me and i might be wrong that the stories were different but they were all trying to drive home the point the need even to just step back and view in a new light the people and the things we've known in our lives for a long time to see the people and the things around you with the eyes of a stranger and appreciate them just as you did when you met them and saw them for the first time br br the other films that i liked were the ones by <UNK> <UNK> with orlando bloom and christina <UNK> by natalie portman with carlos <UNK> and taylor <UNK> by brett <UNK> with anton <UNK> and olivia <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> with julie christie <UNK> <UNK> and john hurt and once again the one by <UNK> <UNK> with ethan hawke and <UNK> <UNK> when they're in the <UNK> i really need to see more work by <UNK> <UNK> as i seem to like him a lot br br overall watch this movie with an open mind don't read the reviews before watching it it might not live up to your expectations of what a movie on and about love in new york should be and i doubt any movie will really live up to that conception just watch this movie for some good music beautiful landscape cinematography some slice of life comfort and a story or two that might just <UNK> at your <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a <UNK> of fast furious without any of the redeeming qualities it doesn't need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises but it needs something this is the equivalent of a porn film where the storyline and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end except that this is worse because you don't get your <UNK> worth mind numbingly boring impossible race sequences and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars which almost <UNK> negative points for having appeared in this movie sure she's hot but who's that desperate for an on screen female i feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets and <UNK> an 8 ball every time they switched scenes no serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes
<START> house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels it is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller it is blessed with marvelous performances by lindsay <UNK> and joe <UNK> and a strong strong cast of supporting players and it introduces ricky jay card sharp <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of magic its dialogue written by david mamet is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie in which reality is often in question an extra dimension of <UNK> br br on the face of it house of games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of <UNK> and con men <UNK> different from the <UNK> which was played merely for <UNK> and <UNK> at this level it does succeed admirably br br however you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from <UNK> professional <UNK> to incredible strength and self realization the only movie i know of which treats the theme of <UNK> of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated private benjamin that thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately <UNK> its focus <UNK> among several themes and <UNK> the fine performance of goldie hawn to chase after some easy laughs house of games sticks to its business as poe once said of a good short story it drives relentlessly to its conclusion br br there is another strain of movies about women <UNK> by thelma and louise a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed whether or not they realize their inner strengths what tripe br br as usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater it should be a natural for film festivals <UNK> it for one near you if you get the chance br br i bought the original version of house of games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter better she should see it on a tv than not at all
<START> i cannot believe the same guy directed this crap and dracula 2000 dracula 2000 was innovative fresh and well written if poorly acted br br this pile can't even claim that it starts with the defeat of dracula at the end of dracula 2000 then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow but craven chose to go in the style of his older films having no good tie but the main <UNK> name br br even the actor playing dracula was different going from dark hair in dracula 2000 to a blonde here br br avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies
<START> overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come although the plot is not 100 accurate to the book most everything is correct the movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts i found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie because i hadn't found out about the movie yet but later i found the movie in a bargain bin at wal mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what i had expected overall i give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts relative accuracy and overall making sense and for its bad parts large time <UNK> and small but noticeable inaccuracies
<START> to review this movie i without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in <UNK> pulp fiction 1994 when jules and vincent are talking about <UNK> wallace and what she does for a living jules tells vincent that the only thing she did worthwhile was pilot vincent asks what the hell is a pilot and jules goes into a very well description of what a tv pilot is well the way they make shows is they make one show that show's called a <UNK> then they show that show to the people who make shows and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows some pilots get picked and become television programs some don't become nothing she starred in one of the ones that became nothing now to stretch on what jules was talking about there are <UNK> of television shows pilots that were never aired because they simply were not well good probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is w a l t e r a spin off to m a s h with gary radar <UNK> as the lead hmmm would somebody really want to be watching radar for a half hour trying to solve crimes hence the show was never picked up what many people don't know or what they thought they knew is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide some have made they're way past and got onto the air the pilot for the animated series american dad comes to mind as the show's serial itself didn't begin until nearly four months later however there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air and this here is why br br black bart a supposed tie in with the mel brooks comedy classic blazing <UNK> is a stale and bland sitcom with little heart and no soul <UNK> was a controversial comedy nevertheless with it's racist humor and vulgar comedy which comes to mind what idiot decided this would make a great television show for prime time tv i say supposed because none of the memorable characters from the movie aside from bart on in this mess of a tv show mel brooks wasn't even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line in a related story i recently found out about an <UNK> tv pilot for a series based on the movie <UNK> that kevin smith was no involved in you see what happens br br set somewhere around the same time as the movie or at all the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west named appropriately <UNK> bart who is this time played by future academy award winner louis <UNK> jr obviously before his <UNK> in real acting whereas in this he is playing a g rated richard <UNK> most of the other characters are <UNK> if not really bad copies of the characters in the movie jim the <UNK> kid is replaced by a similar looking character named <UNK> jordan a former <UNK> soldier who is quick with the gun <UNK> von <UNK> is now belle <UNK> a more of a ripoff of the character being that she's a show dancer and a german with a marlene <UNK> type accent and personality while that's pretty much the end in similarities the lead bad guy in the story is <UNK> <UNK> played by noble <UNK> who i assumed would've been <UNK> <UNK> if warner bros <UNK> the rights to the name see trivia for blazing <UNK> and his son <UNK> i <UNK> <UNK> i suppose the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom much less a pilot bart deals with the <UNK> drunk son and he's out of control behavior which has caused the town to spin really it's a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the series and doesn't focus on the variety and context that would make this an alright show i can't really call it a sitcom and even if i wanted to and that's primarily the fact it was shot on the <UNK> at warner bros studios and later added a laugh track so the show is set up almost exactly like m a s h complete with a bland and dull laughing that is identical to the series the acting is so so but there's one part that always make me laugh and that's when the actor playing <UNK> jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to <UNK> out a piece of dialogue ha the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie surprisingly they use the word n er numerous amount of times through a 22 minute episode rather <UNK> for it's time period and even for today and it gets repetitive br br if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of <UNK> <UNK> interesting novelty item watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots it's on the <UNK> edition of blazing <UNK> god knows why there yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie in pilots never air
<START> coming of age movies are quite usual these days for 1980 <UNK> really gives its meaning jodie foster plays her character straight out ever since she did taxi driver four years earlier she has a stronger character in this movie she's <UNK> a high <UNK> who has plenty of guts and seems to get out of any situation she's in scott <UNK> plays brad way before <UNK> on happy days he's deemed immature by the other girls <UNK> <UNK> is annie hangs with the wrong crowd chased by her policeman father <UNK> and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous annie is rescued by <UNK> and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted reality comes back hard where she is killed in a <UNK> accident and one gets married to a much older man growing up isn't easy sometimes we got to explore life how it is in reality you got to be careful about the people surrounding you for me i was my own person and i tend to stay that way great music great plot this movie's a gem 4 out of 5 stars
<START> i guess if a film has magic i don't need it to be fluid or <UNK> it can skip background information go too fast in some places too slow in others etc magic in this film the scene in the library there are many minor flaws in stanley <UNK> yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible the hardest to fix both characters are smart yet stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood <UNK> although well educated hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the u turn her life took in both their faults and strengths the characters compliment each other it may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an <UNK> would wind up working year after year in a factory or that a stanley never <UNK> his <UNK> enough to work in construction or some other better paying job and while these mysteries are explained in the course of the story their unfolding seems somewhat contrived i assume no one took the time to <UNK> the script even so it's a good <UNK> imagine what de niro fonda and <UNK> would have done on screen if someone had
<START> in the u s very few films have been made about rome that were not set in the time of <UNK> <UNK> or shortly thereafter hollywood's sword and <UNK> epics mostly have a christian theme which makes it difficult to get into earlier roman history <UNK> was probably the first exception to this rule and encountered some resistance in hollywood because it did not have jesus in it br br it's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of <UNK> and christ but is set when rome was only one city among many on the italian <UNK> and had just <UNK> the hated king <UNK> and formed the republic br br however this is not a historical film it's <UNK> and while the production values aren't rock bottom the acting and characterizations are cardboard i can only imagine what the dialogue was like in italian but with wooden english dubbing it's very campy i got a few good laughs out of it at first br br i haven't seen many films of this genre having missed most of the <UNK> movies of the 60s it's amusing up to a point but as the film goes on it gets somewhat boring br br one <UNK> for sure if i'd seen this movie when i was ten years old i would have loved it at that age i went for anything with <UNK> and <UNK> in it so at least this flick brought back some childhood memories
<START> man i loved this movie this really takes me back to when i was a kid these were the days when the teachers still showed <UNK> films on reel to real and if you were good they would <UNK> the movie slowly so you could watch it play <UNK> i still remember one of the opening lines <UNK> was his name and he was an orphan he lived with his sister so and so in the village this is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon at the end the other indian boys in the village <UNK> the <UNK> to <UNK> and he becomes an eagle himself he gets to live the way he always wanted to he gets to <UNK> the heavens
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is indeed <UNK> terrible of french cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public filmed with his <UNK> duo depardieu and <UNK> and the usual dose of sex <UNK> <UNK> plays her typical role at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best french actress ever in first les <UNK> is also one of the first <UNK> as the viewer is just taken to some <UNK> of two little criminals those who only are satisfied with family life or simply know nothing more the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that it just let you think of all the usual things in life working for the car being <UNK> at work etc it's a sort of critic towards the <UNK> society we're living in great job and it just makes you wish two things <UNK> died just too young as he was a <UNK> and of course depardieu he'd better should have stuck with french movies as he proves here that no one can beat him timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some
<START> a woman sylvia <UNK> <UNK> a 15 year old boy eric brown they have sex but it's all tied into some stupid plot or something br br easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever does anyone realize this movie is making light of child <UNK> i suppose it's ok cause it's a teenage boy if we had one with a man <UNK> a teenage girl there would rightfully be outrage sorry but having it done to a boy doesn't excuse it it's still sick i realize brown was of age he was actually 18 when this was made but he looks 15 i just find it disturbing that some people find this ok br br plot aside the acting sucks <UNK> is beautiful but can't act brown is easily one of the worst child actors i've ever seen and the constant nudity gets boring and isn't even remotely erotic br br i saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981 i was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin who could easily pass for 18 he wanted to see it i didn't but i decided what the heck we got in and i actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously <UNK> my cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through let me make this clear three teenage boys left a movie with tons of female nudity that should give you an idea of how bad this is i'm surprised this was ever released a 1 all the way
<START> i normally only write reviews for movies i really hated or really liked and as you can probably tell from the number of stars up there i didn't like it by now i assume you have read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie so i'll skip the summary let's break this down pros and cons br br cons the concept the premise was set up to be interesting using chaos theory as a theme was interesting however it wasn't carried out so well correct me if i'm wrong but it seems to me that chaos theory was kind of <UNK> the event that occurred in the movie seemed more like contrived coincidence than anything i guess the <UNK> effect was represented by the whole god s causes <UNK> to bring back statue the presentation comes off as really sloppy though some people call this intelligent but it just seems to be another <UNK> up action film br br storyline is it just me or does it seem that kamal just threw this together to give him an excuse to play ten roles the plot is extremely contrived <UNK> kept losing the <UNK> so many times in obscure <UNK> his friend just happens to mix up the <UNK> with a package he was sending to india a crazy old lady just happens to throw the <UNK> into an idol half the cast just happens to unexpectedly meet up in the same hospital and the case with the idol just happened to get mixed up with one that <UNK> to a famous singer br br cgi oh god the cgi it was even worse than the special effects in jaws 3 and those sucked right away i could tell which parts were animated even my ten year old cousin knows that underwater cars don't look like that br br stunts yes i now that action scenes in <UNK> movies aren't realistic but the stunts in this one were horrid and actually distracted me from the story br br make up i have to admit they did a better job than expected i thought kamal would be playing people with similar skin tones so the two fake white guys and the fake japanese <UNK> guy caught me off guard however it was still pretty bad i could easily tell which ones were wearing masks br br the songs the music was distracting and out of place in many instances br br <UNK> her character was possibly the most annoying one in the movie she was loud <UNK> and obsessed <UNK> about that idol i actually found myself wishing she would die br br plot holes and <UNK> logic let me get this straight a lab monkey was smart enough to get past a <UNK> locked door but not intelligent enough to tell the difference between a bar of chocolate and a <UNK> with a deadly virus in it and then an ex cia agent who's after the <UNK> figures out it's headed for india instead of immediately following it he marries a pole dancer first a famous <UNK> singer with cancer <UNK> into a small town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available furthermore he gets shot in the throat with a bullet you'd think he would be killed but instead the magic bullet has <UNK> his <UNK> you read that right a bullet knocked out the <UNK> br br pros the <UNK> character possibly the only likable part of the movie was his comedy
<START> we so often talk of cinema <UNK> kane the godfather a bout de <UNK> one film however is too often overlooked by serious film critics i am talking of course about the classic doc savage m o b br br this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us <UNK> not to mention kung fu br br it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history until of course <UNK> breathtaking work on flash gordon although a bit of a <UNK> this film is well worth seeking out it will <UNK> the effort of your search ten <UNK>
<START> hines and <UNK> the <UNK> of this crime begin on the wrong foot first step by assuming that wells wrote gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously that simply isn't true wells was very much an <UNK> of the enlightenment and his main concern was that victorian self satisfaction might leave the british <UNK> for the world the new technology could produce both the good and the bad br br two terrible consequences follow the protagonist is portrayed as a <UNK> <UNK> i was reminded of fay <UNK> in the original king kong rather than a man struggling to live out the <UNK> of an unbelievable catastrophe and the dialog <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> seriously that welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek br br all of this looks <UNK> like ed wood with an enormous budget to waste on cgi effects which by the way are so poorly accomplished the warner bros cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job <UNK> of <UNK> blood looked like red <UNK> i expected them to <UNK> away any minute think the yellow submarine as done by the old <UNK> comics br br worse yet is the loss of theme which <UNK> the film of any reason to exist although the makers of this film return the story to its victorian era they utterly miss the uncanny way <UNK> story predicted many of the horrors of the first world war a fact not <UNK> by wells himself who after the war <UNK> the theme in the shape of things to come br br without any theme all we have here are a lot of people running around getting <UNK> into cartoon <UNK> when they're not trying out for a high school production of a drunken <UNK> rewrite of <UNK> br br really this is the worst most senseless piece of drivel i have suffered through since a friend talked me into seeing the eastern european cartoon fantastic planet thirty years ago that film was so <UNK> dull my friend and i and two total strangers gave up <UNK> it about half way through and sat near the screen playing cards using the movie as light by which to see the cards its only <UNK> as far as any of us could tell br br but i already have electric lighting in my apartment so i didn't need this put down of wells for anything br br do not avoid this film steal every copy you can don't pay a <UNK> and burn each and every one of them god in his wisdom created us just for this purpose
<START> i cannot believe how <UNK> this movie is it's like watching police academy except it's with people that have no clue of what they are talking about and wait there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick i can understand suspension of disbelief but this is just complete stupidity not only is there no plot to this movie it's like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor throw non medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility plus the people are wearing clothes that are un <UNK> for a space program i feel like i'm watching a valley girls b movie in space
<START> <UNK> was by far the biggest load of crap i have ever wasted my time watching this show based on the <UNK> commercials is less entertaining then an actual 30 <UNK> ad for <UNK> the makeup was half ass ed to say the least hard to imagine a <UNK> with <UNK> white teeth even after going to the dentist this show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials that in it self makes for a lousy show perhaps if the writers were the same from the <UNK> ads this may of had a chance instead the pilot lacked a good story line i give this show a 1 out of 10 i would of liked to put a zero out of 10 but that was not an option i pray for a quick death to this show i'd give it less then 5 episodes before it dies a deserving death
<START> based upon the recommendation of a friend my wife and i invited another couple to this film i really <UNK> to them all 4 of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end half the vignettes are bizarre with very little entertainment value there were few scenes of paris for example i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter but i couldn't really recognize anything most of the scene was inside a bar no one in the theater laughed at anything or <UNK> in any way if you like bizarre pretentious pseudo intellectual films don't miss this if you are down to earth like me you will be sorry you saw it
<START> after seeing the batman dead end short i didn't know what to really expect from world's finest of course superman and batman all my world's finest comic books have them as the team up br br after seeing this 3 and a half minute trailer it made me wish someone would make a <UNK> fan film for world's finest if not an actual full length film br br sure some of the superman stuff was cheesy but movie trailers in theaters are always <UNK> giving you only certain aspects of the entire product this looks like it needs a complete product br br other than director sandy <UNK> relative playing an <UNK> poor perry white most of the actors were unknown if an actual movie was made actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film though i believe nina <UNK> would make a good lois lane especially if given closer to the character dialogue br br good to see clark <UNK> wearing the batman costume from dead end but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the 40s batman with the 80s 90s leather cape and <UNK> his demeanor is batman like but i still wonder about the <UNK> of white contact <UNK> instead of just allowing his eyes to show through the mask i believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie persona br br michael <UNK> cannot play superman period he stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says slap me and line delivery seems to be a problem with him br br overall though i would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work there was a <UNK> about a world's finest movie being made and with the correct <UNK> to the script this could be it hope more like this are made
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a over hyped stylized product sure its a one of the most stylish films but when it comes to content even the masses will reject this one why the films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby script is king without a good script even the greatest director of all time cannot do anything tashan is produced by the most successful production <UNK> <UNK> raj <UNK> and mega stars appearing in it but nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland thumbs down br br performances anil kapoor is a veteran actor but how could he okay a role like this akshay kumar is great actor in fact he's the sole saving grace kareena kapoor has never looked so hot she looks stunning and leaves you all stand up saif ali khan doesn't get his due in here <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are wasted br br <UNK> is a boring film the films failure at the box office should you keep away
<START> what the heck was this somebody obviously read stephen king and <UNK> in the same <UNK> we get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror there were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music cgi or acting br br the problem with weird <UNK> like this is that it feels lazy even david lynch's work feels like that at times and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long and sadly this is only 98 minutes br br the cast was attractive and that is about the limit to this i suppose it touches on feelings of <UNK> and the fear of loneliness we all have but just doesn't make the characters likable enough for us to care about their <UNK> whatever they were the final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous
<START> i'm starting to think that there's a conspiracy all right one that involves a <UNK> of money paid to those who have access to published <UNK> in <UNK> and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film despite its obscurity will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a universal acclaim or something within that range thus <UNK> unsuspecting folk like me will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing expecting a surprise only to find myself racing to the bathroom to <UNK> br br this movie is one of them it has definitely make me <UNK> any and every posted article i come across because it's rather clear that two things might have happened either i didn't get the message that is so hidden beneath this film's inner <UNK> as to be impossible to access or they and i watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name 4 is a dirty trick on the audience it's no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say <UNK> and that despite the rating it got on <UNK> no one had heard of it it's terrible with sugar on top br br firstly there is the ever present number four from start to finish while having a little symbolism here and there is okay and it's been done with various degrees of success in many well known movies this movie is <UNK> with it four dogs at the start of the movie looking at the camera in a <UNK> empty street when suddenly <UNK> drops onto the <UNK> and proceeds to rip open the <UNK> four people in a bar although one of them is a non <UNK> three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless not only to each other but to what their lives are not while this concept may work the movie <UNK> so much particularly with the story of the would be model played by <UNK> <UNK> which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre and not in a good way that the initial theme gets lost in translation or maybe like i said before i just didn't get it the problem also lies in that so much time is spent on <UNK> story which revolves on the death of her sister from bread chewing no less and the subsequent shrill mourning which follows that any interest in the inherent <UNK> <UNK> without a trace so what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers <UNK> in a bar seem to have a truth of their own the director doesn't <UNK> much time in truly <UNK> them together or <UNK> a <UNK> story that could in a david <UNK> way <UNK> either with the past present or within alternate <UNK> or even as a straightforward mundane science fiction story this is an <UNK> battle against an <UNK> wall that only a saint or someone into the weird for <UNK> sake could endure
<START> super slick entertainment with a stellar cast an outstanding script and a firm grip on the approaching 1950's at the time rko was turning out classic <UNK> by the dozens but whatever the value of those shadowy <UNK> they reflected a war time mood soon to give way the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> era few films of the late 40's are further from that noir cycle or more <UNK> to the coming <UNK> decade than this sassy little comedy br br jim blandings cary grant works as an ad man on madison <UNK> where in his little daughter's words he sells things to people that they don't need at <UNK> they can't afford he's making good money but like thousands of others he's tired of living in a <UNK> urban cave so with wife <UNK> loy they strike out after their dream house in the <UNK> of the <UNK> countryside needless to say in the arms of nature they get more than they <UNK> for and in hilarious fashion br br there's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script i don't know if writers <UNK> and frank got an oscar but they should have of course the humor revolves around all the problems that pop up when city people build a big house on rural land the <UNK> pile up almost as fast as the <UNK> with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time of course no one carries off annoyance or frustration more <UNK> than grant so it's just one well placed laugh after another particularly when the locked closet appears to have an <UNK> mind of its own yet oddly the film appears to have no comedic high point instead the laughs are <UNK> out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point that's a real movie triumph for any era br br reaching back 60 years later we can see how <UNK> the script ideas look ahead rather than behind with their live in maid the blandings may not be a typical american family but that post war <UNK> from <UNK> cities to <UNK> <UNK> was typical and what more suggestive job for the coming <UNK> than blandings as an ad man <UNK> with finding <UNK> ways to sell more ham more than anything however there's the movie's sunny optimism oh sure the feeling <UNK> at times yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through indeed life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming <UNK> so i expect the film <UNK> deeply with audiences of the day it's that easily over looked subtext along with the sheer entertainment value that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post war period br br so if you haven't seen it catch it next time around
<START> i would almost give it 10 out of 10 however there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss leading which hurt the flow continuity of the film the story line is great and well composed you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it the characters are complicated and so is the story line expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head it's a film where all is explained in the end the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else i've seen in animation it is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so it's worth watching it on a good t v or <UNK> the character voices do save this film in its english version but it would have been more convincing if there were some french accents to emphasize that its happening paris i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitles one the whole its well worth buying on dvd or <UNK> if they have it and personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like waking life ghost in a shell 2 innocence this is just a personal suggestion
<START> do not ever watch this film it is the biggest pile of sh <UNK> i have ever come across in my whole life and thats saying something the acting storyline and filming were absolutely dire this is the worst film in the world seriously doesn't it even give you a hit seeing as it cost my <UNK> from <UNK> and it was only made in 2005 <UNK> this film is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen although if u really wanna watch it you gotta watch the scary shark scene possibly the best piece of acting i have seen in my life ha ha i mean seriously this is the biggest waste of 2 1 2 hours ever
<START> watching this last night it amazed me that fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment it's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed br br i'm sure that the first morning of filming <UNK> welch <UNK> off the shelf over her <UNK> to prepare a spot for the academy award she would surely win for this <UNK> original movie <UNK> that's not what happened br br the <UNK> on the set was detailed in print by rex reed and this helped the movie <UNK> a reputation before it was even released when it was finally released there wasn't the usual three ring circus of publicity if i remember correctly in <UNK> it opened at drive ins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big <UNK> br br i lay most of the blame on director michael sarne who was hot after having directed the not all that good joanna a film with music about young people in swinging <UNK> london br br if i recall correctly fox wound up firing him and <UNK> the film together the best they could that's why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then <UNK> an impressive supporting cast kathleen freeman jim <UNK> john carradine andy <UNK> and others is wasted with nothing to do br br to expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from fox movies featuring stars like carmen miranda in amazing footage from the <UNK> all here <UNK> and hardy who never <UNK> they'd be playing in an x rated movie br br the x rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual <UNK> however none of the characters seem to be having any fun maybe somebody involved with the film had a <UNK> <UNK> sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it wasn't bad to exploit them br br this was one of the youth pictures that nearly <UNK> hollywood in the 1970's one writer <UNK> that easy rider which was made for pocket change was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to <UNK> its success <UNK> once <UNK> directors like stanley kramer and otto preminger made movies like <UNK> and <UNK> in an effort to attract a young audience white directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a black audience those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never as best i know been out on home video or cable they're the <UNK> deep dark secret br br <UNK> <UNK> performance in this is all things considered very good with the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy <UNK> women <UNK> <UNK> and barbara stanwyck <UNK> in she looks great and has awesome costumes mae west is the <UNK> <UNK> something actress i've ever seen on the one hand it's kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by but i'm sure she needed the money br br if you want to see a big budget x rated movie from this era check out beyond the valley of the dolls also from fox because it doesn't take itself seriously it's crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio myra <UNK> tries to say something there just wasn't anyone who wanted to listen
<START> it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great movie br br i've never much cared for brad pitt though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving dark and right on target br br everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening br br the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book is that compared to what came before it the ending is a bit too long and overblown but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic br br if you check this film out try to get the <UNK> <UNK> director's cut for the best viewing option br br rating 9
<START> if the lion king was a disney version of hamlet then the lion king 3 <UNK> <UNK> is a disney version of <UNK> and <UNK> are dead just like tom <UNK> <UNK> film we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original timon the <UNK> with a <UNK> for breaking into song at the drop of a hat and pumbaa the <UNK> with <UNK> issues by following their story rather than <UNK> we get to see why all the animals <UNK> down as <UNK> was presented from pride rock we find out what made timon and pumbaa decide to follow <UNK> back to pride rock to <UNK> <UNK> and we find out how they dealt with the <UNK> once and for all nathan lane as timon gets most of the best jokes but he is <UNK> supported by ernie <UNK> as pumbaa it is also good to hear matthew <UNK> and whoopi goldberg <UNK> their roles julie <UNK> and jerry stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters <UNK> mother and uncle the only downside is the constant stop start <UNK> fast forward device which doesn't always help to progress the story having said that there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie with more laughs than any other third in a disney series movie <UNK> <UNK> is worth watching if only for the hot <UNK> scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable
<START> its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasn't copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids if they like dinosaurs that is i have a few downs too its not all that great cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated so i should have had but a 7 but right now is a little late for that <UNK> 4 more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this might spoil a part for u so if u don't want it to be spoiled don't read on <UNK> near the end is kinda weird cause all they need to do is get <UNK> i forgot what it was so <UNK> guess its not a spoiler so never mind i loved it and its my opinion and sorry for any missed spelled words if any
<START> christopher lloyd is funny and really believable as al the head angel this movie is much better than the first but it has great special effects that the first did not have as well as a much better plot and writing br br ok it was written for kids but adults have as much fun as the kids do tony <UNK> does a very realistic job in his role but this is not a taxi reunion br br danny glover is actually good and even seems to be very human in his emotions as well as showing some real acting talent for a change a pleasant change br br watch at least once it is worth the effort to catch it
<START> i've watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing i haven't been this interested in an anime series since <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this series is actually based off an h game which i'm not sure if it's been done before or not i haven't played the game but from what i've heard it follows it very well br br i give this series a 10 10 it has a great story interesting characters and some of the best animation i've seen it also has some great japanese music in it too br br if you haven't seen this series yet check it out you can find <UNK> episodes on some anime <UNK> out there it's straight out of japan
<START> tony <UNK> is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing a walk on the moon appears to have borrowed from other better made films the present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class jews not far from <UNK> the screen treatment by pamela gray doesn't have much going for it so it's a puzzle why mr <UNK> decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at direction br br the <UNK> family is spending some time at the resort we see them arrive at the small <UNK> that is going to be their temporary home marty the father comes only for the week end he works in what appears to be a family small <UNK> business <UNK> television sets mostly in a few days the first man will walk in space so the excitement is evident br br the <UNK> women are left behind pearl <UNK> wife and her mother in law <UNK> spend <UNK> days in the place until the <UNK> salesman arrives pearl goes <UNK> and she finds much more than a <UNK> she gets the salesman as well it appears that pearl and marty have no sexual life at all after two children pearl who appears to be sexy and with a high <UNK> is ready for some extra marital fun br br that is the basic premise for the film which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter alison decides to play <UNK> and go to the <UNK> festival nearby where horror of horrors she witnesses her own mom making out with the <UNK> salesman what's a girl to do well stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties are happily reunited by the little son's <UNK> when he is <UNK> by <UNK> and the salesman comes to apply some home <UNK> and daddy is called from the city after knowing about <UNK> betrayal with the younger stud br br poor diane lane she went to make <UNK> later on which is the <UNK> version of this dud viggo <UNK> is the salesman who <UNK> to his lonely female customers <UNK> little somethings in their ears <UNK> <UNK> as marty the <UNK> husband doesn't have much to do anna <UNK> plays the rebellious alison and <UNK> <UNK> is the unhappy <UNK> who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first hand one that is playing in her own backyard br br watch it at your risk or pop the dvd in the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh or two <UNK> the film
<START> i never heard of this film <UNK> it played as part of a robert mitchum <UNK> at the national film theatre in london almost 60 years on the cast list looked tasty to say the least with seven names in addition to top billed mitchum in the public <UNK> charles <UNK> not long off the killers barbara <UNK> <UNK> long before dallas and arguably still better known as the daughter of theatre set designer norman walter brennan who needed no introduction frank <UNK> the sadistic male nurse in the lost weekend and the much <UNK> small town <UNK> in it's a wonderful life robert preston still a decade away from harold hill in the music man with tom <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> making up the numbers alas most of them were wasting their time i looked in vain for any <UNK> scenes given that it was robert wise on <UNK> by this time he'd made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style the story is our old friend the range war and mitchum must have thought it was barely a cut above the <UNK> cassidy <UNK> on which he'd cut his teeth there are no new twists if you don't count the unbelievable scene when mitchum <UNK> preston of sleeping with <UNK> to gain information about her father's plans to move his cattle this is perfectly true but how did mitchum know we've seen or heard nothing to indicate how he discovered it on balance not a lot to be said for this
<START> first off with names like fred <UNK> ray <UNK> stevens and jan michael vincent plus <UNK> like <UNK> and troma on the video box you know what you're getting into with this one b movie <UNK> if you're actually expecting to see a thriller based on edgar allan poe then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman 60s poe films this is pure <UNK> sleaze with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to the <UNK> burial complete with lots of r rated ready for video sex and nudity however it's certainly entertaining and fun in a <UNK> kind of way br br <UNK> who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes plays rich traumatized <UNK> housewife victoria monroe whose fear of being <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from her belief that the same fate <UNK> her father <UNK> <UNK> her worthless husband terry jay richardson has <UNK> up some serious gambling debt <UNK> to a gangster played by robert <UNK> and with help from his kinky blonde european <UNK> <UNK> secretary lisa <UNK> <UNK> plots to do away with <UNK> for her money name value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a <UNK> she's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this 50s sci fi horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael <UNK> shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an <UNK> on a still living <UNK> jan michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo goo eyes as <UNK> enters and <UNK> the home br br the kill a <UNK> for the inheritance plot has been done a million times before the ending is an unintentional laugh riot <UNK> with a direct rip off of the <UNK> fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to <UNK> up on their skills a bit <UNK> does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic but the biggest surprise of all is how good former <UNK> pet <UNK> <UNK> is in her role she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here
<START> well first off if you're checking out revolt of the zombies as some very early night of the living dead 1968 type film forget it this is about zombies in a more psychological sense where that term merely <UNK> someone who is not in control of their will but who must instead follow the will of another the zombies here as little as they are in the film are largely <UNK> for <UNK> to the state or authority in general as in wartime it is quite a stretch to call this a horror film br br the film is set during world war i a french <UNK> <UNK> had heard strange stories about <UNK> supposedly <UNK> <UNK> was built by <UNK> zombies and there are tales of zombie <UNK> easily <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dean jagger brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of <UNK> but he won't talk so <UNK> and an international military <UNK> head to <UNK> <UNK> on an <UNK> expedition designed to discover the secret of <UNK> and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to wipe out the white race br br one of the odd things about revolt of the zombies is that it seems like maybe writer director victor <UNK> decided to change his game plan while shooting the script the film begins as if it will explore the zombie military metaphor and maybe even have adventure elements but after about 15 minutes it changes <UNK> and becomes more of a love triangle story br br <UNK> does stick with a subtext about will and power and a <UNK> will to power the film is interesting on that level but the script and the editing are very choppy this is yet another older film for which i wouldn't be surprised if there is missing footage especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is <UNK> dialogue br br amidst the contrived romance story <UNK> tries to keep referring to the zombie thread but little of the zombie material makes much sense <UNK> discovers the secret of <UNK> but it doesn't mean much to the viewer the <UNK> of the zombie material are vague and <UNK> even <UNK> to using <UNK> footage of bela <UNK> <UNK> eyes from his 1932 film white zombie but never explains what it has to do with anything there are big gaps in the plot including the love story promising interesting characters from early <UNK> disappear for long periods of time one potential villain is <UNK> of <UNK> before he gets to do much br br if you're a big fan of old <UNK> b movies revolt of the zombies may be worth watching at least once the acting isn't all that bad and if you've got a good imagination you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps but this is the second time i've seen the film with the first only being about five years ago and i could barely recall anything about it so it's not exactly memorable
<START> sadly the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at universal studios last week so we were stuck with video that could even be a metaphor for this second rate king kong movie from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> essentially it's a warm up for king kong versus godzilla it even uses the idea of a <UNK> kong like <UNK> godzilla of course the movie <UNK> with king kong fighting <UNK> kong on top of the <UNK> tower in tokyo but if you didn't know that already then maybe you're in the age group that this movie was intended for br br the cast is headed by a guy named <UNK> reason who we had never heard of <UNK> over his list i see mostly a lot of scattered american tv credits so it's interesting that they dragged him all the way to japan so that they could have a <UNK> american hero the real hero of the movie is the more sensitive japanese commander played by <UNK> <UNK> who i recognized from <UNK> <UNK> iconic version of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and also from the original godzilla films by <UNK> i'm sorry <UNK> reason whoever you are but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde played by linda miller we laughed at the way reason would always find a way to <UNK> himself between miller and <UNK> who it seemed like she kind of preferred of course like all kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the king himself she discovers a nice trick if you talk to a giant ape really really slowly he'll understand what you're saying and if you're a blonde gal that means that he'll do whatever you tell him to do that fact is not lost on dr who <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> representing a nation which shall not be named who plan on using her as bait to get kong to dig up <UNK> <UNK> that are trapped at the north pole br br yes this is truly the plot of the whole movie apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these <UNK> which can be used to make super powerful weapons dr who builds <UNK> kong to get it but the <UNK> gets in the way so they decide to go for the real kong kong himself seems <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> kong a story element that might have made the film more interesting but wasn't followed up on br br by the end of the movie the cute blonde has <UNK> kong or king kong in her <UNK> voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they're speaking for all of us basically this movie <UNK> whatever <UNK> was possible in the kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early just like the <UNK> version of the story kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously it's a nice looking movie i'm sure it <UNK> the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways the monsters don't ever really scare in these films they just jump around and push each other around a lot it's not a worthless movie but it's extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy
<START> one of the best movies for all ages you will never be able to look at lion king again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds nearly 40 years old i watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight i have not laughed enjoyed a movie so much in a long time br br take time out and watch this with the kids it will remind you of how disney used to be when you were a young one
<START> i had high expectations for this movie and was excited about renting it but was very disappointed when i saw it it was very poorly written and sort of just fell apart there wasn't a lot of good anything in this movie except maybe special effects
<START> i watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when i should have been asleep this in itself was <UNK> that deliverance was a spell <UNK> movie i think <UNK> did a wonderful job on directing this film how expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the <UNK> <UNK> was done it showed so well and early on how <UNK> reserved and simple the people of the area were case in point near the end of the duel the <UNK> playing boy was smiling loved his <UNK> but when drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the duel the kid was too reserved to respond the river trip never left you bored for sure the rape scene was brutal but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of georgia i think <UNK> traumatic shock afterward was well done some have said he was pretty <UNK> by the ordeal i disagree if you really <UNK> attention he was <UNK> during the entire action immediately following in which reynolds put the arrow through the <UNK> and they chased off the <UNK> guy it was confusing when ed killed the other guy later at the top of the cliff it almost appeared that the arrow was shot while ed was <UNK> up and expecting to die but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect br br anyway a great movie and i was <UNK> between an 8 and 9 on my vote but after reading a message from a disgruntled <UNK> who gave it a 1 i gave it a 10 this <UNK> reasoning seemed based on personal bias rather than an objective viewpoint and his vote was obviously a non <UNK> attempt to lower the rating
<START> a bad rip off attempt on seven complete with sub second grade acting awful camera work half baked story and strong <UNK> of lame propaganda yeah them sex <UNK> they live next door and you're gonna get raped really br br no surprises from the vice <UNK> woman she acts as always as convincingly as a piece of wood richard gere keeps on <UNK> lower and lower and is about as low here as a late steven seagal br br the singer woman with the crazy eyes is best when she's dead in bed and even the wolf was sub par although she was the best performer in the movie maybe they fed her before the shots or something br br unlike seven which had a made up but interesting story to which one could relate more or less regardless of the country this movie seems to focus on a us only obsession if one doesn't care much about sex <UNK> and the <UNK> are that lack of exercise and bad <UNK> cause more pain suffering and death there is little reason to see it or to be afraid br br there are some body part <UNK> and some snuff but the gore is less then mediocre and fails both as artistic device because it is pointless and as gore because it is not gory enough br br don't waste time on this one
<START> i really really wanted to like julian <UNK> i think that slater is underrated as an actor and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read so i do not know if what i see as the film's faults <UNK> with the story or were <UNK> on it by the director screenwriter the premise is wonderful and i loved the <UNK> <UNK> tone the opening narration strikes but then nothing several of the cliched local characters ask julian <UNK> to explain his intention to commit suicide one could argue that he doesn't answer because it's none of their business but julian is the one who under only token pressure <UNK> out his intentions in public then neither julian nor the director writer despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded <UNK> for god's sake seem inclined to provide anything beyond the <UNK> initial information on <UNK> life he says he was a <UNK> he says his family moved around when he was a child due to his father's job so what there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to <UNK> <UNK> purpose but none of them go anywhere because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet as if he were the ultimate and only sane one among them this might work as an allegory if julian <UNK> had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to <UNK> the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he <UNK> <UNK> the naive religious wife of the mechanic and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian i can only see the julian character as rendered as selfish petty and totally condescending sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half baked contrived film and poor michael parks an actor who once had so much promise is given nothing to work with here
<START> this anime seriously <UNK> my <UNK> when the anime first opened itself i felt it was too slow the story wasn't quite moving forward and <UNK> was quite an unimpressive male lead once he learns more about <UNK> and you learn more about <UNK> and the holy grail war itself the story pans out and you can see multiple <UNK> of it moving together it was fantastic br br additionally i felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop in the real world there wasn't any stupid completely obvious things going on the development of <UNK> and <UNK> was interesting to watch but i think the way <UNK> and <UNK> grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on a few of the surprise people that show up <UNK> seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another meaning we didn't have generic bad ass a being replaced by generic bad ass b as soon as a died br br <UNK> i loved the music the opening music <UNK> and the finishing theme from the final episode just seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more good job type moon
<START> like a relative that gives you a bad gift soul survivors has its heart in the right place but <UNK> up with a bad execution stephen carpenter's writing directing effort borrows <UNK> from other better films such as <UNK> ladder and <UNK> los <UNK> open your eyes for those who haven't seen either of these films i won't give the premise away suffice to say it's not nearly as well handled here than in those two superior films br br melissa <UNK> stars as cassie about to go away to college her current boyfriend sean ben affleck and ex boyfriend matt wes <UNK> both friends and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are in a car accident after being pursued by two killers in transparent masks she survives the wreck but while attending college has visions of the hospital ordeal and dead people <UNK> and disappear leaving her in a state of total confusion who is dead who's alive what's real br br soul survivors has the look of a bad been there done that gore filled blood <UNK> body <UNK> teen exploitation flick true it has its share of killer stalking the victim scenes <UNK> repetitive and mind numbing but at least it attempts to build suspense through ideas rather than cliches unfortunately rather <UNK> it <UNK> confusion much more often than <UNK> as the story becomes <UNK> messy and incoherent near key points of the mystery predictable as it is br br horror fans who pick up a copy will have no idea they are in for a film that is more concerned with building an uneasy <UNK> of reality than delivering a body count credit goes to carpenter for attempting to create something beyond a derivative teen horror flick too bad he's created a derivative psychological thriller <UNK> also deserves kudos for showing strength in the central performance actually developing her character and <UNK> some sense of emotion as the <UNK> cassie it's great the filmmakers try something different but the film ends up a mixed bag and failed experiment br br 4 out of 10
<START> cage 1989 was another one of those low budget buddy action flicks that were produced during the 80's thanks in large part due to the films such as <UNK> and lethal weapon this one stars <UNK> brown and lou <UNK> as to former vietnam vets who happen to run a local dive bar <UNK> takes care of lou because he saved his life in <UNK> but lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft although he's huge lou has the brain of a child one day some <UNK> throw their wait around in the bar and lou and <UNK> beat the <UNK> out of them but <UNK> a mother they crash the bar leaving lou and <UNK> with nothing that is until these two thugs come into the picture one of <UNK> a real nice guy who have a plan in mind br br the film's a waste of time maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the <UNK> of the situation perhaps it could have worked alas it doesn't and the audience is left holding the bag oh well it's too bad because you have all the elements for a great b movie better luck next time i guess br br not recommended br br <UNK>
<START> there is a dvd published in the uk in 2002 code <UNK> on the cover no <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> no <UNK> code in the inner <UNK> br br probably a straight transfer from vhs br br there is no much point is commenting an adult film but this one contains a minimal plot and the characters are believable it was shown in the united states in normal cinemas br br i've seen it in <UNK> way back in 1975 br br as such it deserves a place in an <UNK> of movies the dvd has no special features and no subtitles and was probably made using a vhs tape as source
<START> is this a stupid movie you bet i could not find any moment in this film that was creepy or scary stupid moments plenty stupid characters you bet bad effects everywhere rick baker may have gone and done bigger and better things this is not one of them oh well people gotta start somewhere dr ted nelson is <UNK> he is the most whiny doctor i've ever seen he's got a melting man running amok out in <UNK> county somewhere he's not overly happy that his wife is pregnant probably cause she's <UNK> years old and <UNK> 90 <UNK> and there's no <UNK> to be found anywhere plus he's got the not too helpful general on his <UNK> wanting to find astronaut steve and the local sheriff wants to know what's going on even though mr nelson can't tell him anything there also some random characters thrown in for good measure who encounter the melting man eventually the movie ends and out monster gets <UNK> into a trash can to become <UNK> in the end it's just what you need for a great <UNK> episode
<START> in my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made in america and it deserved every single award it won and it's place on the <UNK> top 100 list though it's <UNK> too low on the imdb top 250 list at only <UNK> as of this writing if you enjoy acting of the highest <UNK> voight and hoffman are a superb match well drawn characterizations and inventive direction editing and cinematography you'll love this just as much as i did <UNK> paints a vivid always credible picture of the late 60s new york city scene and it's many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the <UNK> poverty and <UNK> of <UNK> street new york city br br the filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground new york film movement and of the city and are nothing less than dazzling i've seen many ideas including the rapid fire editing the handling of the voice over flashbacks the drug trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror stolen by other filmmakers br br the relationship between joe and ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship or having it's homosexual <UNK> i think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times but rather to concentrate his <UNK> on the importance of a strong human connection in life whether it be sexual or not br br midnight cowboy is a brave moving film of <UNK> influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it's impact over the years so if you haven't seen it you're really missing out on a true american classic i recommend this film to everyone br br score 10 out of 10
<START> i rented new best friend hoping for a movie similar to enjoyable teen thrillers such as <UNK> and the <UNK> instead new best friend is much more like the in crowd in which there are no thrills and the acting is incredibly phony new best friend is boring and the events during the movie are the same skip this movie it's a waste of time
<START> heart <UNK> erotic drama are the words that come to mind when i think of secret games it becomes more erotic as the film goes along and at one point blew me away i didn't expect the delightful scene i was about to encounter the call girl has her first <UNK> and what a <UNK> one of the most erotic lesbian scenes i have ever seen the husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this erotic journey it turned out to cost them in the end but it was one exciting ride go see this movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> first american film was one of the best of a slew of prison set horror films like death house or the chair in the late 80's twenty years before guard lane smith had <UNK> executed a condemned man now he is the warden of the newly re opened prison and the man's ghost is back for bloody revenge this atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence viggo <UNK> tiny <UNK> tom everett and kane <UNK> are <UNK> for the entertaining carnage
<START> at long last one of michael jackson's most well known and beloved films comes to dvd in michael jackson <UNK> michael jackson stars as michael a man with powers that are not of this world michael must save sean sean lennon katie <UNK> parker <UNK> brandon <UNK> adams and the rest of the worlds children from drug lord frankie <UNK> aka mr big joe <UNK> who's mission in life is to get all of the worlds children hooked on drugs a note to people in the usa looking for this film on dvd make sure when buying this film on dvd you buy <UNK> product <UNK> as <UNK> region 3 which plays on north american <UNK> region 1 players
<START> of all <UNK> mid '80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be the running man a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad it may have been far fetched back then but not so now not when you think about it currently reality tv shows are either <UNK> the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar if the next one isn't more controversial as the last it's a dud how long will it be before we really do see shows like the running man how long before we have <UNK> <UNK> theatrical <UNK> or the entertainment division of the justice department there is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of tv shows br br the biggest message of all is <UNK> are being <UNK> <UNK> it's no secret that the government and the media work in <UNK> and the masses believe what the media tells them to believe it's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate <UNK> of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the running man in the near future it's no secret that reality tv is not very realistic it's edited and <UNK> before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see usually it's far from the real truth br br although rather different than stephen king's book the ending is completely changed the script does <UNK> to the typical arnie formula yes he does have numerous and very corny one liners and he does say <UNK> be <UNK> which he never really said that often anyway when you think about it in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a <UNK> times better in the role then christopher reeve or dolph lundgren would have been these two were considered before arnie believe it or not br br the director is none other than dave <UNK> himself paul michael <UNK> it may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of <UNK> and <UNK> colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look andrew davis not a director i particularly like was attached before <UNK> though no matter who directs the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel br br first of all harold <UNK> score remember him is incredibly dated and <UNK> the action scenes of any timeless integrity and the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future apart from the dated feel the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot out that passes as the climax br br this new dvd is a <UNK> times better than the original release gone is the horrid <UNK> picture in its place is a brand new hi definition 1 85 1 <UNK> transfer the colors <UNK> and literally pop from the screen the new <UNK> 5 1 ex and <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack are also amazing there constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful definitely one of the best re masters i've seen so far two intriguing documentaries a trailer and a <UNK> the <UNK> gimmick are included in this 2 disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case
<START> jackie chan's classic directorial feature police story 1985 is among the most influential and over the top modern day police <UNK> ever to come out from hong kong jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other urban action which would later become very popular and typical among hk directors like john woo and <UNK> <UNK> police story mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds br br jackie plays chan <UNK> <UNK> a police who gets to protect an important witness <UNK> lin who would soon <UNK> against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity <UNK> girlfriend is played by young and sweet maggie cheung who isn't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like heroic trio and the sequel by <UNK> to <UNK> of the soul by corey <UNK> and david <UNK> and many many others the plot in police story is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place br br jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which jackie hits his head near the eye through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass also <UNK> stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film the scene in which a bus stops right before jackie spitting the <UNK> through the <UNK> went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the <UNK> didn't fly as they were supposed to they were supposed to fly on the car <UNK> in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the <UNK> with hospital level <UNK> during the end credits there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely br br the action is more than <UNK> and imaginative as can be expected by action director chan the now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the <UNK> scenes any action film has been able to deliver jackie always tells how important editing is which is true and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra <UNK> when compared to hollywood efforts for instance there's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch br br but there is again one negative point which i cannot stand in hk action comedies which is this comedy itself the comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue i mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare and he is there to murder that girl this kind of acting is stupid and inept and i wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those loud thoughts are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and light even if the film is comic and not so serious these kind of <UNK> should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily br br police story is a fast speed full impact balls to the walls action adventure miracle from hong kong and from the time when jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the us produced the <UNK> as he didn't have the same thoughts about the film as director james <UNK> had and thus the result didn't please audiences and jackie and he returned to hong kong to make more personal and inventive film that he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80's this is among the most insane action films ever and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws i mentioned 7 10
<START> i know it's crude and i know that it isn't at all pc but it's so funny if you can put it into perspective that it's from the early 80's and it carries all the stereotypes of the time and the movie still makes you almost pass out with laughter than it is truly a good comedy going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years the subject matter of this film is <UNK> if you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half just to have an all out laugh than please watch this br br p s would someone please put this out on dvd it's so hard to find on vhs anymore
<START> there are many good things about the new bsg there's the multiple <UNK> roles for model 8 and 6 for example which the two actresses played superbly there's the old school feel of industrial design aboard galactica my ship will not be <UNK> over my dead body also all the space battles the special effects even though the seasoned sci fi watcher will acknowledge the <UNK> of it all the darkness of the characters their essentially flawed nature br br that makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish br br yes the first part the scenes in space the raid on the <UNK> and all that was very good but the <UNK> ending i always watch films and shows these days with the <UNK> hidden so i never know how much time is left until the end so for me it was a special kind of torture to see the end happen over and over again every time i thought oh this is the final scene the final shot i got one more every <UNK> character got its complete ending that wasn't really necessary br br what really <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of it all the young <UNK> scenes why is important for us to know that a she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and b that she has a one night stand with a former <UNK> student what does that bring to the story where was the <UNK> now i'm all for a more european ish style approach and a random acts of <UNK> in films and shows and all that but this was just ridiculous this didn't bring anything meaningful to the story br br also i've seen the last <UNK> special and in it ron revealed his own <UNK> about the plot he couldn't come up with a good ending for the story so he just didn't it's never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be the whole this was thousands of years in the past idea the <UNK> eve thing was also used in the <UNK> guide to the galaxy and believe you me there are a lot of bsg <UNK> who know that particular <UNK> storyline and speaking of <UNK> now there's a storyline that was not worked out well at all instead we get <UNK> is doing her former <UNK> who's 20 years younger don't get me wrong i'm all for older women with younger men the more power to them but this just made no sense br br all in all the writing in this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be that goes even <UNK> for the last episode i hope lost and 24 do better with their series <UNK>
<START> a few years back the same persons who created paris <UNK> which was <UNK> but very enjoyable my rating was a 7 created this piece of garbage about new york city br br in paris i love you <UNK> created a feeling for paris it was made in many parts of beautiful paris br br in this current film i did not recognize new york city i did not feel that i was in the city of my birth br br new york does have 5 <UNK> i saw no scenes in the <UNK> or queens there is one scene in brooklyn <UNK> beach i saw no scenes in times square or <UNK> village no scenes of the beautiful <UNK> or theatres it does have a large cast most of the performers were not even stereotypes they were caricatures of the lowest sort br br the very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new <UNK> that we all know love br br a few of the films nominated for the <UNK> awards were far better br br ratings out of 4 20 points out of 100 imdb 1 out of 10 br br in my way of thinking i think the title should have been br br new york i hate you
<START> spoilers contained br br i'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific what i didn't expect was the complete change in <UNK> with about twenty minutes to go what starts off as a typical cowboy indian western suddenly <UNK> into a very dull romantic <UNK> about <UNK> soldier blue of the title played by peter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who escape an <UNK> of the <UNK> by the <UNK> the majority of the film then focuses on these two <UNK> people hence the romantic comedy bit donald <UNK> then turns up and <UNK> them both for no real apparent reason they then escape and both turn up <UNK> at the <UNK> base on the eve of an attack on the <UNK> base as <UNK> used to be married to one of the <UNK> <UNK> she escapes the <UNK> base and joins up with them so far so ordinary then comes the ending after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they won't they get together storyline the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a <UNK> and a child being shot in the back of the head similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn't resort to extreme gratuitous violence in some ways soldier blue reminds me of frank <UNK> last summer which also completely changed <UNK> for a shock ending i didn't hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the <UNK> i would recommend <UNK> <UNK> come and see
<START> tea <UNK> plays nora <UNK> a serious photographer who is going through a bad divorce she wants her freedom but it comes at a cost she wants to legitimate photography but is hired to work for the <UNK> as a <UNK> her boss is played by the wonderful and divine holland taylor the show was well written most of the time <UNK> nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just didn't support comedy and they still don't even when they brought in george <UNK> from cheers they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters the show was fine in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it but then the network <UNK> it up like a bad plastic surgery
<START> sunday would not be sunday without an action movie and when you want intense combat you turn to tom berenger platoon br br here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug <UNK> life's a bitch so he gets a green office type billy zane to help on the mission br br the film is in the hands of luis <UNK> who <UNK> up <UNK> he doesn't do much better here but berenger makes the movie worthwhile br br sure it may be a little long who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle but is is good tense action when the time is right
