<START> my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago and i must say this is the single best movie i have ever seen i mean <UNK> dude we better get some <UNK> before this joint <UNK> and dude <UNK> not a <UNK> again what poetry <UNK> and it's such a original movie too i mean you don't usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same i mean exactly now that's originality and almost all the transitions between scenes are these great close ups of the psycho in the er <UNK> how cool the acting is so wonderful to the dad was just brilliant must have studied real <UNK> before filming and how many movies do you find that just don't make any sense not many but this is one of those gems i mean how cool is it that one guy waited outside for like six hours to pull a prank while his friends were both inside that's really cool overall i'd say this is the single greatest film of the genre <UNK> in the world
<START> as usual another masterpiece in the vice academy series <UNK> i don't know why they even bothered to make this trash just another series of cops acting <UNK> a defining part was when ginger <UNK> allen's character holly wells and elizabeth character candy tried to seduce the scientist by wearing nothing but their <UNK> and underwear under their just a wonderful scene ha a character that i didn't like was the <UNK> he was very annoying and ignorant they should have arrested him mrs was pretty annoying as well they should have stopped this series after this movie
<START> i just recently viewed shame which is directed by <UNK> bergman the film was interesting and very unique i liked how it was in swedish with english subtitles and that it was also in black and white these features allowed me to better relate to the characters the time period and their stories i didn't like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you didn't know what was really going on at first it was mainly a story of eva and <UNK> relationship the movie also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came out of all of the conflicts and changes throughout the movie i probably would not go see shame again but it was a very <UNK> experience
<START> i write this review just after hearing of stanley kubrick's death it's a great loss and i write about 2001 a space odyssey because i feel it is the <UNK> kubrick film the one he will be most remembered for it is a picture like no other not only science fiction but changing the way films are <UNK> it was probably america's first <UNK> film and has inspired the likes of george lucas and countless other writers and directors br br aside from its visual greatness the reason the film <UNK> so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it kubrick and arthur c clarke his co writer had a vision but we have never really found out what was going through their minds of course the skinny on its <UNK> is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful <UNK> ending is one of hope a version of our <UNK> through the star child's flight back to earth it is meaningless to many but <UNK> <UNK> will understand br br although 2001 does not have the wicked dark humor of dr <UNK> or clockwork orange or contain strong eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like paths of glory or <UNK> i still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this if anything hal will be his most memorable character dangerous murderous and artificial it was a half decade in the making at a time when hollywood was still <UNK> out dull musicals and just waking up to the new wave of french and italian cinema kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms his own time and for everyone else to marvel at he will be missed
<START> very interesting to find another reviewer who had the exact same reaction to this movie as i did it was a heck of a lot better when i was 10 or 11 years old br br seeing it more than 30 years later it's still okay but it only mildly held my interest what seemed hugely funny back then was only mildly amusing br br also things that were astonishing to me as a 10 year old came across as just silly for example in one scene <UNK> is walking along and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking in fact he doesn't even bother to look and see if they're dead because he knows he hit the mark um yeah right br br in addition a lot of the dialogue sounds quite wooden sorry but 35 years later it hasn't really aged that well br br although it's been a long time since i've seen that one as well probably a better <UNK> hill film than this one would be my name is nobody
<START> this british film version of the stage play i am a camera is based on christopher berlin stories this is the source material for the famous musical <UNK> br br julie harris a major stage actress of her day <UNK> her 1951 tony award winning role as sally <UNK> she's a far cry from the <UNK> minnelli character but the basic sally is all here despite the various film <UNK> that would have <UNK> this story from being filmed in hollywood harris is perhaps <UNK> but she's also quite good as the <UNK> and <UNK> sally her singing number is obviously dubbed by marlene <UNK> no less although harris apparently sings for herself in other moments br br laurence harvey with the very ugly hair plays with zero charm and can't even make the character interesting shelley winters does little with the role of <UNK> <UNK> winters won a supporting tony for the play and anton <UNK> is ok as fritz ron <UNK> plays the clive but seems a tad loud lee <UNK> is funny as the <UNK> br br yet despite the overall <UNK> and cheap look harris takes center stage and she is amazing this film was released the same year as east of <UNK> in which harris gives a glowing performance as comparing the two performances gives a good look at the talent miss harris possesses these two characters couldn't be more <UNK> <UNK> sally <UNK> and <UNK> about and <UNK> out a very <UNK> laugh she also acts circles around the boring harvey br br without the music and with a familiar storyline many viewers may find little here to recommend this film but it's a great chance to see the great julie harris repeating what was probably a very shocking role in 1951
<START> the plot of the movie is pretty simple a <UNK> <UNK> turned the population into flesh eating zombies those who left became hunters br br well first of all this is not the worst zombie movie there is among the worst are <UNK> and the infamous zombie lake br br in fact i think the idea for quick and the undead was very good just executed poorly considering the budget they had to work with this movie looks very good i wasn't bored at all while watching it special effects were solid although they did use cgi once fat zombie getting shot in the head but everything else gore guts was rather good acting is awful however our main guy looks like young clint eastwood other actors are not even worth mentioning as far as the plot goes they didn't work enough on the development of the story br br bad acting low budget good special effects idea for the movie br br overall this flick deserves 4 10 from me it's not as bad as people say imagine a zombie western then watch this movie
<START> ah classic comedy at the point in the movie where brains get messed together a two minute scene with bruce campbell beating himself up partially reminds me of how simplistic movies and ideas can grab you and wrap you into a whole movie br br for years and years bruce campbell knows what kind of movies we want out of him we want to see weird movies like <UNK> ho <UNK> we want to see cameo roles in sam <UNK> movies and we want to see <UNK> with the screaming <UNK> with the title alone one knows that it's going to border that completely silly type of movie like army of darkness only with more silly and less monsters br br the idea of the movie is simple bruce sees doctor doctor has new idea bruce gets bad things happen to him on way to see doctor <UNK> it's the thing the doctor wanted to show him that saves him hilarity ensues br br with the addition of ted <UNK> as a weird russian guy and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as dr <UNK> it's funny that does this movie complete funny never a point of scary br br if you like the silly bruce campbell you'll like this then again why would you be watching this if you didn't like bruce campbell
<START> the moral of this show is that bad eating <UNK> give people bad hair bad taste in clothes bad <UNK> bad jobs and on and on they are obviously miserable and <UNK> themselves however if they learn to eat <UNK> they will be wealthy successful and attractive br br <UNK> ought to be ashamed of themselves for this blatant exploitation of <UNK> fears and guilt if <UNK> is really that important they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods if they really believed in their computer <UNK> i'd like to see them do a double blind test by finding some 40 year olds finding out what their eating and exercise <UNK> were as children and age <UNK> the kids' photos then compare to the real things hey that sounds like a project for discovery channel are you listening br br <UNK> must stand for <UNK> lies and cons
<START> after a very scary crude opening which gives you that creepy chainsaw massacre feeling everything falls apart br br spoiler alert as soon as the two fbi officers start <UNK> you know they are the real killers anyone who have seen enough of these fooled ya movies can figure this out br br this movie is with one thing in mind to depict brutal murders why then is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well will this be next for us movie goers the torture and abuse of children whats wrong with you people lynch is truly has a disgusting ugly mind
<START> combining the conventions of both western and gothic horror and often directed as if it were an art movie this is one of <UNK> and eastwood's best <UNK> br br eastwood plays a <UNK> soldier who after being wounded during the civil war takes <UNK> in an isolated southern <UNK> for young women shut away from the world the women project their romantic fantasies on to him and he responds with <UNK> male manipulation but jealousy and <UNK> raise their heads and he finds himself in a world of brutal revenge and boy is the revenge brutal br br beautifully shot by bruce <UNK> and carefully paced the <UNK> is a haunting elegant work that seems to have influenced the troubled sexuality of eastwood's own play misty for me and <UNK> br br the film is a gripping depiction of a fierce battle of the <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> mix of horror and sexuality all the characters are ambiguous displaying traits of both good and evil leaving it up to us to choose whom we should root for br br don <UNK> left quite a legacy of fine films behind everything from of the body <UNK> to dirty harry but though his early black and white pictures have aged well the majority of his colour films seem grainy dated and badly shot his gritty realism must have seemed fresh and <UNK> 40 years ago but when viewed today i just don't think they've stood the test of time br br the <UNK> however is in a different league mature ambiguous and <UNK> shot it's a shame it isn't more widely known while <UNK> technology and technique have rendered the majority of <UNK> tough <UNK> action thrillers <UNK> the <UNK> still <UNK> audiences today due to it's surreal atmosphere and unique subject matter br br 8 5 10 better than the similarly themed black <UNK> this is in my opinion <UNK> best film part horror part drama part sexual odyssey the <UNK> is a surprisingly arty film especially when considering that <UNK> viewed his films to be quote a large part of the film's artistry is due to clint eastwood who would from this point <UNK> make an effort to choose mature material
<START> i can't believe this movie only scores 7 4 this surely ranks up with the best of hitchcock's movies such as vertigo or <UNK> the only reason i can think of why the score is so low is that for the most part the man <UNK> violence and certainly won't get a <UNK> in sex and crime br br what it <UNK> its tension from is not violence it's the reckless energy of these criminals that take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the kid if the operation fails today having seen a lot of <UNK> kidnapping movies as mel <UNK> <UNK> this seems normal but in the 1950s where family was all in contemporary america the thought of such a crime surely has <UNK> up emotions a lot br br and this tension still works for me today yeah these guys are selfish ignorant <UNK> disturbing in how they act it's a deal for them and they want to be good <UNK> <UNK> the fact that business here is kidnapping kids and <UNK> politicians in the opera br br what makes the movie great however are the creative aspects the kinky ideas of hitchcock the outrageously disturbing scene in the church which brings it to the viewer's attention how alone how abandoned the protagonists are nobody caring nobody helping the people in the church just going home the meeting with the owner of that shop <UNK> and preparing dead animals which <UNK> the somewhat oriental flair the movie has from the opening scenes abroad last not least the role of music in this movie br br music is the key principle here as spoiler the assassination of the targeted politician is to be done exactly in the moment of a loud <UNK> <UNK> so hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second bang and then of course doris day singing <UNK> <UNK> which became more famous than the movie itself she sings it to <UNK> the kid of his parents being in the <UNK> br br all in all a classic
<START> this was so poor i had to turn it off in the end i have never watched such a pathetic film i love b movies and was looking forward to more of the same but was sadly disappointed br br this has the worst acting plot direction writing etc of anything i have ever seen in my life br br my advice to anyone thinking or watching buying renting don't go there
<START> i don't see the sense in going through so much trouble to make a movie like this and then throw the history book out the window there wasn't a single accurate detail in that movie other than the fact than died which i was grateful for at the end so i didn't have to watch any more movies like this are an insult to anyone who knows anything about wwi <UNK> history br br i'll skip the obvious that they were flying in <UNK> because the blue max did that too or that <UNK> <UNK> was flying se and will attack other parts for one thing they call the d iii an <UNK> at the beginning for another they have <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> all in the only one who was in that was <UNK> and he joined after died wasn't held to blame for death <UNK> who <UNK> with had <UNK> to avoid a british plane that was chasing when received his head wound it was while attacking a <UNK> <UNK> two <UNK> and he did not crash into the <UNK> and have soldiers fight over him and no <UNK> <UNK> did not die that day he died september <UNK> in one of the most epic battles in wwi br br <UNK> was short not like the actor who <UNK> over everyone else his brother <UNK> was never in either he joined the <UNK> when <UNK> was in charge of 11 br br there's so many other glaring errors in historical fact that i'll let them go except perhaps the worst one the death scene in the movie <UNK> is out <UNK> by brown and then shot down making a perfect landing brown got off one burst at while was chasing may and the facts <UNK> over the years <UNK> show that was killed by ground fire not by brown br br the only value in this movie was the chance to see the flying scenes themselves which were as good as 'the blue <UNK> other than that i won't watch it again and i paid 30 for the tape
<START> boogie nights is one of the best films to come out of the 90's and i'd go so far as to say it should be in the imdb top 250 i can actually understand why many would dislike it due to the subject matter i personally feel however as many do judging from the this film's received by viewers and critics that it's <UNK> film making br br the direction and acting in this film <UNK> good and reach the level of brilliance there is not one scene in this movie that isn't amazing the individual characters reach out and touch you given that this is a movie about the porn industry one wouldn't imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are the direction is among the best i've ever seen and i've seen a lot of films br br the film isn't about one particular personal <UNK> story it's about many it's a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them boogie nights draws you into their story from the beginning and though the film is long i believe almost 3 hours you honestly don't even notice and when it ends you kind of don't want it to br br i'm not easy to impress meaning there aren't many movies i'd give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one beyond the multiple character study is the use of music in the film i have never in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie there was such <UNK> to it you know it's not something your gonna see everyday br br burt <UNK> performance was perhaps the best i've ever seen him do and mark <UNK> is incredible i'm <UNK> there are still people saying he doesn't act well i don't know how anyone viewing this could possibly think that but the person who really surprised me was heather who is absolutely fantastic in her role in particular the one memorable scene with burt reynolds in the <UNK> towards the end br br again i'll echo other imdb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody but i still think this was <UNK> 10 of 10
<START> how his <UNK> evolved as both man and ape was outstanding not to mention the scenery of the film christopher <UNK> was astonishing as lord of <UNK> christopher is the soul to this masterpiece i became so with his performance i could feel my heart <UNK> the of the movie still moves me to this day his portrayal of john was oscar worthy as he should have been nominated for it
<START> this film seems well made and more efforts should be made to promote films by women that aside this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it <UNK> the manipulative and psychotic <UNK> of a character that is profoundly disturbed if you've seen any of the <UNK> material you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship that's reached its end but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is br br a woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to <UNK> here most <UNK> memories of their relationship when told how unfair to say the least that such a threat is <UNK> the <UNK> protagonist suggests that life's not fair br br huh this character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying and <UNK> him into sexually oriented behavior which she initially <UNK> as a motive all the while <UNK> him this isn't sex br br reverse the <UNK> have the leads played by <UNK> gold and brian austin green and this could air in feature length on lifetime with a title like hostage to obsession there is no <UNK> accepted definition of sound mental and emotional <UNK> that would <UNK> behavior in this film br br props to <UNK> <UNK> for playing a border line psychotic manipulative ex to a t perhaps too well because there is no well <UNK> person male or female who could watch this and not have <UNK> run up their spine
<START> my blue heaven is boring the plot is insipid the characterizations and dialogue stink the musical numbers while occasionally staged in interesting ways are not only too often absurd but also <UNK> trite painfully bright and emotionally hollow to the core the leads betty <UNK> and dan <UNK> are attractive professionals however in spite of their every talented effort to <UNK> the and <UNK> material they fail david wayne and jane <UNK> for all their demonstrated talent in other projects are more or less <UNK> here br br there's really only one reason to watch my blue heaven one reason one star <UNK> <UNK> in her film debut her total screen time is probably less than ten minutes but so what her <UNK> and promising screen personality her <UNK> beauty and her exceptional charisma shine through <UNK> and make these minutes the most watchable memorable and exciting moments in the entire film if you would value an opportunity to see a tremendous young talent on the rise then check out miss <UNK> <UNK> in my blue heaven br br incidentally i <UNK> and would urge you to avoid drew <UNK> manic obsessive <UNK> dvd commentary for this film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> frequently ill timed with what is playing on the screen and <UNK> throughout with an excess of nervous energy his comments are absolutely <UNK>
<START> it wasn't until i saw sidney <UNK> in the picture that i ever connected him to this film this is his worst possible movie absolute dreck the dialog is wooden and unbelievable the plot is unbelievable br br <UNK> scott thomas is wasted in this movie there is nothing about her character that makes you even want to believe in this story br br harrison ford is like on <UNK> there is no life in his eyes br br i blame sidney <UNK> for the failure of this movie the script is awful and he is too smart to not see that so it <UNK> of some kind of payoff whether of a studio <UNK> or something else but this is just bloody rotten
<START> let me say this about edward d wood jr he had a passion for his work that i wish more people did have if we all had the optimism and the commanding hope of ed wood the world would probably be a much better place being familiar with ed <UNK> story and having seen the most wonderful biopic ed wood 1994 several times i admire his <UNK> and his <UNK> for the job he loved i still admire his never say die attitude he had a love for directing that i wish more people in modern day hollywood had br br but that doesn't make his movies any more fun to watch and <UNK> or glenda his first and most <UNK> film is probably his very worst br br <UNK> or glenda is a <UNK> cult movie about a cross <UNK> named <UNK> played by director writer ed wood himself who despite his love for his fiancée barbara <UNK> fuller cannot seem to <UNK> his lust for <UNK> in which he dresses in women's clothing and a wig and thus becomes glenda <UNK> <UNK> story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called the scientist played by veteran horror star bela lugosi oh and there's also some sub story about an alan anne character who becomes a <UNK> based on the christine story upon whom this movie originally titled i changed my sex was previously to be based br br have i dropped your jaw yet well as much as i want to warn you off this picture if you've never seen it i would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of <UNK> in that plot synopsis i just gave you every thing in it is true this is a movie about cross <UNK> and <UNK> a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner i'm sure that with a good screenplay and a good director it had neither that <UNK> or glenda despite the subject matter could have been a very moving picture it is a <UNK> movie on <UNK> part as he was a <UNK> in real life as well as on screen but once again that does not make it a good movie or a watchable one for that matter <UNK> or glenda is a <UNK> <UNK> mess of a movie that sinks into new <UNK> in the realm of bad cinema it makes no more sense than does its <UNK> silly scene where bela lugosi screams pull the string over inexplicable footage of <UNK> <UNK> the majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice reminding me of some very bad short informative films i've seen before it's like one of those really bad short films expanded into a <UNK> minute feature and twice as dull we sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes there is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many <UNK> minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens the only moments that are worth <UNK> time are those of bela lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark <UNK> i guess lugosi is supposed to be like the <UNK> of the film but personally i couldn't care less who or what he's supposed to be i'll tell you what he was a gifted actor who wound up making trash but he and wood were very good friends and liked working with each other so good for him br br i will always admire edward d wood jr for his passion for the cinema but i will never as long as i live admire his movies a film critic once called ed <UNK> movies innocent fun but i think even that is questionable innocent yes fun no sir and if citizen kane is the <UNK> <UNK> of the cinematic world then <UNK> or glenda is probably the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> well the movie is basically about the last days of a specific russian <UNK> <UNK> in before the main <UNK> <UNK> in 1985 the movie accurately portrays the grim realities of russian army that have made it infamous officers and <UNK> physically <UNK> beating and <UNK> younger <UNK> mixed character of war you can trade with your enemy one day and kill him the next life of women at the front lines documentary <UNK> of helicopter <UNK> and <UNK> being and sent home in <UNK> c <UNK> <UNK> class russian <UNK> planes with to jam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> boredom anti war sentiment emotional side simply put the there's some action scenes but they are poorly done and often are illogical like major <UNK> walk and turning of his back to 10 year old kid armed with <UNK> <UNK> who's father he just killed also the fact that in the middle of <UNK> in the mountains heavy <UNK> <UNK> pops out of nowhere and any half bright person knows that it's virtually impossible to <UNK> 40 50 <UNK> on the march anyone but at the same time films shows that war is a dirty affair where murder is sometimes <UNK> <UNK> destruction of whole <UNK> for little or no reason is normal <UNK> killing of civilians is overlooked as <UNK> damage inevitable during war some food for thought as to why <UNK> war as lost not the best war movie made but profound and intelligent enough to be worth watching
<START> i can't really criticize this film it is literally the first film i ever remember seeing and lead to a <UNK> love of science fiction and horror films and <UNK> animals fortunately seeing it again years later it held up fairly well rod cameron plays a big game hunter whose last <UNK> was wiped out by <UNK> no one believes him including his best friend played by <UNK> romero whose brother was among those killed and rod cameron was the only survivor the film was shot in india and has some good scenery the acting is on a high level i don't believe rod cameron <UNK> romero and marie <UNK> ever turned in a bad performance the <UNK> when they finally arrive are fairly effective the ending also has an unusual twist particularly for a 1950's science fiction film definitely worth seeing
<START> this a haunting piece of work its only ten minutes long but i would sooner pay ten bucks into the cinema to see this than to see any full <UNK> movie currently doing the rounds it is a simple piece of a man's reflection he arrived a young man in this place and was <UNK> by a room and the music coming from it and now here he sits dying in old age in this place he so <UNK> <UNK> to his youth the music in it is brilliant the <UNK> have that jazz room <UNK> like neil <UNK> music in dead man if you get the chance watch this film its worth it if <UNK> <UNK> made more films like this i think he would get more respect than he gets at the moment you hear him put under phrases like everybody's favourite psycho im sure that is not what <UNK> would want to be as an actor for he also directed this film so in this shows that he a very artistic actor director a change from the b grade movies he has been doing since the early 90's i hope to see more of this <UNK> <UNK> as he is one of my favourite actors
<START> another movie that makes the story of the beach boys worse than it is i especially remember the scene when brian says he's to quit <UNK> and the other boys calls him <UNK> i didn't happen like that and like the movie <UNK> in the beginning is that some scenes are over <UNK> a movie about the beach boys doesn't have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway the sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who ain't so familiar with the group hard core fans like myself knew that this isn't the entire true story and that's why i gave it a low rating 3 however it is the best movie about the beach boys i've seen so far that says quite a bit about the other movies if you want the truth i recommend the documentary endless harmony
<START> if you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values then <UNK> work for you big time in places sure of course it is and proud of it it is the biggest and best ride in the carnival and should be enjoyed as that br br big production values simple telling with creative shots it is not complex is a very nice and remarkably sweet film it really feels like a labor of love from bill paxton and i bet his son gets that br br the build up is slow enough to be enjoyed the conflicts <UNK> and the british vs americans handled with a degree of <UNK> <UNK> but the dignity between the two main <UNK> protagonists is always to the <UNK> i have minor <UNK> the score wants to be james <UNK> but is too overblown and there are too many close ups and <UNK> shots for 2005 but if you want a straightforward decent and good looking sports film then this is it br br so here's the thing and i feel like i know my film but i actually liked it more than which is a better film but greatest story is simply disney at its core and hugely enjoyable thanks bill
<START> i don't want to seem too much of a <UNK> but if the accidental death of a <UNK> by a time <UNK> caused such an enormous change in the <UNK> how could that be since the <UNK> would have been <UNK> by the blast of the <UNK> <UNK> anyway and how could time <UNK> keep going back to the same moments and not keep meeting up with their prior and later <UNK> who were also at those same few minutes in the <UNK> it seems there would have been quite a large crowd standing in front of that dinosaur <UNK> br br while i can accept the idea of a time wave i seriously doubt the wave would have caused only a few changes as the wave passed all changes that would have happened would have happened at once during the passage of that wave so scratch the idea of the city starting to become <UNK> with jungle and why jungle at all the location of the city would have still been at the <UNK> and it was before and would have had <UNK> appropriate to its <UNK> place on earth br br and an endless list of other illogical <UNK> br br this flick is a weird combination of some fairly decent production values and totally ridiculous plot holes and factual errors br br too bad a terrific story idea that was <UNK> up with silly science br br sigh why why why why why spend all that money on production and not even bother to <UNK> the screenplay to see if it made some sort of actual sense
<START> this film isn't supposed to be funny but it made me laugh br br it isn't designed to be sad but my heart felt heavy through a number of the vignettes br br it isn't written as action adventure but my pulse <UNK> more than once br br just like life this movie doesn't manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel it simply is and you react br br if you don't find it funny or sad or moving i suspect that says more about you than the film br br it amazing and refreshing to see a director so <UNK> celebrate that we are all human and embrace that we are all trapped here doing this life thing over and over for as long as we must br br tomorrow is another day
<START> i think one true thing is one of meryl finest movies to date her depiction of a dying woman is perfect i have recently lived this movie and it touched me on more levels than i could have imagined meryl is <UNK> the greatest actress to have ever walked the earth
<START> a sincere tribute to <UNK> parker who's just passed away not only is one of the <UNK> movies ever made but miss <UNK> performance is in this cheesy movie <UNK> opinion among the worst performances of all time her last scene is especially <UNK> i loved it
<START> though i saw this movie about 4 years ago long before i started commenting on imdb i decided to review it now which is unusual for me since before now i often reviewed something just after seeing it what can i say well the best performance is that of the late peter boyle as the title character who after finding out about a man's killing the drug dealing boyfriend of his daughter wants to bond with him even though he's a madison <UNK> executive who has nothing in common with the very lower class conservative joe in fact there are plenty of funny scenes of joe at this guy's party making smart <UNK> remarks there oh and it should be noted that the actress that plays the daughter who they're looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after on some drugs is none other than susan sarandon making her film debut this was a pretty hard hitting movie for the time it was made late '60s early '70s and was compelling work from <UNK> norman <UNK> later of saturday night fever and director john g later to do save the tiger rocky and the karate kid certainly the ending packs a <UNK> even today after all these years highly recommended for anyone curious about the <UNK> of that time p s among the cultural <UNK> seen here are a <UNK> ann doll a box of <UNK> <UNK> a bottle of <UNK> <UNK> and unique for the era a <UNK> poster asking would you buy a used car from this man
<START> i find it hard to believe that this movie has such a low rating it is arguably one of the best comedies ever made and surely the best bollywood comedy of the 90s the film did not do too well on the box office and people had <UNK> opposite reactions after seeing it my guess is most people didn't expect it to be an all out comedy and were expecting a regular movie if you love comedies this is a must see and <UNK> khan is outstanding
<START> this movie sucks the acting is worse than in the films we made when we were 10 years old with a camcorder the effects look like some 80's computer game and the plot is worse than terrible even the worst van damme movies make this look crappy the accent and speech rhythm of the <UNK> <UNK> is so bad it's funny br br i wouldn't recommend watching this unless you are a big time fan one of the actors 1 out of 10
<START> i get the feeling that lisa krueger is easy to overlook i personally found her first film <UNK> <UNK> and lo to be a wonderfully detailed character study and the performances were uniformly wonderful with special credit to mary kay place the film played for a week or two in major urban centers and <UNK> one or two critics really liked it but many viewed it as slight <UNK> second film committed was released this year 2000 after nearly two years of <UNK> and it similarly <UNK> and once again critics <UNK> the film as slight and pushed the film aside at most <UNK> heather <UNK> screen presence but rarely her acting ability and once again for me committed is a solid success i feel as if krueger has a genuine voice and a personal visual style and these are traits that shouldn't be so easily ignored simply because she works on a very restrained br br the title has several meanings but mostly it refers to graham 's <UNK> to let her husband carl luke wilson <UNK> out and leave her she follows him from new york to el <UNK> and becomes one of the most appealing <UNK> in recent cinematic history her respect for her marriage <UNK> leads her to mexican <UNK> and self discovery and yep the plot is just that simple and thus just that easy to ignore br br of course is the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate <UNK> fifty percent and for me her personal revolution against broken promises and a legacy of <UNK> is fairly intelligent and powerful confident in the belief that people just don't have enough faith in each other inevitably has to discover that her beliefs aren't in with those of society at large several comments her have referred to her character as one dimensional and i'm afraid that that's a simplistic reading of the film or perhaps even a <UNK> if were just an innocent she wouldn't be interesting at all it's the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of the <UNK> that makes her so interesting <UNK> she's a complete <UNK> br br krueger sometimes falls into moments of <UNK> dialogue and her direction of this film has a rather odd over <UNK> on shots of clouds moving across the el <UNK> <UNK> however her mistakes are fairly rare and in this film as in <UNK> and lo it's the performances that carry the day graham has never been better because she's never had a character as perfectly <UNK> to her as for the first time in her career graham seems comfortable playing an adult even one in slightly arrested development she carries the film perfectly luke wilson and <UNK> affleck as brother both have a number of fine moments as do <UNK> as a mexican <UNK> and mark <UNK> and t bo the slightly psychotic truck driver as in <UNK> and lo the characters are part of their <UNK> well detailed totally <UNK> creations these characters may sometimes seem <UNK> quirky but they make sense in their context even <UNK> <UNK> as an artist turned on by devotion fits in in some strange way even though his character's is never discussed br br for me this is a movie that <UNK> depth looking back another <UNK> here spoke of the stereotypical mexican portrayals and again i'm tempted to call that a <UNK> is looking for self justification she knows that her commitment is out of control but she's looking for any spiritual <UNK> that can help her make sense of herself character understands that most people don't believe in him and he plays up his own faith when he sees a woman who respects him br br i guess i can understand how this movie could be viewed as <UNK> i'd simply disagree it's consistently funny frequently hilarious and all of the characters <UNK> a warmth which is quite wonderful br br i'm giving this one a 7 5 10 and when i <UNK> in the vote here that'll go up to an 8
<START> i believe that this is a heart <UNK> film richard <UNK> directed the top <UNK> film superman had done a great job directing this film some of the were good and several were horrible because bobby was by the king baldwin and especially their dog <UNK> attacked the king which meant that he paid for what he had done to bobby br br <UNK> wood portrayed a good role in this film the memorable scene in this he <UNK> that he took the advice about bobby being <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pre soprano had portrayed an <UNK> role br br i give this film out of four
<START> <UNK> the legend of tarzan lord of the apes is based on the classic book tarzan of the apes by edgar rice <UNK> and is a more faithful adaptation to the classic book the film has some great scenery like the <UNK> of south africa to the <UNK> mansion the acting is also great <UNK> did a great performance as tarzan it was also his first english speaking role the film has some funny moments sad moments and touching moments that makes this a real classic br br the film sees a boat crashing in the <UNK> of south africa and some time later they have a son named john the apes go into the <UNK> and one of them kills the father the apes then take him to where they live and adopt him as one of their own as the years go by john grows up and learns to be more like the apes in his teens his foster mom gets attacked by native hunters and soon killed by them years later a group of people are going to africa on a expedition after setting up camp they're soon attacked by the natives most escape but <UNK> <UNK> is left behind injured by some of the <UNK> after hiding he meets john now an adult who takes him to his home and takes care of his wounds after a while <UNK> starts to teach john how to speak english and teach him that he's not one of the apes but a person when <UNK> goes to leave john goes with him after sometime they arrive at <UNK> <UNK> where the sixth earl of <UNK> is shown his long lost <UNK> john is shown his bedroom and picture of his true mom and dad john also meets jane porter and slowly as they get to know each other he begins to have feelings for her when it's christmas the sixth earl of <UNK> <UNK> down the stairs killing himself john then starts to miss the jungle and wants to return but <UNK> tells him to stay since everything they had done would be for nothing john is then torn between his life as a <UNK> and the lord of the apes br br <UNK> the legend of tarzan lord of the apes is a great classic that should be seen 10 10
<START> a superman cartoon br br when america <UNK> its <UNK> new <UNK> the an elite force of japanese spies <UNK> strikes stealing the <UNK> with <UNK> girl reporter lois lane aboard and the destination either tokyo or destruction it's time for superman to get involved br br this was another in the series of excellent cartoons initially created by max <UNK> for paramount studio they feature great animation and taut fast moving plots meant to be shown in movie theaters they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts bud <UNK> is the voice of superman joan alexander does the <UNK> for lois lane
<START> this movie was awful ashley rose <UNK> while a talented tap dancer and singer actually a little better than temple was in terms of the latter is a terrible actress she plays the character as the shirley that we saw on screen in her movies whether she's playing her <UNK> or <UNK> persona so what we get is an overly <UNK> and wholly unrealistic not to mention uninteresting portrait if one wants to see that side of her one can just rent one of her movies the only bright light here is connie portrayal of <UNK> temple i don't think it was terribly realistic but at least it was well acted save yourself the trouble and rent the poor little rich girl
<START> some aspects of this production are good such as the performances of angela lansbury george <UNK> and <UNK> but am i the only one who is distracted by the horrible performance by <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> she is terrible she the songs with her <UNK> voice and overacts in a role she clearly doesn't understand i also think the chorus isn't up to snuff they drag the <UNK> and make the worst facial expressions overall i think this production is okay but <UNK> todd can be so much more if done correctly this production doesn't come near the level this material demands the concert version with george and <UNK> is much better
<START> seeing the title of this movie stupid teenagers must die made me believe this was a spoof of some kind i discovered later on the original title was blood and guts both titles are misleading though this is not a spoof neither a serious splatter movie this is something in between failing in both areas a group of teenagers is attending a <UNK> at a spooky house and then the killing starts sounds over familiar doesn't it well this movies adds nothing whatsoever to the endless stream of similar movies and it is badly made because of the lack of light the entire film is grainy now this effect can be highly effective but it isn't in this case the young cast isn't acting too badly but the director has no clue as what to do with actors in numerous scenes the actors are clearly waiting for directions but these are given too late it could also be an <UNK> mistake of course the characters are unrealistic and the story line just stinks the sound is terrible at times conversations are <UNK> but when talking <UNK> or screaming the actors are very loud indeed br br this is not the worst horror movie i have ever seen but it still is a bad one for me a 3 out of 10
<START> i have read reviews of this film that found it and i am at a loss to understand why this should be so from the beginning i found it a remarkable experience and a complete joy to watch br br spoiler the opening titles <UNK> a beautiful visual of the <UNK> process and this introduces the story with a <UNK> and sweeping style the film isn't about the process itself though it concerns charles <UNK> struggle with his conscience his love for his wife his deceased daughter and his search for truth br br the appearances of his daughter are the <UNK> of a tormented mind that knows it has killed god the daughter is an adult making adult comments about his work and torturing <UNK> with personal doubts was he in some way responsible for her death husband and wife in real life paul <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> give truly wonderful performances as charles and emma <UNK> as does martha west as annie <UNK> size and awkward <UNK> give <UNK> character a genuine sense of reality whilst <UNK> seems very comfortable with her english accent and occasionally somewhat severe persona br br it's easy to <UNK> the times in which this film <UNK> the grip that religion had on society and the inner struggles that a man like <UNK> must have endured to seek the truth in what he witnessed science and religion have always been awkward <UNK> and although it didn't cost him his life as it did with so many earlier men and women science put a <UNK> between husband and wife fact and faith this film portrays that <UNK> <UNK> well br br i give creation ten stars because i think it's beautiful profound superbly well acted and a genuine no <UNK> <UNK> required look at one of the world's true geniuses br br what seems obvious to everyone today well almost everyone see bill <UNK> wonderful <UNK> was hidden for <UNK> the truth once it was discovered was undoubtedly painful for many creation <UNK> that pain and the <UNK> that we are all that we possess br br a wonderful cinematic experience
<START> i've just watched this with my three children boy boy and girl and this film was good old fashioned family action adventure although definitely aimed at the kid market i'd say 5 to 13 it was certainly watchable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a broad range of ages whilst still being suitable for the whole family to watch particularly younger children br br the story revolves around ricky a bit of a nerd with a vivid imagination this can definitely be seen in his <UNK> sequences who <UNK> a kidnapping and major art <UNK> while on on board a flight to washington for a school trip <UNK> dad is an airplane mechanic so ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft inside out but is also a top gun on his computer flight <UNK> this comes in handy when the pilot and co pilot are out cold through a series of <UNK> and there is no one left to fly the plane i don't want to give away any more of the plot
<START> i liked this movie the second <UNK> feature film i enjoyed the one in the snow a tad better though as i found the story here a bit disjointed as i was not sure where certain things were supposed to be happening or when still like the first film this one too has a nice run time to it of a hour and a half plenty of time for a nice well developed movie with some really cool fights the story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown <UNK> it then <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> and hunting down a <UNK> for what they think is going to be an easy assignment they soon find out otherwise as they are also attacked and <UNK> is separated from his friends after he has a fight with a strange young warrior clad in armor they both are injured and taken in by a <UNK> and soon after <UNK> is invited to join this strange organization that wishes to create a <UNK> of course all is not as it seems and there are plenty of fights to go around my favorite was the one involving fighting this strange woman who takes him very lightly which is a very big mistake the <UNK> fight is rather good too involving <UNK> and this strange man who is a better villain than any of those in the previous movie
<START> spin offs for somebody who don't know are not usually successful because most of the original characters are absent br br here they are and you couldn't ask for a better ensemble in what is essentially a silly little cartoon not meant to do anything but entertain br br j p replacing david spade does an admirable job of <UNK> ego and yet not seem as annoying as <UNK> character a character spade has done for decades and gets on one's nerves after a while he has a <UNK> voice but it fits somehow br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her part as is brilliant she hasn't really been given much <UNK> since her turn as batwoman centuries ago except maybe for her vile part in <UNK> it's funny how much the character looks like her though br br and patrick <UNK> there is no way that he can't be funny except when he was thoroughly wasted in men in black 2 i have been a fan of his since seinfeld but unlike that character he plays a genuine likable guy who is sucked into doing not so nice things br br the animation is really beautiful as all disney usually is but sometimes the character design is a little too <UNK> oh well two out of three ain't bad
<START> luc <UNK> first work is also his first <UNK> in science fiction a genre to which he will return <UNK> years later with the fifth element 1997 even if this film was strongly influenced by hollywood cinema it is still highly enjoyable back in 1983 le <UNK> combat reveals <UNK> own approach of science fiction he takes back a <UNK> topic and his efforts are discernible to make a stylish work shot in widescreen and black and white a disaster has destroyed virtually all the population from earth and we will never know what was this disaster and why men can't talk any more some barbarian <UNK> were formed in parallel a man pierre lives on his own and arrives in an <UNK> paris where he is received by a doctor jean br br there are no words in <UNK> work the characters' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures although the starting point and the backdrop are unnerving the film has never the look of a <UNK> one it seems that the man and the doctor try to <UNK> gestures and actions linked to mankind before the disaster the film opens with the man having sex with an doll later the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time it's all the more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from the <UNK> times following this reasoning one could argue that the <UNK> giant jean reno <UNK> evil and a threat to the efforts <UNK> by the man and the doctor to regain what finally made a human being <UNK> for the gang of baddies at the beginning of the film br br the <UNK> <UNK> that such a film could convey isn't really at the <UNK> and gives way to a <UNK> of hope personally the film could have gained with no music at all except the one the man can hear with his <UNK> <UNK> luc was to make better and still <UNK> films like this one he also <UNK> pierre career as a director who will leave a <UNK> work behind him in the future force 1989 simple 1991 ma <UNK> <UNK> 1999 or 2003
<START> why are there no good reviews because this film is hysterically bad br br set in a japanese prison camp in world war ii we have jim brown as the hero who puts up with a hysterically unbelievable racist officer and just as hysterical is the way the japanese officers brown nose jim <UNK> character br br this is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did stereotypes not only abound but they dominate this film the sixties seventies music may be the best thing about the film maybe because it has nothing to do with the film br br this is even difficult to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun this film is even more racist than the message of racism it tries to deliver and believe me i was alive in the seventies and we thought crap like this was just as stupid then it was never popular
<START> this bbc version of an agatha christie book shows the <UNK> of following a book too closely <UNK> books tend to move at a gentle sometimes even <UNK> pace and evans is one that certainly does it also has a solid school of red herrings to confuse the plot this version is extremely faithful to the book which results in a very slow involved story as a christie fan i gave it 7 stars but it takes 3 hours to make its way through a relatively action free story i appreciate some of the <UNK> of plots that the bbc did for its later christie productions much more br br in the end this movie is a <UNK> pleasure <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who brings considerable charisma to her role and plays off james <UNK> very well
<START> when i die someone will bury me and if they don't what's the difference who gives a damn huh thus the philosophy of life or lack there of is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spin off of sergio <UNK> dollars trilogy in the opening scene three obviously evil <UNK> ride into a western town and with menacing <UNK> they <UNK> all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes the <UNK> watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from <UNK> for a few dollars more there is one guy in eastwood's <UNK> one in lee van <UNK> black suit and one seeming to act like <UNK> marie but this movie is not about these guys no sooner do they ride into town when they are <UNK> down by someone even <UNK> than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the stranger br br no this is an altogether different story br br in an obvious <UNK> of <UNK> the good the bad and the ugly three <UNK> are again <UNK> for a hidden treasure once again there is the bounty hunter and the mexican <UNK> the stranger george hilton is a bounty hunter with a <UNK> for shooting people while dressed up like a priest he is after the reward for the <UNK> gilbert <UNK> but when gang steals three hundred thousand in gold <UNK> the stranger gets <UNK> from his normal line of work br br to round off the trio there is <UNK> <UNK> corrupt bank executive <UNK> he too wants the money for himself but after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot now the only clue to the hiding place is a <UNK> that shows a family <UNK> the game is too find the treasure before anyone else does and any gun can play br br with plenty of <UNK> fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala the good the bad and the ugly but with a twist br br this movie is not as good as <UNK> films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh this movie is fun 60s <UNK> spaghetti western style there are no rules no enduring <UNK> and no right or wrong just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it and though the movie is not classic the ending surely is hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a piece br br if you like spaghetti westerns check this one out it is fast furious and worth the look my name is <UNK> <UNK> from california
<START> horrible script which was apparently directed by no one the marines can't <UNK> off the monster with machine guns however it backs off when a 15 year old girl karate kicks it in the face a few times it's supposed to be a luxury liner but the fancy <UNK> room looks like a <UNK> in a hospital it appears that they rented a high school for the summer and pulled out <UNK> and stuff to <UNK> the set with in the end shot they are pulled from the water and into a boat and less than 3 seconds later they are apparently about two miles from the ship as it sinks how do movies like this get made i guess anyone can be in a film these days aaron james nyc
<START> i had the great pleasure of recently viewing this beautifully filmed wide screen adaption of the the 1943 stage revival which unlike the original <UNK> production which included extensive spoken this had been the fashion at the time so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition the film should be seen if only for sammy davis brilliant <UNK> performance as life <UNK> in and out of shadows his seduction of dorothy <UNK> there's a boat soon for new york is one of many highlights nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung it certainly never <UNK> which the recent <UNK> and met versions did it was a pleasure to see that time had not <UNK> the movie and hopefully it will be made available in the near future for the generations that haven't had a chance to experience it
<START> i think the romance of this movie helps couples develop a deeper appreciation for each other although i saw one goof in the early part of the movie it was fairly well done the plot can make you cry if you think about the situation enough i loved it watched it twice already and highly recommend it
<START> now being a fan of sci fi the trailer for this film looked a bit too how do i put it hollywood but after watching it i can gladly say it has impressed me greatly jude is a class actor and miss leigh pulls it off better than she did in <UNK> it brings films like the matrix 12 monkeys and the cell into mind which might not sound that appealing but it truly is one of the best films i have seen
<START> i have never seen this in the theater my second viewing was tonight on big screen dvd as opposed to old vhs tape from rental store br br for it's time and i'm sure the hayes code was pushed to it's limits br br <UNK> <UNK> here is the game play between two <UNK> and yes if guy calls the cops on bruno right away the movie is <UNK> min shorter hello people do you always make the best or most logical choice how many times have you been in either person's shoes and made the right choice for the love of god it's called poetic license however as guy sees the situation he has found himself in he takes it upon himself to <UNK> it he does not help nor does he lie to his would be new wife her defense of him sets off the final show down with bruno feeling he has one more card to play br br for the cop shot <UNK> an innocent person in pre <UNK> <UNK> days and before rules of engagement this type of thing did happen in the post rodney king world a presidential candidate backed the police in sending <UNK> bullets at an <UNK> man if you haven't seen or witnessed outrageous police behavior your blind or have an <UNK> <UNK> for the br br back to the movie br br go watch it with try and wear a post wwii <UNK> and pretend your seeing a great suspense movie like many did for the first time back then and sure it's been copied since but your looking at one of the source of inspiration for many that followed
<START> the actresses are cute and the sets while simple quite ok apart from this there is nothing to save from this movie incredibly bad acted dumb to tears dialogues all too expected plot a lot of goofs and inconsistencies for instance a pretty young girl gets hits in the head by a morning star and not only she survives but barely with a scratch to make it short because it does not worth more even the fans of the genre can avoid it
<START> there is nothing like an oscar <UNK> comedy and this movie is nothing like a comedy the melodrama <UNK> from scene to scene and the comedy is completely absent in the original story the humor comes from the americans who are oblivious to the ghostly traditions of chase the american father even offers some oil to the ghost to quiet the <UNK> chains read the book
<START> this is a hard film to rate while it truly deserves its 3 or perhaps even a two for an al <UNK> film it's exceptional and practically <UNK> very best that's because unlike many <UNK> films there are times when nurse <UNK> almost looks competent but being an <UNK> film you know that sooner or later that <UNK> must rear its ugly head br br the film begins with some bizarre cult leader of a huge <UNK> six trying to <UNK> a dead guy who looks like he's made of blue cheese however in the process the cult dude has a heart attack and it taken to the hospital he apparently dies but it also seems like many of these hospital scenes are missing and a few of them appear much later in the film in other words when you see the film he appears to have possibly <UNK> only to hear later that he'd died because the guy is the b f f of satan however his evil soul can't die and he comes back to both haunt one of his henchmen and to possess nurse <UNK> br br now <UNK> is obviously a very disturbed lady demonic possession or not at times she acts like a zombie and at others she's violently homicidal so i ask why didn't her boyfriend a doctor think this was perhaps <UNK> in other words after trying to kill a patient he neither gets an exorcist nor commits her to the <UNK> <UNK> oh and speaking of <UNK> this movie is not the breast filled sex romp its title and posters would indicate while there are a few bare breasts here and there they are irrelevant to the plot and only seen very briefly 1 2 second or so in all but one scene so if you are a <UNK> this movie is not for you though a few places in the film such as the nurse <UNK> for a patient make it look like the film might have at one time been designed as a porn flick br br if you are a bad movie fan however there is enough to <UNK> your <UNK> some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that aren't zombie like and i am not even talking about <UNK> especially noticeable is one of the very final scenes i have never seen and heard some stilted acting and dialog in my life and this includes ed <UNK> films there are also a few more cheap touches such as the bad animation of the green stuff the doctor finding a murdered nurse yet continuing to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood i'd get a cop better yet an army of cops br br so despite these problems why do i think it's good for an <UNK> film well the story isn't all bad and he was able to build tension very well many false <UNK> early on made my heart race a bit also the car crash while irrelevant came off pretty well and was practically big budget for <UNK> br br overall not a good film and one most people would be bored watching however fans of <UNK> or inept films will like it it does deliver some entertainment in a cheesy manner that will provide a few laughs
<START> as previously stated in one of my great reviews the universal of flash gordon should not be classified with the other serials for indeed the three of these have made a sort of celluloid electronic mythology for a <UNK> war <UNK> mid <UNK> century world they stand alone in many <UNK> minds as the example of just what a cliff <UNK> was br br we can recall seeing buster as a guest on <UNK> late night talk show tomorrow <UNK> by tom <UNK> this was circa 1979 80 during the interview mr <UNK> was asked about his personal <UNK> <UNK> he credited weight training and swimming coupled with some sound <UNK> which included and <UNK> and would you believe it he <UNK> several <UNK> br br when <UNK> about his career mr <UNK> of course got to the subject of his portrayal and strong <UNK> with the character of flash buster stated that he had read and enjoyed the feature in its original medium that is a comic strip the property of <UNK> king features <UNK> he stated that he had thought that it would not work once transferred to the screen luckily he was wrong br br as for the 1st serial it was a very good adaption of the original continuity from the sunday color comics the world is about to end because of impending <UNK> with planet it's up to independent working dr to rocket to the wild planet to change its course he <UNK> the aid of flash and miss <UNK> <UNK> newly <UNK> from <UNK> landing in property br br the serial has excitement through out and manages to make one feel that there is always some other peril lurking just outside the film frame the <UNK> and <UNK> is varied from to oriental to art it would be easy to <UNK> that this was due to on the part of universal but once again this was being faithful to creator <UNK> alex visual concepts just look at the old <UNK> as <UNK> in many <UNK> the rockets were used before in just imagine fox 1930 a science fiction musical comedy the other scientific lab equipment was provided by <UNK> prop <UNK> being the top hollywood company doing horror and scifi br br the cast features jean rogers <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> princess aura who get into a good girl vs bad girl battle over flash charles <UNK> portrays emperor <UNK> in a sort of overly melodramatic villain but makes it work frank shannon is toned down from the sheer madness that he suffered in his appearance in by the way ever wonder how has a <UNK> richard alexander makes a fine <UNK> built prince ever helpful and so noble br br comic actor jack tiny is the surprise of the cast stealing scene after scene as a <UNK> henry <UNK> like <UNK> turned ally king <UNK> of the among the others most notable is jim pierce as prince of the lion men pierce like <UNK> had also portrayed tarzan in a film but he later married tarzan creator edgar rice daughter joan br br flash gordon and the two sequels flash <UNK> trip to mars 1938 and flash gordon <UNK> the universe 1940 have been a <UNK> juvenile fare for generations first in the movie houses then in television release like fine wine they seen to get better with age br br we're all so glad that mr <UNK> was wrong
<START> 1989 is an emmy award winning six part miniseries out of the uk which was the inspiration for the oscar winning traffic 2000 the five hour film breaks down the <UNK> heroine trade for the viewer from the of <UNK> <UNK> in an afghanistan field to the head rush of a <UNK> in a flat in england not only does offer entertainment value through dramatic stories it also provides an <UNK> of the international drug trade at all levels answering the who where how and why questions of the age old and <UNK> <UNK> supply demand machine entertaining and educational will prove to be time well spent for teens and up a
<START> and that's a <UNK> shame please make the sun rise and have it <UNK> all copies of dracula 3000 this must be the worst vampire flick of the new millennium so far i haven't seen reign in darkness yet but they don't get much worse than this don't be fooled be the movie's cool h r cover this is so bad it's almost hilarious i can't describe all the emotions this movie <UNK> i laughed my ass off i <UNK> at the screen i sat there <UNK> <UNK> my head in disbelief this film has <UNK> written all over it the best thing of this movie are the opening credits and the opening shots which feature more or less okay cgi of two space ships but when casper van voice over comes on you start <UNK> something <UNK> and indeed it all goes downhill rapidly after that br br the crew of a salvage spaceship finds an abandoned <UNK> the which seems to be heading for earth they enter it thus <UNK> their fate this movie is above all things a shameless low budget alien rip off mixed with vampires right down to the plot twist were erika <UNK> character <UNK> reveals she's a robot <UNK> goes badly over the top as the <UNK> smoking <UNK> code from the hood as a name casper van character's named capt van <UNK> <UNK> and he looks like er well casper van <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as capt former commander of the is only shown on a <UNK> screen and he really does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto cue poor <UNK> what where you doing in this flick and then we have <UNK> as count one of the most pathetic and laughable <UNK> ever to <UNK> grace the silver screen just look at his outfit instead of some cool looking futuristic black suit or something he's wearing a cheap old school halloween suit with <UNK> you thought richard was unconvincing as dracula in van <UNK> then wait until you see performance br br the set <UNK> went overboard on this one the interior of the looks like a cross between an oil <UNK> and an old steel factory which they <UNK> with awful lights and colors like green pink blue and yellow the prop master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000 because the characters use guns which look like today's 45 and <UNK> uses a non <UNK> non floating wheelchair it has to be pushed around in order to move br br aside from one <UNK> up corpse a few <UNK> and one <UNK> there's absolutely no gore and the vampire <UNK> and contact <UNK> look fake as hell add to that also the most lame stupid and abrupt ending ever <UNK> and <UNK> are the only survivors instead of having one final bloody showdown with count they lock themselves in the control room then <UNK> explains that before her program was <UNK> and joining <UNK> she used to be a 3 2 <UNK> in other words a pleasure <UNK> so she says well then what are you waiting for <UNK> answers ain't gotta tell me twice come on girl picks her up and the ship explodes and credits roll no sex scene no erika her <UNK> no bloody climax just one more shot of <UNK> <UNK> reading a line on the <UNK> and it's over br br so this movie is a must see for every bad movie lover but i must warn them it gets really painful at times and everyone claiming that van <UNK> underworld or even queen of the damned is the worst vampire movie of the new millennium clearly is insane or just hasn't seen dracula 3000 yet
<START> carlos <UNK> is not funny from his stand up <UNK> to this train wreck of a tv series carlos <UNK> is not funny i have been trying to convince people for two years that he steals other <UNK> jokes and as far as his comedy material goes he is a regular johnny come lately with far less than sub par results psycho astronaut jokes britney spears breakdown jokes i hope this is only a <UNK> error but come on carlos and comedy central those topics and many others have run the gamut of late night tv show opening monologues saturday night live mad tv and many many others <UNK> ethnic and racial stereotypes comedy stands no chance of <UNK> with carlos <UNK> around perhaps people especially viewers and comedy central executives will get the point since this <UNK> issue of new york magazine accurately labeled him carlos <UNK> <UNK> joke
<START> i gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by far the worst movie i've ever seen in my life this movie was made in 2003 and i've seen movies made in the 60's with better special effects i wish i could go into detail but words can't describe how crappy this movie was i could have done better with a home video camera and 20 i pray that chuck norris never makes a movie again now if you think i'm <UNK> this movie because it has a christian theme you're wrong i like the fact that <UNK> chuck decided to make a movie that at least attempted to make god look good but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer through such a crappy movie this whole film can be summed up in 3 words re damn <UNK>
<START> this miniseries movie was so terrible at times that i nearly broke down and turned it off i am a great fan of the novel however this movie suffers from <UNK> of problems the <UNK> is poor and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are <UNK> the <UNK> from the novel are poorly chosen significant nuances are missed or <UNK> br br
<START> the movie is about a day in the life of a woman who is going insane to show that she is mentally ill she overacts a lot and the narrator tells us she's going mad along the way she goes out with a fat guy who looks like he could be orson welles' brother and he later takes a <UNK> off a building in one of the only interesting moments in the movie br br this is a strange little film that is very cheaply made and it sure shows the film was shot without sound probably using <UNK> or some other cheap type of film and had some sound effects and an overbearing narration added later in fact the narration was the most <UNK> and unintentionally hilarious i have ever heard and it is said in such a silly and over the top manner you'd just have to hear it to believe it as a result of these cost cutting actions it's not surprising that the film is bad though the idea of trying to make this sort of film was pretty original plus it's very hard to make it through the entire film
<START> i loved <UNK> in the <UNK> it happens to be my favorite book <UNK> the author of <UNK> has the rights to the book and made it so not one person can make a movie about it with his <UNK> br br with that said <UNK> united states of <UNK> beautiful movie with much meaning and depth in emotion but a lot of it reminded me of <UNK> almost too much reminded me of <UNK> the few stories that <UNK> told in the movie such as visiting new york and his adventures were very similar to those of <UNK> in <UNK> and the way <UNK> views people and emotions is also similar to <UNK> they both are simple and true to themselves and others superior acting credited to don cheadle and kevin <UNK> great editing all falls together perfectly and loved the story all together recommend as a buy or at least a rent good movie br br the only thing that it does drag at some points but makes up for it in the long run give it time and appreciate a good movie
<START> this movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a christian environment and learned that appearance is everything she and her son who just recently returned from vietnam <UNK> in some very tense issues the relationship has no connections <UNK> and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues kathy bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty <UNK> or just doesn't want to be confronted <UNK> wrath is never feared and it leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers love for him this is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads one to despair
<START> when i heard the film was to be released and the theme of what it was about i felt very curious but when i saw it was the biggest deception of my life technically speaking the sound is poor you can tell about man dialogs that were remade on studio that are poorly achieved in the final mix of all the photography is mediocre some part of the films show some soldiers with night vision <UNK> and the way the cinematographer achieves that dark night is by <UNK> everything like if they were in an actual military base with lights there's no reference used of the <UNK> my god but not least most of the <UNK> are really poor it's totally not believable the roll of the wife of one of the soldier her performance it's pretty poor br br great disappointing shame of the jury who chose to send this movie to represent <UNK> on the oscars
<START> this is a pretty run of the mill family move that i am sure most children will enjoy but with really no that much to please any adults viewing the movie the premise of the film is that <UNK> cop character takes his retirement but gets drawn into a case which results in him becoming a private investigator the movie's plot is so obvious most of the kids will surely pick the ending before it happens but additionally to that there seem to be story <UNK> and sub plots that are forgotten about as the movie progresses this coupled with a sub plot where the titular k 9 gets <UNK> out by belushi one to be avoided i am afraid
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is not my favorite jane austen novel but it has its charms this movie doesn't it has some of the same character names as the book but the story is drastically altered and the <UNK> man in the whole austen <UNK> unless <UNK> mr knightley gets pride of place is made out to be a heartless and <UNK> creep one or two totally <UNK> characters are introduced and a <UNK> air of <UNK> <UNK> hangs over it all i was so disappointed when i first saw it on its release in 1986 even today it ranks high on the list of films that disgrace the books on which they're based even robert hardy fans should give this one a wide <UNK> it has nothing and i mean n o t h i n g to recommend it
<START> despite this production having received a number of poor reviews it actually holds up quite well for its age note also that it is not a bbc programme it was simply <UNK> to them by <UNK> when the jane austen collection was released on dvd br br so how does it compare with other adaptations of the same novel the most well known version these days is the 1995 film with amanda root as anne elliott and <UNK> <UNK> as captain <UNK> <UNK> that film was of course shorter but a good <UNK> of the story the earlier version with ann and bryan marshall in the same roles had four hours to tell the story and moved at a more <UNK> pace br br is a good ten years too old for her role but she is very good marshall is excellent as <UNK> a man disappointed in love and bitter about <UNK> and hidden in the cast are people who also contribute michael <UNK> later seen in as richard <UNK> later seen in the <UNK> guide to the galaxy as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> earlier in <UNK> street as mrs <UNK> br br one criticism i do have is that the <UNK> are a bit distracting and that the costumes are awful still this shouldn't detract from a hugely enjoyable austen adaptation
<START> a nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by doctor <UNK> she is upset to learn that the doctor has died leaving his assistant doctor masters in charge she is <UNK> by the inmates including a crazy judge a shell shocked vietnam vet a <UNK> and a creepy <UNK> but is soon <UNK> by a <UNK> black man sam she needs all the friends she can get as people are dying all around her don't look in the basement is my first horror film of s f despite its low budget it manages to provide some genuine chills plus a nice amount of cheap gore including a particularly nasty scene with a desk through an <UNK> the climax of inmates taking control over mental asylum is an intense <UNK> of wild camera work gore and <UNK> screams 8 out of 10
<START> tank girl was i suppose meant to be the <UNK> <UNK> of the 90's and was <UNK> as such the comparison is admittedly appropriate both movies have so many things going on in any given frame of film that as impossible as the story is to sort out it certainly isn't boring br br tank girl is a fun enough ride if you turn your brain off before the movie starts otherwise you'll end up with a skull cracking headache like me
<START> <UNK> the big risk is repeatedly recommended every time i look up a jean pierre <UNK> film that i had to give it a watch as soon as possible since i've been discovering <UNK> and seemingly working backwards through his filmography it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films but it was made in 1960 by claude <UNK> before <UNK> would come and stake his claim on french neo noir br br <UNK> has two of the best lead men of the time <UNK> <UNK> and jean paul <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> a gangster <UNK> in italy with his wife and two kids who wants to come back to paris because the police are closing in on him after a roaring and fast paced opening with a big surprise <UNK> eventually gets hooked up with eric stark <UNK> who wants to get into the criminal underworld stark becomes <UNK> and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on <UNK> after everything he's done and been through the film shows the the <UNK> of the two men the older <UNK> at the end of his time after tragedy strikes him and the younger eric starting off the same way <UNK> did falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her man despite the world they are a part of it never ends pretty for them or their loved ones its one thing to see a individual criminal come to his demise its different when he has loved ones he risks taking down with him br br much like <UNK> film the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along as usual as what i feel with <UNK> films it left my head spinning in a good way and dying to re watch it again to pick up what i missed the first time <UNK> is a definite keeper
<START> if you enjoyed films like pulp fiction <UNK> dogs and lock stock and two smoking <UNK> you are going to love two hands it has the same type of black humor beat to it and will keep you entertained through the whole film like pulp fiction it has the wacky scenarios that the characters get into and how they deal with them along with <UNK> and <UNK> at hanging rock this has to be one of the best australian films i've seen it also stars a young heath ledger before he got real big in the states br br this is a terribly underrated movie that i believe is just as good as pulp fiction and those <UNK> you have to see it
<START> <UNK> as a sort of <UNK> between waiting for <UNK> and a mighty wind best in show portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their <UNK> friends to participate some are weird some crazy and otherwise but they all make the movie good director christopher guest is particularly funny as gay <UNK> pepper very much trying to promote his dog eugene levy parker posey michael catherine o'hara and bob <UNK> also do great jobs i can't imagine them not doing great jobs at least not in a christopher guest movie as someone who's never attended a dog show this movie is my main exposure to them they sure look neat
<START> norris plays a chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice who wants to well create he eventually kills the creature by get this throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike not very sharp about twenty feet hard enough to <UNK> the chest unlikely so is the rest of the movie much of it consists of <UNK> and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense the israeli or arab kid is there ostensibly to <UNK> <UNK> ok doesn't work makes no sense and advances the plot so called not one bit also no cops ever every get invited out of the country to be interviewed by other cops it is ridiculous as a premise the whole thing is bad unfortunately it's not so bad as to be <UNK> bad or campy just plain bad but one can see how norris was trying to find his way to the successful walker texas ranger series
<START> despite its <UNK> the most interesting things about this series are not the <UNK> or <UNK> which while charming are little more than <UNK> at least in the story i saw a story short in fact <UNK> though i am to admit it the chief pleasure lies in that most ancient art storytelling br br john hurt in <UNK> mode grotesque medieval make up relates a story about story telling <UNK> by the fire accompanied by a cynical dog one <UNK> day starving and poor he spots a fellow <UNK> thrown out of the royal kitchen by the nasty cook the story <UNK> tricks this latter into giving them an excellent soup furious the cook <UNK> with the king for <UNK> to <UNK> the villain but pleased with the story wit the <UNK> offers him a <UNK> for 100 nights he must tell the king a new story if he fails to do so he will hand him over to the cook br br the story may be old but it's told with great gusto anthony script is excellently dramatic as <UNK> a playwright witty and with some disturbing concerns beneath the fun such as fears for the self or the <UNK> self <UNK> power of storytelling linked to the <UNK> of <UNK> power for a programme aimed at children it is self <UNK> with little nonsense about film being the new <UNK> culture despite the <UNK> style there is a charming sense of medieval <UNK> its and <UNK> terror as well as its magic and power
<START> its obvious <UNK> <UNK> whenever knight is in the news but did they have to make a <UNK> movie about him this was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie i have ever seen it had it all terrible acting terrible dialogue ridiculous casting cheap sets etc etc it looked like it was shot on a 10 budget whats up with the game scenes were they in a middle school gym and the lighting well let me just say it was ridiculous and brian as bob knight give me a break looked like in a red <UNK> nothing more <UNK> lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt they <UNK> millions of in advertising then the <UNK> was a huge <UNK> bob knight is not a subject that can be covered in a 2 hour movie <UNK> blew it even knight himself thought it was more stupid than anything else
<START> the setup for nature of the beast is <UNK> simple and <UNK> with <UNK> potential for suspense <UNK> salesman jack a very <UNK> lance <UNK> picks up trouble in the form of <UNK> adrian eric roberts who seems to be in possession of <UNK> information against jack oh and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed man' is <UNK> people in the desert sounds great right sort of like the <UNK> meets psycho one or both of these men has a secret and nothing is as it seems well unfortunately writer director victor <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> fame doesn't have enough ideas to keep the movie going the scenario <UNK> no tension or suspense poison for what is supposedly a <UNK> and the inclusion of an underlying <UNK> erotic tone seems out of place <UNK> evokes an unusual not quite <UNK> <UNK> even sporting an ample gut but roberts is about as threatening and scary as an extra in death wish 3 we're never sucked in to the point where we actually care about what's happening and the conclusion <UNK> into improbable territory i kept thinking it was going to be fight club all over again but i was mistaken too bad nature of the beast could have been something else instead of nothing else
<START> for a long time i a fan of the <UNK> tv series refused to watch head because it was not about the tv show characters who were warm and wonderful head instead was said to be a cynical dark movie finally curiosity caused me to cave in i didn't of course find a new episode to the tv show but a fascinating movie that appeals to my dark side br br i have always been fascinated by dreams and head was very much like watching someone else's dream with <UNK> hints of stories and a small detail at the end of one scene causing the film to <UNK> off in a new direction very much in a <UNK> stream of consciousness manner the unfinished stories really make my imagination run wild time and time again br br the film also features very striking beautiful cinematography the epitome being the black on white white on black look of <UNK> song the music is haunting especially the lush <UNK> of the song the song is the favorite song of my dark side while my bright side prefers <UNK> a dee doo <UNK> br br in the end i think the tv series could have used some of head 's drama intrigue and intensity but head could have used some of the tv show's warmth humor and friendship
<START> <UNK> ii is one of those pictures which makes you ask <UNK> ' as in <UNK> was it <UNK> ' <UNK> was it made ' and <UNK> was it released into the public <UNK> ' br br to say the least it's a bad film it serves little purpose but to <UNK> how superior its prequel was by setting an almost identical set of characters against each other in a similar storyline as a <UNK> <UNK> land <UNK> attempts to buy out the golf course <UNK> br br right off the bat making the follow up a whole 8 years after the original is somewhat bizarre i mean if your going to cash in on highly successful picture such as the first one then you have a window of a few years to do so but leaving it 8 years means that the formula is hardly fresh enough to simply do a follow up or poor imitation as this is so your sort of <UNK> to reward fans of the original by giving them at least reference to if not indeed actual <UNK> by the actors who made the first one so memorable but there's little if any of this br br instead we get cheap <UNK> okay the passing of ted knight in the <UNK> years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable judge but robert <UNK> inclusion as <UNK> a fellow <UNK> <UNK> akin to the character is unimaginative and seriously lacking in the sort of <UNK> frustration that made <UNK> turn so watchable jackie <UNK> is a feeble attempt at <UNK> the non stop <UNK> delivered by the al rodney <UNK> character of the first while <UNK> role was endlessly <UNK> <UNK> is completely forgettable br br bill <UNK> laughably ridiculous <UNK> and his war of with the <UNK> local <UNK> is <UNK> for his <UNK> co star dan <UNK> role as the <UNK> tom who's high pitched voice just <UNK> your sides with frustration as opposed to the intended laughter br br randy quaid brilliant as cousin ed in the national <UNK> vacation series is quite the opposite here playing unstable lawyer the looks of disbelief shown by the actor's looking on at <UNK> character's intended to be hilarious acts of inappropriate violence echo that of the audience your not laughing your just asking <UNK> the hell is he doing ' br br chevy chase shows up all be it occasionally and wisely rather <UNK> considering the disaster that's <UNK> itself around him as club pro in the films only direct reference to the original not <UNK> the golf course itself that is with his deeply <UNK> skin and loud <UNK> shirts chase looks like he's just got back from a lengthy summer vacation and needs a paycheck he <UNK> himself from the events in the actual picture enough that he takes little of the blame and leaves with some all be it little credibility still intact br br jessica as <UNK> daughter takes over from the role of the original as teenager struggling against class <UNK> sounds ridiculous doesn't it at least in the first danny an irish catholic from a blue collar family and his laughable attempts to make <UNK> into the white <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dominated world of the golf club <UNK> and <UNK> was played out to some memorable set pieces such as being <UNK> by the resident bishop as well as being <UNK> by the <UNK> of the local <UNK> club embarrassment of her father's inability to fit in is hinted at being because of his jewish roots that aside it may also have to do with him being a <UNK> moron but such are swept aside though i stopped caring long before they were resolved at the end of the day <UNK> was trying to get ahead in life miss biggest problem is getting the <UNK> at the local golf club to like her multi millionaire father so that she can get a date with the <UNK> <UNK> white kid or so i gathered br br anyway in <UNK> its poorly written badly scripted with lame set pieces and wastes a lot of talent indeed kudos if you were able to sit through it to it's conclusion it really is a <UNK> there is that question mark though of why did so many of the original actors not return as opposed to being replaced by performers who on paper at least looked their equals maybe they just weren't asked or perhaps i suspect they actually read the script stick to the original
<START> i recently had the idea to make a short film featuring a man who is hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he himself is chuck norris this meant that i would have to do extensive chuck research and find out as much as i could about the man i later find out that he is not in fact a man but an angel sent from heaven with a face like that who could ever doubt it i have watched more chuck norris movies in the last four months than any one person should i am proud to say that <UNK> of innocence ranks pretty close to the top of the all time worst list i spent most of the film wondering if i could return my copy to the local wal mart without the <UNK> which i had been biting down on to keep myself from <UNK> my own tongue the biggest reason why i chose to purchase this film was that it not only had chuck in it but his son mike i was anxious to see if mike was a chip off the old can't act his way out of a wet paper bag block i came to the conclusion a long while ago the chuck norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for one simple reason the only character he ever plays is himself chuck norris no matter what movie no matter what situation he is always chuck norris the one thing that he holds over his son is that he is consistent mike doesn't seem to understand how human emotions work in the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter he seems to be extremely happy maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter out into traffic as depicted in one of the <UNK> flashbacks of all time his actions confused me throughout the film making it very hard for me to focus on what little plot there was the other two lead actors were just as painful to watch as the son of norris the guy who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid <UNK> joke was simply one of the most annoying characters that has ever <UNK> the direct to video screen the only thing i remember him being in other than this movie was an episode of walker texas ranger in which he plays an equally annoying character maybe chuck owes this guy something the other guy which is the only name i can think of because he was so forgettable was your average christian fanatic i don't have anything against christians in fact i am one but this guy was just too much for me to round out the story you have a <UNK> of <UNK> who love to call people friend and a couple of villains who don't seem to be able to decide which one of them is in charge not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of creepy kids in movies all in all the movie is possibly one of the biggest failures of all time on more levels than chuck norris can kick people's <UNK> despite being one of the worst actors of all time i still can't get enough of chuck maybe he really was sent from heaven
<START> in this follow up to the naked civil servant we see the final years of quentin life in new york john hurt is again crisp come on who else could play the part and its a role he <UNK> to the point of disappearing for me hurt is crisp and i've always found it very hard to take the man himself because hurt was more him than he was himself its masterful performance his equal is denis <UNK> as phillip steele long time friend and <UNK> br br unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it to be certain the film gets the details right filmed in and around new york the film the film looks and feels like new york and its <UNK> but dramatically its kind of <UNK> its crisp talking to people being witty trying to come to terms with the world as it is he ended up <UNK> some poorly chosen words concerning aids and dealing with the that old aged thrust upon him quentin the man is always interesting but his life as portrayed is really not br br i am disappointed by the film i've always admired the man and his unique point of view i just wish he was better served by this film about his life
<START> seems to have been made as a vehicle for w c fields and carol <UNK> and they dominate it fields already has his film character well developed carol <UNK> seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of mary pickford who also worked a long time under d w griffith typical of later griffith films technically br br later remade as <UNK> the original title with fields in the same role
<START> there is no <UNK> in this movie br br i watched this movie specifically because imdb lists <UNK> as one of the languages used but imdb is mistaken about the languages used in this film there is absolutely no <UNK> at all it's almost all english with a couple of words of <UNK> do not watch this film if you're looking for <UNK> movies other <UNK> instead are delight with clark gable which has a bit of <UNK> <UNK> is all <UNK> although completely <UNK> and there are some <UNK> street signs in charlie <UNK> the great dictator there was supposed to be some spoken <UNK> in <UNK> as well but i never heard any br br aside from that the other reviewer is right this movie is a complete mess br br spend your time elsewhere
<START> maureen o'hara is always beautiful and appealing here she plays an actress <UNK> ill we don't know with what it is a bit of a <UNK> to love story in that respect br br william <UNK> is good as is most of the supporting cast john payne is meant to be <UNK> but he seems to <UNK> the girl who plays the child he and o'hara <UNK> does her best with a contrived plot device of course adopt an orphan she will live on after the passing of your wife it's a sweet movie but it doesn't feel sincere i was hoping to be moved i was by <UNK> gentle performance but i don't like to feel manipulated
<START> this should have <UNK> <UNK> moved away from the traditional <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> celine <UNK> etc that had made the 2003 show so stale sadly the move <UNK> the show had no <UNK> keeping the show together queen <UNK> did a fantastic show at the 2003 <UNK> the show kicked of with a horrific rendition of lady <UNK> featuring <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jessica simpson okay in the studio with some control they can all sound great br br however when they are competing with each other why it just sounds <UNK> jessica simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings that i've ever witnessed <UNK> <UNK> also performed girl just wanna have fun that wasn't as bad but it was hardly impressive the worst was yet to come <UNK> and <UNK> teamed up to perform hit <UNK> after <UNK> it was <UNK> and didn't fit in with the rest of the show still it could've been okay if they both hadn't insisted on <UNK> like animals it was just dire br br debbie harry from <UNK> is always cool she has a style of her own and although maybe she can't compete <UNK> with a many of the <UNK> although she certainly can sing very well debbie came out and performed <UNK> 1 hit <UNK> with some lovely <UNK> she really hit the notes perfectly she looked stunning <UNK> eve provided a new but sadly inferior rap it was good <UNK> next performance was a team up with newcomer <UNK> stone they performed the <UNK> hit <UNK> way or i think <UNK> misunderstood the style of the song and just <UNK> over debbie a rather sad bit was when debbie tried and failed to match her style which spoiled it a bit she should've just let <UNK> get on with her totally inappropriate the whole of <UNK> performed this track the final track debbie performed was <UNK> massive hit <UNK> it was pretty poor not <UNK> fault because you just couldn't hear her the sound was atrocious all the way through the show br br <UNK> stone also performed a few songs on her own they were quite well done <UNK> also showed up to perform two inexplicable cover versions firstly she did diana <UNK> <UNK> coming <UNK> and then <UNK> she is not a <UNK> she can sing to an extent but she has no presence whatsoever why not just get the real singers in was even interviewed on the show br br <UNK> knight showed up and did a <UNK> it was very good she was probably the best bit of the show i don't know much about her other than she is a seasoned performer in las vegas and her experience and class really <UNK> through <UNK> <UNK> in another performance this time her 80's hit <UNK> it was the finale and it was okay but it was too little to late this was one big dud better luck next time <UNK> br br the version i saw was a heavily edited version which was shown on <UNK> in the uk if these were the best bits

<START> at the first glance of this film the camera angles immediately make you think that this is a low budget film that will bore you to tears or make you press the stop button surprisingly the storyline comes forward and is played through the screen in a way that i feel most would relate to i scored this movie at 7 but like most would felt it should be a 10 you will understand as you watch it because its a rare thing for a film to be in touch with a persons feelings and how life should be shown by a tv set most films try to leave you in awe of their special effects twists and turns etc this film dealt a true hand showed a good film backed by an <UNK> style storyline that most would feel was a good waste of a couple of hours wish i had put the popcorn maker on after all well done
<START> just once i would like to see work given to a decent screenwriter director and producer just once br br this is a good attempt by jean <UNK> and chris sarandon and an even better attempt by victoria <UNK> but everything else is pure <UNK> garbage the screenwriter should be shot for <UNK> work this way and the director please br br the story is a well written story but the screenplay is quite dull unbelievable and horribly executed the only elements which work are the performances by <UNK> sarandon and <UNK> br br on a personal note i really wanted this to work i adore novels but they have never given them the attention backing and talent they deserve if they put the same money into work that they <UNK> by the <UNK> full into king's <UNK> would quickly rise above but alas without powerful people who believe in his work i fear he will never get the chance br br as an adaptation to the novel this movie was a total suck fest as a stand alone movie it wasn't that bad though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible stiff <UNK> dialog which never should have made it to the final cut this movie failed miserably to live up to its potential had they followed the original work by <UNK> a bit more closely and invested a decent amount of production money this could have been a far better <UNK> br br however all i can manage to see in this is how good it could have been and wasn't br br it rates a 4 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> <UNK> man was i pleased i didn't miss this i wanted to post this review as this episode in particular does what a certain recent movie did not it pays true homage to the game doom its plot is different yes and the characters are obviously set in an entirely different universe obviously the doctor who universe however the feel the pace the references and the location are perfect and for all original doom fans listen out for the door opening and closing sound effect it was the <UNK> on the cake for me br br please all doctor who and doom fans alike check this one out its a gem
<START> realistic master piece thirty years later the pictures can look a bit old but actually it only accurate the in the <UNK> effect of the movie i never saw in my whole life a film like this one first time i saw it i didn't know if it was a fiction and it didn't looked like that movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see it's the best ever society critical movie the ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down and the system has not change a lot in thirty years i think this movie would have to be watched as an education piece
<START> charlie <UNK> war based on a true story tells the tale of a texas <UNK> and a cia agent working to secure funding for <UNK> support of the in 1980s afghanistan following the <UNK> invasion of the country this conflict played a major role in the final years of the cold war between the us and the <UNK> br br in terms of film making charlie <UNK> war is a definite winner it well written well acted and well shot while most of the attention has gone to tom hanks for yet another fine performance i was even more impressed with philip seymour <UNK> turn as cia <UNK> <UNK> scenes of soviet attacks on under armed <UNK> and of the <UNK> camp effectively <UNK> at the heart the film also gives a good behind the scenes look at the <UNK> and dealing that <UNK> wilson must go through to secure the desired funding br br there are however two complaints i have about the film the first is that there is a subplot involving an scandal investigation that is not well developed and as such only serves as a minor distraction to the story line the second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war the film makes the look like innocent victims and while they did suffer large <UNK> <UNK> the were in fact rebels trying to <UNK> the government of afghanistan this government ignored entirely in the film not surprisingly fought to <UNK> the rebellion later calling on the soviet union for support in their effort the film also ignores that the us was <UNK> the prior to the soviet <UNK> in afghanistan the film did hint at the <UNK> consequences of our <UNK> actions consequences we are still feeling today but it seems as if screenwriter aaron and director mike <UNK> were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative not having read the book i do not know if george made the same compromise those complaints notwithstanding i did enjoy watching charlie <UNK> war and do recommend it i would have preferred a film that more accurately depicted the <UNK> of the situation as stephen <UNK> did in <UNK> but the audiences connected better with cohesive narrative of charlie <UNK> war than with the <UNK> present in <UNK>
<START> when i see a movie i usually seek entertainment but of course if i know what genre the move is then i will seek what it is meant to do for example if it is a deep film i expect the film to thoughts up in my <UNK> and make me <UNK> what it is saying but who's that girl is not a deep film but it is entertaining nonetheless it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts i've watched it when i was younger the cast is always entertaining as usual i had a small crush on <UNK> dunne even though he wasn't the typical male <UNK> at the time <UNK> morris also stars and late <UNK> actress <UNK> <UNK> is here too overall a delight
<START> hope the summary line won't <UNK> you that much it's a little homage to the show charlie murphy but also to the character but i'll try to put all the things i liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything i didn't like in another paragraph so it will be easier to read br br let's start with the good things the quote strong bloody violence which is used by rating boards to describe the content of a movie does fit here very well this is not a movie for kids or for the faint of hearted it has blade as a central character wesley snipes is phenomenal and a crazy enough story thread to hold justify the action scenes the original idea is also very engaging and intelligent the action scenes are great here too br br ok over to the things i didn't like the overall story is too thin it's enough as i've written above to hold the action scenes together but there could be more and a character like blade deserves more imo the drama <UNK> isn't the best also it's use of clichés doesn't help some characters are <UNK> that's that o
<START> a big waste of time is all you'll get out of this bag i rented this hoping for a suspenseful movie with maybe a few believable scenes but boy was i ever <UNK> i think the title should've been camping 101 or something to that effect well anyway stay the hell away from this film it <UNK> you to death don't be afraid of big foot be afraid of this crap
<START> when a <UNK> a <UNK> a <UNK> and a mad biker together with various other forms of social <UNK> have had enough of their sh <UNK> cell they spot a rat and look for the hole escaping from the <UNK> the group of 9 souls take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization what soon follows is not surprising complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake it seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of br br loosely based on the great escape 9 souls is by far in the top 5 best films i've seen this year running at right around 2 hours 9 souls will deliver a story so powerful it'll literally leave you breathless the beautiful yet subtle use of the rolling country sides adds the realism that is expected from this story the vision of director blue spring porno star is completely mind <UNK> as he <UNK> a sense of pity towards the characters as quickly as each character <UNK> their dream it's as quick as it's torn from them now all responsibility of the success of this film should not fall solely on the shoulders of the director yet props must go to the actors as well this film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom <UNK> <UNK> the son of <UNK> of audition delivers a stellar performance and seems to bring some of his mothers <UNK> to the screen br br i must give props to dvd as well this is the <UNK> film of theirs i've seen now and they seem to get better and better each dvd the sound quality is perfect and the picture clean and crisp it's very annoying trying to watch a film that is too dark in transfer so the <UNK> from <UNK> cats are nice br br bottom line is this film will soon receive masterpiece status by <UNK> world wide keep an eye out in 2005 for 9 souls it's really amazing film to watch
<START> although i liked this western i do have to say it's not one of my favourite john ford westerns for me it just lacks a certain something that most of his other films the ones i have seen anyway possess i'm <UNK> sure what that something is it's not something <UNK> anyway the <UNK> of the story is about a mormon <UNK> train which is being used by a band of <UNK> as a <UNK> from a pursuing <UNK> ford employs a lot of his <UNK> here there are some interesting characters some nice scenery a bit of action and excitement it all adds up to a watchable experience it's certainly not boring just not quite up to the usual john ford standard for me <UNK> master is a 7 10
<START> in short this movie was awful br br i understand it's a disney movie which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting however i must say this is the worst of all disney movies with bad acting lots of irritating <UNK> teen girls my god and an extremely unrealistic plot even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie the only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store br br do yourself a favor and change the channel before watching this no matter how bored you are on a sunday afternoon
<START> creation is a great example of how not to make a movie first there was a book written with a great humor book that has numerous fans who would be happy to supply help when producers for some reasons decided to employ people who hardly heard of the book in the first place then came a script as <UNK> and full of nonsense as possible at the same time the script was written in a way to allow only those who actually had read the books to understand anything of the plot not that anything in this movie made much sense anyway ex i'm like an ice <UNK> you can burn yourself said as a word of warning warning that logic is something this movie seriously lacks to add to that we have to mention that no matter the amount of money that was supposedly spent on the movie everything looks like an amateur production with two 2 computer effects one of which is a see through dragon even the costumes look as if the were borrowed from a really poor theater that is the better ones look this way and to add to that we have a few <UNK> <UNK> put there only so they will be in the film because they have no explanation in what one may mercifully call plot the movie has only one strength that can hardly make up for the rest music is not bad though if i was to choose i'd prefer to have it <UNK> it sounds better if you don't have to look at this failure of super production
<START> hilarious clean light hearted and quote worthy what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie ever since i was a little girl i've <UNK> of <UNK> a blue van with flames and an observation bubble br br the cliché characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen <UNK> harold and andy <UNK> make up most of my favorite parts of the movie and who didn't love the hopeless <UNK> of don't forget the airport antics of <UNK> <UNK> dressed up as <UNK> dancing <UNK> and playing the <UNK> <UNK> the clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless br br a word to the wise if you didn't watch this film when you were little it probably won't win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do you've gotta play
<START> not only was this film <UNK> but it took me back down memory lane with its true to life sound track these were the things we were saying and doing these were the songs we were listening to all during this same time period in the same era way down south in <UNK> i may not have been one of the <UNK> set but i was definitely one of the <UNK> sitting on the <UNK> with the old radio listening to neil young watching those more brave than i ever hoped to be as they put the spin on their <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> the tricks of and adams hoping that maybe just maybe for a brief moment they'd adopt the style it just goes to show how much alike we all were during those wonderful days
<START> this movie gives a cinematic example of the word worthless it's awful you can forget plot or decent acting cause it's not there and with the <UNK> of any decent story or acting or even the <UNK> of being frightening then there is usually only one plus left for a horror film the appeal to those who like soft core porn this film doesn't even have that the women show a little skin but not really anymore than say the <UNK> show except for the main star who is not particularly attractive and has a couple of poor and i mean poor sex scenes so in short if you like good movies you have no interest in this film if you like cheese you still don't have any reason to rent this film if you like <UNK> and soft core porn you really have no motive to rent this film and most importantly if you value your time in the slightest you cannot do better than to avoid this movie
<START> the good news the director is reportedly committed to the cause of <UNK> international and eager to deliver a solid message about the freedom of expression and the evil of <UNK> the plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favourites the not so good news <UNK> is not everybody's when visiting the movies or video stores also noted critics like mr <UNK> and roger ebert have <UNK> the film as a genuinely failed attempt to <UNK> a play from stage into cinematic form if i remember correctly the title is taken from the fairy tale <UNK> character has written and which has made her a possible <UNK> and suspect person in the <UNK> place where the story takes place her dreams are dangerous to the government represented here by <UNK> as the intense manipulative <UNK> since those two people are virtually the only ones appearing in the film altogether the director is in for a real challenge in keeping the viewer's attention in the end i found the whole thing fascinating not flawless and definitely not for everyone but rewarding it's nowhere near a masterpiece like <UNK> 'a short film about or as <UNK> as <UNK> man but if you're into those films or any of <UNK> <UNK> political thrillers you may appreciate this one as well just don't expect any <UNK> or action sequences
<START> the fire gives all br br this is one of film's most masterful <UNK> on artistry set in 19th century korea it tells the story of the famous painter but rather than stick to <UNK> <UNK> melodrama or psychological egg hunting it portrays a series of episodes throughout his life all of which are beautiful works of art in themselves it gives no interpretation of these episodes but leaves them for the viewer to <UNK> along with the paintings of himself in this way the viewer enters into the same sort of <UNK> as and minus his talent can feel their way into the inspiration of his paintings br br part of why this is so effective is the utterly masterful <UNK> of 19th century korea and the musical artistic world that moved in there are so many gorgeous shots of the world outside the paintings that we get a mirror effect where we see the beautiful world inspiring living and looking in that world and the works of art he creates all <UNK> off one another br br the story is told with extreme economy a feeling <UNK> is hardly ever <UNK> with or explained it just appears quickly then is gone for the next one to appear as an <UNK> it is a sort of work of art endless and quick succession of great ideas rather than obsessive lingering on one great idea it has a classical restraint much like paintings there is really no music <UNK> how to feel except a few classical korean pieces used with great <UNK> in several scenes and mostly played by characters in the movie one haunting image if i remember correctly is of a flock of birds <UNK> away over the blue mountains while a female singer <UNK> br br this life is like a dream and only death will <UNK> us br br one telling line of advice in the film from one of teachers is that the painting lies between the <UNK> the film follows that attitude as there is so much matter between what is spoken and described in the film i have seen it twice and it was very rewarding on the second viewing a very <UNK> film with little in the way of explanation one could see how it is film it is an artistic <UNK> like great friend and mentor tells him in describing one of his paintings not a single stroke is wasted br br i compare it to <UNK> in quality though in style it is very different it is much easier and more directly entertaining to watch but classical in form where <UNK> is gothic br br all in all highly recommended to almost anyone except <UNK> <UNK> both times i left the film i felt a wonderful spiritual <UNK> br br one point of life that me was that his mad drinking and raving began suddenly after visiting the noble who told him that good art can come only from great knowledge and learning the next brief scene was very angry and the next <UNK> drunk as he often remained for the remainder of the film i am curious why the <UNK> words <UNK> him so much and drove him to the drinking that dominated the rest of his life or was it just a coincidence
<START> this movie is terrible it was so difficult to believe that katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity chinese people the movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove that and the rest of the plot didn't make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense br br the plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can <UNK> from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother the most annoying character i have seen for a long time br br the acting and scenery were ok but the plot ruins everything full of cheap clichés and <UNK> scenes i expect not to see this movie again in my life skip this one
<START> being somewhat an independent filmmaker myself i really understand what these guys were trying to do and it sounds like a good idea on paper on <UNK> film however it's awful i didn't realize the thing was made in the mid 90's because the film was so grainy and bad i would have <UNK> this was one of those 30 year old flicks where a porn producer tried to go mainstream and the sound ugh i don't know what kind of <UNK> they were using to record but it sounds like someone is walking over dead leaves throughout the entire thing i guess i shouldn't judge too <UNK> after all how many feature films has my company put out none but i'd like to think that we'd at least have good picture and sound quality to go with our poor acting writing and directing a for idea f for execution
<START> i was first introduced to john waters films by seeing female trouble on <UNK> i was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it then i picked up the pink <UNK> dvd in the john waters <UNK> set the movie is about <UNK> johnson the <UNK> person alive who lives in a trailer in <UNK> with her <UNK> egg obsessed mother and her deranged son <UNK> in the movie you will see such sick sights as sex with <UNK> drag queens people eating <UNK> torture and all other sorts of random <UNK> the film has a soundtrack from 60's rock and roll artists the only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and can get a little boring i found female trouble a little more fun rated <UNK> 17 for explicit sex violence and disturbing images enjoy
<START> how do these guys keep going they're about 50 years old each and act as if they're only 30 they play 3 hours of music at every concert and barely break a sweat this dvd is their first concert in <UNK> brazil although the people don't speak english they try to <UNK> the words to the most famous rush songs and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends br br from tom <UNK> to the spirit of radio this concert dvd will keep you in the chair not wanting to pause or move away from the classics that you've listened to when you were young this is their <UNK> reunion tour started in 1974 i went to their <UNK> <UNK> concert and this was just as good although in <UNK> they didn't play so i was upset br br they have they have the trees they have the pass driven red <UNK> a <UNK> roll the bones and much more 10 out of 10 because nothing else <UNK> if you never go to a rush concert then at least buy this dvd
<START> this is an excellent film but <UNK> <UNK> other big budget film is much better i would recommend people go to see <UNK> and then if they like that see this film the film is shot in black and white which i was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen it is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever elements of the storyline i think are a bit <UNK> but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing to the film has a clever plot clever twists and turns very good acting and bearing in mind the budget of the film i have to say that it is pretty amazing
<START> i just saw this film in austin texas at the austin gay and lesbian film festival and it was my festival favorite the <UNK> is a film not to be missed it is an honest coming to terms story about relationships self discovery growing older and having the courage to change and move forward not only is this a good story but the glorious performances by <UNK> and will take your breath away see this film it will be coming soon to a festival near you this film deserved to be picked up right away by a major network or studio i will certainly purchase this when it becomes available on dvd
<START> having been born and raised in <UNK> and having <UNK> from the other high school in the late 70's <UNK> high school i had mixed emotions about this movie i no longer live in <UNK> but will always be a <UNK> at heart i didn't like the way that this town of 80 000 plus was portrayed as a dirt poor small town if i'm wrong about this please feel free to correct me but i believe <UNK> also plays in the town stadium and the home of the <UNK> sign that was shown at the stadium used to be at the practice field at i would have liked to have seen a little <UNK> about the cross town rivalry of the big game in town every year <UNK> vs i am curious why the outcome of the game was altered though i think it would have been just as dramatic if the real outcome was portrayed overall the movie was okay made me a little <UNK> remembering the good old days of <UNK>
<START> words cannot describe how horrible this movie is well maybe they can i'll take a stab at it 1 pitiful hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics apparently script and storyline aren't needed anymore br br 2 violent kids movie but yet one of the characters is <UNK> attacked and killed br br 3 blatantly stupid the movie is actually depicting the farm animals as having human abilities in <UNK> the fish could talk but for the most part they are still fish we only hear the english as a translation in <UNK> the animals are actually speaking english that other people can understand br br 4 <UNK> no smart story line or even any smart humor ok the 13 year old dog on <UNK> was funny br br 5 <UNK> <UNK> the black cow is actually played by a black actress the pink cow is played by a white actress the black cow was playing a stereotypical black person br br 6 ignorant no such thing as a male cow that i'm aware of i believe we call them <UNK> if we are going to expose our children to <UNK> it might as well have the <UNK> facts correct br br 7 boring and my 4 year old had us leave after 45 minutes he practically fell asleep br br i'm sure this movie will make millions which is unfortunate because it only proves to hollywood producers that the american public at large is just filled with <UNK> waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two an unfortunate <UNK> why should the producers spend real money when the returns will be the same either way
<START> the <UNK> mixed with haunting music make one spectacular show the costumes are vibrant and the performances will just <UNK> your mind simply amazing
<START> i caught this on local mexican television at 2 00 a m and i decided to give it a chance since it's based on a real life case that deals with the murder of the typical all american family a dad a mom and a young son br br on the beginning the hints point to walker to be the murderer as he had strong differences with his father shortly after when walker and luke are taken to the <UNK> <UNK> to being examined by the lies <UNK> machine things turn out to be very different br br also when walker and luke attend to an <UNK> with their father's lawyer they learn that luke would receive 200 000 and walker is out of the <UNK> luke immediately buys a <UNK> br br anyways this is an excellent mystery movie that deals with betrayal ambition feelings and cold very cold blood br br i know the real names were changed but still the experience is the same give this movie a try i know there are hundreds of based on real murders or events of the like but this one is truly worthy pure quality on acting direction and plot
<START> after learning that her sister susan is <UNK> divorce kate decides to travel to the <UNK> woman's remote country home and spend some time with her when kate arrives however susan is nowhere in sight that's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a <UNK> in the basement as a storm <UNK> outside kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger the killer is still on the premises in her first post <UNK> vehicle elizabeth <UNK> gives a solid dramatic performance <UNK> <UNK> is based on a short story by tale was first brought to television in <UNK> as an episode of boris <UNK> thriller anthology series thriller stuck very closely to the story which is kind of a pity for it could have used a little <UNK> up granted wrote a moderately creepy number but gerard creator of the one step beyond show adds several clever ingredients that <UNK> the tension and suspense
<START> christopher <UNK> directorial debut is a memorable one the film was very well received and help land <UNK> for making and quite rightfully so br br following is an exquisite example of how films should be made no fancy effects or blood dripping gore just brilliant writing and good acting nolan manages to <UNK> us once again with his writing the actors all <UNK> to me and i suppose most people did a good job bringing the characters to live they were all believable and that's all they need to be the film is confusing because it plays with <UNK> a lot but it's very rewarding in the end the film's a little short to be a full length feature but any additional length would've ruined the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing would've been <UNK> though short the film has every aspect that makes a film attractive imo an intriguing beginning an exciting middle and a surprising end br br i dare say following is almost as good as <UNK> his best film by far the <UNK> <UNK> is equally masterful used in both films the amazing plot twists are present and the acting is very good br br this film was made with a mere <UNK> but the quality is much higher than most almost all million dollar box office hits the use of b w may be a hard <UNK> to swallow for the big audience following is primarily nolan showing off his skills to the studio bosses and what skills they are rarely have i enjoyed writing so much as in even <UNK> doesn't even come close imo though it's also very good br br this is a film surely not to be missed by any self <UNK> movie lover if you liked <UNK> is definitely for you
<START> <UNK> yes the <UNK> show was a great not only did many women get in shape but many teenage boys got a great <UNK> as well i am not saying that the show was in any way not appropriate for family viewing but if you check the other works from the shows producer you will find more adult themes in his works which are also excellent many of the viewers looked forward to the show men and women alike all gained good information and a wonderful release from the <UNK> the girls were perfect and beautiful the show is a classic and should do well in <UNK> the show should still be on as there are never enough choices to view when it comes to health and beauty
<START> there are other movies about <UNK> schools and the antics of the students and staff but the <UNK> of st towers above them all the plot has been thoroughly <UNK> by other posters so i won't cover the same ground i just want to say that it's a shame that it's finally out on dvd but in a format that can't be used in the u s br br enjoy fellow fans in new zealand and australia and if anyone reading this has any pull in such matters please help get it released on dvd with region 1 also is it possible to be <UNK> via e mail when i won't say if it is released on dvd in the united states thanks
<START> one of my favorite movies of all time beautifully done well written and well acted it portrayed 20 something blacks in a way i don't think has yet been <UNK> and the dialog <UNK> so stimulating makes me want to find love like that
<START> rarely have i seen an action suspense movie that was so boring none of the action scenes are exciting the story line is nothing special and except for a couple of actors the acting is bad charlie sheen platoon major league stars as the white house chief of staff who gets himself in the middle of a conspiracy that wants him and more people dead donald sutherland a time to kill fallen plays a friend who he tells everything he can and linda hamilton linda hamilton terminator <UNK> peak plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation charlie sheen is ok as the star donald sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance linda hamilton gives a poor performance with a bad movie i can actually like it if it has a good ending but this movie has a very cheesy ending with some almost laughable stuff
<START> this is the second adaptation of charlotte armstrong by claude <UNK> for the screen the first was la <UNK> 1970 from novel the balloon man and it's really a pity no one cares about it it's <UNK> sleeper and i urge any of his fans to see it br br the chocolate <UNK> was not that strong a detective story to begin with i read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it the movie promises some good things at first though then finally disappoints to a fault this is a confusing <UNK> movie mixing elements of the <UNK> circa 1969 and a <UNK> tongue in chick stuff coming from the eighties the likes of <UNK> not one particularly memorable work br br part of the disappointment comes from the cast this is a <UNK> poor gathering jacques plays like a zombie isabelle <UNK> reveals herself a somewhat limited actress finally rather vulgar it worked in <UNK> <UNK> de femme it does not here they are not supported by the young couple both are bland and <UNK> actors from the past say <UNK> or michel <UNK> both in la <UNK> were brilliant and contributed to <UNK> then unique atmosphere br br the story itself is <UNK> beginning as some kind of serious la <UNK> <UNK> un long besides a character hints at <UNK> very funny movie the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards we will not <UNK> the young female <UNK> who after all she learned about her wicked <UNK> agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road br br because he makes too many movies <UNK> frequently releases <UNK> one wonder why people who wants to watch one of his movies should choose this one among all his stuff up for grabs br br it seems that <UNK> <UNK> satire has finally given way to <UNK> in la <UNK> the first armstrong adaptation an average detective story which <UNK> completely <UNK> you should hear say they have so much money here <UNK> has lost his bite his strength
<START> i remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in <UNK> california in october 1976 while driving the tourist laden city streets we saw a movie <UNK> advertising alice in wonderland <UNK> so before even checking out version of the lewis <UNK> classic a half mile away our curiosity won out and we <UNK> into this cinematic <UNK> i remember even before the movie began how surprised i was to see this kind of film appearing in <UNK> ultra conservative orange county br br thirty two years later i came across alice in wonderland at a local video store i wondered to myself if this was the same film until i looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of lovely <UNK> <UNK> in the starring role and decided to <UNK> some fond memories <UNK> video to their credit has released two versions x and <UNK> in the same package as it turns out the version my friend and i saw in <UNK> was rated x in spite of the original <UNK> advertising at the there seeing it the second time around makes me realize what a delightful romp director bud <UNK> brought to the screen as an example of this man's scope behind the camera in his <UNK> days he directed two episodes of tv's death valley days br br miss <UNK> appearing in the april 1976 cover of playboy is ideal as alice she brings a fresh all american innocence to the role as a <UNK> in her early <UNK> yearning for a better life when her boyfriend is <UNK> from taking their relationship to the next level alice reaches her turning point this is a <UNK> yet the <UNK> are quite catchy with appropriate strings and <UNK> to <UNK> the generally suggestive lyrics miss <UNK> has a pleasant singing voice as she about wanting to be free that's when the magic begins the pacing of this movie is surprisingly fluid given the genre and the supporting cast of wonderland are there to <UNK> alice as she <UNK> into <UNK> special mention goes to tv veteran larry as the white rabbit who seems to be the only character not obsessed with sex as he is always running late for an or something br br special features include comments from noted feminist <UNK> lena <UNK> who <UNK> how viewing this movie while attending college influenced her in choosing a career as an adult film actress after <UNK> br br what makes alice in wonderland such a delightful is its garden like setting partly filmed in the lush natural <UNK> of <UNK> b c 's stanley park the movie <UNK> its pornographic roots you don't come away feeling you've watched a sleazy skin flick at this writing i haven't viewed the triple <UNK> version the extra sex footage tacked on afterward would in all <UNK> <UNK> the overall flow and remove the light <UNK> atmosphere evident throughout br br naturally the lewis <UNK> version is the best way to <UNK> up and explore <UNK> adventures in wonderland however for a time capsule representing <UNK> adult film <UNK> alice in wonderland is worth following that white rabbit for a <UNK> ride full of mayhem
<START> <UNK> is back wit a gem he manages to capture the mental trauma of a small girl searching 4 her mother they way he goes about showing the problems in <UNK> is a treat <UNK> movie is a must watch the musical score does enhance the viewing pleasure <UNK> a find of has given some great tunes the lyrics r apt 4 the movie the locations used for the movie are very good and makes viewing pleasant the movie starts of in a light manner moves over to capture the feelings of the girl finally goes on o shed light into the life of people in war torn places across the world this is yet another classic from
<START> i usually like movies about animals or <UNK> turning against the mean old humans who <UNK> their environment but i have to say snake island was a major letdown br br the premise is interesting a group of people including a writer <UNK> played by william <UNK> goes to an island called duh you guessed it snake island and what the island lives up to it's name that is one thing i will give this movie there are snakes lots and lots of snakes of all <UNK> and kinds so that part of the movie in fairness lives up to its name but the writing acting and directing is <UNK> lame it is almost painful to sit through br br the characters are so unlikeable i was begging for the snakes to finish these horrible people off to put us all out of our misery there are a couple of scenes that are so surreal and ridiculous they have be seen to be believed snakes <UNK> to really horrible disco music while 2 women dance together and a scene with a snake holding some inane dialogue with one of the actors it's beyond absurd i think the writer was trying to be funny but this just came off like some weird <UNK> trip br br i remember william <UNK> years ago back when he starred in carrie what a hunk he was not that he was ever a major star but to be reduced to this garbage i feel for him br br avoid this movie like the plague unless you are really into movies that feature lots and lots of snakes and really horrible humans
<START> i am a big fan of this film and found the tv mini series children of the dust the version fans should look for at least 20 minutes or more are cut on the dvd version of this film br br i would also suggest viewers who enjoyed this film to check out the book there is a more rounded storyline with <UNK> and rachel more on black history and buffalo <UNK> there were two many <UNK> for the series or this film br br sidney <UNK> only shows he gets better with age the talent just keeps growing the chemistry between his character of gypsy smith and <UNK> taylor were wonderful viewing i also enjoyed the billy <UNK> joanna going storyline they seems to play off each other well br br billy <UNK> is of course the model of indian vision the look the attitude the dream of every woman who was wanted to be carried off in one of those romance novels by a native hero worked for me also br br much more could have been done with this storyline but it did give the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems back in the <UNK> white take over of native <UNK> lack of black <UNK> to setup towns in the west michael <UNK> <UNK> as always a great actor comes across as a very caring and confused teacher not sure if the whites should be <UNK> with native culture br br for anyone who enjoys characters and watching them change this film is for you i thought the chemistry between <UNK> character and that of the orphan very moving and thought <UNK> and <UNK> worked very well together billy <UNK> did some of his best scenes when working with <UNK> br br going got on my nerves sometimes when you want to just stop and shake her or give her a wake up and grown up call but on the whole it was a great evening of entertainment br br look for the two tape version of this mini series if you are a fan you will really see the difference
<START> but it is also and <UNK> too yes the grumpy captain may not look like pete but it is mickey and <UNK> are the best characters both of them are very sweet and likable interestingly <UNK> is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and mickey is less than <UNK> in this than he is now pete is still the same old <UNK> but he looks a bit different br br in this famous episode on board a little <UNK> mickey <UNK> and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of <UNK> even in their first appearances the three main characters are very developed br br i quite like this episode although overall i prefer the mickey mouse in the future i like the animation the <UNK> and music theme the clever gags and of course mickey and <UNK> br br like many early cartoons this is very random walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to gear it along there is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary these are the things i do not like about it br br another interesting thing about this episode that a colour version has not been made for it or if it has i've never heard about it br br anyone who just enjoys mickey mouse and disney will enjoy this
<START> some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story david lynch takes 2 and a half hours to piece together scenes with clues and his trademark <UNK> but there's never a story no plot no progression of the characters unless you find revealed <UNK> a progression it <UNK> me how anyone can call lynch's garbage art but if beauty rests in the eye of the <UNK> so be it lynch's movie and tv work in the 1980's came off as avant garde and alternative fine 20 years later work like <UNK> drive comes off as a 2 5 hour david lynch masturbation piece it's <UNK> i've finally seen the movie that takes my top spot as the worst ever at least the people <UNK> out godzilla and <UNK> weren't passing them off as art
<START> the contemporary chapter of the u s <UNK> elite underwater <UNK> team is called to do whatever they want apparently br br charlie sheen was made an officer already the storyline is unbelievable michael <UNK> is his immediate c o but he keeps charlie on a rather long <UNK> and one of the guys pays for it early on by getting killed thanks to charlie's <UNK> stupidity the rest of the team spends their spare time committing <UNK> martial <UNK> mostly an exercise in random <UNK> and paper thin <UNK> these particular <UNK> might be better suited to serving as crash test <UNK> br br some good action scenes counter the goofy proceedings
<START> although this starts out <UNK> a woman in a car is <UNK> around dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man holding a lizard this gave me the impression that we were going to see something special something almost david <UNK> if there is such a term but unfortunately the film starts to go <UNK> not having a core center just sort of meandering story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town the character study goes all over the place and i couldn't really care for any of the characters it seems especially when some of the story all of a sudden goes into flashback mode i had some hopes for this movie but all in all it was a bit of a letdown
<START> first of all this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to <UNK> it since i myself did not understand this horrible story further the unknown cast <UNK> by an actress called laura is simply awful the expressions and screams of the character sara <UNK> are laughable and ridiculous confusing <UNK> with acting last but not the least there are many <UNK> reviews about this flick in imdb as follows br br top notch can't wait to see more of the directors work  the author has only one review in imdb on 24 september 2004 br br incredibly shot amazingly intense  the author has only one review in imdb on 12 august 2004 br br not your typical blood and gore in fact better 7 10  the author has only one review in imdb on 13 <UNK> 2005 br br as intense as asian horror the author has only one review in imdb on 14 november 2004 br br coincidence or are they the parents relatives friends or people hired by the production to promote this crap my vote is three br br title brazil 11 11  a <UNK> 11 11  the new prophecy
<START> the only reason i watched this is because of its stars <UNK> van <UNK> micheal <UNK> eric roberts catherine <UNK> <UNK> all capable actors have given good performances in the past not this time a weak serial killer story you can guess who the killer is in the first scene very contrived in all aspects there is nothing to recommend in this disaster my rating is 1 2 poor
<START> everyone knows the so called plot so let me cut to the chase br br forced <UNK> miscast performers working hard to have fun so you can have fun the brilliant meryl streep gives it a great try pierce brosnan just plain embarrassing inexplicably set on a greek island lots of <UNK> <UNK> women lots br br it was a silly <UNK> box musical on stage now it's a big <UNK> poorly shot screen <UNK> box musical if you like <UNK> so so if not an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you're left with when you exit the theater i readily admit that i didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did but for the love of god why does my gender <UNK> and <UNK> to convey delight ever sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are absolutely determined to have great night out on the town that's the feeling of this whole project it just felt so good when it stopped
<START> oh man they sure knew how to make them back then hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making cardboard steel and the god <UNK> scientist action hero br br this film was so close to a masterpiece alas it was not to be as it failed to feature ray guns and <UNK> from the moon the mst3k version tried to fix this by adding a pilot of a show called captain cody where a guy with a rocket <UNK> jacket fights bad make up people from the moon but it didn't quite add up br br also the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as i expected them to be all in all a great disappointment
<START> don't get me wrong i enjoy art house movies low budget flicks character studies and foreign movies unfortunately i couldn't enjoy this one <UNK> pacing complete lack of plot and characters that you can't dislike enough to hate but you can't tolerate enough to like br br for me distant was like watching the cutting room floor footage of a reality show all of the scenes which were deemed too uninteresting which would normally not make the final cut were the only scenes included a camera in my apartment with two of my friends <UNK> around for hours does not an interesting movie make br br distant certainly makes the watcher feel that way long stretches of no dialogue nearly 10 minutes before the first word is spoken from the credits can be made to work 2001 comes to mind but for me something else compelling needs to happen to draw me in br br if you're the kind of watcher who can sit through a movie and be content with movie analysis perhaps it will work for you however if you're somebody who chooses to watch movies to relax expand your mind or be entertained you should probably look elsewhere
<START> a <UNK> and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist catherine <UNK> jennifer lopez who is desperately <UNK> by two fbi agents peter novak vince vaughn and gordon <UNK> jake <UNK> to use her therapy on carl vincent a serial killer who uses strange and horrifying torture tactics is found in a coma by the <UNK> what novak wants in return from <UNK> is <UNK> of latest victim is and if she's alive once <UNK> gets into mind which has the <UNK> and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of david lynch's <UNK> or blue <UNK> and wes craven's a nightmare on elm street the adventure begins <UNK> sees a variety of odd people ranging from carl as a <UNK> an adorable jake thomas to a freddy krueger like man minus the razor <UNK> i don't want to give away the ending but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances howard <UNK> creepy musical score and directing by who shows here that he can direct
<START> i have tried watching this show on several different occasions and each time found it to be utterly pale of humor br br the reason to mention one thing is that it is solely based on <UNK> anything the <UNK> have done in short it is basically <UNK> party political opinions <UNK> as humor br br all mr stewart does is <UNK> about anything the <UNK> have done and the audience <UNK> themselves in <UNK> of forced laughter br br my guess is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate <UNK> br br <UNK> br br br br my faith http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie has to rank with welcome to the jungle and the <UNK> and dream <UNK> for sheer god awfulness you've got the most irritating heroine in gore history who spends most of her time <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> all the time in the most horrendous rest stop toilet ever put on film why she spends so much time in this ghastly bathroom from hell is never explained even when the usual killer truck driver is trying to murder her she refuses to leave the <UNK> when a motorcycle cop comes to her rescue the killer truck driver runs over the <UNK> legs while the heroine just looks on instead of grabbing his gun for protection she drags the poor <UNK> into the <UNK> and locks the door then the cop orders her to blow his brains out because of the pain she does so while <UNK> and <UNK> and and blows the back of his head off then the cop still alive beg her to shoot him again because he's still in pain he says this while the entire back of his head is all over the floor the <UNK> <UNK> heroine shoots him again the movie goes on and on like this none of it making any sense the heroine is so <UNK> you really want the killer to off her early on i saw this flick on the sci fi channel so it didn't cost me anything to watch but still i did watch out of sheer fascination as to how a movie could end up so terribly bad
<START> derek <UNK> has shown us time and time again that dialog is not his strong suit he is a painter and paint he does his films are almost always visually splendid but about as exciting to watch as paint that is already dry watch his movies in fast forward the really fast setting that you can only get on dvd in the <UNK> <UNK> does very little with the script or the characters using them as simply a to hang a very long and well constructed cinematographic frame he even goes so far as to <UNK> shakespeare's original script to achieve these slow and lifeless scenes there is none of the romance magic <UNK> or urgency the script calls for little <UNK> and the character of in particular is reduced to a <UNK> and insane idiot of sorts similar to in edward ii it is too bad that this is just about the only film version of the <UNK> available
<START> never before has such a large cast of ugly people gathered together to make an equally ugly film br br something huge and horrifying is loose in the waters off the florida coast something that leaves half <UNK> up bodies behind in its wake <UNK> beer <UNK> bob thinks he has caught the <UNK> evil voice on tape <UNK> assistant the amazingly unattractive and painfully skinny stella decides to <UNK> the help of slimy ladies man peter an <UNK> whose equipment may be able to help them locate the mysterious creature but anyone who sticks their nose too far into the mystery winds up dead killed by a <UNK> faced hit man with a bad <UNK> what is the terrible secret behind the sea killer br br ugly scientists have <UNK> affairs inept cops and doctors puzzle over the increasing numbers of corpses stella and peter make out on the beach and characters we don't care about are killed off or <UNK> up the sea killer a weird combination of an <UNK> a shark and a pair of large <UNK> never really seems as threatening as it should the conspiracy behind the <UNK> creation makes no sense whatsoever none of the characters are particularly likable and the ones who might be are killed off immediately this is a poorly shot badly dubbed plot less mess the whole thing is so <UNK> and <UNK> it made me long for a hot bath i've had <UNK> <UNK> scarier than this film avoid it unless it's the mst3k version
<START> it's difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film jean pierre presumably had the chance to explore the problems of <UNK> on a serious level and <UNK> instead to use it as an excuse to make a soft porn movie having seen loved admired and respected se <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> which explores memory loss albeit as the result of <UNK> in a profound and heartbreaking way not least in the <UNK> performance of isabelle <UNK> i find that is an insult to se <UNK> i have no problem with soft porn per se and even if i had i'd virtually have to give up going to movies so prevalent is it today but i do have a problem with writers directors who attempt to it by it as here in the <UNK> of medical research the sad thing is that fine actresses like julie so wonderful in clara et <UNK> and anna who seems to have hit into a double play after last <UNK> le <UNK> and now this are wasting their time on <UNK> like this
<START> that is what this movie is good god the special effects suck in this movie it is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot but the special effects manage to pull it off let me try to explain just how bad this movie is br br first there is the plot there are four punk ass teenage dirt <UNK> who are riding around in a forest in <UNK> one of them is a dumb ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg a <UNK> comes to help him but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks then all five realize that there is a forest fire which we see is started by some guy <UNK> tons of gas all over the forest all they show us is his boots and they show scene after scene of this guys boots walking around <UNK> gas and starting fires meanwhile the teenagers try to escape the fire only to find that boot man has somehow managed to get ahead of them while they were <UNK> through the forest on dirt <UNK> dump gas all over the area they were riding through and start more fires he does this several times and the <UNK> finally catches him and starts him on fire i won't spoil the ending but this guy's <UNK> will have you shouting what the bloody hell at the screen anyway they are now surrounded by fire and their only escape is through a mine which is filled with <UNK> gas yes <UNK> gas i'm not even going to try to describe the ending because it is too ridiculous and you'll enjoy it more if you don't see it coming which you won't because you can't possibly expect what happens this is because of the second major problem with this movie <UNK> br br is some semblance of <UNK> too much to ask for apparently so i cannot even count the number of broken limbs in this movie they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their <UNK> i think each character breaks at least one <UNK> and several more than one they then limp around until the scene ends and then forget that they're supposed to have broken limbs there is one scene where three of them who are supposed to have broken legs start dancing but then their <UNK> suddenly return when the plot needs them to br br finally the cgi if there is a hell it consists of watching the fire in this movie all they did for the forest fires is line the dirt paths with cgi fire you can clearly see that the only cgi fire is along the paths and all of the trees more than two feet from the path are left <UNK> and then they zoom out and show the whole forest being <UNK> in flames it's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks but i assure you that the <UNK> is quite impressive br br this movie is one of those so bad its good types there are some occasions where it <UNK> into the painful bad category but for the most part it stays above the line and is laughably inept i can't wait to check out the other nature unleashed movies that came in the four pack with this one
<START> this is a truly wonderful love story i liked the songs however even if you do not you have to love the story peter o'toole is at his best and clark is doing fine as well i first saw this when i was about 13 and loved it then now in my forties i still enjoy it probably even more still makes me cry and laugh and feel good it is a movie to watch only with a new age guy or by yourself as it is a chick flick but whats wrong with that need a little romance and maybe a little cry try this movie br br
<START> i had high hopes for this one after reading earlier reviews but it was so slow and the plot so basic that well i wondered if i had read the wrong reviews br br please a boy meets girl next door at 11 and both <UNK> to love and being basketball legends grow apart but watch each others progress guess what both get <UNK> to same university and become lovers again until his father is caught out playing around with a younger woman our young hero unable to cope has <UNK> in court concentration but some how decides to go pro and drop studies and guess what is picked up by <UNK> <UNK> the heroine because she was not there for him during this emotional period so for 5 years they go their own way she returns from spain having lost the <UNK> for the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks mom tells her that she should fight for her love so she <UNK> her on going love and challenges him to a basketball shootout he wins he marries she wins he loves her well he won but decides to dump other girl for our girl the end has her playing basketball and he has baby duties sorry 2 is my high score my partner she scored 0 for a <UNK> story for those who read mills and <UNK>
<START> this is a great <UNK> day gift a gorgeous guy and a pretty girl fall in love while trying to beat the competition at a <UNK> contest very romantic i'm a real fan of <UNK> <UNK> since his days at <UNK> <UNK> and he hasn't lost his appeal lauren holly is still lovely and adorable and the two still have great chemistry together the supporting cast was good as well seeing all those wonderful <UNK> being made was a delicious sight in itself i loved that <UNK> and lauren teamed up to win in the <UNK> competition and in love this is the kind of film that all <UNK> romantic and otherwise hallmark always shows excellence in their programming and this is no exception the whole family can view this film also shows that sometimes love <UNK> over any <UNK> i found myself <UNK> and wishing for more for this film and also yearning for those wonderful <UNK> i recommend this film highly for all ages a great treat for all
<START> this movie has to be the worst film i have seen there is a reason it was made to be a <UNK> movie of the week the continuity was all wrong palm trees in a chicago setting even though it was filmed in toronto canada the effects were left to be desired for the year of 2004 hello lord of the rings had better cgi than that but i guess they also had the money for it the budget will for sure affect the outcome but anyone that calls this <UNK> more than a 2 needs to go back to film and tv school next time remember that care and time make a classic not <UNK> for a <UNK> box office or tv smash hit br br also i know networks can <UNK> footage from old networks or but using 80's footage for 2004 i have a hard time buying that
<START> film critics of the world i apologize it is your job to give advice to the <UNK> public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt however my decision to see the cat in the hat wasn't made <UNK> you see three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the <UNK> known as how the grinch stole christmas then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful funny and almost hypnotic <UNK> treat so when the critics unleashed their fury against the cat in the hat another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role i thought that it must be the same old song how wrong i was br br for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear the opening credits are clever the kids are charming and the production values are top notch then the cat showed up there are many problems from this point on but the biggest one was the <UNK> <UNK> of mike myers where the grinch was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey the cat was destroyed by myers he can be very funny when his <UNK> are applied where they belong comic sketches every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch from wayne's world to austin powers so he tries to do the same thing here it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl not funny just painful not that the writers helped him out any after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive <UNK> humor gags poorly timed <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> attempts at hip humor this movie was the most <UNK> cinematic experience i have ever had period so much talent and work went into something so vile i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively <UNK> by this mess i just hope that the wonderful spencer <UNK> and <UNK> fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies if you are a parent please avoid this like the plague with movies like <UNK> and brother bear currently in theaters you have far better choices
<START> i play this game exactly after i watch the trailer in old magazine <UNK> cd br br the is very interesting and dark atmospheric missing in nowadays games movies the game is set somewhere in the middle of the <UNK> in the spooky mysterious mansion you play as adam <UNK> and your quest is to free the soul of your death trapped father br br the look of the game is doom like but very different type of game a lot of a action various <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and many more interesting locations and characters are presented in this old classic game br br the game will run only on windows 98 and there is no <UNK> for windows <UNK>
<START> a group of tourists are stranded on snake island after an unfortunate accident with their boat they are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected it isn't called snake island because it's just <UNK> much fun to say it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls this is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from nobody actors the only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which ain't anything couldn't see in a <UNK> rated movie folks if you are into snake movies than check out but don't torture yourself with this crap
<START> <UNK> <UNK> blank was really quite a below average film its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller the acting is very normal the performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very and that really annoyed me the whole reunion and the <UNK> i haven't seen you in 10 years ' element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on especially <UNK> the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one <UNK> them it just all seemed very tacky pointless and was poorly executed br br dan <UNK> role as a assassin is very sparse he only seems to appear once at the very beginning and right at the very end in a <UNK> show <UNK> which is hugely hyped up but doesn't deliver at all br br the soundtrack is also very mediocre the bulk of the songs that are in this film are straight out of the 1980's and with the exception of two or three are very bad hearing duff songs over quite a duff film just adds to the <UNK> that <UNK> this film br br i could go on and on about how little things were annoying and were just very bad such as the very few action sequences that came and went very quickly the lack of character development and how poorly the whole thing was constructed in that department the way that half the time you forget that <UNK> character is even a hit man at all as the element is so non existent br br even the way the comedy thinks it's funny but it isn't i didn't laugh once during this movie sure maybe i <UNK> now and again but my only real feel good point was when i realised the movie was nearly over br br please don't waste your time with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> despite the relatively high but badly incorrect imdb rating i've seen films that are better than this film that have lower rating on this site which tells you that there are better films out there just don't bother with this one
<START> i just saw this film last night and i have to say that i loved every minute if taken in the spirit of a parody of bond esquire films it's truly superior the true comedy of the film is in its blatant disregard for political correctness the <UNK> cultural <UNK> and almost laughable macho <UNK> of the films of this genre are used for major comic effect it also calls the <UNK> and formulaic elements to task with agent <UNK> <UNK> constantly learning difficult things insanely quick such as <UNK> and how to play a traditional <UNK> while missing some <UNK> obvious clues some of the lines from the film left me laughing for hours after the movie was finished and i have to say i have learned some interesting french <UNK> that would probably have my <UNK> quite <UNK> with me were i to use all in all i thought this film excellent intensely funny and the first film i've ever seen that truly parodies all aspects of the spy film
<START> this film took me by surprise i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a 7 8 rotten tomatoes users <UNK> it at 7 9 and the critics <UNK> an amazing 8 2 if anything they underrated this little gem br br filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents for <UNK> and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents <UNK> mother <UNK> and less than <UNK> dad mike i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker mike son doug was going to take us as a matter of fact i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this br br life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully <UNK> film follows the journey it is difficult to <UNK> just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must see even if you aren't a fan of the documentary genre this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten <UNK> <UNK> street is one of those rare <UNK> experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience eventually millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work bravo
<START> this was the most unrealistic movie i ever seen br br i can't believe that the writer and director didn't see that almost all the movie looks like a sf one br br for example br br 1 it is impossible for the killer to stay on cold and after 10 hours to get up so quickly br br 2 you can't get <UNK> <UNK> a water <UNK> like in the movie believe me it's my <UNK> br br 3 with a saw you can cut 10 <UNK> in 10 hour very easy let's say that the chain was made from steel but the water <UNK> was rusty and it was made from iron br br 4 if you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint in the best case it's more likely to die because your hart fails before to get to the bone shin br br and there are more other examples
<START> this is without doubt one of my favourite horror films ever i really cannot believe that it didn't gain much more popularity when it was released especially when the main <UNK> at the time were the usual wes craven sequels and <UNK> horrors mute witness has all the style suspense and plot twists of a hitchcock <UNK> movie coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot it never promises to be any more than a good popcorn and hot dog movie but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it is br br the plot <UNK> on <UNK> hughes a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a russian factory by a series of events she finds herself accidentally locked in and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie br br one of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to <UNK> every horror film ever made as the main character is mute she cannot make a noise something which is a <UNK> at some stages of the movie and a curse in others br br the director seems to have studied his hitchcock very well even the opening scene is a tongue in cheek nod to both hitchcock's psycho as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes br br while the acting can be hammy at times the whole film does hold it together not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to end br br all in all a hugely overlooked well paced and action packed psycho thriller which i would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual freddy jason scream michael myers <UNK> at
<START> seth <UNK> is a true genius he has crafted a show that is witty <UNK> sharp and just downright hilarious br br for those that think its <UNK> take on social or cultural topics makes no meaningful comment just causes can be pointed to this quote br br peter coming out of the <UNK> cell lab how long was i in there guard five minutes peter why aren't we funding this br br why indeed br br thanks family guy for being not only the funniest show on tv with the possible exception of the much loved much missed <UNK> but for also being pretty clever to boot
<START> although i do not recommend this film neither do i recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie though i have not given away the ending or most of the plot twists this movie would be best viewed without any prior information it's hard to <UNK> the chief problem with the film <UNK> <UNK> as there are many to deal with richard kelly in his first feature film seems to have <UNK> enough scenes of adolescent rage late night <UNK> <UNK> self righteous <UNK> and <UNK> banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen angst dramas then <UNK> them into a single two hour package with a sci fi twist the result is deeply <UNK> for all the wrong reasons the film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning to make them sympathize with one dimensional characters and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot full of loose ends by hiding it under a <UNK> of cgi effects and neo <UNK> the main character <UNK> <UNK> is a young man committed to therapy misunderstood by his friends and rendered hostile and <UNK> by his suburban life we are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his <UNK> although sometimes that is a difficult <UNK> to make for example when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> with a theory of his own his friend complains about <UNK> acting all smart speech however is no smarter than that of his friend just <UNK> the only clear evidence of his intelligence is his <UNK> description of his <UNK> test scores as <UNK> ' but given the director's <UNK> against simple of human elements as shown in the fear love sequence this is a poor substitute for character development <UNK> takes <UNK> drugs to combat mental problems which are not addressed directly in this film in fact the entire issue of the drugs is understated and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost the ambiguity of strange destiny the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination is pushed into the background making the film 100 percent science fiction this would not be a bad thing in itself except that the science behind the fiction is very shaky the explanations of time travel are weak at best sounding like detached <UNK> rambling we get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters and can't quite remember how it worked but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film the scientific portion as a result depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved at one point a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject he'd be fired apparently no further explanation is needed <UNK> with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions the justification for these actions is a <UNK> business he <UNK> his school but it's okay because his school doesn't treat him like a person his punishment of a creepy self <UNK> <UNK> somewhat similar to tom <UNK> character in <UNK> results in the man's public <UNK> but should the audience believe that <UNK> is some sort of <UNK> angel striking out against ignorance and <UNK> he himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact aside from these flaws the film is <UNK> with flat uninteresting <UNK> of humanity the story is set in 1988 just before the bush dukakis election and the director touches on this point during the film the focus however <UNK> exactly this far gruff blue collar father is voting for bush while his free spirited rebellious daughter plans to vote for dukakis there is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here simply a statement of the obvious the former are not necessary to make a good film but the latter should be left out likewise heartfelt speech about not being able to <UNK> all human emotions into the bland categories of fear and love this doesn't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless mr kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80's pop culture in his film e t stephen king the <UNK> back to the future at it's heart this film feels like the director's homage to himself a collection of his own experiences interests personal heroes and <UNK> <UNK> and roughly <UNK> together by <UNK> hands entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions seemingly because the director likes the songs characters who have little to no bearing on the plot including the <UNK> bully fat girl and right wing idiot teacher are given unnecessary focus because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow the awkward mess that is <UNK> <UNK> leaves us wondering if mr kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless <UNK> meandering effort br br my rating 1 10
<START> this <UNK> remake of the terrific five star final suffers from terrible acting <UNK> bogart stars as the manager of a radio station that is desperate to boost <UNK> ratings the owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago so they hire the fake preacher harry hayden to track down the <UNK> who was <UNK> and has been living quietly under a fake name the preacher arrive on the daughter's wedding day but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives br br bogart is always good hayden is good the the slimy preacher and henry o'neill is good as the father everyone else is just awful helen wins no sympathy crucial for the role linda perry is a lousy actress beverly roberts is ok but always looks old claire <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> have no parts <UNK> moore is a dud as the boy friend virginia is miscast as the society mother robert overacts as the station owner br br this one comes in under an hour but is a pale copy of the original which <UNK> dynamic performances by edward g robinson <UNK> <UNK> frances <UNK> and boris karloff but it's always worth watching
<START> well after seeing beginning i thought why the hell they burned version and did that poor one but now after seeing <UNK> i deeply understand this decision even they got it not much better br br sorry but this movie is really crap some good moments but a really boring story telling and some major plot holes are killing this movie br br i thing the exorcist story has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see but there is so much little of it in the movie the effects are really bad not even tv standard
<START> the nun is a revenge picture <UNK> a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school story line is predictable in <UNK> and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end it is a <UNK> of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle still if you look past these there is some suspense and acting <UNK> if you like senseless cookie cutter you'll like this otherwise you should pass
<START> i watched this movie miniseries on television back in 1989 and it was an amazing movie i would love to track down a copy of it just to watch it again and again it's been 15 years since i watched it and it still sticks out in my mind br br from the beginning it draws you in the characters and plot line keep holding you the ending was superb the feeling and rage that the son displayed when finding out the truth about his father are unforgettable the suspense on how it will turn out and how he will confront his father is really intense br br if you can get a copy of this movie you will thoroughly enjoy watching it br br then email me and tell me where i can get a copy
<START> this movie is truly worth seeing robin <UNK> excels and henry thomas proves that he's one of those <UNK> the child <UNK> who grows up to become a real actor the characters are perfectly drawn and in the wrong hands because of their depth they could have been unconvincing but all the actors are simply astounding the cast of this movie has to rank up there with that of girl interrupted both movies <UNK> star the brilliant <UNK> duvall the score and music <UNK> fit perfectly and there is plenty of action to prevent the movie becoming just a character study if you want the story you won't find it in this review but i will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time
<START> i must admit at first i was worried about <UNK> the opening segment was not very strong and i began to worry about what was to come however once it set in to familiar <UNK> territory with the <UNK> sense of humor the unique and enduring characters and the compelling story combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction the story follows john <UNK> played by ben <UNK> a scientist who has developed a spaceship and theory that rely on <UNK> <UNK> however during the first test his craft encounters an unknown <UNK> field and he is <UNK> into an unknown galaxy where he finds himself in the middle of a struggle between escaping prisoners on the starship and the <UNK> human <UNK> he is quite literally drawn into the prisoners ship and after many twists and turns finds himself united with the prisoners <UNK> a warrior a <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and sun a who has reluctantly joined the crew with excellent special effects <UNK> make up and puppets and robots that <UNK> the <UNK> standard of perfection as well as a very well written story and character driven plot <UNK> looks to be a fantastically original creative and clever science fiction series
<START> the real surprise of this effortlessly lightweight movie is how such a top notch cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a hammy uninspiring affair presumably it was a proverbial <UNK> rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape one can imagine that by the time miranda richardson got <UNK> by her agent the conversation went along the lines of <UNK> you want to shoot a movie in <UNK> scripted by neil jordan michael caine and michael are already in ' this is a dull <UNK> that sees michael caine and dylan <UNK> try and pull off a well planned <UNK> where <UNK> must imitate a london <UNK> boss whose arrival is <UNK> to collect a <UNK> sum of cash from local <UNK> michael the rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly <UNK> is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as black books caine is <UNK> in his role and gives a steady performance without being <UNK> one can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie it can't even have been a summer in <UNK> given that many of the scenes look positively <UNK> in the background actually steals the show and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of have i got news for you will know that he is a wonderfully funny man but overall the result is disappointing and it seems a lifetime ago that neil jordan was making quality movies of the likes of <UNK> lisa
<START> i was 19 years old when i saw first saw this film in the theater i have a vivid memory of a different ending not completely different but significantly i just watched the movie last night and i was wrong so i guess the following can't be called a spoiler since it never happened the ending i remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked frances austen found him quite easily and after she confronted him she slowly <UNK> to her knees and went down on him off camera only his face was in the frame and it was pretty obvious he was letting it happen albeit against his will but nothing like this showed up in the movie sandy dennis was <UNK> years old when she made this movie michael burns was 22 in the movie he complains to his sister that frances makes too big a deal about sex yeah well then so go to bed with her dude and get it over with wtf
<START> it occurred to me while the final scene of the movie <UNK> to reveal the <UNK> detail of buddy <UNK> death that there are still people alive today who were at that <UNK> in <UNK> who remember it vividly that has to be a haunting memory <UNK> even more <UNK> by the lyrics of american pie as it pays tribute to the day the music died the world lost some tremendous talent that day lives cut short way before their prime and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who <UNK> that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacy br br i watched the film today some thirty years after it's original theatrical release thirty years i have some trouble <UNK> my mind around that i had forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little things like the <UNK> in the wall who became <UNK> with the <UNK> name but most of all i remember the music it's hard just to sit there and not begin <UNK> to the beat of oh boy or that'll be the day and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes i'm with buddy on that score at least how could they be jungle <UNK> if he came up with them funny how each <UNK> decade brought it's own threat to the fabric of society the beatles <UNK> disco and a whole host of other musical forms we're still listening and dancing to the beat so i guess they couldn't have been all that bad br br there was another <UNK> from the film i had forgotten about this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasn't seeing things my way i've done that a number of times over the years but by now had forgotten the source well i should be good for another thirty years or so now br br you certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly seeing him today one could never imagine him as the <UNK> down rocker with the horn <UNK> glasses but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod don <UNK> and charles martin smith are competent as <UNK> band members though their characters take a back seat to much of the story i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were into the picture names like sam <UNK> and king curtis without ever <UNK> on their presence br br i'll always be a fan and <UNK> of music from the fifties and sixties they call them now i guess that makes me a bit of an <UNK> too but you can't replace the experience of growing up with the music history that now makes it to the big screen which only goes to <UNK> the idea that i'll keep on enjoying the music until well the day i die
<START> possible spoilers br br i've read up on dahmer a little and saw the new dahmer film with the same name at an earlier time this movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings too little on dahmer himself the film called dahmer had the opposite problem it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself br br i did not find the acting to my satisfaction it had a certain amateur feel too it especially the <UNK> officer it also seemed as if the dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the <UNK> officer actor but i might be wrong about that br br what annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show the real deal about what he did anyway that is ok but what i then don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while dahmer was out getting beer was not depicted being naked since that is also how it happened it's not a big deal but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out what wasn't shown either or not even really hinted was <UNK> sexual obsession with the dead again i don't mind they didn't show it but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehow br br conclusion i think the really good dahmer film is still to be made a movie that <UNK> not only <UNK> crimes but also who he was and why he did what he did i think that 1 5 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all this movie was just a <UNK> excuse the pun of <UNK> life and personality and does not give you any to <UNK> insight into his life or personality br br 4 10
<START> winning 26 out of the 28 awards it was nominated for there is no doubt that this film will stand as one of the best of 2007 the fact that it was made with non professionals who were trained to act and dance makes it that much more special br br it is not a bollywood production but it is about art a lower <UNK> girl wants to sing and dance she wants to move up in society but there is a limit everyone cannot be president in india there is a <UNK> system and the narrow minds will not allow it to be <UNK> br br <UNK> school at 15 and goes to work for the <UNK> <UNK> who was once an accomplished dancer after some time working the animals she is taught to sing and dance the film is strikingly beautiful with rich color it is amazing what can be done with 20 000 as this film was a <UNK> project for the writer director br br the son <UNK> <UNK> returns from america to run for office and is struck by the girl but she is lower <UNK> and can only be a <UNK> for his lust things are no better at home as her father drinks and eats and steals her money she ends up pregnant and has to sell the baby to the <UNK> br br in the end she never rises above her <UNK> but the story was fascinating and the acting was really good
<START> stay away from this movie at all costs i was <UNK> into watching this movie in a bet to see which one of us knew the t worst movie of all time needless to say this one won hands down it is long and drawn out and has no purpose or plot from what i can gather a movie about a killer kid raised from a <UNK> that was grown outside the <UNK> just has no place inside your vcr if you are extremely bored and have no life watch this movie but if you rather keep your sanity stay away
<START> fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a mess plot wise and the acting of those who dubbed the voices is almost universally bad but the premise is engaging the fight scenes are fast and flashy and the movie is often quite amusing it's a shame the story is such a wreck there are a couple of places where i had no idea what just happened it was almost as though five minutes had just been cut out and you were suddenly at the next scene without knowing how you'd got there the movie is poor at explaining things and some things don't make a lot of sense but the movie moves along so its flaws barely register not a great movie by any means but definitely a fun one
<START> is one of the worst movies i ever seen most of the time this is fine and i can go on with my life but i feel the need to warn others in this case as a veteran of the iraq war i feel it necessary to say that the story plot acting and depiction of what soldiers go through upon returning home was pure garbage it was as if the director writer whoever <UNK> on to whatever cliché about returning soldiers and ran with it and ran with it and ran with it not to mention i would imagine there was absolutely no research put into this film the marine uniform looked like it was fresh off a <UNK> store shelf and was a pattern not used since the first iraq war i won't go on forever this is a horrible movie if you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers there are much better <UNK> i recommend going to your local library
<START> i should live this film but i don't it won international awards it is foreign i usually like such films it is slow moving again something i like and it has no gratuitous sex or violence the problem is that it is boring we have two friends from the same village in turkey one successful the other not the <UNK> one comes to <UNK> to stay with the successful in an attempt to get a good job at sea both live lives that are <UNK> pointless and petty br br well it isn't the first time this kind of film has been made i didn't see anything new being added to this tired theme there are long takes that are just someone standing and looking at the sea or sitting in a coffee shop or watching tv i do understand that this kind of thing is there to show the <UNK> of their loves while it does do that i got the idea in the first 15 min i don't need to be beaten over the head with it for the rest of the two hours br br the symbolism is also a bit heavy handed the plate of live type fish with one off the plate and <UNK> around in its death throws symbols are best when they are not obvious but are there in the background creating a mood just slightly below the viewer's awareness br br the film is so <UNK> that it doesn't even rate a score of 1 so i gave it a 2 to rate a 1 takes a talent at being bad this film didn't have that much energy
<START> every movie i have <UNK> because leonard <UNK> praised it to the <UNK> has blown <UNK> every single one when will i ever learn br br is a raving old bag who thinks nothing of saying she's dying of breast cancer to get her way laura is an <UNK> <UNK> filled with the holy spirit and her <UNK> <UNK> caught between these <UNK> is dumb as a rock boy who has been pressed into <UNK> pulling <UNK> by the old bag br br as i said when will i ever learn br br i was <UNK> lifted out of my <UNK> when the old bag stuck her head in a sink but unfortunately she did not die i was <UNK> lifted out of my <UNK> again when <UNK> got <UNK> down but unfortunately she did not die it should be a capital offense to torture audiences like this br br without harry potter to kick him around rupert is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically <UNK> out of its <UNK> julie scenery chewing especially the scene when she plays god is even more shameless than her character br br at least this harold <UNK> some bimbo instead of <UNK> for that i am truly grateful and if you're reading this mr <UNK> you owe me 3 99
<START> i was not making big <UNK> on the fact that this for sure was a very very free adaptation from the work of de and i must say that this free adaptation form the book as a lot of possible good ideas and characters the problem is the way that is done without any care without any taste just a <UNK> of bad taste clichés everywhere the script is so fake and the characters so unreal that's makes petty seeing nice actors as and others lost themselves in a net of whatever except cinema or storytelling for my surprise the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> stick in their performances but you can see them lost like a <UNK> boat without any direction and talking about direction this seems to be something totally missing on this the director everything is bad taste the frames are whatever and whenever the use of hand camera without any justified reason the light design that should build <UNK> doesn't exist and no excuses that the all point is a dark real story the problem overall in this trying to be film is that as no taste or very very bad taste it's sad to see <UNK> and melting away in such fake and <UNK> sex scenes painted here and there <UNK> out the movie like closing <UNK> holes or used as <UNK> transition motives maybe carlos da <UNK> should see the 2002 carlos <UNK> adaptation of the same book of and get the <UNK> of how to build a true movie
<START> contains spoilers br br <UNK> <UNK> film adaptation of thomas <UNK> <UNK> is visually if not <UNK> faithful to its source opera offers a more faithful reading of the <UNK> <UNK> struggles which <UNK> the aging writer it is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made br br in the visconti version the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story never has <UNK> looked more beautiful and <UNK> more <UNK> and <UNK> if you've read the <UNK> it's like having the <UNK> on its pages come to life <UNK> <UNK> gives an outstanding performance as <UNK> von although he has very little dialogue he conveys the <UNK> <UNK> passion and finally pitiful yearning of through facial expressions alone the young actor who plays the beautiful object of desire was perfectly cast he too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures the character is pivotal to the story so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire visconti with his incredible eye for beauty knew exactly what he was doing and changing from a writer to a composer based on <UNK> and then using music especially the from the <UNK> <UNK> was another brilliant stroke although i'd read the mann story before the film music and death in <UNK> will always be <UNK> linked in my mind as will the haunting images which appear throughout the film especially that last one of dying on the beach as walks slowly into the sea br br one day this film will be released in dvd widescreen format and its visual <UNK> completely restored to us
<START> could it be that <UNK> wouldn't want to release this absolute classic because it would show up their current series of mike <UNK> for what it is when discussing mike <UNK> with some work colleagues i mentioned cup as being a far superior offering and was surprised to find that i seem to be the only person in my entire office that has actually seen it this can't be right for a film that has got to be the funniest thing i have ever seen br br let's face it <UNK> don't have the greatest recent record for producing comedy so you would think that they would jump at the chance of at least repeating something which is genuinely funny perhaps if it could be combined with a <UNK> <UNK> competition of where we think the coach driver will go next then they might be interested br br come on <UNK> there are still some of us out there who would like to watch original quality comedy drama do the decent thing thing repeat it then get it out on dvd
<START> <UNK> this film a lesbian love story is about as accurate as calling pride prejudice a straight love story there's just so much more to it than that br br yes the main character is a lesbian but her story is classic a journey from childhood to <UNK> from sexual innocence into maturity from personal <UNK> to self discovery there is a <UNK> element of camp to the film's direction but it is not a <UNK> rather it serves to <UNK> the staged and dramatic parts of the main character's life br br those who know anna <UNK> from the bbc version of pride and prejudice will certainly be amazed with her here <UNK> <UNK> is stellar as the main character <UNK> and <UNK> is all wide eyed goodness as her lover kitty butler <UNK> might have the stand out role that is aside from sally <UNK> who plays <UNK> butler this film is not for the faint of heart but it's not a piece of pro gay advertising either it's a real story with real comedy and drama an engaging story with compelling characters and well worth watching
<START> in the past 5 years i have rented some bad movies completely on purpose see i <UNK> to be a movie reviewer and as we all know there are horrible movies released every year anyway about 3 months ago i rented this one i watched it all the way through and cried <UNK> this is one of those movies that is so <UNK> bad it makes you want to <UNK> it actually put a sick feeling in my stomach i've seen lots of bad movies mystery science theater 3000 anyone but this one takes the cake the plot was hard to follow the lighting horrible and the sounds almost <UNK> if there was a negative rating on the scale here this movie would be at 11 for me this may seem odd but i highly recommend it it's something you have to see for yourself but don't say i didn't warn you i don't think this review could get any more precise so i'm done now br br
<START> my husband and i watched this last night it was wonderful for once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending it moved along very quickly and the acting was superb i adore tom <UNK> anyway he has never made a bad movie as far as i'm concerned the above description of his acting hits the nail on the head the facial expressions are incredible even the <UNK> scenery is awesome we have just finished watched all of the prime suspect series and i am convinced that the british have a way of capturing the audience there is no doubt that i would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get a few hours of <UNK> entertainment
<START> there's really not a whole lot to say about this it's just really really bad the acting is bad the script is bad and the editing is probably one of the worst jobs ever it's so sloppy and choppy that it serves only to confuse the audience there's no real to plot to speak of mostly it's a really fake looking monster fish attacking europeans trying to pass themselves off as americans pass on this one
<START> i <UNK> on cinema but there is a limit a name isn't enough to make a movie the beginning of the movie puts us in a mood to expect the unseen yet but we remain hungry or angry till the end things are getting so confused that i admit that i did not understand the end or was there an end to this the opportunity to make an outstanding movie was there but the target was totally missed next
<START> christmas in <UNK> is a gem of a christmas movie classic while lesser known than some others it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time i watch it every year br br barbara stanwyck is perfectly cast as elizabeth lane the single career girl way before it was popular stanwyck <UNK> the single girl on the rise her nyc apartment and her friendly uncle <UNK> around the corner the single girl in the city existence she can't cook yet she writes a <UNK> for a magazine br br dennis morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero <UNK> jones who wants to meet the amazing elizabeth lane after being lost at sea all he wants is to spend christmas in a real home which sets up the delightful <UNK> story that <UNK> it is fun from beginning to end we should all have an uncle felix too
<START> this show was a really good one in many ways although certainly an <UNK> western with the hero riding around on a motorcycle rather than a horse due to the <UNK> setting very late for a western which tend usually to be set between and <UNK> i remember some controversy about its <UNK> at the time but didn't really watch it during its time on nbc when i came to see it and love it was a decade later when i was in the army <UNK> in germany and it was shown every week from the beginning on armed forces television by then <UNK> <UNK> was famous as lois lane but i'll also always think of her as <UNK> girlfriend in a lot of ways <UNK> was a lot like maverick both were much more attracted to getting rich with little effort than they were fighting it was in the little tv magazine that they distributed at the not really an <UNK> edition of tv guide but made to resemble it as closely as possible without getting into <UNK> trouble that i first learned the real story behind the <UNK> i really wonder what the next season with the more violent twin would have been like if they had really made it as planned of course by the time this show was made the western era of tv had been in decline for around a decade someday i hope to be able to write that the reality era has been in decline for that long while <UNK> and bonanza were still running they were both <UNK> their ends and it had been years since a new western had really caught on i think that this trend did a lot to hold <UNK> back and was the main reason that nbc executives <UNK> that it would ever find a large audience but to me a good western unlike a show set in contemporary times is somewhat timeless as are other period shows changing fashions and the like do nothing to make them look any more dated than they were supposed to be and i think that watching this show 10 years after it was produced is really what brought this point home to me also this show is an early pairing of garner and stuart <UNK> who is really one of the all time great <UNK> and not just in westerns
<START> the actors are so bland that it's almost impossible to tell them apart pauline <UNK> said of this movie the actors have names but they're truly anonymous and the special effects are really bad they <UNK> with people hanging on <UNK> and by <UNK> the trick that let fred astaire dance on the ceiling in royal wedding but none of these guys move well enough to make it look convincing br br the low point of the movie is when one of the characters an airplane <UNK> is trying to convince some other giants of industry to come in with him in a moon rocket and he shows them a woody <UNK> cartoon that explains how a rocket works at a 2nd grade level and to think that robert <UNK> worked on the screenplay br br the only plus is that the production design manages to communicate a sort of amazing stories sensibility and even that is done much better in the <UNK> george pal subsequent movie when worlds <UNK> which has similar bad acting but is much more entertaining however <UNK> best sci fi movie has to be the time machine
<START> francis ford <UNK> apocalypse now is not a vietnam war film do not confuse it with one it is set to the back drop of the war but it is a <UNK> exposition on the <UNK> effects that war has on the human psyche it is also one of the most <UNK> films ever made produced or even conceived second to the lord of the rings trilogy to call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels br br opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the doors the end as martin <UNK> captain benjamin l <UNK> <UNK> to images of <UNK> and <UNK> the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes <UNK> mission is to <UNK> with extreme prejudice colonel <UNK> marlon brando who has <UNK> gone <UNK> in the far reaches of the <UNK> jungle and as told by his general is out there operating without any decent restraint totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct and he is still in the field commanding troops <UNK> is a <UNK> colonel now being <UNK> by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god for <UNK> this <UNK> operation seems somewhat more <UNK> than actual combat yet the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior br br <UNK> up with a small crew they <UNK> down the vast reaches of the river in a <UNK> boat along the way <UNK> <UNK> himself on all things <UNK> during <UNK> <UNK> voice over he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads <UNK> was a highly <UNK> and respected green <UNK> he was a normal man with a family until a part of him <UNK> to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that <UNK> is being led the descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away eventually the power of the experience <UNK> on the group as drugs and a sort of <UNK> <UNK> attacks their senses but <UNK> seems <UNK> and <UNK> in his quest to find <UNK> as he reads about this <UNK> figure he is drawn to the man's power and why he has become what he has become we know that <UNK> slow <UNK> will parallel that of br br marlon brando has been <UNK> for decades his presence <UNK> his genius <UNK> but for those <UNK> with his acting <UNK> and <UNK> to his physical nuance brando can be perceived in the eyes of an <UNK> film goer as a hack he is most certainly not brando was difficult to work with hard to interpret and impossible to understand but his talent for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> monologues is <UNK> the man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't his colonel <UNK> is a being of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br if the film is any indication of the <UNK> into hell than francis ford <UNK> actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man's <UNK> struggle to produce a movie it is reported that during the film's 200 plus day principle photography schedule coppola <UNK> suicide the film was not only an <UNK> struggle to make it is a <UNK> film to watch <UNK> sweat and blood <UNK> through the <UNK> of the steamy locals and his dedication <UNK> through the <UNK> of martin <UNK> haunted soldier <UNK> br br i can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film at the dawn of all that was original and <UNK> films that challenged as well as <UNK> were <UNK> <UNK> aside apocalypse now is pure film making my respect and admiration for mr coppola is of the highest order but i <UNK> at the return to what has become the norm for today's standards for film a lack of <UNK> it is not simply the <UNK> of the world of cinema today it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart but we still have the great ones like <UNK> masterpiece a film which <UNK> in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend br br that depth in apocalypse now is the step into madness the killing can <UNK> the loss of innocence can but it is the damage from within the countless <UNK> of images that distress <UNK> and <UNK> us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually us from humanity and <UNK> us into the realm of the <UNK> the savage and the <UNK> if the thought of killing does not provide the act of killing provides man with its fundamental <UNK>
<START> michael is probably too <UNK> for most action movie fans and too hollywood for the intellectual crowd but i found it both extremely funny and very touching despite it being both <UNK> and formulaic br br when three <UNK> are sent to investigate a man claiming to be an angel they end up <UNK> him on a grand tour of the mid western country side only to find that it is each of their own hearts that need investigation br br when taking this film apart as with most films today there isn't a lot of new material but when taken as a whole it has a <UNK> original approach and is off beat enough to entertain one all the way through br br while not being a family film it is suitable for all ages and a good film to share with the whole family or that special someone br br michael isn't a great film but it certainly is a good film a touching film and well worth seeing br br
<START> game huh game i'm not even sure the bloody <UNK> of that particular reality game know what the term means let alone the bloody players in the game br br an aspiring would look at that and think <UNK> what the flying <UNK> was that useless excuse for a <UNK> of <UNK> women i've seen my <UNK> dog seduce women with more <UNK> than that and it is one ugly bloody dog and its main approach <UNK> is to <UNK> <UNK> legs br br i challenge the frustrated <UNK> <UNK> of that show to a show down a <UNK> of their so called pickup ability can they deliver if one is to view that piece of un reality drivel then you would realise no these mentally <UNK> suck me darling boyfriend wanna be <UNK> of <UNK> eye or something similar not that there's anything wrong with that are unable to un <UNK> their <UNK> long enough to provide a <UNK> of a real pickup br br as you lovely north americans say <UNK> said br br a message from down under with love
<START> what i liked best about this flick was the chance to see joan <UNK> who awe struck me as one of the several <UNK> in the charles boyer classic <UNK> in a leading role she does well as rita an orphan who rises to make good as a lady crime boss her <UNK> to the top reminds me of joan <UNK> characters e g mildred pierce who realize their ambitions by fierce determination and <UNK> if you're looking for a film noir classic better look elsewhere at several points it's difficult to know where this story is going i first got the impression that it was going to <UNK> <UNK> plot for revenge against the father and son who tricked her into taking the rap for a drunk driving death <UNK> by the playboy son but <UNK> time ended up being only a minor point and a <UNK> to the somewhat confusing second part of the film where rita becomes increasingly involved in city corruption anyway it's only <UNK> minutes so a second viewing should clear up any my copy is from a <UNK> box set called mobster movies the picture quality is good but the soundtrack sucks constantly skipping <UNK> of dialog there are eight films in the 5 50 box making each movie a fair <UNK> cents look for anne <UNK> father john archer as <UNK> childhood friend bob alan <UNK> doesn't get much screen time it's definitely joan picture
<START> i saw this movie when it aired on the wb and fell in love with <UNK> smith immediately i would recommend the movie to people of all ages who just feel like being entertained and not much more i wish they'd air it again or cast <UNK> smith in another movie
<START> worst movie ever seen worst acting too i cannot imagine a movie worse then this nothing to see no acting at all t hey actors should look for another job i <UNK> understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie br br i'm sorry for eric roberts must be tough i cannot imagine how <UNK> his <UNK> must be to justify taking the job br br the ladies in the movie perhaps they better stick to <UNK> br br as for the leading man what a lead he better be put on a lead and stay there i can see him being more successful at <UNK> rather than acting br br overall rating do not rent do not buy
<START> this is absolutely awful it's everywhere nowhere doesn't have any sort of point i have never understood what is good about jeff or sarah silverman bonnie hunt is so above this drivel she must have been personal friends w people involved because there is no way she would have read any part of this so called script thought yeah i wanna do that most movies i can find at least one or two things that are <UNK> or funny there is zero of that in this it's extremely dumb there really isn't any other word to describe this this is quite possibly the biggest waste of money on making of film that i have seen in a long time skip this at all cost you'll be glad you did
<START> another winner from that 50s 60s era that i love so much for the comedic value they give with each viewing these days corman never lets you down with these films they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets a recipe for good watching for sure ed nelson a very competent actor got started with corman as well as many other favorites who show up in superman and many of the westerns of the day the costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking well the <UNK> was a little off but thats the beauty of it film making for the love of it not looking for perfection just digging the action of doing it it comes thru these films are a fun time even better is the mst3k version
<START> stan as a <UNK> and a good one is quite a surprise usually overshadowed by oliver hardy this silent short allows him to take the lead and the <UNK> br br one can only draw the conclusion that his character was a parody of the many <UNK> <UNK> movies of this era br br be prepared to laugh yourself silly at some of the dialog and keep an eye on the special effects br br i viewed this on dvd in a <UNK> 1 2 collection
<START> i liked this movie not because tom <UNK> was in it but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi over <UNK> view of some of the issues that a baseball player coming to the end of their time in major league sports must face i also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in american and japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently br br overall it is a good movie to watch on cable tv or rent on a cold <UNK> night and watch about the dog day's of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away a good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good date movie  trust me on that one <UNK>
<START> it's really too bad that john candy wasted his skills on so many horrible films delirious <UNK> east who's harry etc this one has maybe a few chuckles but it's mostly just really bad one liners and dumb physical stuff let's honor this <UNK> memory by remembering things like planes trains <UNK> and uncle buck
<START> the <UNK> is a spoof on inspirational sports movies and let me just tell you it is not a good one tom brady the director probably found it hilarious that <UNK> sports films from <UNK> gang <UNK> and even miracle to the longest yard and <UNK> yes <UNK> and <UNK> in a couple of sex jokes would be the funniest thing since airplane well he was wrong they did such a <UNK> job you'd thought it was written in a week i have found it that if a director loves the genre the movie will be good obviously brady does not love the genre he is <UNK> this movie is a <UNK> piece of garbage not worth viewing so don't see it
<START> this movie was a complete disaster for me there is one thing that movies must have in order to be watchable and that is some psychological credibility of characters unfortunately here this is not the case the main characters behave <UNK> most of the time and even if they have some reason for such behavior it is not revealed to us by the director sophie character is particularly irritating making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie when one could expect something more rational for example meeting with her mother in the hospital and why exactly did she marry this guy no this is not a spoiler the plot at times seems like ripped off some soap opera and while the actors' performance is not bad this does not help much all in all i just could not find a way to connect with this movie not that i tried too much after the first hour though i have never walked out of cinema during a movie but this time was the closest in my life so far
<START> i realize the line on my summary is not too polite br br this film written directed by scott <UNK> starring <UNK> <UNK> don cheadle himself runs a long <UNK> minutes br br there is a dog in this puppy of a movie he is cute br br the movie opened in 2 u s theatres in late april 2007 for one week <UNK> all of <UNK> it quickly went to dvd in early august 2007 br br we were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the dvd off br br this was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill you saw the main film figured lets see what this one is like you might have walked out before we shut it off br br the 3 actors the young ladies in the film all have done deserve better than this br br ratings out of 4 <UNK> points out of 100 imdb 4 out of 10
<START> don't get me wrong i've got a considerable soft spot for the works of charles band both as producer and director but you've got to raise an <UNK> when the man who was willing to put his name to <UNK> vs the demonic toys sticks a <UNK> on anything as a bit of bad movie fun head of the family is rather lacking although it is better acted than you might expect <UNK> <UNK> is a definite talent who deserves better than these kinds of movies j w is also quite funny as the titular monster though for such a being he does get <UNK> quite easily <UNK> i'm <UNK> because the rest of the movie is so sharp and witty of course br br and having a lead character called lance nice one guys we didn't know you americans knew that piece of <UNK>
<START> my one line summary hints that this is not a good film but this is not true i did enjoy the movie but was probably expecting too much br br adele who is <UNK> portrayed by susan sarandon did not come off as a very likable character she is <UNK> and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter this is the one thing she knows how to do without fail daughter anna is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14 17 years old this of course makes natalie portman the perfect choice to play anna since she never seems to be 14 17 years old either portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years yet even with the two solid leads wayne wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as he did with the joy luck luck and even more so with smoke though i have not read the book the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen changes which may drain the emotional <UNK> of the story i enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work but i never got lost in the experience and i never related to their plight
<START> classes <UNK> is one of the best gangsters films <UNK> france has ever produced perfect cast <UNK> <UNK> a young jean paul <UNK> who made a bout de <UNK> <UNK> thing the same year marcel and a fine supporting cast brilliant script by <UNK> <UNK> who also wrote le the same year what a year for him wonderful black and white cinematography by and taut action first class directing by claude <UNK> who surpasses jean pierre <UNK> whereas the latter films gangsters movie with <UNK> <UNK> which sometimes lasts more than two hours claude <UNK> directs men of flesh and blood and the presence of the two children adds moments of extraordinary <UNK> which <UNK> has never been able to generate and <UNK> avoids pathos excessive sentimentality the last time <UNK> sees his children coming down in the <UNK> subway is a peak of restrained emotion br br <UNK> portrays a gangster whose die is cast when the movie begins he thinks that he can rely on his former <UNK> but they are all <UNK> we are far from <UNK> friendship dear to jacques <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> was to continue throughout the sixties sometimes <UNK> by mean women the film noir <UNK> par excellence living in a rotten <UNK> ready to inform on we are far from jean <UNK> simplistic behavior in <UNK> <UNK> br br works wonders with the picture the scene on the beach in a night when the two children see their mother die after the shoot out with the customs officers is absolutely mind <UNK> br br there's a good use of voice over which <UNK> only uses when necessary thus the last lines make the ending even stronger than if we have attended the scenes br br claude <UNK> had found a good <UNK> and he followed the classes <UNK> rules quite well with his follow up <UNK> <UNK> 1965 which featured <UNK> again and made a good use of a desert island and a ship had he continued in that vein france would have had a howard <UNK> in his subsequent works only max et les 1971 showed something of the brilliance he displayed in the first half of the sixties he had become from les <UNK> de la <UNK> <UNK> the cinema de director who used to focus on tender hearted <UNK> in such works as <UNK> et <UNK> 1972 vincent <UNK> paul et les 1974 or 1976
<START> this was a sad waste of two such promising actors chris <UNK> character was unlikable from the start and never made an improvement what did she see in him he was rarely kind never thankful for what he does have and a coward pass this one by on the shelves you'll be glad you did
<START> this particular title is very interesting the whole movie was like watching a ninja <UNK> which is really cool three magical swords three <UNK> a horrible demon a political power has it all the animation is decent but a little grainy the story is top notch and the fight scenes are real cool one thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters they are pretty freaky if you liked blood reign and ninja <UNK> is the one to see
<START> can this film be considered as a film imagine the situation somebody puts a handy <UNK> over a <UNK> and in front of a sea <UNK> and film people walking or <UNK> along it then he places the camera in a beach buys some <UNK> in a pet shop open their <UNK> and let them run in front of the camera later he just films the water surface and the sound of birds and insects in an absolute darkness is it an experiment or just an insult to the audience intelligence what would it happen if any unknown director did a film like that would we mark his job with 10 i always disappoint directors who believe that can do everything they want once they became famous
<START> only connery could bring that particular style with a line like <UNK> crashes into <UNK> arms when she water <UNK> up to the super agent in and <UNK> <UNK> how reckless of me i made you all wet ' the super agent replies <UNK> but my <UNK> is still dry ' br br barbara <UNK> makes a great villain stealing the show as <UNK> <UNK> is number 12 in the <UNK> chain of command and is a gorgeous assassin who takes intense <UNK> of pleasure in br br assumes all the deadly characteristics of <UNK> proving to be one of <UNK> <UNK> she is a victim of her she's good at what she does and wants the world to know <UNK> but her vanity is her using every possible approach to eliminate <UNK> is a wild and cunning woman who makes love to the man she is about to br br <UNK> actor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does not make a very <UNK> <UNK> for referred to as number one in the <UNK> chain of command <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> and travels aboard his super <UNK> the flying br br max von <UNK> becomes the fourth actor to appear as <UNK> chief <UNK> once more plotting to put the world at br br kim basinger takes the part once owned by the lovely french actress <UNK> she is domino the mistress of <UNK> who soon falls deeply in love with her br br black actor <UNK> <UNK> becomes the sixth actor to play cia agent felix after jack lord <UNK> van <UNK> norman burton and david br br edward fox portrays the new unsympathetic <UNK> ' pamela <UNK> is the third actress to play miss <UNK> lois <UNK> was the first and barbara <UNK> was the second br br valerie leon is the sexy lady in the <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> out of the blue water and saved his life by making love to him in her own valerie was the hotel <UNK> in 'the spy who loved <UNK> when bond and <UNK> arrive seeking br br <UNK> gee is physical <UNK> cohen is nicole <UNK> secret service contact in the south of br br <UNK> is jack the u s air force <UNK> officer who <UNK> the president of the united <UNK> <UNK> and arms two cruise <UNK> with nuclear br br <UNK> <UNK> is the bumbling foreign officer <UNK> small fawcett and alec is <UNK> the who provides <UNK> some <UNK> br br if you like to see connery playing a tense battle of <UNK> disguised as a <UNK> attacked by robot controlled sharks giving away a considerable amount of money for a tango dance thrown into a medieval <UNK> don't miss this second of only two <UNK> james bond <UNK>
<START> i have little to no interest in seeing another awful movie that totally lacks anything new creative or funny <UNK> the national lampoon tag how ever something caught my eye in the cast of this movie i see <UNK> name i'm a big fan of boy meets world but the movies <UNK> in are awful more so as a fan i'm not rewarded by seeing her terrible movies with the treasure of bare breast so this is where my question comes in br br has anyone seen this movie and if so does <UNK> get naked in it would save me the 2 hours of my life i would never get back watching this terrible movie thanks a lot
<START> i must say i was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an adam sandler happy madison production and i am usually attracted to that type of silly humour br br there were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie i realize that many are not realistic can still be quite funny but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all the acting was horrible the cinematography was very poor the plot made no sense at all i cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing overall i was very <UNK> with this film and i do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it
<START> based on the manga comic of well known artist <UNK> <UNK> this animated feature was a slight disappointment to me br br the story is good but the animation is merely ok while it could should have been <UNK> the movie is imo adequate but seems somehow flat uninspired if you know what i mean a wasted opportunity if you consider that another work by <UNK> ghost in the shell is considered a classic in many respects it set new standards for japanese animation and <UNK> among other things a brilliant series called stand alone complex br br i consider this worth a rental unless you're a fan of <UNK> and want it all do check out the original manga which comes highly recommended
<START> i am an avid movie watcher and i enjoy a wide variety of films however i found no enjoyment in this movie it is probably the worst movie i have ever seen i do not feel that it had much of a storyline the characters were not likable and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best and the ending only made me dislike the movie more it is definitely not in the same category as the cave which was in my opinion the best cave movie ever made even the descent was better than this movie br br it was a waste of the 3 <UNK> rental <UNK> and of my time to watch this do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one
<START> yeah there's a sleeper watching sleeper cell and it was me after reading comparisons to 24 like on the cover of the dvd i expected a fast paced action romp but nope this series just along in my <UNK> half awake state i would think he's gonna and <UNK> it would happen guess that van is gonna roll off the and there she goes br br and so on br br and why would in extra deep cover pursue a babe could it be perhaps to provide a little t a hey that works for me hence four stars rather than three br br this show is no 24 i've watched 24 sleeper cell you're no 24
<START> what a great movie this is i found it full of the delightfully unexpected pain of being a single father of a teenage girl and it is set in a <UNK> island well br br gerard brings his special european flair to this story about a divorced father of a teenage girl they are on holiday together and she begins to add to the excitement on the island in many unexpected ways but you will need to see the film for yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find for themselves br br there are a few cult classics which all teens should see this movie should be added to the list in addition to dirty dancing <UNK> <UNK> day off bill and ted's excellent adventure rocky horror picture show and animal house my father the hero should be required film study watch it as if you had a teenage daughter and you'll be rolling with laughter watch it with your teenage daughter and prepare to be laughed at for months
<START> if they had a zero out of 10 i would of entered it everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves taking money from the public i don't know how films like this get released video or pay channel i am disappointed in vincent <UNK> val kilmer was in it for about 8 minutes so i can't get that mad at him only the person who listed him to be the star in it it is like marlon brando in superman there is no plot except <UNK> searching and finding his friend in the <UNK> why they were searching for the gates of hell only the director knows they should of kept this film in <UNK> and burned it for fire to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night there is nothing more to say about this film that all the other reviewers have written i wish i could forget this movie it hurts my brain
<START> the only good part of this movie was the ending you know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you leave to go home no no that may be a little harsh the dancing in the film was sensational but unfortunately that is where the plot ended as long as the cast was dancing and not talking the movie went along well as for debut not too bad but hopefully his next film will have a little more depth as for going to see the movie wait for the rental or tv do not make the same mistake i did and pay 8 50
<START> exceptionally bad i don't expect much from garcia since he is one of the most overrated actors today but keaton really should have known this movie would suck and gotten out while he could not that i'm especially fond of him but hey he did batman br br in one scene keaton is transported to a hospital <UNK> down and wearing a <UNK> <UNK> kind of face mask when two attack dogs <UNK> at him dogs can sense evil you know <UNK> and keaton <UNK> back at them making them back off and <UNK> with their <UNK> between their legs did the movie turn comedy right there garcia makes a fool out of himself in an <UNK> scene with dialogue only a complete <UNK> could find plausible and the kid is too annoying to feel sorry for br br if you are gonna make a movie with as poor a plot as this you need some charm humour some solid action take die hard for example which is great despite its rather crappy plot br br even though character was a joke i <UNK> for him all the way i wanted to see garcia cry over his dead kid and keaton <UNK> <UNK> on some paradise island however this movie makes for a good laugh watch it with a witty friend and you can have some fun as this movie begs for <UNK> in almost every scene br br all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money greed made this movie and thank god it bit its own ass
<START> i went to see this movie not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the <UNK> of robert de niro and eddie murphy it was a fast paced movie and the hour and a half went by fast this one certainly won't win any academy awards but it was a change of pace for mr de niro he is good in comedy overall i enjoyed it
<START> seriously any film with john <UNK> is usually very good and this includes clint eastwood <UNK> russo john <UNK> <UNK> dylan mcdermott the practice and many more great actors br br clint is getting old now but thanks he is also an awesome director in his own right br br we are used to <UNK> water films like <UNK> boot <UNK> and perfect storm this was really different but just as <UNK> directed br br the premise of the assassin is as serious as it comes the film is well paced some of the violence is a bit but altogether recommended but not for kids
<START> separate lies changed my life actually the q a did br br spoilers below read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it br br the emily watson character <UNK> on the tom character my first reaction to the puppy dog eyed emily was it's over dump her bad <UNK> for some reason he stuck around not in a pathetic way he just listened and tried to accept her needs at times he needed to leave but he stuck by her and let her live her life but i still wanted to see her br br afterwards julian the screenwriter and director talked about the film i'm glad he did because frankly i am too you and was too immature to get the point before he broke it down for me br br <UNK> character loved her and no matter how much her pursuit of her needs might disagree with what he wants he would always love her the relationship and love they shared wasn't a lie all of a sudden just because she wanted to be with someone else the fact that she wanted to be with someone else didn't make her who she was when you get past fifty there's a strong chance that finding the love of your life won't come around again so you can't be as <UNK> as you were when you were younger you have to try and make things work because the alternative may be much worse br br she needed what she needed and she couldn't help that he had to learn to let go of her if he wanted to be the full man he could be he helped her in pursuit of her lover even when it hurt him br br another thing julian said that the strongest tool of a <UNK> is guilt br br again the strongest tool of a <UNK> is guilt br br at the end of the film tom released her from her burden he felt a need to let her know that he loved her but not to in order to get her back he wanted to let her know she didn't need to feel guilty or think poorly about the relationship just because it ended in such a terrible way br br it is not my way to review a film based on the message rather than the execution especially when i understand that message better when it is explained to me by the director but i make an exception here as i feel one more mature than i would benefit from seeing the film br br the execution of the film making was a nice british pace rupert was slimy and revolting tom and emily were their usually solid real characters
<START> maybe you have to be a former hippie to fully appreciate this because aside from some dated fashions music and dialogue it doesn't really have a thing going for it nowadays br br four fun loving college art students enjoy <UNK> days of painting nude models and riding on <UNK> they take acid in one scene and go to a <UNK> a sign flashes on the screen that says do not feed the animals and suddenly they're in a cage laughing and hanging from a chain tire swing an evil artist larry <UNK> tells in flashback how his art career was almost ruined because of a <UNK> hand disease he sends out zombie henchmen dressed in black to kidnap people then <UNK> them with a serum that <UNK> their faces he's trying to create some new form of abstract act i'm guessing here the details given are a bit fuzzy to put it mildly meanwhile jason ross harris sets out to save the day after his friend <UNK> chris <UNK> is killed and his girlfriend janet is kidnapped i thought the zombie make up in zombie lake was awful but wait until you see it here it's by douglas <UNK> the star of death curse of a small role is played by brad the director of the z classic blood freak which is much much more enjoyable than this deadly dull turkey aka nightmare house br br useless trivia note the 1984 regal video release features the wrong cast for the brides wore blood <UNK> directly on the video label br br score 1 out of 10
<START> i've seen just about all of the <UNK> <UNK> films now and i have to say this is one of their better films i wouldn't dare say it's better than the big <UNK> but it was very good in it's own right br br i thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times i loved all the characters especially tim blake nelson <UNK> and john <UNK> pete br br there really isn't anything bad i can say about this movie but this movie isn't for everyone it might be safe to say that if you liked the other <UNK> <UNK> films then you'll hopefully like this one too and if you liked what you saw in the trailer i think you'll like the film but don't hold me to it br br anyhow i hope that you like d the film as much as i do thanks for reading br br chris
<START> not for the <UNK> but the number of twists inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology gorgeous visual extremes together with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most stunning horror films i've ever seen it <UNK> into utter madness along with characters but never seems exploitative or horrific without purpose there are <UNK> amounts of <UNK> accompanied by some nasty sucking and <UNK> sounds but also subtle moments where you laugh out loud as he tends to do chan <UNK> park keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters br br and there's a lot of literal <UNK> keeping in the vein of vampire myth pun intended they have <UNK> strength and can nearly leap tall buildings in a single bound to <UNK> a phrase the first time our heroine is carried by the across the tops of buildings by the troubled vampire priest it has all the magical romance of lois lane and superman but this romance becomes increasingly disturbing but driven by a strange and conflicted <UNK> <UNK> not by mere horror br br the acting is superb particularly ok <UNK> kim the gorgeous actress in the female lead role who at 22 shows a range that is remarkable the character borders on a kind of black widow film noir type she <UNK> from innocent to <UNK> to <UNK> to demon with utter conviction this is a really smooth and <UNK> performance br br if you love real art in horror or are a fan of <UNK> don't wait for the video see it immediately
<START> it's pretty good all things considered a must for anyone <UNK> about the opposite sex i e all of us the trailer doesn't give away any of the plot for good reason br br the premise is absurd so it's nice to see that it doesn't take itself seriously it's like someone from the bbc children's department decided to make a film for adults that's not a bad thing imo br br 7 10
<START> hitchcock's original classic <UNK> tremendously not only from the performance of but also the <UNK> of anthony <UNK> he projected a kind of clean cut innocence a young teen idol type of persona he was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like especially in the 50's when this ultra chilling aspect of mental illness split personality <UNK> was relatively <UNK> in film which is exactly why the casting of him as norman bates was a slice of true <UNK> genius audiences were taken by surprise to put it mildly br br that's why this re make does not work even a little bit in spite of trying to be an exact copy whereas anthony <UNK> looked like someone you would never think of as being a serial killer vince vaughn is easily imaginable as one he lacks the <UNK> look of <UNK> and his acting chops are clearly inferior as well at least in this role honestly has there ever been an actor who could convey <UNK> as genuinely as anthony <UNK> while it was a pointless re make to begin with the <UNK> of the story's most important character sucks this film down completely br br as a side note i feel that hollywood's <UNK> for re making great movies because <UNK> people refuse to watch anything that's not filmed in color not only stinks to high heaven of corporate greed but is exceptionally <UNK> to the original work as for viewers who can't watch black and white it's their loss hopefully they'll mature sometime in the future and no longer require shiny colours to hold their attention when they do they'll discover that sometimes black and white works far better with the background muted the story and performances are that much more front and center and in many cases the mood or atmosphere created through black and white cinematography is just not <UNK> in colour
<START> i think the <UNK> is pretty <UNK> about this recent tv miniseries it's okay but it's a far cry from <UNK> <UNK> it gets compared to the latter simply because this a prequel to that famous story br br moon is definitely worth a watch for any fan of westerns just don't expect it to be as intense as <UNK> <UNK> steve and karl urban are not robert duvall and tommy lee jones and the characters they play aren't as strong as how duvall and jones portrayed the same two guys some say it's unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison but you have to compare it it's the story of the same two leading texas ranger characters <UNK> call and gus br br the main difference i found was that this prequel is a lot of slower and more the two rangers and their women at times yet i didn't mind that because the two main women were pretty ladies and generally likable and <UNK> people they were played nicely by linda clara forsythe and elizabeth banks maggie they helped make this long movie <UNK> if you've seen pictures of women in the old west none of them looked half as pretty as and banks though they were a joy for these male eyes to <UNK> <UNK> son <UNK> was a wonderful kid too the kind of boy every parent would want br br the most interesting character i thought turned out to be <UNK> <UNK> played by val kilmer as in the western film <UNK> kilmer almost steals the show from the leads <UNK> is really an original if i ever saw one a strange dude indeed br br actually all of the supporting actors in here did a fine job from keith <UNK> to wes <UNK> as buffalo <UNK> i always find <UNK> to be fascinating no matter what role he plays i wish he had had a bigger role in this miniseries br br one thing this film has in common with <UNK> <UNK> and other good westerns the scenery and photography it's just beautiful at times and is a joy to watch we also have an excellent director of this film simon who directed <UNK> <UNK> and an another outstanding tv western <UNK> trail he also did two of my other favorite feature films both based in his home country of australia lap and <UNK> down under br br unfortunately although i enjoyed this moon is nothing as good as the above mentioned films yet i still watched all of it and was sorry it ended if that makes any sense it made me want to watch <UNK> and gus again this time with tommy lee and robert br br note the title page says this is <UNK> minutes that must have included the tv commercials the two disc dvd version i saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes
<START> this film had everything i need in a film women <UNK> violence music by h i m and tony <UNK> the artwork and camera effects in this film is amazing the music in this film is the best i've heard in any other film each track goes so well with its scene i thought the acting was really good considering none of <UNK> crew have been in scripted films before although the whole concept of the film is the story of ryan <UNK> and his girlfriend who is sleeping with <UNK> behind his back is a predictable and age old story they way its acted out is very unpredictable for example <UNK> and the gas tank himself <UNK> breaking <UNK> behind the and all the don <UNK> scenes this films is a must see
<START> minor spoilers br br a woman gets pregnant but not by her husband she develops <UNK> inside her or at least thats what her husband thinks they go through a lot of hard times while she is on the brink of a nervous breakdown the husband contacts an <UNK> professor and with his help they try to find out what is wrong with her br br minor spoilers br br the story could have been a bit better or at least be made less predictable but the movie is catchy and it got me and my sister hooked through the entire movie without a problem the acting is very good and the filming is much better than normal if you compare this to your normal b alien movie the effects are good and something is happening every second of the movie the characters are really likable and apart from a stupid nurse in scene they are all very convincing in their roles br br i thought it was a good movie and can recommend it if you like alien monster <UNK> movies br br 7 10 the story could have been a bit less predictable
<START> a real insult to the original <UNK> which is one of the most genuinely disturbing films and i intend this as a compliment i have seen in the last years br br where the original is chilling and brilliant the remake is flat and even boring especially the happy end finale takes away what little suspense there was in this film in the first place br br while such a <UNK> especially <UNK> a happy end which wasn't there previously is quite frequently the case in hollywood remakes of european art house movies and could've been expected the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this inane mess was created by the very same filmmaker who did the original <UNK> br br why mr <UNK> decided to ruin his masterpiece in such a fashion is beyond me br br avoid this abomination at all cost as it might spoil the original for you even if watched after that let alone the other way round
<START> this is the greatest example i can think of to prove the theory that when hollywood runs out of good ideas they make an awful sequel and ruin the first one now don't get me wrong i absolutely love the first <UNK> i even liked the third one pretty good but this movie is atrocious i am a huge fantasy sword <UNK> movie fan and i hated to see such a terrible sequel made to such a classic as the first <UNK> so why do i hate this movie so much well where do i begin first of all the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous <UNK> and his evil older brother who was nowhere mentioned in the first movie huh cross over into our world via a handy dimensional time <UNK> gate ya see earth just happens to be on the same parallel plane as world whereas with the first movie you're led to think the movie just takes place in the past but with this one you're shown it's a completely whole other world altogether that's just one of the many things i hated about this sequel it didn't work with masters of the universe and it sure doesn't work here either movies like this should take place and stay in their own time line and their usual surroundings for <UNK> sake what's next <UNK> in new york er uh bad example moving on br br after a device called a <UNK> <UNK> to use as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom so it's up to <UNK> his <UNK> his eagle and his tiger not a <UNK> painted one this time to go off and save the world but along the way they have the help of a young cool and hip <UNK> daughter who gets caught up in this whole mess and she show's <UNK> around l a takes him for a <UNK> in her <UNK> and helps get him out of tight situations here and there how convenient right and speaking of convenient i found it awfully convenient and easy for to sneak into a highly <UNK> military base and get away with a stolen highly destructive nuclear weapon even with half the u s army and l a p d after him <UNK> to easy even for an evil barbarian <UNK> from another world there are <UNK> many plot holes in this i don't know where to begin like why did go to the l a <UNK> for at the end of the movie he absolutely has no reason whatsoever to go there and wouldn't that be like the last place you'd lure your greatest enemy who just so happens to have the handy ability to control animals br br and don't you just love these kinds of movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops firing at one guy they still don't manage to hit him the police in this movie belong in the police academy series they are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind even the title of the movie makes no sense <UNK> 2 through the <UNK> of time they never actually went through a time <UNK> because the movie isn't set in the future of world it's set in a parallel world along <UNK> in the <UNK> plane so they never actually go through time only a dimensional world along theirs so no actual time travel is involved at all this movie tries to come off as funny and it does not because of the humor but because it's just so bad and that's putting it mildly the acting dialogue plot characters and ending are all so cheesy it's hilarious what more can i expect from the guy that brought us return of the another bad sequel sorely missed here is don wonderful directing and serious feel of the first one avoid this <UNK> piece of garbage like the <UNK> plague and stick which the first one and maybe the third one if there's nothing better on t v
<START> it's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a <UNK> review of three colors red without letting people in on some of the ideas that has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy the more i see them and think of them and imagine myself in their world the more i get its theme that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion in blue juliette <UNK> played a <UNK> widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected in white an act of cruelty <UNK> an unlikely friendship between two men who will against the odds <UNK> to bring the <UNK> to justice and full circle and now in red all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young model and a retired judge who has a habit of <UNK> into other people's lives br br this young girl is appropriately named valentine a <UNK> irene <UNK> who has this <UNK> about her and even smiles openly while working the <UNK> not that she is without some <UNK> she has a boyfriend unseen who also demands to know what she is doing at all times she has a brother who troubles her and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge <UNK> she strikes a dog while driving and <UNK> her back to health but when she takes her to the owner a retired judge jean louis he does not want her i want nothing he <UNK> says and elements of blue suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man who also lives in <UNK> and apparent free floating freedom <UNK> <UNK> on unsuspecting people this male version of juliette <UNK> character at first shocks valentine she states she can only feel pity for him as she walks away in horror but a chance event has her back at his place and here is when he begins revealing who he is and his great loss br br at the same time is unfolding a parallel story the story of a young man <UNK> jean pierre about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from valentine but they keep missing each other chance is the word like valentine winning the <UNK> at the <UNK> story she visits elements of chance pepper her life and he has a girlfriend who also supplies people with reports about the weather one of them happens to be the old judge he knows more about her than <UNK> does and he's never met her like god or <UNK> he is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of <UNK> and bring a new meaning to the expression we meet again it's this <UNK> between the old and young judge that makes red so beautiful and <UNK> because time is in reality a lot more fluid than we would like to <UNK> it there are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames so many things would be different br br such is the case with valentine and the old judge i believe that there is definitely a strong <UNK> of souls <UNK> them together in a tight bond she is that woman whom he did not meet by chance or not and is whether he knows it or not trying to make <UNK> hence why he goes to the great risk of revealing his <UNK> and becoming the social <UNK> but it doesn't end there one of the many <UNK> between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage <UNK> where julie did not see her and would not have helped her anyhow and fresh from his public <UNK> <UNK> at her thinking someone is worse off than i am valentine is the one who helps her <UNK> in need can happen anywhere and even applies it here in a minor character br br now red is so much more than a story valentine the old judge <UNK> even rita the dog these aren't characters confined by storytelling an american version would ruin the idea and <UNK> chance encounters and even bring forth a <UNK> down ending red is so devoid of a linear defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have <UNK> off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and place br br adding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal this is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films in blue <UNK> husband had a mistress and she also betrays olivier when it's become clear she's emotionally dead in white <UNK> has listen to her <UNK> over the phone which becomes an important device in red as she has sex with a man while the <UNK> of contempt looks on in red the old <UNK> tale of love and betrayal gets re <UNK> and all this time <UNK> <UNK> image <UNK> over them like a of what is to come at the same time that rita the dog <UNK> car struck bears seven <UNK> life <UNK> for the six major players in this complex trilogy obviously filmed with care and love why do i say six you'll have to watch the movie and wonder
<START> i have a strong feeling that what you think of this film will strongly depend on your frame of reference if you've never seen a miyazaki film before then it will probably confuse the heck out of you if you have seen a miyazaki film before then it will still probably confuse the heck out of you but you won't really care that's because i found that the first time i saw one of his animated films i tried too hard to figure out what was happening and why and it <UNK> my enjoyment of the film now that i have seen just about every miyazaki film i see the <UNK> and just take it all in enjoying the beauty of it all in many ways these films at least to western audiences is like drugs lots of strange and beautiful images that don't always initially make sense but sure feel great to see of all the miyazaki films this might have the most unusual and incomprehensible story line even more so than spirited away and princess <UNK> or my neighbor <UNK> but like these and many other studio films if you just sit back and watch you are rewarded with a fabulous tale but because it is so hard to describe and others have already done so i won't even go there br br as for the artwork it's very typical of one of these japanese films though there was one noticeable change there was a very extensive use of what looked like colored <UNK> for the backgrounds this was not a bad thing at all the lovely <UNK> like look was very pleasing and unique in some ways it looked like a tiny bit of bill art style was <UNK> into a typical miyazaki film with a high frame rate exceptional character animation which <UNK> them with tons of personality and a great wow factor this is an exceptional film for all ages though clearly designed more for younger audiences the <UNK> fans especially it is a bit scary here and there during the storm segments but there is plenty of great stuff for adults as an adult at least <UNK> so i loved the cute stuff and applaud the other <UNK> of the film br br a great film among miyazaki's best i don't give it a 10 because i am <UNK> to ever do that plus i did like a few of the <UNK> other films a bit more particularly <UNK> but that doesn't mean you shouldn't rush out now and see it do it and do yourself a favor
<START> this has to be one of the if not the worst movies i have ever seen after watching this piece of sh t i felt as though i should write to madonna and demand <UNK> for my time but now i feel that i should write madonna and demand a great 80s album considering she can't record a good album to save her life anymore in return for this disaster br br on to the movie itself which can be summed up like this br br it consists madonna jumping around acting like a spoiled teenager who lost her way she is trying to impress this absolute <UNK> of an actor who plays the in the movie but the best was the ending i was staring with my jaw on the ground into the television as the credits rolled by thinking to my self that's it that's the ending what a piece of sh t if madonna wasn't a pop icon at the time of this film this movie would have single <UNK> destroyed her career and the funniest thing of the whole situation was that i just watched the damn movie to see where they placed the song who's that girl well guess where they placed it at the end
<START> i got this on a double feature dvd called scream theater and it's no doubt one of the most terrible movies i've ever seen and i've seen some really bad ones <UNK> out and of three girls who if they're teenagers i'd eat my hat are talking about non stop party so of course they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the most strict for a <UNK> party meanwhile a psychotic has escaped the local bug house where one girl's father works is on the loose with sharp objects and wearing green <UNK> and sporting wide open eyes i guess that's to show he's <UNK> of course since he has a bone to pick with that particular doctor off he goes to his house the location of which is apparently common knowledge in the meantime some dumb jock types are <UNK> down beers and out to scare the girls and of course the loony shows up too and starts cutting throats and that's about it as the heavy metal music <UNK> along in the background or maybe that's not it but really that's all you need to know unless you spend your time <UNK> stoned or drunk you'll find little of interest here and even if you are wasted most of the time you'll still probably find your intelligence insulted 1 out of 10
<START> it is more a subtle story of the fact that in indian household how most decisions are taken by the man how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether he can control his desires not to give the woman pleasure and in such a type of scenario women <UNK> have two choices either to accept all this and take it into their own life which is usually the case or not accept this and try to <UNK> things to satisfy themselves which makes a movie br br fire is a brilliantly directed story of the second option which women choose for themselves no sacrifice not to serve anybody else rather a decision for their own good somehow the whole idea of <UNK> <UNK> didn't find an acceptance in the indian audience but if one looks the whole movie from an angle of self expression then the whole debate doesn't even <UNK>
<START> the following review is one from the wrong side of the tracks meaning two things you will hear nothing but <UNK> coming from me and don't be fooled by my rating i also could tell you that this review contains no spoilers but technically that's a lie br br well screw the review i'm just going to <UNK> a bit it has been a while since i had so much fun with such a bad film and if you cannot enjoy this piece of utter drivel then you simply have no sense of humor first off this movie was meant to be taken seriously and that's the main aspect were the fun is coming from the story a doctor's son is <UNK> ill daddy doctor decides that a hart transplant must be the only way of saving his son so in true mad doctor style he decides that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick of course the gorilla heart is much too potent for a human so sonny boy transforms into this hideous ape man that immediately breaks free and goes on a killing and <UNK> spree because that's simply what any horny beast would do isn't it the make up of our ape man is hilarious there's simply no other way of putting it the <UNK> face looks like a turd i'm talking human <UNK> here the solid brown kind beautiful the gore in this flick is wonderful too aside from real footage of an open heart surgery we also have incredibly fake but quite nasty looking blood gore effects a <UNK> an eye <UNK> a throat ripping the of someone's skull it's hilarious and indeed it's quite incomprehensible why night of the bloody apes ever made it to the notorious uk video <UNK> list because all of the nasty things portrayed in this film are simply too ridiculous to be taken seriously oh and there's only one bloody ape running around in it too by the way so needless to say that la is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and convincing tale of science gone horribly wrong br br when not trying to shock with poorly staged acts of bloody violence or random portrayals of female nudity this movie manages to be highly entertaining with ingredients like nonsensical dialogues cheap cardboard sets plot stupidity and incredibly bad acting just a few random examples maybe about the sets one can clearly see that the set <UNK> just used the same walls doors windows etc over and over again to be build various different interior sets e g one side of the hospital room the window side where the unconscious wrestling girl lies looks <UNK> similar like the window side of the basement laboratory from where ape man escapes the set <UNK> also took one of the side windows from the laboratory made it a bit larger and just placed it in the <UNK> room of the hospital all the walls in any building are the same grey ones then there's the setting of the park clearly shot in a studio you can see on several occasions that the grass is loose whenever there's some struggling fighting <UNK> going on the grass just shifts and <UNK> and you can see the grey <UNK> from the studio floor beneath it br br just a few random lines that come out the actors' mouths br br in the <UNK> room where all the doctors are <UNK> the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl a disappearance that would of course mean bad publicity for the hospital daddy doctor intelligently <UNK> we find ourselves in a situation that is difficult br br during that same debate a colleague doctor cleverly remarks a <UNK> any <UNK> gets up <UNK> providing a solid excuse for the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl br br after our investigating detective through the amazing process of his own logical <UNK> concludes and tells his superior that the murderer must be a half man half beast his superior answers that it's absurd adding the line it's more <UNK> that of late more and more you're watching on your television many of those pictures of terror truly one of the best lines of the movie br br other sources of laughter br br the two scenes were daddy doctor and his <UNK> like assistant kidnap the gorilla from the <UNK> and unconscious wrestling girl from the hospital these well thought out acts of <UNK> are like taking candy from a baby br br daddy doctor speaks to god a lot doesn't he br br sonny boy calling daddy doctor <UNK> on more than one occasion br br an old lady screaming <UNK> a dead man a dead man a dead man a dead man br br the plot <UNK> stops to <UNK> in scenes of women wrestling only to go on again and do nothing with that concept sure daddy doctor <UNK> sonny boy's gorilla heart a second time with that of unconscious wrestling girl but do you think something spectacular happens after that like ape turd man growing breasts or something trying to rape men this time our leading living wrestling beauty norma doesn't even go into a climactic wrestling contest with ape turd man near the movie's finale but ape turd man does start to show some <UNK> love near the end almost and i say almost in true king kong style i e the top of a building and people on the ground pointing and screaming br br okay i think that's enough now i <UNK> in more than my two cents here rational rating for this sleazy piece of hilarious dreck 2 10 rating from the wrong side of the tracks 8 10 go see this film people it is well worth it
<START> in general i prefer horror movies that creep me out so much i'm afraid of everything for the next day or so not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an <UNK> monster this is one of those movies the of legend is a dog faced lizard skin <UNK> gray monster that <UNK> like a <UNK> has <UNK> and <UNK> has a row of sharp <UNK> sticking out from its back and sucks the blood of <UNK> as in many horror movies good and bad this movie takes liberty with the legend it not only attacks humans but it eats their intestines and has a <UNK> nearly <UNK> <UNK> so tell me how can a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> its skin when bullets can't and why when the marines figure out that armor <UNK> bullets can hurt it do they split up so the can pick them off one by one john rhys davies gives a performance that rises above the bad movie and simmons and dylan <UNK> deserve credit for their performances too otherwise the rest of the acting was poor to bad just like the rest of the movie my rating is based on rhys davies simmons and <UNK>
<START> now you guys i loved this film though not quite as much as farewell to the king another beloved john <UNK> epic it was fun a lot more than if it were based on a <UNK> williams drama it's a great yarn with a <UNK> of political correctness i love this film for its beautiful photography its humor and its criticism of the bad guys and the real bad guys the <UNK> <UNK> for the world with their repeating <UNK> <UNK> and large <UNK> out there in the harbor br br the standout scene is the <UNK> with blue gray smoke from the cooking fires rising into the chill desert air it is visually <UNK> highly <UNK> br br set in <UNK> <UNK> wind features a helpless american woman <UNK> <UNK> who is taken hostage by a dashing albeit <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sean connery the very model scottish muslim <UNK> the exciting story is based on a few historical facts the photography is <UNK> beautiful <UNK> by jerry <UNK> outstanding score br br mrs and the conduct <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> around in the desert between even though the proudly <UNK> his <UNK> back to the apes he is a perfect gentleman he even lets her keep her head after she beats him at chess a marine <UNK> <UNK> the palace putting out the fires of competing with <UNK> don't mess with the <UNK> <UNK> br br there are many entertaining stereotypes br br despicable <UNK> resembles a <UNK> <UNK> definitely not a liberal br br cruel german officer a large <UNK> <UNK> sporting a <UNK> he chooses to fight the with swords instead of <UNK> him down in the manner of indiana jones <UNK> by way of von br br dashing marine officer kicks the crap out of the of army and <UNK> his palace while chewing <UNK> his speech is mildly the <UNK> him not to breathe on him br br the a <UNK> of <UNK> led by a charming <UNK> none of them take <UNK> except perhaps in <UNK> <UNK> br br president teddy <UNK> is <UNK> portrayed as vacuous and <UNK> with guns toys and stuffed <UNK> bears br br beautiful american widow gives the men a lesson in courage as do her two children she evidently has a huge supply of clean <UNK> clothes and rarely has a hair out of place br br the sends teddy <UNK> a message <UNK> him for the gift of a <UNK> repeating rifle <UNK> br br <UNK> you are the lion and am the breaking wind br br how true br br please do not take my <UNK> remarks to mean that i did not like the film i had almost as much fun writing this as watching da <UNK>
<START> perhaps this movie is a little too long but it still has some charm 45 years later the main roles seem more appropriate for clark gable and <UNK> leigh i could care less about gary cooper but ingrid bergman is fine particularly in dark hair the movie is worth seeing for the supporting cast <UNK> <UNK> is terrific as a servant she is a white woman in <UNK> and can have an expression of evil or of a voodoo mistress jerry austin as a servant dwarf has a delightful role that keeps you <UNK> despite some overlong scenes speaking of scenes <UNK> bates steals most of the ones she is in as a <UNK> social lady i didn't understand the outcome of the <UNK> fight at the end of the movie and the last scene was pure hollywood dreck it's an odd feeling when you realize the film title refers to a <UNK> rather than a piece of <UNK>
<START> french <UNK> is one of my favorite all time movies it's an excellent film there's color there's humor there's music it's a very good portrait of the so called belle though jean <UNK> <UNK> were always to show a creation a so the film isn't a historical movie the final sequences in which the girls dance <UNK> are unforgettable images it's a film you shouldn't miss
<START> i quite this anne rice book adaption while most of the film is filmed here in australia it offers a great amount of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot in <UNK> stuart <UNK> has recently woke up from a long period time of sleep and has decided to <UNK> his vampire <UNK> by revealing himself to a band when he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires go mad and plot his death meanwhile jesse <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> member of the supernatural studies who has an ancient vampire family tree has become deeply obsessed with <UNK> her boss david paul <UNK> understands her obsession and his obsession with the vampire <UNK> vincent <UNK> who is an ancient vampire and the man who made <UNK> a vampire too jesse is given diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the queen of the damned <UNK> when <UNK> holds a concert in death valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there may come as well meanwhile has other plans she goes to a vampire <UNK> a bar and kills everyone in her path with <UNK> tempted with and loving care by the ancient vampires <UNK> of <UNK> and aunt lena <UNK> plot against them join her or die br br i thought the film was fantastic it had great fight scenes great music and great locations <UNK> sadly passed away in a plane crash shortly before the films premiere but she looked stunning on the set and off the sets br br i gave this film 10 10 because it was a fantastic film and i urge you to see it
<START> this is an unfortunately <UNK> classic br br the look is superb the design costumes etc are flawless the post battle scenes and the <UNK> charge are both chilling and exciting br br the characters are vivid and really human <UNK> is right and <UNK> as the lawyer steals the movie with his clever <UNK> <UNK> like performance <UNK> in the ups and downs of <UNK> <UNK> depardieu is good but perhaps too large a presence for this role br br where the film really excels is the story and also its changes from <UNK> <UNK> those changes are <UNK> in that <UNK> has lots of discussion on society and this film <UNK> with characters nevertheless <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> the key <UNK> not just the missing man trying to regain his place in society but every character has to find their place in society the <UNK> is trying to buy a his wife <UNK> comes from a <UNK> birth and when she was married to colonel <UNK> they achieved their position in the <UNK> of post revolutionary france everyone has something to lose in terms of status and that makes for a good drama as their <UNK> are in conflict with each other br br it also feels very modern money is critical to buy status to reach power but someone can go down as quickly as they go up enjoys the <UNK> he has seen the worst of people he says to <UNK> when he takes the case this original place is at the end of the <UNK> as <UNK> sums up the human comedy with huge irony
<START> john wayne's first starring role just blew me away <UNK> <UNK> style on <UNK> i had to check and make sure i had the right date sure enough this 1930 film was made using a <UNK> <UNK> wide screen process aside from that it features some of the <UNK> most realistic footage of the trek west i've seen <UNK> men and animals are really <UNK> down a cliff face by rope trees are chopped by <UNK> men and <UNK> women so the train can move another 10 feet the indians are not the pretty boy city <UNK> who portrayed them later they're the real deal a river crossing in a driving rain storm is so realistic it has to be real in fact i understand that director <UNK> walsh nearly lost the entire cast during this sequence i could smell the wet <UNK> each day is an agony the various sub plots are forgettable but the film as a whole is not i can't think of another title that can beat the big trail in <UNK> a sense of living history on the trail to <UNK> bravo
<START> this is officially the terrible boring corny and ridiculous movie ever created the movie is all about a crazy kid and his friends and they land a <UNK> his dreams are very corny and make no sense at all and is very poorly done every special effect looks as if it was done without any modern technology and might have been created by the kid that plays the leading role in the movie if you watch this movie it will definitely make you <UNK> i advise you to never consider watching this movie and if you do good luck and don't miss the brain cells you killed off my comment does not even fully grasp the awful creation from hell that has been made the person that wrote the comment before me did not watch the same movie that i dreadfully watched and wish i never watched peace
<START> thirty per <UNK> of this movie appears to be the prototype for the map channel you see a giant map for about ten minutes then they <UNK> the stock footage big time while <UNK> <UNK> get it on about radar apparently there's a lot of radar stations in the far north protecting north america's borders from attacks by deadly polar bears the bears never show up but a giant <UNK> does it was frozen in the ice for over a million years or so until it was released by an <UNK> somewhere else in the world yeah right for my money it was released by global warming it is a huge <UNK> <UNK> and it needs lots of food since there aren't any <UNK> in the frozen north it decides to feast on the most like creatures it can find up there i e human beings it starts attacking radar stations probably because the <UNK> from the radar <UNK> was getting on its nerves br br enter <UNK> joe the resident smarmy guy of the film he's investigating a plane that went down and is puzzled why there are no bodies in the <UNK> the only thing he finds is one of the <UNK> of the <UNK> apparently it decided to <UNK> its nails while it was <UNK> on the <UNK> crew takes the claw tip back with him to be <UNK> by a thousand year old scientist br br grandpa scientist can't make heads or <UNK> of the claw mostly because he's missed his <UNK> so his mind isn't <UNK> too well so he calls in a smug <UNK> played by the guy who was the p i in perry mason he and his friend a <UNK> photographer fly north because he's decided that the claw must have come from a praying <UNK> just one the size of a <UNK> train br br it's luke warm love at first sight when <UNK> first sets eyes on the she male photographer the men at the base obviously having been <UNK> for many years think she's the <UNK> thing to come along since <UNK> <UNK> smug science guy and smarmy soldier guy start working together to track the path of the <UNK> which has <UNK> some stock footage of an <UNK> village it comes to the base looking for an after dinner <UNK> and <UNK> some cheap sets quite effectively then it flies south and disappears br br now comes the tense hours when the <UNK> ground <UNK> core are called on to <UNK> the <UNK> looking for anything large flying <UNK> i doubt that in reality they would have been told that they were looking for a giant flying <UNK> that eats human beings since that would <UNK> caused a panic probably they were told to look for a giant that was painted green and because its engine was out of tune br br <UNK> goes up in a plane to try to shoot the <UNK> down and <UNK> the mission the <UNK> lands in new york city probably because it wanted to take in a show on broadway or visit sex world in times square the army <UNK> it in the tunnel and and his men don stupid suits that they borrowed from the man to go in and try to blow the <UNK> up success well almost since the <UNK> is still <UNK> enough that it almost kills the eve <UNK> photographer lady there's a tepid love scene at the end and the <UNK> takes a picture of the dead <UNK> because colonel hair grease and ms gender <UNK> are busy <UNK> so kind of a nauseating ending
<START> with a catchy title like the butcher of this ed <UNK> variation and kane <UNK> playing him will no doubt fly off the shelves for a couple of weeks most viewers will be bored silly with this latest take on the life of ed br br the movie focuses on <UNK> rampage and gives us a few glimpses into his and <UNK> in its these scenes that give the movie a much needed <UNK> br br what ruins this is the constant focus on other characters lives and focuses less on <UNK> big mistake here br br kane <UNK> is a strange choice to play <UNK> but he does pull it off quite well and deserves more acting credits than he gets these days barnes and <UNK> also show up br br 3 10
<START> again i've read all of the comments posted here and agree with the many intelligent ones but totally disagree with those who think it was is <UNK> br br personally i think nuclear is about the only energy left to us unless our <UNK> <UNK> and states increase the <UNK> thinking <UNK> will use photo cells on their <UNK> many attractive and <UNK> homes in southern are designed and built to take advantage of the <UNK> energy around the sun i live in a <UNK> which is exposed to total <UNK> on its roof the entire day i hardly use the <UNK> i'm sure it would <UNK> too much electricity to <UNK> the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees <UNK> we are blessed with dry heat in this part of the country i'm from the <UNK> coast of the usa so i know about <UNK> br br that said i found the china syndrome to be a convincing movie about what could go wrong if the industry is not busy and <UNK> nuclear plants i think there are enough comments posted here to <UNK> those who still fear it like the plague they are safe is still on line br br director james bridges carefully <UNK> this plot by mike gray t s cook to build suspense and to a <UNK> interesting film all the roles were well played jane fonda <UNK> wells jack lemmon jack and producer michael douglas richard adams are all excellent in their roles plus all of the rest of the cast i too loved there being no score it was so interesting to get a true to life glimpse of the behind the scenes of the tv industry that shouldn't be surprising currently dan rather is sue ing cbs and i hope he wins can you believe donald <UNK> saying he's a loser <UNK> who cares posted a very good comment here i agree it is my opinion that getting <UNK> by a nuclear <UNK> is much better than living in a world which has been wasted and becomes blade runner and or green come away from your video games for a couple of hours and watch this dated movie really isn't and get a little education on nuclear energy i recommend it to the whole family
<START> looks as if the <UNK> writer has been <UNK> <UNK> the this is a very solid horror action movie about a man set up in an accident to be used in cruel experiment anyone who have seen <UNK> knows the story watch out for pam <UNK> as a bitchy and darn good looking assassin this highly effective violent and bloody horror movie may not be to <UNK> liking but this canadian outing is well worth seeking out for anyone who is fan of the genre 8 10
<START> this movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason definitely not a well made movie so unbelievable the scenes where the president <UNK> were downtown and walking among the people were a farce there would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 <UNK> of the president in that situation in real life if it wasn't for the blood and profanity this was shot like a tv movie it could have been decent if it was done differently <UNK> president talents were never realized in this movie <UNK> acting is okay the production values in this movie leave a lot to be desired overall i think most people would be better off not wasting time to watch this affair
<START> in an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences <UNK> on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good it is <UNK> to look back at john carpenter's 1982 <UNK> the thing which itself is a remake of a childhood favorite of the director's howard <UNK> 1951 sci fi horror classic the thing from outer space although carpenter's film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid 1982 it has since garnered a very large following br br in fact carpenter's film is less of a remake of <UNK> film than it is a <UNK> as he goes back to the original idea <UNK> by the source material namely the john w campbell story who goes there in which a us scientific crew in <UNK> is <UNK> by a shape changing alien out from the ice after 100 000 years kurt russell who had starred for carpenter in the director's 1979 tv movie elvis and the 1981 film escape from new york heads a cast of <UNK> character actors including keith david donald <UNK> richard and richard in this tension filled exploration of paranoia as the shape changing thing which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a norwegian team is trying to kill takes over each of them one by one it isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to <UNK> his fellow man the ending of the film in which russell and david are the only ones left has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar to both the birds and straw dogs br br almost universally when the subject of the thing is bought up the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make up and alien designs created by rob <UNK> who had worked with carpenter on the 1980 horror classic the fog and on joe <UNK> 1981 werewolf film the howling these effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic and even today they can also be quite stomach turning but all of this would make carpenter's film nothing more than a high end splatter epic if the direction the story and the acting weren't up to snuff and thankfully each of them are when he's not <UNK> on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences carpenter builds suspense in the same hitchcock influenced way that informed his previous films halloween and the fog with cinematographer dean <UNK> <UNK> camera work particularly through the corridors of the station a significant help the acting enhances an already fine screenplay adaptation by bill <UNK> and we are also given a taut score by <UNK> <UNK> whose work on director sergio <UNK> classic 1960s italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all including of course carpenter himself the thing also features additional fine visual effects from albert <UNK> who worked on many hitchcock films including the birds and roy who worked on close encounters of the third kind and jaws 2 br br carpenter's film was not the success it could have been because universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released steven spielberg's far more family friendly e t the extra <UNK> not surprisingly critics and audiences at the time <UNK> spielberg's excellent film over carpenter's equally excellent but exceedingly different one also most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another spielberg produced film <UNK> as a result at a cost of 15 million the thing suffered from lack of attention in its time br br over time however many have come to see carpenter's film for what it is an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story though it is still quite gruesome the thing should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make up effects for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis
<START> the movie isn't too bad up until br br the main problem is with the ending so it's a pretty major spoiler br br for the time it was made it's a beautiful movie and does get a lot of it right br br however br br in the book sam succeeds and lives his dream whereas in the movie he gives up and goes back to the city completely destroying the you can do what you put your mind to theme of the book br br this movie is a <UNK> and instead of <UNK> classics that don't need <UNK> the hollywood types who haven't any better ideas should do this one right this time
<START> if you are a fan of slap stick that has terrible writing awful acting and cliche after cliche this one is for you br br there is far too much to list for the reasons why this movie sucks in a brief synopsis people with a combined iq of 100 journey to new mexico on a race for 200 million dollars and yes they are all apparently super heroes as they can do many things such as jump onto trains that are traveling 80 <UNK> survive numerous car crashes and endless instances of outright cartoonish <UNK> and <UNK> antics br br if you are a teen or dont want to think for a movie this one is for you not one actor outside of <UNK> is <UNK> at all <UNK> saves the movie from a 1 with the hitler bit br br 2 10 save yourself the 2 hours of pain and 4
<START> yes it is a bit cheesy but it's suspenseful and entertaining and one of my favorites there are some excellent actors in the film and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters it's interesting to see david soul in a <UNK> <UNK> role i thought he was quite believable and rather chilling as the ever more paranoid co robert conrad is a long time favorite i think he brings his character to life very well and sam <UNK> has been star quality in everything of his i've watched movies or tv br br i watch this movie every so often but our tape a vhs tv copy i got is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it this is a movie i think they should put out on dvd maybe it wouldn't be universally sought after but i'm sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be a market for a dvd version i'll keep hoping
<START> i found this little gem as an extra feature on my dvd of <UNK> der des allen grey and didn't expect all that much from it it looked like it might be an interesting little short though so i turned it on br br i am so glad that i did it was really incredible despite having been made more than 70 years ago the animation was in my view better than some of that done today with all the computer effects and experience available now br br the story is quite simple a newly put together toy dog hears its <UNK> <UNK> about not being able to afford an orange and goes on a quest to find her one in the process it runs into a underworld with all sort of <UNK> creatures and toys <UNK> by none other than the devil himself who all want the <UNK> orange for themselves as well br br this film <UNK> but reminds me a lot of mad monster party 1969 jules bass a movie which i have always really enjoyed and to a lesser extent some of tim <UNK> animated works the nightmare before christmas 1993 henry <UNK> and corpse bride 2005 tim burton fans of any of these movies will i am sure also love the <UNK> br br overall an incredible piece of short animation which is well worth watching
<START> i can't believe i actually bought this movie it sucks where i live mexican movies mexican movies are never advertised or even available you can't find them in the regular rental places so i had to buy it i really like mexican movies they bring me closer to my roots and my people and they are way different that what your normally used to but this one was <UNK> predictable your could guess what was going to happen <UNK> not a horrible movie it just wasn't worth what i paid for it <UNK> but if you have time and are truly bored then yeah u should watch it but if you love mexican movies and love theater itself then don't watch it it'll be painful lol
<START> do yourself a favor and stay away from this film minus 50 billion out of 10 if you want hard boiled action don t rent it if you want a good independent film look elsewhere br br i never thought i d see burt reynolds in such a crappy movie it has the <UNK> plot line ever van <UNK> flicks should win an academy compared to this one br br rob lowe once again prove why he is not the <UNK> actor in the world even <UNK> would have made a better drug addict than him i do not want to bore you with more facts about this crappy movie except to say that you are better off renting anything by hulk hogan or dolph this should prove my point if you get my drift br br
<START> hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally have not seen this movie i mean there were <UNK> plot holes and under <UNK> cast shoddy special effects i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio a high school drama club could probably come out with a better product i mean they had erika <UNK> who is gorgeous casper van <UNK> and under rated actor their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this <UNK> don't they read scripts i still cant believe that tiny <UNK> was a survivor in the movie i was <UNK> my head the whole time at why him and not a <UNK> of van <UNK> be the last man standing i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light of day
<START> well it is about 1 000 years in the future and we have finally <UNK> traveling the vast distance between <UNK> but sadly we still use guns that shoot bullets black men are still calling each other brothers and getting high stoned fighting etc common stereotypical urban black men are still getting the short end of the stick babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they're from <UNK> share close quarters with the <UNK> and crew crippled people still require <UNK> to move no fancy <UNK> <UNK> or robotic legs dracula still looks and acts gay need i go on in short this move was shot on a typical sci fi set low budget props actors and no real special effects to speak of the beginning the middle and the ending was pathetic i have to go off and shoot myself now there is nothing left to live for
<START> while this is horribly dated i must insist please no remake frankly it just won't help as there's nothing which could be added or changed to make this <UNK> better br br the novel upon which this is based was atmospheric well written truly spooky work but on film it just doesn't translate most of king's written masterpieces fail to translate to film i'm not sure why this is but when you view this work if you view it you are likely to see just what i mean br br the book it's wonderful it's not a masterpiece but it's more than just entertaining br br the movie do something else you can thank me later br br it rates a 3 1 10 from br br the fiend
<START> my <UNK> gave me this dvd with friends like these the front cover looked quite scary thought i'd watch it what a bloody mistake br br basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends br br the first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him the second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a clone in his <UNK> and the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic arm br br the dvd case rated this film 18 but even a 5 year old can watch this and not be or entertained the film should be rated 12 for slight scares and the swear word bloody br br all in all this film is utter <UNK> don't go near it
<START> this short film doesn't get there <UNK> and not very funny attempt at dark humor humor isn't funny enough to get you interested and the protagonist isn't likeable so you really don't care about what happens anyway producer spent some money on this flop and it shows in the production value which is the only saving grace
<START> well this movie certainly was in keeping with the current times no happy endings super heroes or <UNK> here just down to earth fiction to <UNK> our minds along the lines of terrorism and what <UNK> kudos to <UNK> and for an excellent screenplay and superb direction by <UNK> films like this are needed to keep us aware of what is out there if every peace loving man and woman on earth reported obviously suspicious activities i believe terrorism could not <UNK> this movie showed just how hard it really is to <UNK> these terrorists even with good intelligence even though the film is a bit <UNK> against islam the use of a muslim police officer as a main character i believe it was entirely realistic there was meant to be shock value in the bombing incident as a very clever tool to <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of people caught up in an attack such as this they showed full nudity of women being post attack it didn't take me long to realize that this was meant to even further <UNK> into the viewer that thought i e we are not in control of everything in a situation like this although this took place in london with the usual high level british acting it makes a statement for any part of the world great movies don't have to be blockbuster epic productions and this movie is very very worthy of viewing
<START> this is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen and believe me i have seen a lot of movies the unbelievable twist the movie makes going from an extremely bad alien <UNK> inhabit earth movie with sickening bad acting to a film that tries to spread an judgement day is at hand seek jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery <UNK> of hell message left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes even religious christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this i didn't know what to do with myself when i watched the horrible acting that could have been performed by 7 year olds simply disgusting i am not a christian nor very religious but if i had been i would no longer be afraid of hell rich has shown be something much much worse
<START> this is what <UNK> me about critics and their opinion i usually do take in what the critics say about a film on most occasions before i see a movie br br however i saw this one without knowing anything about it mainly because of the cast kevin spacey and don cheadle are two of the most acclaimed and in my opinion best actors alive and ryan <UNK> is on a fast <UNK> journey up there as well his reality and humanity which he exudes in most of his portrayals makes the audience truly believe in the character and whats happening to him he's really my favourite actor of my generation i've always found <UNK> malone pretty cute ever since <UNK> <UNK> and if she chooses to keep doing similar roles then heck i ain't complaining br br back to my point this movie really moved me i believed it the acting was top class as one would expect the actually movie left the audience with the ultimate aim of a good movie reflection and <UNK> which ensues after the final credits roll i think i must watch it again to <UNK> how this movie was <UNK> <UNK> i know that their reviews must be taken with a <UNK> of salt at least i know now
<START> the <UNK> runner is one of those modern epics that one is occasionally <UNK> with <UNK> two <UNK> multiple family generations and many decades this film touches on a <UNK> of items including friendship love loss and ultimately redemption br br it's prime <UNK> is young <UNK> a native <UNK> boy who often plays with the hired help mainly young <UNK> ahmad khan a boy who's family is supposedly inferior to the <UNK> <UNK> but the two form a bond of friendship based on education <UNK> teaches <UNK> to read <UNK> in house and of course <UNK> flying br br but bad times are on the way for the city of <UNK> the <UNK> are <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> have separated due to an <UNK> brutal act of prejudice by an <UNK> boy against <UNK> the two may never see each other again br br father races to get himself and his son out of afghanistan eventually finding their way to america here the two set up a gas station and live hand to mouth by selling at <UNK> <UNK> and as father gradually becomes ill a new revelation will strike to the heart of <UNK> one that he cannot ignore and requires his return to his beloved <UNK> br br a study of friendship war and <UNK> the <UNK> runner is truly a fantastic piece of cinema the story is never <UNK> spoken in english whenever we're in a foreign country and only broken english whenever we're in america this was refreshing and <UNK> itself to a sense of realism br br the acting was on par with the best you'll see too particular note must be made of who plays <UNK> <UNK> father and strong <UNK> also lead as the older <UNK> is played well especially when returning to <UNK> to find it in ruin quite the contrast from when he'd left br br the cinematography of afghanistan during escape and ultimate return are nothing short of breathtaking with snow <UNK> peaks that will cause your mouth to <UNK> i'm not sure exactly which mountain range they used in the film but wherever it was i want to go there and film it myself but it isn't the cinematography nor the acting of one or two people that makes this film a success it is a simple story told very well that makes it worth any movie <UNK> while highly recommended
<START> something strange is happening in <UNK> <UNK> the water is crystal clear nor cold a giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills <UNK> what is this movie first i love reading stories about sea monsters in general when i saw this for sale i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws no it was terrible the story was pointless acting was 100 garbage the only up side was the cool mechanical they used it was full of <UNK> wrong locations and bad everything not worth your while just leave it on the shelf or garbage can you found it on on second note this film was shot in not <UNK> <UNK> a major <UNK> to fans
<START> aussie shakespeare for 18 24 set with blood blood and more blood and good dose of nudity this will not be for every one on may levels to violent for some too cheap for most done on low budget they try and do there best but it only works <UNK> and this <UNK> just seem to be lacking its just not compelling although there is some good acting on the part of most you don't get into there heads especially the best performance came from gary sweet and the strangest mick molly if your into shakespeare then see it but if you like your cheese mature you will love it it not a bad film but it not that good either sam would of loved it that is if it was filmed as a western i was expecting a lot from this as i loved <UNK> but this is was a <UNK> effort
<START> after seeing a texas tale of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> efforts by cox could not even afford the massive <UNK> <UNK> directed with no budget it tells a story about dedication sweat <UNK> fire and punk rock i love it my favorite parts are the interviews with <UNK> she's such a hot baby babe and she <UNK> me but she just doesn't know it yet the japanese clerk his lines that <UNK> me up the sex scene was really cool i am going to see if <UNK> will come over sometime and do the box light wave thing when i'm doing it with my woman the intro and of course my 5 seconds during closing credits i know thats going to get me some chicks i hope to see more from because i know i can expect the unexpected
<START> this is one of my all time favorite cheap corny vampire b movies br br <UNK> <UNK> underwear model oh i mean <UNK> the good vampire returns to <UNK> to <UNK> the throne of <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> half brother has other plans having killed their father the vampire king now sets his sights on <UNK> <UNK> new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends and the all powerful br br okay the scenery is beautiful and it should be as it was shot on location in <UNK> for gosh <UNK> the actresses are no great shakes and <UNK> the heroic vampire is about as charming as a <UNK> <UNK> poker but who cares there's only one reason to watch this movie and his name is he's a physical homage to <UNK> and he has the best lines in the movie all spoken in the <UNK> voice of a man who <UNK> ten packs of <UNK> a day the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film as slowly approaches the camera and reveals his <UNK> <UNK> face for the world to see i found myself cheering him on as he <UNK> victims and <UNK> his perfect brother but maybe i'm just a <UNK> questionable taste in men aside i highly recommend this film to vampire <UNK> it's original it's fun and is one of the best vampires i've seen in a long time much more fun than the stiff tragic whining undead <UNK> that endlessly grace the horror screens these days enjoys his <UNK> and never <UNK> he's what a vampire should be
<START> i have read almost all the books by now and have seen the musical production in two different languages i absolutely <UNK> everything that i have been <UNK> previously but lately i've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy i still have couple of books left but they are either in <UNK> or they are the sequels which i am not in a hurry to read so an idea <UNK> on me sink me there are movies which i have not watched thus i must watch them immediately br br the first five minutes of these series were acceptable in fact i quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the <UNK> however different it had seemed it went all downhill from there though was too <UNK> and i <UNK> too old for this role not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful either or and what was that with random bed scene featuring him it was way too creepy wasn't his only love the <UNK> <UNK> and his only interest his job and his only obsession sir <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> woman in france <UNK> woman in europe i think not although whatever compelled her to break into the study of sir <UNK> i haven't the <UNK> idea and whatever my lord tony has done to deserve this death yes every member of the league did <UNK> his life to sir <UNK> but he would have never <UNK> any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger and if by any means he had to <UNK> his companion he would have done that <UNK> not just move on as if nothing had happened which brings me to another point sir <UNK> his portrayal was most dreadful he was neither a lazy <UNK> nor a <UNK> and <UNK> hero who is a master of <UNK> nor did he care too much about his <UNK> of that word alone made my ears bleed and with his own hands he had never killed anyone so what was that with him randomly walking around and <UNK> people br br the costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well this is post revolutionary france we are talking about not pre revolutionary people in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily it was all just <UNK> br br although i must admit after i watched other parts my opinion did change slightly watching it as a separate work independent of scarlet <UNK> series it was tolerable just your other average hero in the mask but for what they tried to pass it it is still miserable
<START> <UNK> almighty continues the mainstream bruce almighty franchise this time with <UNK> turned <UNK> <UNK> from buffalo <UNK> <UNK> steve carell at it's center a wholly <UNK> and not even really self <UNK> man god morgan freeman decides to <UNK> some sort of quest upon <UNK> in order to illustrate the importance of kindness so that <UNK> can change the world aka pay it forward br br think of <UNK> almighty as a wholesome derivative of gentlemen ' <UNK> is not a con but his colleague <UNK> long john goodman wants his <UNK> support on a bill that essentially is <UNK> to the environment and well meaning <UNK> knowing the importance of <UNK> and <UNK> is willing to support him br br in addition with the new job comes more responsibility and <UNK> is in a sense <UNK> for not spending enough time with his family br br so god decides to give <UNK> <UNK> some <UNK> by forcing him to become the modern day <UNK> his orders build an <UNK> except while it may be mildly humorous to see <UNK> transformation to the weirdo with a beard o there doesn't seem to be much point to this whole thing which becomes <UNK> <UNK> when the climax of the film <UNK> spoilers if none of the population is killed by the <UNK> then what was the point of <UNK> the animals or at least the ones that obviously weren't from suburban virginia or more importantly if all <UNK> had to realize was that <UNK> projects <UNK> in their quality then why did he have to build an <UNK> br br so although a comedy like this <UNK> be a hysterical laugh riot it was certainly one made far less enjoyable as it was <UNK> with far too many <UNK> and not all from morgan freeman and action that seemed intended for a film of more epic events
<START> i <UNK> this little piece of on the <UNK> tales of voodoo dvd label quite where the voodoo is supposed to fit in i have no idea indeed i would not usually connect voodoo with <UNK> anyway let alone with <UNK> br br i know and love <UNK> movies i have seen most of them i could not therefore resist this little known gem from the description given to it on the cover br br it is appalling you cannot have a <UNK> movie if the women keep their clothes on even in the shower although it gives a nod to the exploitation genre <UNK> without nudity is like a big mac without the <UNK> br br as my gym teacher used to say on the whole i'd rather be at the disco
<START> this movie is the last straw in a list of films i have seen this week that have pushed me over the edge and forced me to join imdb and spread some warning to the public it was absolutely horrible the film was drawn out and painfully boring the sound effects and even picture quality seemed like they came from <UNK> 1988 or maybe even conan the barbarian 1982 the battle of was absolutely absurd this largest filmed <UNK> of medieval battle ever staged in the british <UNK> made me <UNK> there wasn't even a coherent <UNK> at all just a few guys with spears and horses running right through them the scenes of douglas especially in the last battle were simply horrible as was most of the acting in the film
<START> i've tried to <UNK> why so many bad reviews of this film while the vast majority of reviews are given a rating of between 7 and 10 the reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in a positive review although a few have done that quite nicely already this film is confusing depressing and doesn't have a happy ending i still gave x a rating of 10 because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film that is really my favorite kind of filmmaking i've only seen two of <UNK> films this one and sang as with this film i'm being somewhat pretentious when i call this one of <UNK> best films but i am <UNK> has a <UNK> style if that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring then it would be best not to watch this but x was less <UNK> than sang so it had quite a lot of intensity for a thriller at least for my taste i found it quite interesting and absorbing the two lead roles did an excellent job acting i mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister catherine d is always great but her role was not very large or significant in the story but everyone did a fine job i thought the cult stuff was great it may have not been very believable but that is due to its being rather abstract there is a lot going on between the lines in this film this is a very <UNK> psycho thriller
<START> this movie was amazing i was in tears by the end of the movie okay i know the acting sucked but that's not what was important the message came through loud and clear about god's love for us and <UNK> sacrifice the movie was realistic and showed actual human feelings whether it be <UNK> anger of the blond girl's <UNK> or the guy that asked questions but it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with christ the cars were awesome and the actors were very hot and that attracted my eye but what i liked most about this movie was the clear <UNK> message the mother and <UNK> supported ben in his new walk with christ and tried to be a <UNK> example to others <UNK> d showed that no matter if you have all the world has to offer without christ it doesn't matter nina showed how a misguided but good person can easily miss the mark i loved this movie and think that it will bring many teenagers to christ
<START> this review contains a huge spoiler but i don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away i saw revenge a while ago br br now you might think it's just a rip off of child's play indeed there are similarities br br however <UNK> was a possessed doll who works <UNK> of the kid it is possible that is possessed with a demon or cursed or something however the puppet itself is actually completely <UNK> the kid is insane and the kid is the one killing people everyone including the audience the survivors and the kid herself thinks it's the doll but it's the kid br br the nudity is almost a pity because otherwise i could tell everyone to see it because it really is an interesting horror movie
<START> this film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead there's a lot of <UNK> <UNK> about the internet i e if you <UNK> a program on the computer you see dead folks much like if you play a <UNK> you'll die in <UNK> frankly most of this seemed rather silly and lost me what i did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence being totally alone for eternity this was <UNK> and fascinating br br i love japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most americans however one genre that has become popular in recent years that i just can't relate to very well are these horror films i know they are super popular especially since they seem to be remade so often in the states i've seen both <UNK> as well as the ring <UNK> on and the grudge and was rather <UNK> despite their popularity about the only recent horror film i really liked from japan was a <UNK> of the great british film on a wet afternoon and what do i think made different well unlike the other films as well as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience instead the emphasis was on the story the bottom line is that these other films are a lot like american films like halloween or friday 13th with scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary at best for me i want story not cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the film br br with a relatively high rating i know i am in the minority but i just don't find this a very satisfying film all too often minor things occur that might <UNK> someone slightly but the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say this is the scariest film ever made so you'd better start shaking well i think it just tries too hard and i wish it had focused more on the <UNK> seen at the end of the film and plot progression not scare tactics
<START> an exquisite film they just don't make them like this any more we on an upper middle class family in <UNK> in the early part of the 20th century they are <UNK> an after christmas dinner for their friends and relatives their table talk is just <UNK> <UNK> but it is so well written that one is <UNK> away from the dinner table some fine piano playing helps to create an intimate atmosphere as if one were there as one of the guests perhaps a bit too perfect for an amateur player the odd mistake here and there would have added to the magic of this film no real story but real entertainment and an object lesson for up and coming film makers
<START> the cure is an outstanding real life drama that deals with a very sensitive subject it is the story of the profound and dear friendship between two boys eric and <UNK> the latter has acquired aids from a blood <UNK> thus he and his mom <UNK> <UNK> have become <UNK> <UNK> by the public and labeled as dangerous company basically due to a common lack of public knowledge of the disease br br when eric brad known from 'the and and his mom move into the house next to them he has to deal with public insults and the fear of catching aids himself however eric <UNK> his fear and risks everything at first he starts talking to <UNK> but eventually he climbs over the fence and joins the witty boy played by jurassic <UNK> joseph and his games very quickly he develops a real friendship with <UNK> who is <UNK> built and <UNK> due to his condition br br the central theme of the movie  the theme which makes it <UNK> authentic and tragic at the same time  is how eric and <UNK> try to find the ultimate cure at first they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves  which is very naive but also genuine at the same time as it shows how young kids deal with such <UNK> <UNK> and how strongly they still believe in the magic of the world when they hear about an alleged cure which has been developed in the south they do not hesitate and take off for an adventure that will bring them even closer together and <UNK> the ultimate quest for hope br br so they board a raft and head on the <UNK> river what starts as a real adventure becomes a dangerous <UNK> which is emotionally intriguing and <UNK> at the same time the scene when <UNK> reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe where everything is dark and cold eric hands him his <UNK> a symbol that wherever the boy may have to go eric is and will always be with him he will never have to be alone this sequence which is one of the most compelling ones of the movie features a very convincing interaction between the two actors who manage to avoid awkward and corny dialogs and deliver a very genuine performance that is eventually <UNK> in its <UNK> and honesty br br i will not go any further in <UNK> the plot as i do not intend to give away too much information the ending however is emotionally tough and makes the audience so much a part of the tragedy that everyone who watches the movie will feel personally affected this aspect makes this movie so strong so outstanding and so convincing the emotional burden on every character is so real and so <UNK> that even the <UNK> members of the audience might need some <UNK> br br a 10 is doing justice to this movie and is not too high a rating there is hardly any other movie i have seen in my life so far that handles such an emotional issue with so much wit and sensibility it is the story of how two boys make each other's life <UNK> and how they teach each other lessons of life thus <UNK> <UNK> his isolation and sadness and eric learns what really counts in life and both of them realize how much of a gift real friendship is when it comes to the hardest moments of life br br this movie is tragic  but its message is sheer inspiration
<START> if you watched pulp fiction don't see this movie this movie is not funny this is the worst parody movie ever this is a poor attempt of parody films br br the cast is bad the film is bad this is one of the worst pictures ever made br br i do not recommend <UNK> fiction i prefer the original pulp fiction by the great quentin tarantino this is one of the worst parody films ever made br br <UNK> fiction is not a good movie it is not funny it is so dumb and vulgar
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is the story of a little boy who becomes a <UNK> the animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film br br i laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie mostly at the concept after that the joke wore thin as a 15 20 minute animated short <UNK> <UNK> would have been a classic instead this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long br br voiced by ludicrous does have several crude and funny one liners unfortunately that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story eventually i grew as bored with his remarks as i did the rest of this movie br br i am a big fan of south park and other animation aimed at adults i also play several online <UNK> games so i am partial to stories about <UNK> the transition from little boy to <UNK> <UNK> was brilliant but after that both the story and dialog became redundant and predictable br br i give this movie a five it is worth watching for the great concept and voice acting just do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed
<START> just got out of an advance screening and wow was this movie hilarious possibly better than the first one but at least its equal if you don't like jackass or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity way more than in the first then stay far far away but if you dig the whole jackass thing then this movie will not disappoint toro <UNK> is the greatest invention ever ok so my review wasn't long enough all else i have to say is poor poor <UNK> they really kick the crap out of him in this so if you enjoy <UNK> humor and prolific male nudity and by far the most disgusting female nudity ever john waters is involved need i say more then this movie will keep you in <UNK> for it entirety i never stopped laughing and actually came out <UNK> in sweat
<START> yes the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child it was called on this particular cover with the <UNK> men turned inside out it even featured this <UNK> looking <UNK> on the cover as well that made all sorts of cool gory images run through my mind perhaps some sort of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn off maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the rampage yes all these thoughts ran through my mind one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore this movie is really more like the island of dr <UNK> than anything else and quite frankly that movie bored me too it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes these films are to much figure stuff out and not enough blood for my tastes yes i know i have strange tastes but i can not help it i like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is really neither
<START> its difficult to be too tough on brad sykes a hard working guy doing what he loves there is an honesty about him that seems often lacking with other <UNK> directors check out the <UNK> crew credits on camp blood there is none of the usual <UNK> everyone down to the pizza joint they ate in its brad and his buddies and thats it no pretentious rubbish jennifer isn't your average horror flick heroine but does well enough for you to hardly notice <UNK> looks like a star and joseph <UNK> is so funny it hurts the clown is hardly an original horror film bad guy but the design is good <UNK> <UNK> does a decent job of bringing him to life and the image <UNK> nicely with the rural backdrop camp blood is horror as blue collar and basic as it gets not a good thing not a bad thing just a thing
<START> and never ever see it now i've been watching bad scifi movies for years i love watching bad scifi movies i think that was the only reason i could watch this movie the whole way through i was <UNK> up by indian superman and that awful fantastic four movie just to name some examples usually i have to beat my head against the wall after i've seen a bad movie to make some of the pain go away no not with this one with i had to hit myself in the head with a shoe in the middle of the movie temporary fix i can't believe i wanted to see that i cried when it finished i cried it was horrible it was worse than when i saw <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in his underwear in the curse which by the way never watch either aside from the fact that wesley in his <UNK> <UNK> it's just <UNK> bad but this review is about the worst part about it is that someone wrote this movie and said this deserves to go on film it's great and wayne <UNK> rob lowe and everyone else in the cast said oh this is what i want on my film history i'll watch indian superman until the <UNK> come home but i am never going to see this steaming pile of <UNK> again
<START> excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair then again the point of the film to <UNK> another comment is that every relationship can be unique and intimate a truly quality short film which caught me at my <UNK> yet had the power to pull me down onto the <UNK> and watch fixed and quiet for the duration bobby and <UNK> are <UNK> moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a <UNK> exercise beyond that the <UNK> within a <UNK> idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting though in a somewhat <UNK> way
<START> after a <UNK> lands in boston really somewhere in the <UNK> of man a hideous <UNK> alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl's school causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie like creatures this film is apparently a loose and i stress loose remake of the 1986 film with the same name as it features the same monster but a different plot both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable this isn't let's start with all the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad this film is supposed to take place in boston we know this because the film makers had the ingenious idea of putting boston police or boston gas company on everything yet everyone seems to have rather muddled british accents at least they didn't try using boston accents thank god the script is a big flawed mess the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by <UNK> a <UNK> containing a piece of the <UNK> is that what our brave heroes do no they run around shooting the zombie students instead nice director paul <UNK> who also wrote directed the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films the movie is terribly boring in places the lighting is awful the film looks cheap and bland one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 99 of the death scenes involve the creature popping out of a dark corner and dragging someone away while we hear they're horrified screams off in the distance this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here the visual effects were awful the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on <UNK> <UNK> for god's sake the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so i'll give credit where <UNK> due the creature effects were actually pretty cool gotta love those close ups of slimy <UNK> teeth br br to sum the film up is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the <UNK> virus not recommended br br 1 5 10
<START> 1st watched 7 19 2003 1 out of 10 <UNK> brad sykes ridiculously lame 3d movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80's teen slasher flicks stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site become hunted by an unknown masked man and then we try to figure out who if anyone is going to live we really don't care who's behind the mask but even that's not hard to figure out if you've seen any of these kinds of movies what a waste of a 3d viewer despite somewhat decent 3d effects
<START> to me <UNK> is certainly one of the better movies i have seen i don't think <UNK> was primarily intended to be a horror movie but a movie questioning the <UNK> of science if you watch it with that in mind it turns into a really good film the only annoying bit was the awful voice dubbing for the english version how can you expect any non german person to listen to these unbearable german accents for two hours let native english <UNK> do the talking or use subtitles instead
<START> well you know <UNK> <UNK> and robert patrick both are really good actors but wtf with this movie the story was lame and the script was just terrible the poor actors didn't have material to work with br br the dvd cover invited you to a flight action flick you would expect something like top gun huge disappointment the flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you <UNK> the <UNK> scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources not made for this movie and they didn't even care about the marks or the fighters models taking for granted the audience will not notice it br br as i said the story was lame with a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting in short it seems a b movie made in the 70's br br i feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here they sure must be ashamed
<START> this is one of my favorite films ever the story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good unlike the other disney films of the age this film never <UNK> the audience 101 <UNK> peter pan robin hood they were all good but lack what we have here this is funny creative and always on target this movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books however this is not the best animated film ever made that title belongs to the brilliant toy story but this is a respectable second immediately followed by the lady and the tramp just see it and enjoy what one of the <UNK> greatest achievements and by the by i'm not a little kid this is for the older audiences wanting to <UNK> their childhood an absolute must
<START> while not as bad as some movies like the horrible atomic <UNK> <UNK> still relies upon common <UNK> and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot i am currently studying nuclear <UNK> in the pursuit of a masters degree and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry br br riding the false fear that a style <UNK> could happen in an american plant the movie states that any <UNK> even partial according to one of the guest <UNK> in the movie would mean disaster for the area in fact a partial <UNK> in an american plant while destroying the core would not pose any risk to the surrounding area three mile island experienced a partial <UNK> and no <UNK> material was released into the environment at all thanks to the natural <UNK> of the fuel and core design used in this country paired with substantial <UNK> br br the security steps shown in the movie were perhaps the part of the movie <UNK> from the truth at any important <UNK> location be it power plant chemical plant military base anything you will never see <UNK> <UNK> to an alarm by <UNK> around talking as if it were an <UNK> <UNK> this is especially true at a nuclear plant where upon the sounding of the alarm the <UNK> would be immediately <UNK> them off can be done with the push of a button in the control room you do not need to put the core in <UNK> mode like depicted in the movie and the chemistry of nuclear <UNK> <UNK> a core from being brought back up to power within about 9 hours of a so if this scenario played out in real life the <UNK> would not be able to cause a significant <UNK> in theory they could still cause a partial one due to <UNK> heat if they exposed the core immediately but that would be almost impossible given the numerous <UNK> systems present in a plant there are many more than the single <UNK> <UNK> they speak of in the movie br br as for the spent fuel <UNK> it may be possible to turn the <UNK> into a dirty bomb by blowing them up but this is far more difficult than simply parking a truck full of <UNK> near the <UNK> the fuel is under approximately 18 feet of highly water the water cannot become <UNK> no <UNK> steam like they speak of in the movie <UNK> <UNK> in water can but the water itself cannot thus the reason for very <UNK> <UNK> so the only way to turn a fuel pool into a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water this is no easy task as water is very heavy and the <UNK> are below ground with very thick <UNK> walls the <UNK> would have to be in the pool below the fuel which is <UNK> <UNK> and there would have to be a heck of a lot of <UNK> as water is very hard to move through an explosion even if this were to occur spent fuel is not extremely <UNK> and the explosion would not cause nearly as high a death <UNK> as mentioned in the movie especially given the small amount of <UNK> material that would be spread br br from a basic movie standpoint i grew somewhat tired of the style used the constant <UNK> in and out use of gritty black and white and fast tracking and <UNK> looked amateurish the characters were one dimensional especially those in the us government i have some problems with the twist thrown in the movie but will not discuss it as it would be a major spoiler br br overall 3 10
<START> fabulous cinematography from <UNK> help to make this a stunning piece of work the opening scenes are as if one is through some master <UNK> album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look all is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking difficult to describe without <UNK> but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her <UNK> brother are at odds as the <UNK> <UNK> and the windows <UNK> another <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and a spinning shot of tree tops and even develops into a fantasy sequence soviet film making of the highest order
<START> this movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history its cousins a mighty wind spinal tap and waiting for <UNK> are terrific in their own right but best in show takes the cake br br a movie about the <UNK> of dog owners that show their dogs it's the <UNK> of the characters that make it so good after watching the movie about 75 times i have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film there is very little interaction between any of the groups of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film br br if you watch this movie and don't find it as funny as i am billing it as watch it again the first time i saw it i thought it was <UNK> but not overly hilarious it is a film that grows on you a movie that you will find yourself <UNK> frequently br br characters hamilton and meg <UNK> a if you get the dvd check out how these characters were born amazing that these two could hit it so on the head and to find out that they really didn't go by a script and sort of made it up as they went br br <UNK> and cookie a cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the cookie character <UNK> eugene levy delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious <UNK> type weaker half br br <UNK> and scott a find me a funnier character than scott i dare you he will forever be <UNK> as this character to me as he was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point <UNK> micheal was very good as well and they interplay here and a brief appearance with the goes to show why he is always in these films a great actor with razor like wit br br <UNK> pepper b i don't want it to seem like he isn't funny he sure is but being the only solo act he can't be quite as funny as the others above he does use the dog more than others and has some other <UNK> going for him br br the rest are all great as well there is no weak character see this film at least twice buy it you will not regret it
<START> i went to the movies to see <UNK> and loved every minute of it the cast and the soundtrack as well <UNK> <UNK> was never better than in this role we saw ms <UNK> <UNK> her looks barely saw her naked <UNK> a cigarette <UNK> beer and oh she cursed whenever this movie was shown on tv and finally cable i would call my friends to watch it just the soundtrack from the very beginning of the movie is awesome all thanks to <UNK> knight and the we saw a black woman struggling to raise her children dealing with teen <UNK> and everyday life meets a man whom she learns later on has issues himself finally this movie made it to dvd and well deserving
<START> there's something rotten about this film and basically the way it turns a sinister and twisted character into a hero by <UNK> our sympathy with his admittedly horrible situation like many who have lost hope chooses suicide the fact that he has been <UNK> it for more than 26 years probably makes his condition worse but the belief that we should do whatever anyone asks even if it means ending a life is in my opinion profoundly wrong what a contrast to the uplifting example of the scientist stephen who suffered a far worse condition for far longer yet with the morals upside down the film <UNK> in hero worship and the people who disagree with are painted in simplistic idiotic terms there's little room for subtly especially in the encounter with the priest deliberately <UNK> the real life encounter which was with a much younger priest in that way i suppose the film is on a par with triumph of the will the <UNK> idea is that everyone should have to right to take their life when they feel they cannot live it anymore it makes no difference whether you are physically or psychologically damaged there are people evidently who believe you have the right to choose the same people are likely to make a case for abortion its all part of the current trend to get the suffering or <UNK> out of sight brush it under the carpet <UNK> will say its ok and we all feel very happy with ourselves so we go down the <UNK> path of believing that some lives just ain't worth living and then we'll decide that as some people can't really decide for themselves then we'll bring in the state to decide for them enter <UNK> hitler straight from that other oscar <UNK> der <UNK> hitler of course believes that he carrying out exactly what nature does in <UNK> of the weak under his regime there were forced <UNK> among the weaker <UNK> the mentally handicapped were quietly put away and the jews were <UNK> <UNK> by using gas he would have <UNK> this film and why not for it is in line with his philosophy some lives are just not worth living i <UNK> from <UNK> hitler and all the people involved with making this film human life is sacred it is not a right it is a gift and an <UNK> nobody chooses to be born then who can choose death its not about religion its about protecting the weak and helpless something this film does a lot to <UNK>
<START> had it with the one who raised you since when you were young you just want her gone from your life that woman is your mother you should respect her you should honor her whether she's in sick or well but that in times it can be <UNK> especially when she becomes very overbearing that's how owen danny <UNK> had to deal with in throw <UNK> the train his <UNK> anne <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the worst he trying his best to be a writer and she is everything but grateful calls him a clumsy <UNK> a and fat and stupid for his friend larry <UNK> billy crystal he has his own woman problems his ex wife she trying to <UNK> him so what did owen do push her overboard what does he do help return the favor get rid of mrs lift in the kitchen scene i liked it where owen called larry cousin patty and <UNK> said you don't have a cousin patty and owen shouts you <UNK> to me and el larry with the <UNK> pan then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill <UNK> lift that is <UNK> and she kicks larry off the train well everything back to normal the ex wife lives but <UNK> kicked the bucket on her own maybe she should have seen the errors of her <UNK> ways a fun movie it is and the cast is great a classic 5 stars
<START> this is a really bad waste of your time i would probably rather go watch some documentary than this it's really that bad br br the acting is really terrible and you can tell that the producers had a low budget because of the terrible picture quality it's by far on the low end of the scale don't waste your money on it br br i have a really hard time believing the person who made this movie that it would fare well i had to watch it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the kids even the kids 3 4 6 and 8 all thought it was pretty boring br br i agree with the other <UNK> <UNK> would be a lot better to watch than this br br overall just don't watch it don't don't
<START> the on me is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the <UNK> 23 years of shorts the reason is understandable by today's standards this film can be considered racist for this reason it is rarely shown if ever on television br br let me just state that for the record the japanese seen in the film were not soldiers they were japanese americans sent to a <UNK> center during world war ii they were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this film by all accounts including the us government who made an <UNK> and in the 1980s japanese americans during world war ii were as loyal and <UNK> as any american their <UNK> during this time is a dark <UNK> in american history br br there are some <UNK> laughs in this film but the memories of how japanese americans were treated during this time <UNK> the entertainment value let's not confuse the loyal japanese americans with their representation in this film as <UNK> loyal japanese americans and the world war ii era evil empire of japan are not <UNK> 2 out of 10
<START> the couch trip is one of those silly comedies that they <UNK> out in the '80s in this case dan <UNK> plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist and he goes to beverly hills to sub for charles <UNK> most of the movie's humor springs from their satirical look at beverly hills and people's empty lives there a woman has a power struggle with her maid br br it's the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time don't expect any kind of religious experience but you'll most likely laugh a lot at how the beverly hills people <UNK> their wealth also starring walter matthau donna dixon <UNK> gross and victoria jackson of <UNK>
<START> the man with the golden arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic and in some respects the message the tragedy of heroin addiction it's nowhere near a great film but its importance lies in otto <UNK> dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and <UNK> what i liked is that it's not so much an expose of <UNK> if you want the best expose of that read naked lunch if you can get through it anyway besides the point but the nature of the urban environment frankie machine lives he expects after he gets out of prison for dealing to go on the straight and narrow to become a drummer in a band and make it <UNK> as a musician but he has his crippled wife who can't work and needs money and often complains and then there's the old neighborhood he can't escape seeing <UNK> darren <UNK> who is still doing back room card games and yes pushing <UNK> like mean streets it's hard to escape the <UNK> unless you leave br br but then again it's hard for frankie machine not to try and operate naturally in this urban quarter it's just that he can't escape the temptation of junk when he's <UNK> on a phony <UNK> charge with his friend he sees a <UNK> freaking out and it puts back the fear of going back on into his clean self and <UNK> frankie is sinatra and i can't see anyone else who could've played him even original choice brando he fits into the neighborhood and seems like the kind of guy who should be a step ahead of the game but there's also a vulnerability to sinatra that he pulls out wonderfully and by the time we see him going in <UNK> apartment it's believable even if it's not the kind of thing those from <UNK> generation would think of heroin i e <UNK> and certainly <UNK> for a dream if for nothing else you want to watch the movie to see what happens to sinatra as this character br br the flaws however come in some of the other performances though it's a little <UNK> <UNK> parker seems to be overacting for a good portion of the movie <UNK> frankie that she's really crippled when in reality she can walk and is <UNK> him for one reason or another but then it becomes <UNK> as it goes along she's supposed to be nuts and nuts with jealousy and on that level it starts to get better meanwhile kim novak is good though not vertigo worthy as the possible girl in the side but more like the voice of reason in the story then there's a detective who might be one of the most one note characters performances ever and also <UNK> <UNK> nerdy friend and the characters of <UNK> and and they're all played as one might expect them to actually <UNK> is better than ok as far as casting other talent around sinatra preminger doesn't do all that great and frankly some scenes kind of fall flat br br but there's a lot of fascination in the man with the golden arm and not just as some dated piece of <UNK> interest it works as compelling drama and as a message piece conveyed without being preachy or campy it's a genuine article just not exceptional
<START> well i am so glad i watched this on hbo instead of paying for it in the theaters or video store the movie has some points but if you want to make it a worthwhile movie i suggest that you become what the main characters are called <UNK> br br 2 10
<START> other than john this movie was absolutely terrible the <UNK> <UNK> and andrew love story was as clichéd as possible full of unbelievably bad lines about how her parents wouldn't ever let them be together and super hammy longing looks none of the emotion had any depth or reality whatsoever the two <UNK> characters dean <UNK> as rupert and whoever it was playing the gun expert once they saw how bad the accents were couldn't they have decided to just drop them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid giving the audience <UNK> apparently not i don't even know where to start with the editing particularly the sound editing if you hate obvious over dubbing as much as i do don't watch this that being said was great off the bat i'll admit that i'm a huge office fan and that's why i rented this but he's quite entertaining as the off the wall friend with crazy ideas he's got a clichéd role but he still manages to make it as entertaining as possible the ending was awful just flat out terrible the idea of the robbery gone awry had potential but <UNK> around after being shot all the way to his studio to fall <UNK> of a painting of <UNK> which looks nothing like her is the most cringe worthy scene
<START> this turned out all right and looks interesting however as it goes on the attempts at creating emotions between the characters is so inept that it really turns the horror off and is an insult to serious viewers the story this is based on i walked with a zombie is probably much better although unfortunately i <UNK> seen it yet ritual looks so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo but in reality it has turned out very poorly which is a shame it´s hard to say what is wrong with it i guess there are just too many inept scenes and it is hard to believe for example in the between alice who is called alice like the girl who supposedly inspired lewis <UNK> to call his heroine alice and the younger brother absolutely nothing has been built up between them and then in the end they get married anyway this looks great and it was worth a look but the movie is just so poorly performed 3 10
<START> have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the <UNK> they deserve here's hoping that the dvd will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience the actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent perhaps overall the movie is a little long but may miles thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary good for the actors i am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot may miles thomas deserves more recognition from the film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors
<START> surely one of the <UNK> shows ever to be produced on these <UNK> and thats saying something even many of the lead actors didn't stick around for the duration the fact that it ran for eight years is a sad <UNK> on the average intelligence and cultural <UNK> of the aussie viewer it went round and round in circles with repetitive gags and poorly drawn characters arthur macarthur for god's sake did they actually pay the writers of this show i wonder if anyone checked their <UNK> there were tired gags about rural people and second rate farce situations that were poor <UNK> of a thousand english and us sitcoms that had gone before i think that's what i hate about it so much that it appears no one involved wanted to make it memorable original or clever instead <UNK> for the lowest common <UNK> each time
<START> i had seen this movie when i was a boy before wwii and was surprised that the local library had a copy saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was this is an example of a movie that was not a a movie no editing poor script weak acting and not much directing should not even be as high as a b had a laugh at how jaded i've become over the years seems to me i thought it was good when i originally saw it
<START> anybody interested what black film making was like in the 70's watch this film some the dialog in this film is so funny ie the summary of my <UNK> also watch out for the boom <UNK> to show up in some of the scenes as well as some of the best karate action ever don't take this movie seriously or you will be disappointed go into it with an open mind and step into the world of one the the <UNK> <UNK> in the world <UNK> editing wise its put together like it was <UNK> with a razor but once again this film is so much more than what you see in the movie it has influenced the black community in ways you cant understand
<START> one would make you believe that this game is about a man obsessed with a number and sure it's an interesting subject can a person become so obsessed by something <UNK> as a simple number that he completely loses touch with reality and becomes hopelessly <UNK> and paranoid br br well perhaps someone will make a movie about that sometime this one unfortunately doesn't have anything to do with the above never mind what the trailers or even the movie itself would like you to believe i would like to say that this number is just a <UNK> but it isn't even that it's pointless a gimmick a hook for unsuspecting audience br br well what is the movie about a dog <UNK> carrey who becomes obsessed with a cheesy noir crime book because he feels it somehow reflects his own life there sure the character in the book detective sigh is for some reason obsessed with number 23 and carrey himself becomes obsessed and starts seeing the number everywhere but it's just padding and totally irrelevant to the story in fact you can cut out all the 23 references and have the main character s <UNK> about cheese or something and you'll have the exactly same story it is painfully obvious that all the 23 stuff was written in <UNK> after the story was already finished rejected and sent for <UNK> br br which would be ok i guess if the movie wasn't dull dull dull half of the movie is narrated for <UNK> you aren't watching the movie you are listening to jim carrey <UNK> the movie about a quarter in carrey starts reading the book and from then until the horribly cliché ending we are forced to watch real life scenes from dog life where nothing happens interspersed with narrated artsy film noir ish book scenes which will either leave you <UNK> or just plain depressed it's like a poor man's sin city with all the violence cut out narrated by carrey and shown in slow motion ugh br br this is a simple case of a c movie script somehow being filmed with an a movie cast probably because of the number 23 hook which i guess sounded intriguing enough on paper to warrant the <UNK> hollywood treatment however since as i said already the movie is about number 23 as much as it is about cheese production in switzerland one cannot feel anything but cheated br br i give the movie 3 out of 10 because i guess it didn't insult my intelligence as much as <UNK> did or made me downright <UNK> like battlefield earth did and the bottom of the scale must be reserved for <UNK> like those but fear not this is still a pretty lousy flick
<START> i agree with some of your comments but i have to disagree on a couple of things first this film is nothing like the cars that ate paris not imho nothing like it br br i think the film had elements of <UNK> but i think the basic approach of the film maker is not <UNK> per se therefore its not really like cars paris i think more like a weird euro work with some scenes bearing the hallmark of <UNK> not surreal br br secondly i think the music by is brilliant they used <UNK> that old sound from country and western records and its better than most aussie films which usually team the film maker up with a dumb sounding <UNK> band that the company wants to push br br as for the name of the film i don't know why it's called modern love i was kinda hoping for david <UNK> to appear dressed in drag and <UNK> <UNK> i'm starting to show my age
<START> i have seen most of the tarzan episodes certainly the rated x with <UNK> bo derek which is totally <UNK> br br i have seen this version several times since it was originally shown br br all the cast had memorable parts great acting the ape sequences br br last night i viewed same on spanish station and other than some french dialog all in spanish br br as far as hudson not wanting <UNK> voice he did nothing until the very end he viewed the <UNK> and could have hired a dialog coach br br it seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking <UNK> that hudson attacked <UNK> the story line in the movie was that she was an american cousin the last time i checked <UNK> was in the usa br br she was beautiful in movie and her eyes and gorgeous hair <UNK> skin <UNK> all us males she did not have to resort to <UNK> level br br she has remained a lady throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie half her life ago as a starting point her performance sincerity made this movie enjoyable believable that a half wild man could <UNK> her inner beauty br br great sending point for sir richardson he did steal the movie
<START> awful star wars knock off with a slightly more comic <UNK> robert <UNK> stars as the leader of a group of ice pirates who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now how all the poor people stay alive is a mystery he <UNK> up with mary crosby daughter around 25 and a total <UNK> a princess looking for her missing father also in the cast are an embarrassed looking <UNK> huston in some hilarious sci fi get ups and a <UNK> short ish ron <UNK> whom i thought was seven feet tall from his other roles and john carradine who looks days from death and hollywood <UNK> relative term bruce if you ever wanted to see bruce get decapitated here's your film but then again even that's not worth seeing as it doesn't shut him up at all think he might have been a robot but i <UNK> off a couple of times
<START> forget <UNK> and jason br br horror has a new name <UNK> the plot is simple but efficient the actors are good two thumbs up for michelle and the killer and the dialogs are even quite clever from the beginning to the end the action will leave you breathless you just can't escape it there is blood awful murders funny moments and a sense of <UNK> that goes far beyond any rule <UNK> <UNK> surely not <UNK> is not another slash movie it's truly a classic of its own it deserves the success it had and there's even more success to come with its re release <UNK>
<START> everyone is entitled to an opinion the only critic who counts is yourself i think this is a great movie much better than the original br br in <UNK> rodney <UNK> is funny but obnoxious he was asked to do the sequel but things got in the way jackie mason shows the saying that less is more he is funny but a man with real family issues a more rounded person it's no drama but a movie that makes you feel actually in some points you feel sorry for jackie mason especially when his daughter walks out on him br br it has a good soundtrack and overall a good sorry a good end to the series br br in the tv show <UNK> <UNK> says that he cried in terms of <UNK> the wife kate <UNK> played by anne also says he cried at <UNK> 2
<START> it is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change as an added bonus it is nice to see some local home boys from <UNK> making good in l a i hope this show will be a keeper
<START> this had the promise of being an interesting film the subject matter was certainly a promising one the <UNK> of the catholic church during the counter however not only was this not developed other than a two paragraph introduction many things were not explained i e the <UNK> the the and their relationship to the one true church nor were the politics of the time explained i e the relationship between the catholic church and its supporters like the holy roman emperor though these may have been apparent to an <UNK> audience the lack of explanation makes it confusing for americans br br but perhaps it's a good thing that they didn't emphasize the history since what they showed was pretty inaccurate anyway <UNK> of torture bloody <UNK> witch and <UNK> <UNK> big shiny swords and pretty golden are the stars of the film it could have just as easily been one of those conan type sword and <UNK> movies only with period costumes
<START> the premise of the story is common enough average family wants out of the rat race wants to find the simple life so they move from <UNK> <UNK> california to lake kids in <UNK> br br the lake is beautiful they have <UNK> an old house but wait there may be something in the lake people are being murdered and no one knows how never mind why <UNK> <UNK> is excellent a familiar face for lifetime viewers valerie <UNK> is also good since this film was made in <UNK> maybe the writer should produce a sequel br br you will also enjoy barry corbin as the town eccentric and <UNK> anderson as a bruce dern <UNK> crazed military man br br while the story plot is a bit over the top if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from psycho deliverance as well as other horror stories of that genre several camera shots and sequences will give you a sense of <UNK> <UNK> br br sit back and enjoy if you don't take it too seriously it is very entertaining and better than for example the more recent movie br br i know what you did last summer it seems they made better movies in the good old 80's
<START> christopher nolan had his goals set on following in a very narrow direction and in that direction he pulled off something that reminded me of the kind of great little <UNK> <UNK> movies the likes of directed back in the 40s only this time he's able to <UNK> touches of homage things like black and white photography a given due to the shoe string budget but also essential to the dark <UNK> these characters inhabit and casting of the actors the john <UNK> lead the slick male counterpart and the beautiful in a gritty way femme fatale while keeping it in the realm of the 90s underground indie where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in locations and music and such anything could be possible that and as well in the film noir mood nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot maybe even more so than <UNK> where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding by way of a plot <UNK> by looking to the past inch by inch here the non linear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like bill can go through as dark a path as <UNK> only in an environment where keeping on your <UNK> is not for someone who's not really twisted and into the deeper mind games <UNK> is br br of course the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story and going into it i wasn't even sure where it would lead if it might be some kind of stream of consciousness ala <UNK> where nolan would lead his character along to one urban british person to another but the establishment of the ties of bill to <UNK> are done in a quick and excellent way as we see right when <UNK> approaches bill at the <UNK> to ask what he's doing following him tells almost all we need to know about both that and the first robbery he brings him along for what seems to soon be a good score on the horizon is really all one big set up by <UNK> and his lady just called 'the maybe a too obvious homage to noir but why but this is revealed in a way that actually truly had me guessing as the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to <UNK> questions not so much of why but of how the <UNK> is brought out all the greater due to the actors understanding of their essential points as characters with alex <UNK> being brilliant as a true <UNK> who can barely mask his <UNK> ideas about what it is to really take pleasure in a <UNK> and with that demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does but is more intelligent in that naive way that stands no chance in the <UNK> environment such as this russell almost makes it too easy even with a face that would send <UNK> savage shaking her head br br meanwhile nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman keeping nothing in that doesn't add to ambiance and suspense with the fade in fade outs not too quick to leave a lasting impression but enough to add to the <UNK> could lead logic of the script he follows it in hand held form as if he knows where his limitations lie and yet is fantastic at keeping the <UNK> close ups when need be one i loved is <UNK> face in a small mirror and a fairly simple <UNK> track that never <UNK> sometimes as mentioned the line between seeing something in <UNK> and seeing something that is as <UNK> as a solid pulp story of low level criminals with mind games and moral ambiguity is always never totally clear which for me is practically irresistible in its dark way simply put this is one of the great calling cards i've seen from a filmmaker in recent years and should hopefully be something that future fans of <UNK> other work can look forward to to discovering or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapid editing and big gun firing dogs of the mainstream even in independent films it's a bright little <UNK> minutes
<START> i happened to see a <UNK> for this movie on spike channel last night it was <UNK> with a patrick <UNK> of another movie he made and thought was in this sequel boy was i wrong i see the screen writer also starred in it and i'm thinking the budget was a bit tight i am surprised to see will <UNK> in the film he has far better credits to his name to be playing in a c movie like this jr was trying so hard to portray the image of his father one of the best bad guy actors ever that failed miserably the only redeeming qualities in the movie was the chicks good looking and with lots of t a just not worth the time or your hard earned dollar to rent it
<START> <UNK> blues is and excellent movie the casting was perfect every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played their chemistry together was amazing the acting was superb i felt as if i knew the characters i could almost <UNK> them they reminded me of people that i knew as a child growing up in the 50's and 60's oh the memories my personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see i have watched this movie so many times that i can almost <UNK> the lines as the characters are saying them i can't even list my favorite part because i have so many favorite parts thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and age and that is black people loving each other looking out for each other <UNK> each other caring about each other and doing all we can to help each other gotta go now i have to go watch it again
<START> 22 joe drama 1970 joe peter boyle is a racist factory worker who's known to hate hippies and <UNK> <UNK> he meets bill a businessman who has just murdered the lover of his drug addict young daughter jill susan sarandon jill runs away and joins a hippie <UNK> at the <UNK> of town bill turns to joe for help their search leads them through the <UNK> parts of town where both men's inner hatred and <UNK> is <UNK> tested br br critique this was director john g first sleeper turned smash hit an amazing run which included 'the karate <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> film is interesting enough in that it served to <UNK> the themes and ideas of the <UNK> 60s vietnam war black power women's <UNK> etc it also has a good performance from peter boyle as joe one of the <UNK> first <UNK> he's always been good at playing creepy <UNK> <UNK> whose abstract ideas are <UNK> by his <UNK> presence he would play the frankenstein monster in mel <UNK> spoof young frankenstein he reminds me of a little kid trapped in a big dumb awkward body film has a weak script the meeting of joe and bill for instance is a bit <UNK> but it has a particularly gruesome post taxi driver ending br br quote title song i saw a <UNK> selling junk to children he gets nervous every time i pass cause he knows that if i catch him i'm gonna kick his head and kick his fat a
<START> the first <UNK> had a sense of cynical wit and a sick sense of violence it was a fine line to walk but paul verhoeven pulled it off and the film did so well they made a sequel how awful possible spoilers ahead though anything that could spoil this is beyond me br br <UNK> <UNK> is not the director for this type of film he clearly did not understand the wit of the original and as a result the massive over the top senseless violence looks really bad and worse is very <UNK> even worse is the musical score leonard <UNK> was an old man from another era and the heroic light music does not match the images on the screen at all what was he <UNK> the great american hero worst of all he completely eliminated theme from the first film which was so memorable and perfect can you imagine a superman film without john <UNK> <UNK> or indiana jones etc how could he do that br br the plot is just a collection of ideas that don't <UNK> in beginning we see <UNK> stalking his old wife fine good idea but they completely drop it after that then there is this a stupid idea of the company <UNK> to be nice that's thrown in for 10 minutes and then is immediately dropped or the silly idea that the repulsive 10 year old drug lord reminds <UNK> of his son once again a weak <UNK> that is shown briefly twice and dropped this may work in a comic book but not on film and frank miller was unfortunately too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea in along with the kitchen sink it doesn't work as a whole br br some people here seem to be <UNK> the corporate bashing in this film and the <UNK> of the police that is the best part of the film that is consistent with the first however in the original the old man was a tough business man out for a profit but ultimately fair in the end in this film he is just pure evil in his lust for money and power you can't just change characters like that for no reason and nancy allen's character is useless in this film whereas in the first she was essential to search for himself she is as gratuitous as the violence in this film br br and the violence yes the violence i enjoy many violent bloody films when they serve purposes and are meant to tell a story <UNK> <UNK> seems to get off on human beings being blown to bits shot to pieces children <UNK> for death and torture and <UNK> desire for drugs he doesn't know when to stop do we really need to see every last innocent <UNK> even people trying to help others get shot up it is <UNK> when we see the bad <UNK> shooting repeatedly instead mr <UNK> proves he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an <UNK> mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and worse a disgusting message of violence for any young person watching this film br br no this film isn't meant to be message y and i certainly don't watch <UNK> movies or alien or predator movies for that reason however when you go too far and cross the line much of what you do must be put into question and as for this film in the words of the evil kid drug <UNK> last words as he dies it still sucks
<START> man stop making sequels to great movies the original was a great movie that was over the top with fights sex and one of the coolest characters that <UNK> the screen in the 90's the story is believable as if your been to bars in the outs of the south you would know but here comes this piece of junk <UNK> 2 last call lets just hope they are serious with the title and never make another <UNK> ever again it doesn't have the charm of the characters of the original nor is the story really believable the story is more of a steven segal type action that even though <UNK> 2 is a b movie it still doesn't click as some b movie action still sales the movie no matter how cheesy it is the only reason to rent not buy this movie is that we finally find out the one question is left from the original <UNK> patrick <UNK> character dalton is dalton his first name or last name well i'll save you the 4 00 rental <UNK> dalton is his first name as in dalton <UNK> never make another <UNK>
<START> for all those <UNK> by the length and pace of this film like why does he show <UNK> <UNK> for like 15 minutes here's a word you might want to think about br br beauty br br beauty is an under rated concept sure you'll often see nice photography and so on in films but when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it there is a weird belief among that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed this is depressing <UNK> there is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot a director can show 15 minutes of <UNK> for no reason than that they are beautiful and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so br br requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films it requires you to relax it requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization don't get me wrong plots and characters are good but they're not the be all and end all of everything there are different kinds of film and to enjoy you must tune your brain to a different <UNK> and <UNK> to the pleasure of beauty pure beauty <UNK> by the banal conventions of everyday films br br all art is quite useless oscar <UNK>
<START> this filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell and did so really awful <UNK> of unlikely unexplained <UNK> and <UNK> plot line all without character or clear motivation br br we get cliché <UNK> instead of characters one in particular is the <UNK> and beautiful crime boss who projects an overdone tough guy persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of <UNK> over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny <UNK> as in the smallest from a complete american set in a bright sky blue without explanation or <UNK> otherwise it's standard visually one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in <UNK>
<START> there are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 <UNK> from 6 different countries <UNK> the main character leaves his <UNK> life in paris his ex <UNK> mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to <UNK> to study spanish in order to get a job at the <UNK> he falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently when <UNK> brother wendy is one of the room mates comes from england the film starts to become a lot funnier well anyway <UNK> starts to see things differently with all his new friends and he probably lives something he will never forget and will change his life forever overall a very nice nostalgic film which becomes even more interesting because of the <UNK> cast i thought it was very interesting that you could see all these kids from different countries all of them speaking different languages and having different cultures get along with each other and fun i gave it a 9 out of 10 because i left the theatre with a smile on my face and thinking about things i haven't done yet while i'm still in college and would want to do before it's too late
<START> synopsis <UNK> the ending does not show ben <UNK> online for guys he is looking up <UNK> language <UNK> at the military <UNK> in san francisco perhaps to join the war in iraq as a <UNK> <UNK> many of the <UNK> <UNK> from ask tell have been <UNK> they are now it major short supply ben also spoke russian this movie is a good time capsule of life in <UNK> but quite a bit of non reality here mostly a good laugh at lame social skills and the sad portrayal of grown up twenty somethings not developing beyond the college party mode also a brief study of the always changing scene in <UNK> somehow it always stays close to the edge of the same b s br br watch together the films <UNK> in new york and the the new twenty both good for nostalgia i think the movie twenty shows how far the <UNK> between gay and straight as evolved br br these two films are gay time travel for sure enjoy
<START> martha <UNK> has done some <UNK> movies working with river phoenix and harrison ford but she was never able to expand her limited <UNK> appeal into the same class as say molly <UNK> this film which was barely released is just an <UNK> of her late '80s early <UNK> attempts to find a screen persona which was <UNK> to <UNK> and it represents another failure <UNK> plays a troubled young woman who finds out on her 21st birthday that she was adopted and worse than that was actually abandoned as an <UNK> on her parents' <UNK> she sets out to find her <UNK> mother and father but the viewer has no clue why she'd even want to would simple curiosity give her this much determination unattractive material given sitcom handling it starts off on the wrong foot and never <UNK> <UNK> gives a sour <UNK> performance but hector <UNK> and mary kay place are fine as her <UNK> parents 1 2 from
<START> of all the 48 films of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is widely regarded as one of her best what we see is special for once the plot has a value of its own does much more than only providing a cheap vehicle for sex charged appearance br br this film is your true well worked out light comedy with a good and coherent story set in <UNK> government circles in the late 1950's it entertains from beginning to end providing many amusing twists turns and some slapstick all acted out by at least three starring leads including <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> french for female <UNK> of paris focuses on telling a story not on showing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> serves the plot very well by using her talent for acting in light comedies br br when you settle on your couch on a friday night tired and weary from a <UNK> <UNK> away just turn on <UNK> <UNK> this film will make you feel better
<START> i haven't seen this film in years but the awful taste of <UNK> performance still <UNK> on my tongue some have commented on how quaid has jerry lee lewis to a <UNK> but the fact is he only appears to have the most extreme stage jerry in mind nobody acts that way all the time and the performance comes off as hopelessly <UNK> <UNK> lewis to a <UNK> caricature the nuances of a man's life are lost in the <UNK> of sheer over acting br br the author of the book this is based on nick is a good writer who has written several fine musical <UNK> i particularly liked <UNK> on dean martin in the books gives us a full human being both separate from and involved in the <UNK> <UNK> acting seems to imply that jerry never acted like a human being if people were like this no one would bother to hang around them as cartoons go it is mildly amusing but otherwise it is one of the most <UNK> film destroying performances i have had the honor of viewing terrible
<START> david morse and andre <UNK> are very talented actors which is why i'm trying so hard to support this program unfortunately an irrational plot and very poor writing is making it difficult for me i'm hoping that the show gets a serious <UNK> or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them
<START> i know we shouldn't expect much from a low budget indie film but the idea behind it is sound an attempt to open america's eyes to the <UNK> relationship between the government and the <UNK> that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it but somehow the documentary aspect of it takes away from its drama the <UNK> during the 2004 <UNK> convention in new york were not that compelling to make a documentary about it those kinds of compelling <UNK> belong to the era of the 1960's br br it would have been better to stick to a drama format perhaps a slow build up where the young <UNK> eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy
<START> i think this movie is my favorite movie i am not sure why but it is julia <UNK> has been my favorite actress for awhile and when i saw this i went crazy it's sort of romantic and i definitely recommend this movie
<START> think of the most un film worthy subject you can and this is 10 times worse a woman needs to complete as many as she can in a day we don't even get to see the questions and think of the words on our own we just watch her struggle the woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do the but for some reason she spends the time <UNK> walking all around the city when she could be focused at home the acting is horrible the actress <UNK> and <UNK> as she tried to think of the words and we are left completely in the dark the new york scenery is nice but the movie relies on it too much and it gets old fast the movie plays like a rejected <UNK> student film this film has no redeeming qualities and i do not recommend it to anyone ever
<START> i was very disappointed with this series it had lots of cool graphics and that's about it the level of detail it went into was minimal and i always got the feeling the audience was being there was a lot of what seemed to me as this is extremely cool but we're not going to explain it in further detail because you won't get it anyway let's just show you some pretty pictures to entertain you the host would drop interesting sounding words such as and super <UNK> without any attempt at explaining what it was we had to look it up on <UNK> br br furthermore i know quite a bit about for a <UNK> and i found their explanations were convoluted and could have been so much better they could have chosen much better examples to explain concepts but instead the examples they used were confusing and further <UNK> the subject br br additionally i got so sick of the <UNK> they could easily have <UNK> the series into one episode if they had cut out all the <UNK> they must have shown the clips of the quantum <UNK> about 8 times the host kept saying the same things over and over and over again i can't remember how many times he said the universe is made out of tiny little <UNK> strings it's like they were trying to <UNK> us into just accepting are the best thing since <UNK> bread br br finally the show ended off with an unpleasant sense of a competition between and clearly biased towards this is supposed to be an educational program about quantum physics not about whether the us is better than europe or vice versa i also felt that was part of the <UNK> audiences need to see some conflict to remain interested please give me a little more credit than that br br overall 2 thumbs down
<START> first off this film will not be for everybody there are scenes of extreme graphic violence and disturbing images that by their nature alone will turn off many possible potential viewers obviously from the reviews on this board <UNK> cruelty has divided those that have seen it i'm among the ones who liked it very much for several different reasons i feel this was a very ambitious and quite competently pulled off <UNK> for a bunch of 18 19 year olds with no budget and little experience i think that each aspect of the film the direction the acting though the character's performances are more <UNK> to stage or free form performance because of the nature of the film the production the fx the score sound design all are far superior to many films i've seen that <UNK> these kids budget and experience ten <UNK> i honestly haven't been this impressed with an art house style horror film since <UNK> <UNK> br br first off i'm not going to pretend to understand and or grasp all of the <UNK> content in this film but knowing that this wasn't a straight narrative type of film when i went into it i wasn't disappointed with how it played out <UNK> cruelty is 4 relatively short vignettes that all sort of <UNK> around the theory of right brain left brain lust anger <UNK> vs restraint compassion <UNK> to very briefly give a synopsis of each chapter br br <UNK> basically just has a naked girl who has an <UNK> cut out of her <UNK> i'm sure it's symbolic of something i don't think i was paying that much attention at that point and this one blows by pretty quick br br the next episode human <UNK> is a <UNK> horrific genuinely creepy story of a guy who's both in love with and <UNK> by his pregnant sister who gives into his growing <UNK> which leads up to the shocking conclusion of that particular chapter human <UNK> is the best of the bunch in my book and will probably get under your skin the dead pan narrative dialog <UNK> the growing tension as you know something horrible is going to happen but you're not quite sure what it is do yourself a favor and if you are interested in seeing this film don't do too much research on it come into it with an open mind and an iron stomach and i think you be pleasantly surprised especially with this particular episode br br <UNK> has a bunch of people in a field <UNK> the ground and blowing trees and stuff apparently an arty interpretation of the rape of the earth or something to that effect not bad but this one is pretty short too and i sorta missed the point on it br br and right brain <UNK> seems to be about religion and religious <UNK> and also along with human <UNK> has some of the hardest images messages of the whole feature br br <UNK> isn't anything to write home about mainly because of it's very short running time but does make a decent <UNK> into the insanity to come and <UNK> is also kind of short and not quite as thought provoking but human <UNK> especially and right brain <UNK> are so off the wall and well done that they more than make up for the other parts i think the main reason that i liked this one so much is that as shocking repulsive violent and excessive as it is it is also done very beautifully and you can tell this was a real labor of love from those involved nothing about the film feels cheap or rushed and even if the content isn't completely <UNK> it's undeniably original and that alone <UNK> the points some in my book not that every weird art house film that has an <UNK> plot should be praised for it's originality but <UNK> cruelty is the type of film that i do think i'll watch a few more times in the near future to see what other interpretations i may gain from it again this film is absolutely not for everyone with some very extreme scenes of gore murder rape incest <UNK> imagery etc that is definitely there to shock the viewer into taking a harder look at this film i have to say it worked for me and i'm <UNK> awaiting the collaboration that is <UNK> to come next check this one out if you have the stomach for it 9 5 10
<START> lame rip off of the <UNK> <UNK> 1955 the first half is deadly dull even dreary but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the <UNK> <UNK> in the accompanying <UNK> a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes when compared to the ones created for the other titles in <UNK> monsters <UNK> set director day who admits to not being a fan of the sci fi genre tries to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that he had a zero budget to work with where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage and i'd have been inclined to be more <UNK> with the film had i not recently watched the immortal monster 1959 a similar and similarly <UNK> but far more stylish venture from italy br br bill <UNK> as the cocky but unlucky astronaut obsessed with achieving the titular feat is positively boring at first but he eventually manages to garner audience sympathy when his physical features are <UNK> and the character develops a taste for blood marshall thompson as his commanding officer and elder brother is o k as a <UNK> glenn ford type he had previously starred in fiend without a face 1958 another and more successful richard gordon produced sci fi which incidentally is also available on dvd through <UNK> italian <UNK> <UNK> struggling with the english language makes for an <UNK> female lead even her <UNK> in the <UNK> proves to be of little lasting value br br the audio commentary is yet another enjoyable tom weaver richard gordon track where among many things the fact that first man into space was intended as a double feature with corridors of blood 1958 is brought up but it was eventually put out as a <UNK> release so as to exploit the <UNK> news value of the current space race it's also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by who <UNK> died in a traffic accident prior to the film's release weaver even recalls a couple of <UNK> from the time when he was involved in the production of the dvd <UNK> shot by of all people ex cult ish film maker norman j warren who by then had become a lady of title was still ready to help out in carrying the equipment necessary to film the interview down several <UNK> of stairs <UNK> was supposed to have contributed to the <UNK> but once in london he proved reluctant to co operate with weaver eventually the latter learned that the actor had been recently <UNK> with cancer and in fact he died in 2002
<START> the way i found out about this movie was when i watched american pie 2 at the start it had a trailer for ali g i watched the trailer and it just forced me to buy the dvd it looked incredibly funny so the next day i went to my local store and picked it up for <UNK> 99 bargain the film is about ali g who is a gangster of the west massive crew who's rivals are the east massive crew ali has a <UNK> <UNK> pack of children where he teaches them how to survive in the ghetto by teaching them how to swear and steal cars after ali finds out the government are stopping the money coming to the <UNK> centre where ali teaches the kids he runs for <UNK> for and <UNK> another <UNK> in his attempts to get rid of the <UNK> centre to make room for an airport in throughout the film there are laughs <UNK> as ali gets up to some crazy stuff <UNK> makes an appearance for a few seconds in the film too this is a definite must watch film for all you <UNK> baron cohen fans out there
<START> widow hires a psychopath as a <UNK> sloppy film noir thriller which doesn't make much of its tension promising set up 3 10
<START> i have seen three other movies that are worse than this one plan 9 from <UNK> side <UNK> and the <UNK> blair witch project there are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just isn't believable br br let's start with an train with no <UNK> or <UNK> between cars the killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the train br br in one scene a killer <UNK> into a woman's apartment he wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her so what does he do he turns up her <UNK> if i heard my <UNK> suddenly get <UNK> i'd be concerned he kills the women by throwing an electric hair into the <UNK> i was amazed to see that an electric hair with a five foot <UNK> could be tossed ten feet and remain <UNK> in plus the apartment looked modern enough to have ground fault <UNK> in the bathroom and the victim was still <UNK> br br the <UNK> <UNK> is one of the most well known commercial <UNK> on the planet so this part really amazed me first the <UNK> was not even close to a real <UNK> and second it wasn't on the top deck of the plane i watched in utter <UNK> as the pilot and co pilot where was the flight engineer walked right past the spiral <UNK> and headed forward the nose of the airplane br br i was also amazed that bullets wouldn't <UNK> an <UNK> serving <UNK> good thing for our hero or bathroom doors but would <UNK> the ceiling causing a fuel <UNK> that <UNK> through a small hole in the <UNK> huh watching three guys <UNK> a <UNK> by 100 <UNK> in less than a week was pretty amazing as well br br i didn't check was this a movie of the week or something it was terrible
<START> out of all the mafia movies i have ever seen this is one of the best for many reasons the acting from <UNK> <UNK> and vincent the story is one of the best ever in the mafia genre as it realistic the characters are people that lots of other people can relate to this movie is also great as it's dialogue is good it also has very realistic fights and action scenes this movie also launched the careers of <UNK> and vincent if it weren't for the success of this film casino and <UNK> might not have been as good as they were br br story 10 10 acting 9 10 realism 10 10 br br overall 10 10 br br my <UNK> mafia movies are br br 1 <UNK> 2 casino 3 the godfather trilogy 4 family <UNK> the death collector 5 the sopranos i know it isn't a movie
<START> i'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is but i couldn't find it it's a really long barely credible hardly <UNK> conversation between three guys on one set br br it doesn't move anywhere the characters are just totally bizarre the underlying plot equally so it's lost on me definitely a walk out movie br br the one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever <UNK> possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax and the fact that all <UNK> aside at the banal personalities they're acted quite reasonably but you have to <UNK> yourself for endless dialog wishing on many an occasion that teach would just shut the up for a moment
<START> slow moving <UNK> movie with terrible acting on the whole but lovely locations clothes to admire and of course timothy dalton who does a compelling job as always i wanted to laugh out loud at the voice overs so silly but dalton is always worth watching even in bad movies a wonderful actor older now but still very handsome and <UNK> this movie is worth viewing only to see him and he seems like he <UNK> into a bad dime romance novel poor fellow your time would be better spent watching mr dalton in 1970's <UNK> heights or the early 1980's bbc version of jane eyre poor ward so lovely but so wooden surely she's been better in other movies
<START> i only saw the first part of this and <UNK> that i wouldn't miss anything if i didn't watch the second episode the cinematography was ok but apart from this the plot was just as and run of the mill as any other war story the actors and actresses play their characters without any passion and the make up is really bad with his white hair and <UNK> respectively as if some <UNK> white hair could give them more dignity and common sense i mean if you've watched more than two or three movies about wwii as most of us have then you'd only go to the trouble of seeing a third or fourth one if it promises some new insights or twists in the plot but <UNK> <UNK> seems to afraid of doing so you can almost smell his fear of not living up to the <UNK> and <UNK> expectations of the conservative tv channel while watching this movie millions of <UNK> were spent to <UNK> boring and unimaginative german film making these millions of dollars could have been spent to make three or four independent movies but no let's give to some director <UNK> make a film that tells people that war can be explained by rational means my advice read joseph <UNK> or kurt <UNK> instead they'll tell you what war is like or give me one million <UNK> and i make a better film than this load of <UNK> and another thing why is it that german movies only get to be nominated for the oscars when the movie deals with wwii or the holocaust probably because that is the only thing german film making is good at and that should get us thinking shouldn't it
<START> <UNK> are elected for three year terms as <UNK> said in 1973 the <UNK> were determined to continue forcing labor to the <UNK> until they were defeated if you ask me this is portrayed in the <UNK> but anyone who says kerr acted properly in this fails to acknowledge the self serving and <UNK> <UNK> of the liberal party of australia on the series itself i though max <UNK> was a poor his voice was too ghostly also more of the key political players on both sides should have been used though this may have been a reflection of <UNK> constraints at the time nevertheless i recommend it with caution
<START> admittedly when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie my expectations were pretty low they weren't low enough roger corman somehow came into <UNK> of the rights to produce the marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's and handed it off to whose directorial work has largely been in campy tv series such as and with a supposed total budget of 1 5 million dollars it was produced shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the <UNK> of forgotten film there it should have remained however like a banana <UNK> in a vaudeville act this fantastic four sits out in the <UNK> waiting to cause a <UNK> for those rare people unlucky and foolish enough to step on it br br if you have ever heard of these comic book characters you know what to expect the people who made this were very true to the source material and that is the only thing for which they deserve any credit in this fiasco this presents the origins of the heroic group that develop <UNK> powers when the <UNK> on their experimental <UNK> fails to protect them from <UNK> radiation reed richards alex hyde white develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes <UNK> his girlfriend sue storm rebecca can become invisible and her brother johnny jay <UNK> can <UNK> cause fire to <UNK> from his body finally ben <UNK> to both michael <UNK> smith and carl receives <UNK> strength when his skin <UNK> to a rock like hyde and is then referred to as the thing there is a prologue that sets up a former <UNK> of <UNK> victor von doom joseph <UNK> to become their enemy dr doom who <UNK> the <UNK> of the fantastic <UNK> space flight as an act of revenge for <UNK> he blames on reed there is the set up then the discovery of the powers the revelation of the villain and ultimately a climactic fight there are more details to the poorly written script but they are <UNK> br br this is a movie that was made simply because the creators i use that in the technical sense of the word there isn't a whole lot of creative imagination at work here had the legal rights to do so the plot will be undoubtedly <UNK> in the anticipated big budget release set to be directed by tim story in 2005 but <UNK> a massive special effects project like this without a comparable budget or <UNK> actors qualifies as an act of cinematic insanity what special effects exist are mostly hand drawn or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original 'the great train when half of the climactic fight <UNK> to full on hand animation you're almost <UNK> to be watching a cartoon instead of the poor actors who were damned to be in this project there is very little <UNK> of style in this mess as well most scenes are either shot flat in available light or wild primary colors and the only dressed sets are the obvious sci fi pieces there is camera work but it is mostly just keeping the characters centered on the screen and minimal information flowing to the audience editing includes leaving in extra lines and using obvious <UNK> at one point there is even a transition using the center of a number 4 editing <UNK> are even used to <UNK> the poor special effects when the thing transforms the one scene where <UNK> technology was put to use was shocking only because it was such a positive jump up in quality br br limited camera work is not unforgivable in <UNK> only the most basic camera movements are used and there is almost no style it worked for that film because it was about people whose lives had no style and it was consistent kevin smith never let his reach <UNK> his grasp 'the blair witch <UNK> caused some audiences to suffer motion sickness from the jerky hand held stuff that put that pseudo documentary together when all was said and done it was an effective work about the terror of getting lost and being consumed by a frightening situation there is no sense of story or theme here on either a spoken or visual level with this <UNK> you never get more than an accidental laugh at the fact that the film makers and performers seem to be actually trying to rival other comic book movies with this poorly budgeted entry br br any film involves a great deal of time and work it just so sad that so much of both was <UNK> into a project like this if you're one of the people who were involved with this it was most likely done as a stepping stone on the road of a hopefully improved film career everyone knows about taking jobs to make the most of what appears to be an opportunity for those who are curious about watching this movie my advice is to only do so with a group of friends so you can all point and say you watched it too who have been <UNK> about the experience so nobody gets hurt from the shock and maybe you can come up with a drinking game to ease the pain between the accidental laughs br br 1 out of 10
<START> saw this last night and being a fan of the first demons i had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun spooky spirit of it's predecessor this is unfortunately not the case the set up is similar as the first in which a <UNK> of flesh eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played the first had been a movie theater this one takes place in an apartment building and on tv once the demons are released madness and mass carnage ensues that's pretty much it as far as plot development goes it worked nicely in the first part because of the <UNK> make up fx fast pace and <UNK> the sequel however doesn't cut it the first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we don't really care about one way or another if they were annoying or idiots then there would at least be some kind of <UNK> when they are inevitably butchered <UNK> eaten alive but these people are just kind of there waiting to be slaughtered plus the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building and out of it they are constantly cutting back and forth between them which kept pulling me out of the story there are some amusing bits courtesy of the splatter fx and <UNK> such as a constant flow of dripping blood eating through one construction after another as if it were alien acid the first demon possession of a <UNK> birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party and a creepy demon child <UNK> his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with child however that sequence <UNK> into a ridiculous looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the chest of the human child that constantly flies across the room at its intended victim i got a couple of chuckles out of that scene but i don't think that was <UNK> intention the scene probably would've worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman but hey other little things like the over <UNK> acting of most of the characters and the bad dubbing don't help matters in <UNK> i managed to see the <UNK> version on dvd and can't imagine having to sit all the way through the previously only available r rated version because the make up fx and gore were the only thing i got out of it also notable is an early role of producer <UNK> future <UNK> daughter asia in fact she probably gives the best performance of the whole cast and she's barely on screen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> might want to check it out just to see it but will probably find themselves looking at their watch like i did gore fans might get a kick out of some of the fx but will be laughing themselves out of their <UNK> at the most goofy looking evil baby puppet since little <UNK> from dead alive you could do worse but it certainly doesn't live up to the original
<START> some people don't like led <UNK> but luckily the number of people who versus the number of people who don't is way <UNK> i am the proud of 2 or 3 led <UNK> fans and the only reason i was able to do this is because of this dvd br br for one how someone can listen to <UNK> to heaven or immigrant song without falling in love with <UNK> is beyond me but to play the guitar and not like page that is like being christian and not liking jesus my friend was like led <UNK> sucks and i was like oh yeah watch this after about 2 mins of watching page pick through white summer black mountain side he was glued to the screen and has never said a bad thing about <UNK> since br br <UNK> you haven't been following the running metaphor i am calling this dvd the bible of led <UNK> held high by the followers and used as a for the <UNK> <UNK> br br course there are some things missing like over the hills and far away a good version of immigrant song and i really didn't need 2 version of whole <UNK> love but what the hell i'll take 'em br br because there is nothing besides the song remains the same to compare this too i gave it a 10 and even if there were more to compare it too i still would have given it a 10
<START> simply miserable <UNK> turner vehicle had a beautiful voice but he rarely uses it in a film that reminded me of the student prince with adults is no leading man either he looks like an elderly man ready to collect social security and go fishing br br the plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of barry sullivan <UNK> <UNK> and debbie reynolds are given so little to do sir cedric <UNK> comes in at the end to <UNK> that our king had better return to his people as far as i'm concerned the faster the better is that <UNK> turner really singing with not bad if it is her the picture would also remind me in a way of the 1960 movie the prince and the <UNK> with marilyn monroe and laurence olivier
<START> i tend to get furious when hearing about lucio <UNK> reputation as a director too often he's <UNK> as a no talented filmmaker only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore true his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream american production but his films always are of wide range and the plots are <UNK> morbid don't torture a <UNK> is yet another story this film is a pure gem of the italian shock cinema i easily dare to call this film a an old fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror the film shows the search for a <UNK> serial murderer in a small italian mountain town the bodies of 3 young boys are found horribly <UNK> there are quite a lot of pseudo <UNK> in the town but every trail leads to nowhere among the suspects are a greedy bum and a scary woman obsessed by <UNK> and voodoo like a true mastermind fulci knows to find the right creepy tone for his film he portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and <UNK> setting of macabre happenings supported by a <UNK> soundtrack fulci also develops himself as a genius <UNK> here the script always is one step ahead of you and the complex plot will <UNK> you more than once in other words this is a unique giallo horror slash murder mystery the gore isn't presented as grotesque and explicit as in later <UNK> among them are the legendary zombie 2 the beyond and the new york <UNK> although there still are a few nauseating and hard to watch shock sequences shown br br don't torture a <UNK> is the most compelling and effective achievement lucio fulci ever brought forward and it easily ranks among the greatest italian horror movies ever made right next to the masterpieces made by mario <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the film is fascinating from start to finish some plot aspects are <UNK> realistic and the tension is <UNK> <UNK> at all times a must see for horror fans and an absolute <UNK> for italian shock lovers
<START> just watched this and it was amazing was in serious doubt about renting the dvd or not so if you are and like watching other than brainless action movies don't hesitate any longer don't let the dull cover put you off the script is one of the best ever funny original touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat through the whole movie i had already watched another movie right before this one and was really sleepy and usually i get bored on watching a second movie in one night but this one really made me wake up and didn't have any boring moments it also made me <UNK> a lot of things in life and gave me a really good feeling br br also the acting is great one of kevin <UNK> best roles the visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen if i have to come up with something negative to say about it well i can't really find anything enjoy 10 out of 10
<START> the finest short i've ever seen some <UNK> suggest it might have been <UNK> due to the <UNK> of insight it offers there's irony in that comment and little merit the acting is all up to <UNK> and he carries his <UNK> character perfectly i might have preferred that the narrator be less recognizable but the <UNK> <UNK> is pitch perfect this is a short for people who read for those whose bar is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that <UNK> stupidity and <UNK> can <UNK> contrary and bitter <UNK> of beauty a beautiful short film i was pleased at the <UNK> reference since i once believed that <UNK> was just another art whore with little talent like i assume most people until the day i saw some drawings he made when he was 12 <UNK> was a <UNK> and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime i understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for
<START> i found this movie to be filled with irony but watching the movie you can almost for see what will happen <UNK> is a confused bored house wife who is constantly looking for happiness when she thinks she finds true happiness she <UNK> onto it leaving behind all that she knew but she finds her self almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband she learned that if she only had <UNK> more about what had bothered her in her previous marriage that it could have been <UNK> a lot easier that she intended it to be she realizes that words are nothing with out action but she learns that too far into her second marriage and finds herself looking back and hoping for change once again the main conflict in this movie is <UNK> vs herself you can not have true happiness with out yourself being truly happy i liked this movie but i would only recommend this movie to women i can't see a man truly finding enjoyment in this movie
<START> well unlike most people i went into this movie expecting it to not be that good and it turned out to be an awesome film pretty cool plot i love the idea of it but what really made this movie was the actors they all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to see <UNK> and dillon work together it's a movie where you go in thinking right away you will be able to predict whats going to happen but it <UNK> quite turn out how you predicted i don't want to give away anything about the story so i wont but i suggest giving this one a chance if you saw the movie money train and enjoyed that you would love this movie maybe everything lawrence <UNK> touches is gold
<START> this isn't far away from the trash that bollywood normally makes but there's just something really good about it br br the title song is one of best and is haunting throughout this is one of the films along with a must see bollywood film that made shah rukh khan and it's for this you have to check it out br br other reviews give away the story it is a fairly basic idea <UNK> definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra star br br its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to bollywood or not 8 10
<START> i saw <UNK> ii when i was ten and i mostly laughed because of the horse scene i should have realized that the movie was as empty as i can't come up with a good comparison it's stupid and not even really funny the cast members from the original who chose not to star in this made probably the best choices that they ever made in <UNK> this why oh why did chevy chase return and how on earth did jackie mason robert stack <UNK> cannon and dan <UNK> get involved in this <UNK> i bet that every person who had his her name even remotely attached to this junk e g the <UNK> is ashamed beyond redemption so all in all it's beyond dreadful terrible and everything such avoid it like you would the <UNK> virus
<START> i saw this movie only because sophie however her acting abilities it's no enough to this movie almost all cast don't play their character well exception for sophie and <UNK> the plot could give a rise a better movie if the right pieces was in the right places i saw several good french movies but this one i don't like
<START> <UNK> br br i have seen it <UNK> that most american movies are cowboy movies in disguise that hollywood is so in love with it's only truly original creation that it keeps <UNK> the cowboy myth i'm not sure i totally buy that argument but <UNK> is evidence in support of the theory it's a cowboy movie with br br actually it goes one better than that it's a <UNK> western with substitute the planes with horses make the <UNK> a priest and this movie would be <UNK> from any one of a dozen italian spanish semi arty shoot 'em ups with <UNK> of the seventies br br the film isn't as bad as i had been lead to believe by some of the reviews i had read here but it certainly wasn't good
<START> this is an extremely competent movie technically the camera work and direction are excellent and the acting is fine as well especially the fine acting by daniel <UNK> as the marquis i really thought there were no problems at all with these aspects of the film instead i was a bit annoyed by the way the marquis was portrayed as it didn't seem all that honest and seems to be a very view of history in fact in recent years the marquis has <UNK> a bit of a transformation to a <UNK> of freedom with great insight not the fat <UNK> <UNK> rapist he really was in a way this is highly reminiscent of the <UNK> given in the people versus larry <UNK> where these men are <UNK> to hero status even if you don't think that the <UNK> weren't all that bad they included rapes and extreme violence his portrayal in this film as a sexual social worker in this prison seems pretty silly instead of the violent and selfish <UNK> he spends a lot of time carefully <UNK> a young virgin and slowly helps her to explore her own <UNK> what a nice and kind man in fact now that i think about it this performance reminds me of the man maurice <UNK> played in <UNK> but without the singing a cute older man who loves the ladies i strongly doubt the real life marquis de <UNK> would have recognized this character at all br br the film surprisingly doesn't have a lot of nudity though what it does show is extremely explicit only a maniac would let their kids see this as this is a very adult drama it's very well made and pretty entertaining just not all that truthful the director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview among the special features on the dvd i watched so go ahead and see the film if you'd like understanding it just isn't very good historically during the 18th century sexual were quite accepted in france as they were pretty broad minded so despite what the movie implies it wasn't sex that was the issue it was the violence and rape that was and still is the problem
<START> if you have ever wanted to know more about cab drivers then this is an excellent movie to watch for <UNK> purposes only i can just hear it now wait just wait a second why don't we follow a cab driver through his entire day are funny and so are the people they meet and they only talk to each other for just a couple of minutes so the other actors should be cheap harry you take care of production joan you've got <UNK> brian you go round up some actors and we'll all meet back here tomorrow to start filming br br the first 90 of the movie could not have been any worse had that very thing happened at least with no planning whatsoever there is always the element of surprise to be found some of jim <UNK> movies have stuff added as they go along and they always do well at the box <UNK> the problem here is that the first 90 is pretty well scripted out and it pretty much sucks paul dillon plays the cab driver in chicago who is working all day we pretty much see what he sees people get in and out of his car and he drives all around town he talks to those people for a few seconds and then we get some more people br br i'll admit there were a couple of funny bits here and there a religious family tries to talk the cab driver into going to church with them he takes a pregnant lady and her husband to the hospital breaks up a rich businessman from his girlfriend a poor girlfriend from her boyfriend and takes a rape victim home i guess the moral of the movie is that a cab driver is more than a cab driver and has a larger <UNK> of influence over the lives of his passengers than you might originally think for some people he's just a means of getting from here to there but for others his very ordinary words help change the direction of their lives br br the last passenger of the day is used to try make sense of the rest of the movie and to a small extent it succeeds it had a bit of that <UNK> <UNK> feel to it where the good majority of the movie sucks and then at the very end it tries to make it all better in just one or two changes i wasn't too impressed with the movie as a whole but there were a few bits and pieces worth watching again as far as the actors go paul dillon is it john cusack gillian anderson and <UNK> moore are all in this for about 30 seconds each but don't watch this for any of them or you will most certainly be disappointed i will give the other people some credit that it's not your ordinary movie they have produced here but it wasn't a very good one either there just wasn't enough material to keep you going for an hour and a half it was a decent effort but it failed none the same
<START> i saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and i can only imagine that guy is a <UNK> br br the acting of the female lead is actually quite good but the entire film is just so excruciatingly boring i could hardly bear to sit through it this is the very definition of <UNK> br br so far this film is rated as 8 out of 10 on 7 votes that must mean the director director's girlfriend producer actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a 10 br br for the rest of you who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story avoid this br br this man on the street shall give it a 2 out of 10 br br <UNK> note while this movie can be used as an <UNK> to <UNK> a good nights sleep no <UNK> value is implied or offered
<START> first let me start off by saying this film sounded very interesting a serial killer the works of edgar allan poe who is one of my writers of all time sounds cool right yeah definitely not probably the worst film i've ever seen ever and that's not an exaggeration i've seen a lot of very very bad movies this one takes the cake and i was even prepared for a bad movie before going into it br br perhaps the writer should've studied some law <UNK> <UNK> if you have the name of the killer his entire life's history a criminal record and his address where is the first place you should look hmm possibly his house what no that's a preposterous idea anthony how could you suggest something so obvious and level headed rather than going to a <UNK> alley spoilers end honestly sometimes i can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad or vice versa but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find br br i think my biggest pet <UNK> was how the police fbi acted br br for example black fbi agent okay <UNK> female just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while i go inside and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be sound good to you moronic female fbi agent yeah sounds a okay to me go right ahead i'll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the <UNK> black fbi agent excellent that's what i would do honestly if you want to be in law <UNK> rent this movie so you can learn how not to act or if you're a human and want to learn the same br br 0 5 10 a half point just for getting a film produced and in stores <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> first snow has an intriguing beginning a traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man who's <UNK> turn out to be amazingly correct from this point on the movie plays out like a <UNK> twilight zone episode i mean nothing but car <UNK> phone calls and paranoia william <UNK> gives his usual interesting performance but guy pierce is anything but a sympathetic character <UNK> other people's well being for the sake of his own paranoia the ending is especially weak with absolutely no payoff for the long suffering audience do yourself a big favor and avoid this one not recommended <UNK>
<START> with the little respect it deserves i would like to state that this movie was horrible the filmmakers had good intentions but the overall quality of the direction and production value was obviously lacking a great deal i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good hard laugh and then wasting two more hours of their life enduring a truly painful experience i'm surprised i even found this movie on the 1 dvd rack where it was <UNK> placed i thought maybe it was going to be good and that i might discover some amazing independent film i was wrong i wish i had never seen this movie my 3 year old cousin couldn't make a worse film i'm glad i saw the film because i can finally tell people i've seen the worst movie ever made and be sure of it
<START> there must have been a sale on this storyline back in the 40's an <UNK> threatens new york it's always new york and nobody takes it seriously some might say that richard widmark and jack palance did it better in panic in the streets but i disagree br br there is always something about these poverty row productions that really touch a nerve the production values are never that polished and the acting is a little rough around the edges but that is the very reason i think this movie and those like it are effective rough grainy edgy and the cast all 2nd or a list actors past their prime no <UNK> here these folks were happy to get the work <UNK> <UNK> carl <UNK> reid jim <UNK> arthur space charles and the <UNK> voice of reed hadley flowing in the background like crude oil by the way i've been in the hospital a couple of times how come my <UNK> never looked like dorothy malone in these kind of movies they don't bother much with make up and hair but they really managed to turn evelyn <UNK> into a <UNK> or maybe they just <UNK> the make up and hair altogether anyway it was pretty effective she plays a <UNK> jewel <UNK> who picks up a case of small <UNK> in cuba while <UNK> <UNK> back for ultra villain charles who is <UNK> her sister in the meantime you got the customs agents looking for her because of the <UNK> and the health department looking for her because she's about to de <UNK> new york no 4th <UNK> rights here everybody gets <UNK> br br you gotta have the right attitude to enjoy a movie like this i have a brother who movies to death if they don't hold up to his orson standards he bombs them they must have the directorial excellence of a david lean movie the score of <UNK> von the sound and art of douglas <UNK> and cedric <UNK> respectively this ain't it br br but i have the right attitude and if you do as well you'll love this movie
<START> essentially a <UNK> b movie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden <UNK> major talents fritz lang even with the stellar names of lang walter <UNK> joan bennett and george sanders be prepared for a ludicrous storyline bad acting <UNK> phony sets and <UNK> for <UNK> sake i have to admit i am an <UNK> non admirer of walter <UNK> who was lucky to have found a <UNK> at the artificial dream factory of mgm and somehow worked in secondary roles supporting <UNK> <UNK> and others he is wildly miscast acting in a <UNK> <UNK> ray <UNK> <UNK> comedy tone in a role where his life is in danger and he is in hiding joan <UNK> cockney accent is excessive but her <UNK> hair perfect makeup and classy outfit <UNK> a street wise cockney <UNK> girl george sanders is incapable of bad acting but disappears after the preposterous opening finds <UNK> somehow pretending to shoot <UNK> hitler surprising for fritz lang is the <UNK> of tone i found the film <UNK> <UNK> between occasional moments of suspense thriller surrounded by light hearted comedic interplay hitchcock totally <UNK> the ratio using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense there is a reason this film is unknown it didn't serve or <UNK> <UNK> career or reputation and is forgotten because it's a surprisingly bad film from such a group
<START> i got this movie from ebay mainly because i'm gay and i love <UNK> <UNK> however it's one of those movies that when you watch it a second time you never say to yourself hmm i forgot about this boring part i'll go make popcorn it doesn't have that part it's a very fluid and constantly interesting film and yes <UNK> <UNK> is worth it if nothing else but it's a great movie even for straight guys
<START> this is an excellent movie had no role <UNK> to base her actions on yet was able to bring about very necessary change to a land that was living in darkness when it comes to female treatment i like the fact that it was a real story rather than made up it added to the horror of the story the triumph
<START> being a bit of a <UNK> of garbage i have stumbled across this little treasure action romance crooked cops violence its all here and not a single one has been pulled of right i was in love immediately then a funny thing happened about the second time around i became addicted i thought it was going to be a one rent and chuckle kind of movie br br <UNK> ray moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie he didn't have the money to make it look good but he did it anyway that's very commendable it also shows he was making the movie for his self i don't know how many of you have heard <UNK> <UNK> music but if you haven't he has a whole slew of albums reaching into the fifties
<START> an updated version of a theme which has been done before while that in and of itself is not bad this movie doesn't reach the ring like the other inherent and pure evil ones do br br predictable ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending
<START> 1 2 elisha <UNK> <UNK> michael murray brian van holt paris hilton and jon <UNK> directed by <UNK> br br yet another classic horror film remade with headed teenage acting despite <UNK> and creative deaths based on the 1953 vincent price film house of wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage <UNK> and turns them into priceless wax figures still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like tobe <UNK> 1974 classic texas chainsaw massacre later remade despite creativity and so so acting the movie was still just a gore picture director <UNK> showed mild enthusiasm with his directing but still worth watching my final rating 7 10
<START> todd sheets has created one of the greatest low budget zombie movies ever the story is great the gore is grand the <UNK> are wicked yet the movie is flawed by its petty dialogue and <UNK> <UNK> at times br br despite this delivers what any zombie movie should gore good plot fast pace adventure into the if only mr sheets had been given a <UNK> budget this movie would out do every zombie movie ever even the almighty dawn of the dead br br but as time goes by he gets better and as he gets better more money comes into his pocket thus allowing this man this modern day genius to craft his vision better br br just remember that zombie bloodbath 2 was just one of his great stepping stones when he is <UNK> of gore mountain
<START> <UNK> version of the life of the late <UNK> they put it just slightly ahead of <UNK> version and it may have suffered from that but the program itself was excellent it moved fast since it only had two hours with commercials also taking up time to cover this great man's long life but thomas <UNK> admirably was up to the challenge he did a remarkable job in conveying the emotions and <UNK> that john paul endured he unlike the cbs biopic played the role from youth to old age and managed to seem realistic at both ends of the scale his credibility never <UNK> he has an amazing range and depth it is a shame that the program could not have been longer and more detailed but working within the time frame they did have i think they did an excellent job bringing it to the small screen
<START> is full of energy and it's honest realistic and refreshing not a comedy or drama but more a slice of life movie about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in <UNK> for one year beautifully photographed with a nice soundtrack if you're older this movie should bring back a <UNK> of good memories if you're young learn by this example
<START> i've seen worse films this is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause it rest firmly in the <UNK> of the low budget b movie sci fi genre br br it is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket awfully charming rather than just plain awful br br the highlight for me is when lover goes to rescue her upon turning up she <UNK> which draws from his co pilot br br sit back get drunk enjoy
<START> this film was made soon enough after <UNK> passing that perhaps richard carpenter and the people closest to karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems as the years have passed almost 25 to be exact it must have gotten easier to deny any <UNK> richard has spent the years after <UNK> death endlessly and the <UNK> he made with her he married his cousin mary and from what i have read it looks like he may be planning a next generation <UNK> with his children he seems to have <UNK> making this film and that may very well be why it is <UNK> in any form it seemed to me to be a fairly honest <UNK> of the <UNK> short life and incredible talent that was karen carpenter
<START> richard utter insanity cartoon 'the big is a trip through madness enjoyable backgrounds melting characters and a conclusion that nearly brings me to happy tears <UNK> i see it br br this short i have seen over and over and over and i never tire of it luckily having it on tape from a broadcast on tv it never stops to make me burst out in laughter <UNK> and then reach down into the depths of my spirit <UNK> the greatness of the human condition br br cause when someone says <UNK> on let's finish the <UNK> everything is alright in the world and the troubles that we face everyday we suddenly realise are all petty fleeting things not to fight or worry about anymore this film at first seems just like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humour but it is far more than that this film hits a greater sense of spiritual meaning with mankind in the wake when everything seems to be so bad and trivial br br it is flawless in every way and damn funny too br br rating 10 out of 10
<START> it is the best film i have seen in the last 5 years surely it will be in the same row with such masterpieces as the platoon apocalypse now the doors the <UNK> heart russian film really the play of the boy and his parents is so good that you can't even say that they play no they live as if it was happening to them notice the smile on there faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them the hate and love in one piece and the final scene br br really i'm still under impression of that film it's very hard even impossible to combine the humor and the tragedy but if you succeed and did the impact would be twice strong br br i compared it with one flew over the <UNK> nest i like this film either and the novel itself is good too but after movie it seems simple the same difference i noticed after i watched the film american history x and <UNK> the latter is deeper i mean <UNK> <UNK> only showed the material point of view of the problem you watch it then you say yes it's a good film i like him i don't like her and that's it but angels leave you a wide base to think there are no bad and good boys in the film cause each of them have the right to behave in the way they do like the girlfriend of one of the patient of course she's young and is pregnant and that is a problem for her that his husband is in the clinic but the feelings and emotional experience of her are even stronger the result is his suicide why ask him what have he done aren't you insane yourself to ask why do not support him help him understand him finally it is even funny when those people talk to each other they say genius things there are a lot of things i would like to say about this film but i'm not so good in english but i'm sure those of you who have watched the movie understand me br br good luck br br
<START> having watched all of the star trek tv series episodes many times each since the 1960s most being quite good to superb and only very few being mediocre my opinion is that this one is the worst of all br br in fact i think it's so poorly executed as to be an embarrassment to the series it's not that the story is so bad although it's not particularly outstanding in any way but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters meaning those other than the <UNK> in this case barbara anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of a mass killer and who is on a mission of a sort she practically calls in the role from a phone and shows no real <UNK> abilities here although usually she's never used as more than a pretty face in most of her film tv roles usually small parts she has done much better br br arnold moss as her father gives new meaning to the term and is the only actor ever on a 1960s star trek episode that <UNK> william shatner in this area and actually makes shatner look superb by comparison and he gets to play a <UNK> actor no less which gives him more <UNK> to <UNK> and he does so br br other than these two leads being so weak the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minutes i say this because i told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre teens his <UNK> was yeah you're right br br skip this one and watch the much superior <UNK> episodes which were originally <UNK> right before
<START> so one day i was in the video store looking for a movie i came across this and rented it because it was a film i hadn't seen or even heard of br br now i like slasher movies in general but this is just abysmal not even good for laughs besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction i have ever come across now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had but not here painful example of home made horror
<START> not your ordinary movie but a good one billy bob is very funny in this movie the way he talks what he says etc i was kind of surprised when i saw it cause i just thought it was a normal comedy but it was more than that it had a very good story great characters and a good balance br br favorite part probably when billy bob is running around in his <UNK> shooting at the
<START> what a production what a waste of screen time and money here is what some european so called producer think of a scifi movie take former model alexandra <UNK> pair a with an us c class actor and get one of film business most notorious producer harry a towers towers then finds some obscure <UNK> based <UNK> house <UNK> communication bauer and then mix it all up with no script whatsoever and you'll get a priceless gem among the worst movies ever done get a live people and do something else whatever you do no movies please to top everything producers went to south africa for filming what you see on screen is one giant sand hole where the action takes place between extremely bad actors and extremely bad fx that any film student would do better
<START> in the muslim country of fictional its <UNK> leader dictator reed hadley as <UNK> is dying of cancer <UNK> dies and a desperate plot unfolds his body is wrapped in <UNK> foil and taken in a <UNK> operation the population does not know of his death <UNK> of his doctor and <UNK> out of the country to perform a <UNK> brain transplant the surgery is being performed by the <UNK> dr kent taylor who believes there is no chance of failure and has two <UNK> one of them is about 3 feet high master <UNK> did indeed run <UNK> town and the other is a <UNK> traumatized 7 foot giant named <UNK> what could possibly go wrong br br did i forget to mention <UNK> american blonde <UNK> wife tracy or that dr kent has a <UNK> with female slave test subjects <UNK> of <UNK> how about a brain transplant that didn't take there is a lot of double dealing throughout this and people are killed but i'm not going to lie to you anymore mission accomplished the ends justify the means if you can accept that then you will not have to waste 80 minutes i hope that is warning enough don't say i didn't warn you if you must watch then don't watch alone and have plenty of medicine standing by br br celluloid <UNK>
<START> if you been there and done that you will absolutely love this film i have and by there i mean underground <UNK> and house parties where there is far more rare to find people just being drunk than it is to find people high to their ears on speed or <UNK> br br by that i mean dancing and <UNK> like crazy for eight hours or so in a row with out even a <UNK> and that followed by a way to long morning of no can sleep and almost wanting to die followed by a week of just waiting till the next weekend to do it all again br br so even though this film now is one of my absolute favourites i can certainly understand why some people or most people even would dislike it
<START> sadly this movie is not very good but does it really matter we all know the <UNK> for the story and this has nothing new but i love low budget horror sci <UNK> camp classics so i forgive this one about <UNK> only thing that anyone remember from this movie is that little <UNK> <UNK> made his debut in it br br he did ok the part didn't ask for great acting skills and the direction probably never gave him any chance of providing one anyway little <UNK> <UNK> was very cute and so was the girl the movie is fun if you like horror sci <UNK> camp classics and are experienced in watching them
<START> simply put paul <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> were remarkable the movie is less about the raw science of <UNK> beliefs and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family primarily his wife emma and daughter annie br br toby jones gives a wonderful turn as thomas the great <UNK> of <UNK> beliefs and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with <UNK> and <UNK> br br but it is those two who carry the movie their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end but develops <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> with his demons the scene where <UNK> relates the ending of the story of jenny the <UNK> to his dying daughter annie is utterly gripping the world premiere audience at the <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> performance will be recognized as one of the year's best in short order equally magnificent is <UNK> work playing the religious wife of a man who in <UNK> words killed god br br the film moves slowly through the entire spectrum of <UNK> grief <UNK> every detail of <UNK> and <UNK> acting br br brilliant
<START> i just finished up this <UNK> adaptation of h p <UNK> the lurking fear that was shot in <UNK> outside of a few changes names setting this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to <UNK> its own twist ending that you could see coming from a mile away either way it is a much better adaptation than full <UNK> the lurking fear too bad it is a terrible film director david <UNK> shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short i swear i counted maybe two camera movements the creature design is cheap we're talking store bought masks here but shot in a dark manner intentional or not where they are somewhat creepy the most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion but <UNK> fails to exploit that as well file this one under good adaptation poor execution
<START> michael comic book stories particularly his work on madman usually are a great deal of fun no budget <UNK> film is the opposite of fun br br worst acting ever coupled with truly horrible dialog makes for a brutal cinematic experience pretty certain understands going on but he's the only one daring you to watch the entire mess isn't enough <UNK> you to watch the entire mess is more on target br br is some kind of movie tie in to red rocket 7 comic book which ironically is mostly <UNK> so if your experience isn't terrible enough definitely track down the over sized comics and continue the fun br br felt sorry for who was totally out of his depth attempting a film also felt sorry for myself what an incredible waste of my time and money please buy my vhs copy which is available right now on ebay hurry up
<START> mr kennedy should stop <UNK> with bad movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed the hey i've got an idea let's make a sequel stage of <UNK> if there was a zero rating i'd give it but i guess i'll settle for a generous 1 it seems these days that if there is a buck to be made movie <UNK> will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up hey i said hit and run kinda describes how i felt when this movie ended how this piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me it is filled with unpleasant humor strange animation and jokes that don't quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion if you are being dragged to this movie and someone is paying for you fine but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the <UNK> however if you're planning on paying your own hard earned money search out a better alternative
<START> was a great experience many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue <UNK> directs his film very visually driven for everything he wants to tell he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves thus he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen particularly european cinema is often very dialogue driven and many of the young us american directors are strongly influenced by that opposite attitude was really the point that made this film special for me it has also a very interesting topic that is wrapped up in a quite unusual story and told with humour vincenzo <UNK> is outstanding as family head <UNK> as well as the amazing charlotte <UNK> who i enjoy watching in every single one of her movies there are many great sequences in this movie just to pick one when the ship leaves italy and the people just quietly stare this scene is great particularly if you consider the pop cultural references that go with it titanic
<START> publicity got me to the theatre br br advice will take you away from this <UNK> of time br br very bad everything br br do you really want to see a monkey talking with a technological device br br x
<START> a refreshing black comedy starring some of <UNK> finest in the same way that lock stock and 2 smoking <UNK> captured the funny side of london gangsters two hands rips through the sydney underworld it wouldn't be so funny if it wasn't so close to the bone br br an australian classic if australia could pull more <UNK> like this out its hat it might actually have a film industry worth keeping an eye on
<START> this show was not only great human drama but portrayed racism in this country in a raw all too true to life manner when one show can be so witty and entertaining and yet so poignant and educational all at once this is television in its highest form the acting was phenomenal the writing was exceptional not only did the show portray race relations in a straightforward manner that seems <UNK> by any other television series but its ability to depict this subject matter as it existed in the 1960's alongside how it exists in the beginning of the twenty first century <UNK> demonstrates the ways we have changed and sadly the many more ways we have not
<START> i liked all the <UNK> and <UNK> movies the tv series weren't that great but i put my opinions of the series aside when i watched this movie and i must say it was bad br br one thing i found disappointing was the animation yes you heard it the animation i found its quality greatly <UNK> since the first movie its quality was only as high as the tv <UNK> something which i did not expect at all if you're looking for eye candy don't expect anything much here also the animation failed to portray any serious <UNK> even in the supposed sad scenes i didn't feel anything for the character another <UNK> from the first movie br br the next was the absolutely horrible voice acting i found it very very unconvincing and wondered why disney with all its <UNK> and glory couldn't afford voice actors with real talent the voice actors' skill were just as annoying as the one in the series i <UNK> the one in the series because hey who wouldn't be tired out when made to voice act for so many episodes heck i don't even know how many episodes there are <UNK> there are but i just can't believe that however i thought that the voice acting would improve in the movie and i was put down in the face by the truth that what they could do in the series was already their best br br next was the horrible script it was cheesy beyond redemption and the writers just try too hard they try to put some jokes in but i just found them annoying maybe it wasn't the voice acting but the cheesy dialogues that ruined the sound section on the upside the soundtrack wasn't too bad and matched the mood quite well br br <UNK> was the problem with the storyline i predicted everything and the storyline was what made the characters so unoriginal and unlikeable all of a sudden you have the aliens get new positions and <UNK> space after the initial hype they realize that they actually didn't like it and miss their old life br br meanwhile the evil villain gets broken out of jail after a very <UNK> action scene and breaks in to lab to steal his experiment the experiment was then <UNK> into 100 others and the <UNK> wants to <UNK> earth when the main characters find out they try to stop the evil <UNK> but gets confronted in some cheesy final showdown against the experiment and owns him in an extremely lame excuse for trying to make the series to look cool the characters then give up their new <UNK> and return to earth to resume their life seriously how many other movies has used that ending already the that storyline was extremely short and formulaic so don't expect too much from it br br so disney has failed in sound graphics and storyline the only charm of the series was the original characters and how they managed to retain the <UNK> of the characters but even that wasn't able to save the movie i tried to like it i really did but i give it a rating of 4 10 another disney failure
<START> it's too bad these guys the so called judges are such <UNK> even the <UNK> sensitive ones it's the self <UNK> tone that really makes me sick though these guys don't have any perspective on their behaviour i think the real problem though is the quality of the contestants not a single smooth or truly charming one in the lot they pick the most pathetic girls out of the crowd because they're the only ones these guys have a chance with let's see some real players trying for a truly <UNK> girl and maybe you have a show otherwise you have a revolting half hour of self love and real sexual tension takes two
<START> i'm sorry but i just honestly cannot see why anyone would actually like this it's stereotypical and real are nothing like they were on this show personally i'm glad it got canceled after the first few episodes i mean this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that weren't really like this and the whole story was just for the show but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this if anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a then i honestly feel sorry for them this reminds me of the kind of portrayal they have of kids in mean girls it's sad really that people think this way this is complete garbage imho
<START> <UNK> banks is thief at the top of his game but after a successful career he has decided to settle down with his woman and <UNK> however he decides to take one last routine job in las vegas all he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple unfortunately someone <UNK> the police and after a <UNK> car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place a typical action fest ensues br br steven seagal plays himself surprise wearing a <UNK> coat and sporting his beloved <UNK> <UNK> along with his usual bone breaking <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> have always been with him but the first i recall him with the <UNK> coat is in 'the <UNK> ' it isn't particularly impressive but it does add a little notch to <UNK> lethal <UNK> of or it covers up those extra pounds he is <UNK> look at it however way you choose his main buddy throughout the film is played by another new thing a <UNK> in an action movie and they both <UNK> a little conspiracy of bad guys on both sides of the law and give each evil <UNK> his due br br the film's main problem is that is it painfully and i truly mean painfully unoriginal seagal just follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie and even that manages to get more and more dull as the film progresses then it goes from dull to utterly ridiculous in the final scene as people who seemed to be dead on killing each other suddenly for no reason start to talk <UNK> inducing in every sense of the word the only real positive thing here is the decent opening a car chase in las vegas complete with flipping police cars and generally entertaining mayhem but after that brief highlight you've seen it all before 3 10 br br rated r constant violence and profanity
<START> this film is not only the last piece of the three colours trilogy but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s there's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being br br valentine irene <UNK> lives in <UNK> where she works as a model though she has a boyfriend she seems to be rather lonely one night she has an accident and <UNK> a dog and who leads her to his owner a retired <UNK> jean louis <UNK> who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls disgusted by him she cannot go away and they meet again two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other br br the story itself is too complex to be told completely there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and <UNK> real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendship br br the actors are wonderful irene <UNK> and jean louis <UNK> developing a deep and authentic friendship br br the topics are of an endless <UNK> <UNK> not only in contact with each other but also in the respect for the right of <UNK> <UNK> we seem to loose this right more and more which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994 br br red is one of the strongest colours that exists representing inner turmoil love anger and passion used here as another protagonist it brings a <UNK> depth to the movie a masterpiece
<START> though short lived the amazing spider man was one of the best made for tv versions of a famed comic book hero only wonder woman <UNK> carter the best of the genre and the incredible hulk bill <UNK> lou <UNK> were better br br the amazing spider man <UNK> the 1966 1968 batman because the high camp elements of the latter often ruin the adventure spider man <UNK> all three television interpretations of superman lois and clark <UNK> and of course the george reeves superman which brings up the rear br br the amazing spider man was an action drama during the late 1970's the pre cgi era when stunts had to be performed by stunt men not in the <UNK> of a computer spider man had its own very talented <UNK> to perform the death <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his name was fred <UNK> who <UNK> the suit for the action sequences nicholas <UNK> better known as one of julie <UNK> children on the all time movie classic the sound of music was spider man during the dialogue scenes <UNK> spider man also had his own secret identity as peter parker similar to christopher reeve superman clark kent adam west batman bruce wayne and of course <UNK> carter as wonder woman diana prince br br it's unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes because when the first episode hit the <UNK> in november of 1977 the entire country was watching it on cbs that <UNK> night in all fairness cbs should release this pilot episode as well as the deadly dust the captive tower etc on dvd shortly spider man was short lived but did have a cult following and in my opinion was a heck of a lot better than the movie interpretation of the famed comic book hero starring toby <UNK> br br cbs might be <UNK> to release these episodes for two reasons a there might not be a broad market for them based on the lack of <UNK> of the series and a generation of children and young people who weren't born when the series originally aired in the 1970's b one of the early spider man episodes dealt with a terrorist with designs on the world trade center which was attacked twice many years after this show went off the air in 1993 and of course the devastating attack against this country on 9 11 <UNK> in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost br br however i don't think that it would be in bad taste to release this spider man episode even if the show was adventure derived from a comic book and camp in nature the live action amazing spider man doesn't have a large following but it has a cult following if and when cbs releases it out on dvd this cult following could be explained along with the episode in which <UNK> saved the towers in 1978 but how in september of 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies i like to follow the news but i also like science fiction fantasy therefore i am eagerly awaiting the release of the amazing spider man on dvd
<START> this movie is overrated to say the least it's not good as a comedy and it's not good as a serious film either the pacing is far too plodding for the former and there is too much lame slapstick for the latter the only laughs come from some of bud <UNK> reaction shots when he becomes <UNK> by his brother's behavior the dubbing is excellent but the full screen framing is appalling 1 2
<START> when i fist watched the movie i said to myself so a film can be made like this wong <UNK> <UNK> gorgeous poetic love story captured me throughout and even after the film i must admit this is one of the best love movies maybe the best of all i have ever watched the content and the form <UNK> perfectly as watching the secret love we see the characters in <UNK> frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even <UNK> i want to <UNK> christopher doyle and pin bing lee for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love also the music <UNK> the sadness of the love which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in <UNK> <UNK> and of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real eventually all the elements in the film combined in a perfect way under the direction of <UNK> and give the audience the feeling called love
<START> i had the honor this evening to see a screening of the movie these girls at the philadelphia film festival going into the movie i knew very little about it and just took a chance on it because the film's plot sounded interesting so as i entered the theater just hours ago i wondered what the final verdict would be thumbs up or thumbs down br br these girls is the story about three best friends from a small town <UNK> caroline is the <UNK> who basically doesn't know what to do with her life after high school but her father keeps pushing her to go to college which is something she doesn't want to do lisa holly lewis will be going away to a christian school after the summer and finally glory amanda walsh who plans on spending her summer <UNK> but this summer is going to be a special one as they all blackmail keith clark david <UNK> the sexy older hunk who they baby sit for fun times and a lot of laughs br br i normally don't like movies like these girls but there is something about this movie that i really liked i think the quality i liked most about it was that it seemed rather realistic three girls who want to explore their sexuality pick a hunky guy who lets all of them have sex with him only to be <UNK> by them later it's a pretty funny tale about growing up friendship and sex but even though it sounds pretty cheesy i can see majority of this film happening in real life br br the subject matter here is probably a main reason why this film didn't get a mainstream release in the united states all the girls in this film are suppose to be under 18 which if i remember correctly two of them are 17 and one is 16 now in the usa even though <UNK> sex occurs on a daily basis many production or <UNK> companies won't <UNK> a film like this because of the sexual content this information was actually confirmed by the director himself john at the q a after the film the thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this film aren't graphic and the nudity is minor not to mention that all the actresses in this film are way over 18 in real life go figure br br what the movie does best is it provides a lot of laughs as well as very strong characters i liked all the characters in this movie and each character seemed to have a now then characteristic to them the jokes were funny because they were cleverly written not because they were dirty or over the top everything seemed to flow together nicely both the comedy and the drama the script was very strong br br the acting was very good for the most part i thought all the three girls were great caroline who also starred in one of the most underrated television series of all time <UNK> was just terrific as well as holly lewis and amanda walsh who both did a fine job as well david <UNK> did a good job and he looked like he was having fun while shooting most of the scenes the guy played a pot head so it was funny seeing him play that role br br i had the pleasure of meeting john tonight who seemed like a very nice guy and was very <UNK> of the comments made about the film i am shocked that this movie didn't go anywhere i think with a little marketing behind it it could have taken off sadly it's going to be one of these direct to dvd films which so few will ever have the pleasure to see i think with what little budget mr had to work with the film turned out well and i think he did a fine job directing this little gem br br for someone who typically hates teen sex comedies i can honestly say i really enjoyed this film the character development and witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be amused this is a fine comedy because it has heart and <UNK> to it i know i will be sure to buy this film when it comes on dvd on may 16 2006 if you're a fan of coming of age stories teen sex comedies or romantic comedies be sure to check this film out because it's one of the funniest films of its kind to be released in years br br <UNK> final rating for these girls is an 8 10
<START> i watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was i was looking forward to it after reading the plot even though i find <UNK> overrated it sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that <UNK> puts in little touches like the books kubrick book among others movie posters etc i like when i see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film and you can really feel that in this there are tons of scenes and moments that i love i am trying to think now of some other films that are like this and i would say the only thing i can think of are cameron <UNK> films takes little moments and makes them stand out and special the soundtrack is amazing and each song works perfectly with the scenes and feel of the film this film is amazingly shot and the editing is outstanding i could really go on and on about the film i cannot recommend this enough really if you want a fun story with great tunes from a director who clearly put his heart into his work then check this out
<START> i happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie that was humorous however my expectations were let down this movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a pg 13 movie this should have been rated r for the many mature references that went on in this movie i wouldn't recommend allowing a 13 year old teen see this br br even if no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie beware of a truly stupid movie there's no humor in the movie just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of <UNK> something that shouldn't even be <UNK> about br br i would like to know what happened to pg 13 movies that were actually safe for actual a 13 year old this is beyond a <UNK> movie and should be re rated
<START> i rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club you know those hip cool places you might stumble upon late on a saturday night well there's not one ounce of cool in this ridiculous movie the score is goofy the original songs are awful both lead actors' singing is continually off key to be kind and <UNK> at best the plot is no more complex than boy meets girl the acting is laughable and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes the jazz club scenes feature <UNK> dialog <UNK> by overly busy <UNK> music this joey de <UNK> should keep his day job unless his day job is helping with movie scores is it possible to not only get my four dollars back but have my therapy sessions paid for as well this movie interestingly enough is so bad you might want to watch it sort of like driving by a bad accident you just have to look at least once just get the ear <UNK> ready
<START> poor jane austen ought to be glad she's not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation so many great jane austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be <UNK> buried along with two other movies i despise the man in the gray <UNK> suit and the 1969 version of david <UNK> my main <UNK> with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book jane austen was <UNK> fun at the gothic <UNK> in her society and much of the novel is tongue in cheek the movie however is serious and comes across terribly <UNK> the lighthearted fun <UNK> flavor of <UNK> writing is completely and <UNK> absent from this <UNK> <UNK> horror meets period drama the scenes of <UNK> imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting also henry is dreadfully unappealing why i ask would anyone fall for him if you are looking for a fun filled jane austen evening watch emma instead
<START> i will admit my ignorance of this film's existence until i saw it advertised on a cable <UNK> i was very impressed with the <UNK> structure of the film the film which is in a language i do not understand <UNK> with intelligence and nuance for me i think this speaks to the film's quality it was visually stunning the acting was visually <UNK> the chinese theater traditions of movement used to enhance the delivery of dialogue is so compelling after watching western film where actors <UNK> focus more heavily on the dialogue the action in this film comes right at you without a lot of explosions to get your attention it is human action that is so <UNK> here the added advantage that the film taught me history about one of the world's greatest tourist <UNK> the <UNK> clay army of <UNK> first <UNK> was very impressive it seemed to give the film an international relevance beyond the film's great <UNK> themes this is a film i can <UNK> recommend to a wide variety of friends and <UNK>
<START> anthony writer director cold mountain is a carefully constructed sensitive and intelligent drama set in the social context of the <UNK> during the civil war which deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner while it accurately depicts the brutality and <UNK> of that war it also does something that many films related to this period to not handle as effectively cold mountain studies the southern context from the inside out and portrays changes among the non slave <UNK> common people <UNK> by the war and almost uniquely cold mountain does not over <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or anybody else br br the film <UNK> through genres as needed never presenting a dull moment it is a romance a war story an action adventure and historical fiction all nicely woven into one br br the story centers on jude law and <UNK> monroe nicole kidman who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons as this young romance begins to bud <UNK> in the <UNK> army taking with him a book <UNK> has given him and a photograph of her <UNK> character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end <UNK> is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister she begins the film as a <UNK> girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn in other words as she admits to ruby <UNK> <UNK> she is a master of everything useless br br <UNK> father passes on and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself with no experience of this sort she struggles and survives by holding the memory of close to her heart ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and <UNK> father ruby has all the skills and abilities <UNK> lacks and as they become <UNK> business partners they grow to love one another as best friends experience is <UNK> different but something of a mirror image during his participation in the war he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in and decides to desert nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to cold mountain and <UNK> and most of those he meets die br br the bulk of the film takes place during long walk following both of the protagonists as they live learn grow and change an on going act of will <UNK> of desperation <UNK> their intense passionate love for it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation for <UNK> it is very much the same thing but also a symbol and <UNK> of the old south a world which is rapidly passing br br the cinematography is powerful and breathtaking there are beautiful shots of <UNK> landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history the script and editing are also extremely strong <UNK> the broad class and educational differences reflected in the <UNK> <UNK> southern <UNK> of the middle and lower classes with the cast of this film nothing short of perfection should be expected and the cast mostly rises to the occasion my one criticism however relates to the accents adopted by kidman and <UNK> characters an australian and a brit probably should not be expected to accurately <UNK> southern american speech but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips i admit my to this and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people performance is outstanding and she creates a character i will remember into my br br very highly recommended
<START> okay first the good thing if you saw the trailer then you know about 100 of the scary <UNK> moment of the movie and yes it's a good thing because you should just stick to the trailer and not go see the movie br br i now understand why sarah michelle <UNK> did not stay alive in that movie for very long she did not want to associate her name with this production i wish her the best for the return br br you have to follow 3 different story in this movie and they are all <UNK> in time and meaning until the very end and even then it's a very bad climax and god <UNK> even open the door to another sequel br br yes in this movie the rage and fury is on the move no need to visit the house anymore just be close to someone who when inside and you're done it's not a curse anymore it's kinda like a virus go inside the house get scared return back to usa and spread the joy in your apartment building br br it's not that difficult to follow but you just don't really care about anyone the plot line is slim to none and you have many scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head milk anyone i saw <UNK> on 2 at the <UNK> movie festival last summer different story completely but much better than this dud it's not a remake but this time maybe they should have simply done a remake br br if you must see it wait for the dvd
<START> i thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the <UNK> that i saw in theaters when my sister borrowed from a friend i decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do needless to say ten minutes in the movie and i loved it amanda was a great actor in the movie her comedic timing was perfect the guy who played duke was hot plain and simple my favorite scene was definitely when amanda walks by the <UNK> and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she is talking to her mom about dresses as she is pretending to be a guy i re watched this part over and over to make a long story short the movie i thought was going to be lame i now own it
<START> great story and great lead actors quaid and ryan but the movie suffers from bad directing bad screenplay and bad script the lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at all too bad because this could have been a good 80's style hitchcock suspense mystery thriller ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though an ok look for big ryan fans
<START> if anyone has any doubts about the talent of <UNK> <UNK> just a look at his new film everything is <UNK> which clearly shows a man that is not only one of america's finest actors but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a <UNK> of what is to follow mr <UNK> has adapted the novel by jonathan <UNK> <UNK> into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material the film clearly <UNK> our expectations since we had no <UNK> ideas br br for those who haven't watched the film perhaps you should stop reading here br br jonathan is a collector his love for his grandparents is <UNK> he watches as his grandfather dies and as his grandmother is on what appears to be her death bed on a clear moment this dying woman gives jonathan a picture and an <UNK> <UNK> for his collection watching the photograph taken a long time ago a young couple are seen together watching makes jonathan think it shows the grandfather and his girlfriend taken on happier times watching the <UNK> seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to go looking for his <UNK> past in the <UNK> br br jonathan has made <UNK> with a travel agency <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> for his trip to the mythical place where his grandfather came from the agency is handled by an older man who claims to be blind and his <UNK> alex a man who loves the pop american culture that has captured his imagination as well as his <UNK> in the country alex speaks a kind of english no one speaks and his conversation and translation for <UNK> benefit are hilarious to our ear for the use of sometimes <UNK> english terms the old man insists in taking his dog sammy davis jr against the wishes of jonathan who doesn't want to sit next to the <UNK> and <UNK> animal during the trip br br as they <UNK> in search of it's clearly that his companions especially the old man has no clue where he is going at this point the film becomes a road movie as the three characters riding the back roads of the country become more <UNK> with one another as the trio arrive at the <UNK> field with the house at the end it <UNK> they have indeed come to the right place some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past br br the older woman living in the isolated place is the missing link of the story she is able to put things into the right perspective but here is where the story changes its emphasis from jonathan who clearly has come to the land of his <UNK> to the old man we watch as this older man starts remembering things about himself this in turn changes the dynamic of the film as we discover how connected jonathan and his <UNK> have been all the time br br some criticism in these pages have expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story which after all it's a work of fiction and liberties have been taken it would have been impossible to make another film including so much that is contained in the book the great way the film is divided into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what's about to be seen br br <UNK> wood a magnificent film actor does an excellent work by <UNK> jonathan mr wood makes one of his best appearances in any film with his interpretation of the main character the casting of eugene as alex the <UNK> tour assistant and <UNK> seems to be an idea made in heaven mr is about the best thing in the film his <UNK> usage of english gives the film a funny angle that <UNK> the viewer boris as <UNK> grandfather and driver of the tour car makes a valuable contribution to the film as well as who is seen in the last part of the movie br br the excellent cinematography of matthew brings the <UNK> of the czech <UNK> countryside in all its <UNK> the musical score by paul is heard in the background <UNK> the film in ways that it adds a <UNK> to the movie br br above all this is a triumph for <UNK> <UNK> the first time director that will surely go far in whatever he decides to do next
<START> while most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra end up being cheap <UNK> of the <UNK> series pitch black stands as a fine piece of sci fi and an excellent movie all around perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting this movie beautifully employs many different colors shades and <UNK> of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself something different than the <UNK> movie lighting we are generally subjected to <UNK> <UNK> brings his character to life in an excellent manner <UNK> avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal after all the film is about <UNK> character personal journey so thankfully <UNK> doesn't drop the ball the remainder of the cast with the exception of the talented and gorgeous <UNK> black were unknown to me but all turned in marvelous performances <UNK> the diverse characters with unique quirks and mannerisms pitch black is a perfect example of making a great film with out the resources of an excessive budget the special effects are more than adequate but at the same time they are by no means the sole focus as in many high budget <UNK> it's a great movie because it uses science fiction as a medium to tell an engaging provoking story rather then telling a mediocre story to use the flash of science fiction
<START> <UNK> revolves around classic comic book action superhero genre story lines essentially <UNK> is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth he is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of earth from the supernatural rather then be a menace the normal career route for a demon br br the set up of the story involves creative uses of history combining nazi experiments with the occult it's preposterous but so is the whole idea of a demon <UNK> the streets i find the explanations of the characters who they are and how they came to be very well handled the sequences are to the point and very entertaining in fact the opening is the best part of the film <UNK> lays the br br essentially del toro who both writes and directs this piece <UNK> it the film is absent of all tension or any major conflict <UNK> is essentially established as <UNK> within the first act and so the rest of the film <UNK> of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rather crass because we know inevitably <UNK> will be ok and the bad guy will die i hear you cry that this is the case for any action hero film well yes it is but once we are drawn into a well made action film we can't help but feel the hero may die die hard works because john looks likely to die at all parts he escapes death by the of <UNK> the stakes are raised as his wife is also in danger etc <UNK> terminator and terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior than the hero the threat and tension is constant br br some of the other major weaknesses are del toro is also guilty of <UNK> <UNK> ex <UNK> characters generally disappear and <UNK> as their skills are needed within the story the villain is featured in maybe three scenes he has no motives turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably in the one scene <UNK> looks to be up against a real threat groups of monsters a character <UNK> her abilities the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everybody else lives a minor character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film her character is so thin the relationship so undeveloped it is clear she is nothing more than a prop of sorts to push the plot along and to make it all make sense i don't want to ruin the ending of the film but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to br br the film suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just aren't smart or funny after a while it all starts to <UNK> br br what's more del toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals and whoever made the creative decision to make primary weapon a gun instead of his <UNK> arm should be fired essentially the use of the gun <UNK> the concept of the film <UNK> the fights to nothing more than a one sided shoot out br br the few <UNK> include the cinematography is very good at all times a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker colour palette as well as the use of interesting locations yet perhaps it is all a bit <UNK> as well br br the use of cgi and fx is well done never do we get an over load when effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is kept rather similar to how nolan used fx in batman i much prefer this method to the effects we often see br br all in all this is a pretty poor film the real shame is that despite not reading the comics i found the film wasted a lot of potential <UNK> as a character has a lot of instantly apparent fascinating <UNK> which are completely <UNK> the film has watch ability in the sense that if it comes on tv and nothing else is on it might be worth a viewing but in any other situation i wouldn't bother with it
<START> the horrific production doesn't qualify as a film it was obviously shot on video tape and very poorly at that there is a constant sound for the audio sounds like a bad <UNK> which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters are saying badly dubbed in music will suddenly appear in a scene and the entire editing of this thing rates about a zero br br the plot is contrived and ridiculous a late <UNK> gay man trying to hide his live in lover from parents visiting please and the reaction the mother has when she finds a picture of her son kissing his is beyond melodramatic and rolls right into stupid talk about a stereotypical view of gay life the acting is worse than a porno movie and the direction is very poor br br as far as production goes there isn't any br br this title is simply a lame <UNK> attempt to call itself a film there is no heart and soul to give it even the smallest bit of praise br br it's just a stupid waste of time so avoid it at all costs bad acting bad writing bad directing and the title of producer is vanity as this trash probably them the price of the <UNK> they shot it on br br this <UNK> garbage has no business getting released onto a dvd as it's <UNK> to the i cannot stress how horrible this crap is br br
<START> based on the best selling novel the <UNK> the missing star the latest film by acclaimed italian director <UNK> is the story of the growing friendship between an older italian <UNK> man and a young <UNK> he hires in shanghai to be his guide through china vincenzo is the <UNK> manager at a steel mill in italy that has been shut down and the blast <UNK> sold to china when vincenzo sergio <UNK> discovers that a control unit in the <UNK> is <UNK> and potentially dangerous he travels to china to find the steel mill where the part has been sold in hopes of <UNK> a fatal accident br br the film of course is about the journey not the destination to use a familiar cliché and on that journey we are <UNK> to an engaging look at china with all its immense beauty and complexity via the outstanding cinematography by <UNK> the film takes us to shanghai and a trip along the river showing us <UNK> areas that are <UNK> to be <UNK> when the three <UNK> <UNK> is fully <UNK> a chinese mega project that has resulted in the <UNK> of 1 2 million people the trip brings the <UNK> face to face with poverty <UNK> <UNK> and children left to <UNK> for themselves br br the film revolves around the relationship between vincenzo and <UNK> liu <UNK> <UNK> who first meet in italy where his <UNK> with her <UNK> at a dinner meeting causes her to lose her job when he tracks her down in shanghai she is working at a library and <UNK> to <UNK> approach looking at his offer to help him in his travels in china as little more than a well paying job she reluctantly agrees to <UNK> him their relationship however grows as they move from city to city her <UNK> skills much in evidence to help the <UNK> vincenzo who does not own a cell phone br br as they slowly open up to each other they expose each other's vulnerability and the film <UNK> into their past and present life and how they arrived at their present situation we meet <UNK> son lin wang at the home of her grandmother in <UNK> one child policy he is one of the <UNK> children who have been hidden since the father of the boy abandoned the family although the meeting between vincenzo and the boy is casual their relationship becomes central to how the story plays out br br <UNK> is an excellent actor though one <UNK> for a younger <UNK> lo in this role however he is emotionally distant throughout the film his expression rarely changing from a far away <UNK> expression though <UNK> <UNK> brings a great deal of presence to the role her relationship with the much older vincenzo never seemed real to me and the ending seemed to exist only in a reality known as the movies though is one of my favorite directors coming on the heels of the brilliant keys to the house missing star is a disappointment
<START> this is really bad the characters were bland the story was boring and there is no sex scene furthermore it lacks drama the conflict is minimal causing it to be extremely slow paced nothing happens in this film you would expect a sex scene but they just have a kiss the plot revolves around three characters a man his wife and a stranger that they pick up from the high way the couple invite the stranger to stay with them because he is homeless at this point you would expect the stranger to have sex with the wife right no they just kiss and thats it also this film contains no action no comedy no drama and not even suspense makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script
<START> curse of michael myers is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the halloween series after a very disappointing letdown in halloween 5 the series reached a near <UNK> in plot lines with a silly <UNK> into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of michael myers curse of michael myers ups the <UNK> in blood and gore but really represents a <UNK> in the <UNK> integrity it's too bad to as this is the last movie for donald <UNK> as the character of dr <UNK> <UNK> has some good screen moments precious ones if your a fan of the series as the now very aged and as he says very retired doctor sadly he died before the movie was completed and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized right from the beginning credits halloween 6 has more of the feel of a made for tv movie then that of the block buster horror flick that it started out as in 1978 any loyal halloween <UNK> should have <UNK> more from this film dr <UNK> and donald <UNK> deserved more
<START> what can i say not much to this one at all pretty dull and uninteresting br br the actors performances are just ok the only one that shines in any way is simmons but he only has maybe 3 scenes i understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he <UNK> the mysterious psychic aura he has but i can't help but feel his talent was wasted no one else rose above mediocre br br the story itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning but then just doesn't go anywhere there wasn't a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like i had just seen something special the cinematography was fairly bland i mean desert in a washed out sort of <UNK> not very inspiring br br the story of his childhood pal back outta prison seemed only partially thought out and didn't really add anything to the story other than making an average <UNK> <UNK> script into a full length feature br br drab
<START> not even <UNK> but simply a bad movie the cinematic equivalent of a dirty old man ugly in every way unimaginative script static point of view <UNK> clothing ghastly hair unlikable actors and one truly gratuitous rape and <UNK> scene the director's perverse sense of humor is present but it is not applied consistently the movie comes alive only in its cruelty the women fare especially badly could be used as proof the director was a <UNK> though a better explanation to me is that perhaps beginning with his tv series and <UNK> which he himself described as an exercise in <UNK> an experiment to see if a television crew could shoot a passable feature alfred hitchcock had pretty much abandoned art and settled for <UNK> in the great master seems to be <UNK> to convention trying to go with the times and give audiences what he thinks they want in the form of unappealing nudity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and general <UNK> i don't <UNK> an old man his rest but i don't want to remember him tired and lazy and <UNK> time to watch again

<START> <UNK> was awesome i don't get how <UNK> goes to the underworld and makes a deal with the source but then in season 4 is back how does she get back is there a deleted episode that was never showed i am confused i brought 1 2 3 4 5 and season 8 but am still confused will someone help me help help help h e l p br br h e l p br br h e l p br br h e l p me me me me <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ll <UNK>
<START> great film no gratuitous gimmicks like in most hollywood films everything supported the suspense of the plot b w gave it a basic no <UNK> feel also in short it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast br br following serves as an interesting contrast to <UNK> characters in both used manipulation and <UNK> <UNK> in that sense both reminded me somewhat of in the company of men also highly <UNK> one difference between <UNK> two films is that <UNK> was a little easier for me to follow given that the b w scenes progress in a constant <UNK> direction and so do those in color i don't think that was true of following where scenes seemed to be shown at random if you have the choice between vcr and dvd i'd highly recommend dvd since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in <UNK> order not just in the <UNK> albeit <UNK> order presented by nolan it also makes it easier upon a second viewing to piece the order together for yourself if you want to br br as another viewer noted one of the best things about both this movie and <UNK> is that none of the cast were famous they were characters not big name actors who brought in <UNK> developed in other movies br br given certain similarities in the plots i wonder if <UNK> is sort of a remake of following but intended to reach a bigger audience like edward burns made she's the one in the mold of and with largely the same cast as the brothers
<START> i actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it's even better then the deer hunter which was overrated both this movie and year of the dragon are very underrated although i could see why someone would not like this movie at three and a half hours the movie just goes on too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half kris kristofferson and christopher walken are fighting over isabelle <UNK> but she can't make up her mind about which one to be with sam <UNK> is the villain who has a list of <UNK> people to be killed who is says are and thieves there is a great cast that also has jeff bridges brad <UNK> and a young mickey rourke
<START> i need help <UNK> an episode of king of queens it begins with a scene where doug is talking to carrie on the phone and he suggests that they agree to stop ending every conversation with i love you however it's hard to do and he ends up calling her back only to close with i love you it's a very clever moment and one i think says a lot about relationships that have lasted a long time br br i think but i'm sure that's it's the same episode where doug gets some local construction guys to <UNK> and throw lurid comments at carrie to <UNK> her spirits up br br i saw this episode recently but it was probably a repeat don't know what network i saw it on can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode
<START> this is one of the many <UNK> <UNK> movies that <UNK> like <UNK> in the mid 90s after the internet went mainstream br br hollywood movies have always had their way in the depicted <UNK> to make them look better and more appealing the same happens when hollywood tries to show us some hi tech the outcome of such attempts <UNK> from being very far fetched and ridiculous see <UNK> 1995 johnny 1995 etc to being quite realistic see <UNK> 1992 br br the net lies somewhere between those extremes by <UNK> one can end up with quite a lot of technical inconsistencies and a lot of cases where the <UNK> seem to be much more sexy and <UNK> than the way things are in real life as usually happens in movies br br however by simply <UNK> those the viewer ends up with a quite solid entertaining movie the characters and acting are convincing and the movie does a good job in keeping you in your seat till the end of it the plot is okay a fairly standard one really based on the good ol' <UNK> design but with a hi tech edge this time and quite convincing again when <UNK> technical issues the development of the plot is a bit <UNK> though and occasionally you can <UNK> some supposedly surprising turns in the plot br br the bonus here is <UNK> pie sandra <UNK> which besides being cute something she does quite easily apparently also portrays a solid act you can really feel her character her despair her emotions br br in the bottom line the movie is entertaining and interesting rates about 7 from 10 in my scale it's worth renting from the video library or even watching in the cinema whether to buy it or not is up to you
<START> very touching film a great surprise to come up from brazil a country that usually <UNK> features about social themes violence sex magical realism is a very hard task and i believe <UNK> has made it wonderfully it seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film far from that although many people think the film was adapted from the play he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book another mistake is to think that has been influenced by the series <UNK> de maria the tv series produced by was made after the film but aired before unfortunately br br the negative point is the photography by walter <UNK> it seems that he didn't capture or understand the concept has created the story is captivating and universal in spite of taking place in a tiny little city in brazil that could take place anywhere in the world a great movie i strongly recommend
<START> the second woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to do him harm a girl who likes him wants to help him but she is led to believe that his fears are caused by a mental illness br br interesting plot very good acting but the result as a whole is poor in many ways the story is too simplistic or rather presented in a simplistic way even though there is a couple of interesting plot twists for example people say they love each other after only two <UNK> i don't want to reveal anything else but you see what i mean if you watch the movie come on it was the fifties you may think yet i <UNK> seen quite a few films from that era and i know that some don't seem so dated nowadays br br something that disturbed me was that some scenes were shot pitch dark making it almost impossible to watch what was going on ok it's a film noir but this one is too noir at some points o br br overall the second woman is not a masterpiece of that era but no trash either watch it if you have nothing else to do
<START> at first i thought this film was going to annoy me it was as though i had seen this movie somewhere before the <UNK> hero the father figure and the 9 year old sister who is older and <UNK> than her years see <UNK> girl but then not 15 minutes in it became a laugh out loud comic gem of a movie dylan <UNK> who i thought was just going to bug me was excellent as was mr and the mad scottish <UNK> lena <UNK> was extremely sexy for half of the film i was trying to remember where i'd seen her before the <UNK> officer she has the most amazing smile but clearly the true hero of this film is mr caine this man should do much more comedy this ranks alongside some of his best comedy roles without a clue dirty rotten <UNK> he is a pleasure to watch in all of his scenes but especially the end br br no one can quite say f k the way michael can br br
<START> from 1950 comes a neat thriller about a couple <UNK> <UNK> from abroad and also the <UNK> disease <UNK> evelyn <UNK> pulls out all stops as the essential victim of this film noir once back in the united states she is not aware that she could be <UNK> the disease on everyone and everything she comes in contact with eventually she is pursued and must be stopped before an <UNK> occurs other than <UNK> striking performance there is good support from villainous charles william bishop dorothy malone lola <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the finale is a <UNK> with miss <UNK> on the <UNK> of a building with <UNK> and hundreds of <UNK> below a good b flick
<START> it gives the ordinary guy girl the chance to be on television singing as their favourite stars br br for the majority of the time they sound like the singer they are meant to be portraying br br another twist to it a team of make up people and <UNK> dress the contestant up like that singer they might not look like them but the <UNK> of getting someone that sounds like a person looking exactly the same as them are very slim br br it's a load of fun for your saturday night and the contestants aren't raging <UNK> like they are on another tv singing show the fact that there are no <UNK> involved and it is for fun means that it will attract a different type of person br br the only <UNK> i have is with the kids version it looks like they have done the round of stage schools what happened to the normal kids
<START> ok a warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian be careful about who you see this film with ie do not take kids to see this film i'll explain why br br 1 the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance i assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf but is annoying 2 the film itself is really very very disturbing i have some problems first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a <UNK> <UNK> but it is a very disturbing film and involves a child and his parents and a small town br br ok it <UNK> down to this the film is not suitable for <UNK> because it contains sequences and images that are unsettling and would be confusing to a child is has a bizarre quality to it and its only because it has a child in it that makes me feel its <UNK> as a parent myself i feel strongly enough to want to tell people because i read only the other day that it is having a release in theatres br br i hope im not <UNK> the film makers by saying this but i think its my right because its getting a release and has an m rating only because its not violent or sexual just weird and unsettling but pretty good in and of itself
<START> proud as i am of being a <UNK> i'm truly shocked by flicks like these why why this cheap acting why this storyline that just sucks why a dozen sequels why o why they add a lot of hot dutch chicks in an effort of saving this movie from redemption and guess what all the <UNK> in holland go and see it i was forced to watch it at a party all the girls were going crazy when entered the screen all the guys took a another beer and <UNK> but the thing that really bothers me is the fact that this kind of flicks are the only sort of movies dutch filmmakers can produce apart from van god los and <UNK> this doesn't prove our <UNK> to other countries it doesn't add anything to our imagination it just f <UNK> up the brains of little 13 year old girls <UNK> i hope you will burn forever
<START> this is a good plot concept so why o why is it such a poor film the acting is terrible and every shock is <UNK> so far in advance that it is almost laughable by the time it reaches you spend your time and money elsewhere this is not worth watching
<START> i loved it others have revealed spoilers but i won't it was an unusual premise actually sort of weird but i went along with it completely <UNK> was a difficult part to pull off convincingly maybe that's why some people hated it but i think <UNK> was excellent and her acting skills <UNK> her to nail the part perfectly without being <UNK> or ridiculous i don't know why she was even interested in a loser like james franco but married him anyway i like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job he has nothing to be ashamed of there have been movies with with similar <UNK> e g ghost i simply love <UNK> miller and went along with the situation as written in the script i feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated and hope it becomes more recognized by the public i thought all of the actors played their parts very well and hope more people get to see the movie i highly recommend it i was surprised that my local block buster store had about 10 copies available i definitely plan to buy it
<START> the good the acting were great especially <UNK> howard and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> howard should have been nominated for best supporting actor instead of matt dillon br br the bad i'm a visible minority non white and i have experienced some form of racism in my life but despite my life experiences and the movie's subject matter i would definitely not say that this movie is the best of the year in fact it's far from it i have problems with this movie both from a <UNK> perspective and from a visible perspective some of my problems with this movie are br br 1 poor character development or none at all just because we saw extremes in a character for example matt dillon being a racist cop and being a good <UNK> to his <UNK> father that does not mean in any way that the character is well developed yes i admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie it is quite difficult for every character to be well developed but that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that br br 2 the dialogue seems really contrived to the point that i'm really surprised this movie won for best original screenplay they should show this movie in a screenplay writing class not because it's good but to show students and future screenplay writers what not to do i just felt like i've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is i get it br br 3 the plot seems so <UNK> it is laughable what are the chances of a black car <UNK> running over an asian guy who also happens to be a human <UNK> while entering his van and that same black car <UNK> ended up <UNK> that asian guy's van several hours later after he brought him the hospital only to find out that the several <UNK> being <UNK> inside the van just to show you that the black car <UNK> has a good side after all or what about that scene where a <UNK> upper class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred <UNK> into thin air if it was that simple why don't we throw every racist in america down the stairs so they will have a change of heart br br 4 i think my biggest <UNK> about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism as someone who has experienced racism in my life the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face i've been refused to enter a supermarket because i'm not white did the store owner said because i was not white no he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside did he yell racial <UNK> no racism in america is more hidden some cab drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're non white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial <UNK> if a chinese woman rear ended me i won't be saying blake blake learn some english bitch on the other hand if i was a chinese woman and i accidentally rear ended a mexican woman i won't say <UNK> are bad drivers in front of her face that's not how things work instead i would give out my insurance info say sorry and go home and tell my fellow chinese friends and family that <UNK> are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs that is the real racism it's hidden and not in your face br br anyway crash is not original unlike what some people may say the <UNK> and <UNK> story lines plots and characters have been done before <UNK> is a movie that does this much better than crash did and yet it was never nominated for best picture at the oscars it had a stellar cast <UNK> moore william h macy phillip seymour hoffman who won best actor recently tom cruise etc it really <UNK> my mind how crash was even nominated for best picture
<START> you belong to me 1941 is a example of the <UNK> which started in the mid 1930s and ended <UNK> wwii some of these films <UNK> their status others have earned <UNK> praise when originally were critical and box office <UNK> like bringing up baby 1938 or mr mrs smith 1941 then there is this one which value just keeps sinking br br why can be <UNK> in the screenplay story it <UNK> credibility from the get go <UNK> a superior cast barbara stanwyck is married to millionaire henry fonda who is insanely jealous he would be content to sit back with his million and love her she wishes to maintain her profession as a doctor she wants him to become in what her eyes is a useful member of society this conflict is supposed to <UNK> us it cannot be <UNK> by either the principals or the supporting cast br br the faults in this scenario can clearly be laid at the feet of dalton henry <UNK> character is written in such broad <UNK> that any viewer has a instant dislike for him barbara stanwyck just has nothing to do but react to each idiotic situation of jealousy must have been spending to much time outside the studio being a useful idiot then being on the job columbia obviously did not get their <UNK> worth from him maybe robert should taken over
<START> ugh what an embarrassing episode last night it was either a failed script for abc <UNK> special or the product of an earnest rookie writer just out of college making an homage to that classic pc anti gun from 1974 the gun in fact <UNK> were disappointed that the closing shot wasn't of the gun being <UNK> down like in the movie br br no i'm not some <UNK> <UNK> it's just that when the producer of an intelligent nuanced series gets it in his head that i should be subjected to a <UNK> <UNK> of his personal cause i'd appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn't delivered via 2 by 4 <UNK> br br ok the <UNK> lesson is over the message has been delivered the important episode has been aired now let's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence
<START> i used to love the muppets the muppet movie the great muppet caper and the muppets take manhattan were good family movies cleverly written and fun to watch i never thought i would see the day when they would jump on the hollywood sleaze <UNK> but here it is <UNK> as a <UNK> rave dancer <UNK> making <UNK> and suggestive comments every five minutes this is not your father's muppets it's not jim <UNK> muppets anymore either br br this it's a wonderful life themed movie has its moments but not enough to save it i <UNK> while watching this with my children i still have hope for their next movie but this one was certainly a disappointment
<START> yes i felt like i had been <UNK> after first seeing it but not until the next day did i begin to see the true brilliance of this creation i won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film but there is one new area i want to touch on spoilers why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the <UNK> pocket most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an <UNK> performance i must disagree watch the scene again <UNK> is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage the student is quite an <UNK> girl crying <UNK> her fears just the opposite of <UNK> character there is a scene later in the film after the girl is injured when <UNK> <UNK> the accident with the girl's mother the mother <UNK> upset states we gave up everything so she could study piano and <UNK> immediately <UNK> you mean she gave up everything don't you br br so it was my thought that <UNK> was simply saving this young <UNK> student from her own destiny she didn't want the girl to end up like her repressed hardened condemned to a life of <UNK> gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago before things grew bad maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age is she ruining the <UNK> life or simply <UNK> her br br for me that realization made all the difference in what i experienced through this film brilliant
<START> prince of central park 2000 is so utterly bad it was a pure waste of my time and i can't believe i actually watched the whole thing please do not watch this movie if it's the last thing you do
<START> come on fantastic drama on screen are you joking folks i wouldn't put horrible molly gross to play even in school play where did these people learn acting <UNK> some papers from their neighbors actor terrible plot awful acting <UNK> why do you take us for an <UNK> what can i say more i understand this is an tv production and the acting is not supposed to be the one from citizen kane but nevertheless they should try it harder in order to earn their money and apart from that what can be said in 10 lines for a simple movie like this u wanna article in the morning paper to say what worse film in the decade ok you want it you got it
<START> burt <UNK> <UNK> to clint eastwood <UNK> on his redneck comedy <UNK> with his <UNK> comedies was to make his own dirty harry in chicago style thriller <UNK> machine originally intended for john <UNK> but in the end directed by the star himself it's an out and out commercial package with reynolds a <UNK> who gets <UNK> down to the vice squad literally they're in the basement who sets out to nail a mysterious crime lord who is backing earl <UNK> as the next <UNK> you can guess the rest but while reynolds tends to lose sight of the story at times he has a good eye for individual scenes and almost gets a performance out of rachel ward as the high class hooker he falls for the romantic subplot is unusually well developed there are a couple of good action scenes and some nice touches such as having <UNK> <UNK> villain a mirror image of the hero or reynolds and a killer both <UNK> out a witness from <UNK> apartments in the same building one of the <UNK> better films from his glory days it's no classic but it makes for a more than efficient saturday night special
<START> i would bet a <UNK> <UNK> the magnificent seven returns <UNK> was made for tv other reviewers <UNK> that <UNK> was a theatrical movie and i'll take their word for it the logical answer must assume it was originally shot for tv and after a change of studio heart it was released <UNK> instead every actor is primarily a tv actor <UNK> hartley michael <UNK> stephanie powers tv performers all lee van <UNK> split his time between tv and theater screens stephanie powers has only made 3 or 4 real movie appearances in the last thirty years of a very prolific television career proof positive this was shot for tv minor players are veteran small screen actors who can be seen on old reruns of <UNK> wild wild west streets of san francisco and so on br br the ho hum sets are identical to the universal studios tour sets often seen in old episodic tv and the editing betrays the one or two takes of tv with limited camera movements <UNK> cutting and lighting the sound track <UNK> of the original themes are straight from seventies television yep i'd bet money it was shot for tv br br that's an important point in <UNK> <UNK> initially i watched <UNK> on cable assuming it was an old theatrical release in comparison to the original magnificent seven it's a joke a cartoon an amateurish attempt at movie making acting lighting writing settings action cinematography music the themes editing pacing on and on all pale in comparison to the classic magnificent seven which is close to the perfect 60's western and one of the great action movies of all time br br however viewed as an early 70's made for tv movie as i suspect the film is actually better than average those unfortunate enough to live through the 70's as an adult know what i'm talking about <UNK> would have <UNK> against <UNK> smith and jones and similarly bland network shows during the seventies <UNK> was a quality show <UNK> on character development rather than action gun play to two <UNK> a week the first shooting usually a murder sets the <UNK> plot into motion the second shootout <UNK> the episode by killing the guest star his nemesis or otherwise <UNK> the conflict with <UNK> matt dillon <UNK> has more action than a whole season of <UNK> in this light in this frame of reference <UNK> is passable entertainment a cut above the tv fare from that decade
<START> this film was very different form the previous films and i had to wonder where is ralph <UNK> he could have been involved in the plot somewhere as old friend who teaches julie what he already knows then can come along and add some more <UNK> could've been the love interest for julie in this film never mind br br on a serious level i enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenage girl how to do karate and her feelings are very different to what <UNK> were julie is much more wild than daniel was and needs <UNK> something which finds very challenging she's quite a troubled girl and a rude obnoxious brat br br it was very satisfying to watch the transformation in julie as she <UNK> to and gets to understand more about karate and her life in general we can all learn a thing or two from <UNK>
<START> enjoyed http <UNK> <UNK> my wife didn't so i watched it in bits over a few days br br reviewers mainly confused most agree it's <UNK> but not of what br br that most people don't wish to escape and it's essentially forbidden goes with most of those <UNK> br br so presumably you're supposed to project your favourite <UNK> prejudice fear onto it br br so i'd say it's about an a life a live <UNK> of colour literally in the film <UNK> in the interpretation
<START> what a disaster normally when one <UNK> a historical movie it's always fun to point out the inaccuracies that slip in usually added by the writers to create more dramatic situations however is a whole kind of animal in this movie you strain to find anything at all that is confirmed by the historical record amidst the <UNK> of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of bad boy artist emperor br br and it's a pity because <UNK> is one of the most fascinating of all the roman his life was filled with enough <UNK> events and interesting people to make a really good movie the producers of this mess chose another route which leads only to head scratching on the part of any informed viewer br br just a few examples br br 1 <UNK> is depicted as an 6 8 year old boy when <UNK> has his father killed for <UNK> his mother and sends the boy to be raised by slaves in the countryside ten years later the story <UNK> just before the assassination of <UNK> facts <UNK> was born about six months after <UNK> began his four year reign and was only three when he was <UNK> <UNK> father died of natural causes was briefly <UNK> for bad behavior not <UNK> and <UNK> was not raised among slaves but had the typical upbringing of a young member of the <UNK> family br br 2 okay according to the writers <UNK> is now about 16 when his great uncle <UNK> becomes emperor in fact he was about to turn 4 <UNK> the downfall of the <UNK> and marries <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> then he goes off to <UNK> britain and is <UNK> by soon after his <UNK> return <UNK> is <UNK> emperor although he's still perhaps only 18 or 19 years old fact <UNK> <UNK> britain in <UNK> a d two years after beginning his reign he lived until <UNK> a d <UNK> should have been <UNK> years old by then by any normal <UNK> but in fact succeeded to the throne at age 16 br br history tells us that there then followed the five good years where <UNK> ruled wisely and well under the <UNK> of the <UNK> and the commander this is shown sort of except that portraying the roman <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> good <UNK> is false opposition to <UNK> only <UNK> when he started to show signs of insanity and began killing <UNK> for real or imagined <UNK> br br 3 <UNK> mother is the controlling sort who murdered her uncle husband to make her son emperor after a while <UNK> <UNK> of her <UNK> and decides to kill her in the movie he sends his henchman to stab her to death all true enough but the reality was so much better was a survivor and didn't go easily <UNK> tried three times to poison her but as an old <UNK> herself she was <UNK> to all that and he failed then he tried to crush her to death by <UNK> the ceiling of her <UNK> but that also failed next he sent her on a voyage on a ship that was deliberately constructed to fall apart and sink as it went down she jumped into the sea and <UNK> to shore finally he had her stabbed to death now showing all that would have definitely improved this movie br br other errors abound <UNK> lover was not a childhood slave friend she never <UNK> him and there is no evidence that she became a christian <UNK> did not commit suicide by <UNK> his <UNK> while sitting beside a lake etc etc etc br br the sources for <UNK> life are primarily the roman historians and both of whom were of the class hostile to him and his memory but the evidence <UNK> that he remained very popular with the common people unlike one of the final scenes where he is <UNK> by the mob with <UNK> as he leaves the city to commit suicide br br why did the writers and producers take an <UNK> interesting story with plenty of good stuff for any movie and make this piece of crap oh and did i mention how cheesy the sets and costumes were lol br br one star because there's no way to rate it lower
<START> this is a prime example of <UNK> filmmaking at its best richard greene who does good in the role search for his two missing friends takes him to the black forest <UNK> and castle of one eyed count bruno stephen <UNK> a past enemy of his whom he has never seen face to face incredible film has so many awesome elements combined for once into a single film a crocodile pit a <UNK> mute played by <UNK> <UNK> jr a <UNK> doctor played by boris karloff a <UNK> hunt very well done and very atmospheric a love story a castle a <UNK> a sadistic one eyed count and his two evil <UNK> played by john <UNK> and michael <UNK> an intriguing background story which makes the film even more interesting and more jerry script doesn't allow itself to be bound in making a film that comes extremely <UNK> to anyone who is into <UNK> filmmaking with a touch of horror and atmosphere to it
<START> the deer <UNK> success with critics and <UNK> alike led united artists to give <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> gate an epic western about the <UNK> johnson county <UNK> br br the <UNK> story about the <UNK> of <UNK> european born <UNK> by cattle was a muddled mixture of class conflict <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> stereotypical however <UNK> fetish for authenticity and his sweeping sense of scale <UNK> that the film running at nearly four hours  was rarely br br its <UNK> status as a cause with critics divided as to whether it was a masterpiece or a fiasco derived from its <UNK> blamed for the <UNK> financial problems <UNK> became a <UNK> for hollywood's general decline and the film edited into an incomprehensible short version after its initial release was a commercial
<START> i've seen this amusing little times the only problem is its currently <UNK> on video or dvd <UNK> certainly a <UNK> for a dvd release the much missed richard jordan plays an ex pat american whose just been released from prison he finds himself a job as an <UNK> in a bank it all goes well until he finds himself <UNK> in a bank heist with his ex <UNK> david niven plays the mastermind <UNK> its an enjoyable little romp hopefully studio <UNK> or anchor bay will come to the rescue look out for john rhys davies before he struck it big with <UNK> of the lost <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> in a small role as a <UNK>
<START> john wayne is without a doubt one of the most popular and loved actors of all time his career stretched over forty years and within that time he starred in films such as angel and the <UNK> the green <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bravo north to <UNK> and the <UNK> br br the film's listed above are <UNK> as some of his best unlike this 1934 effort randy rides alone which has been pretty much forgotten about as <UNK> gone on which is <UNK> as it's nothing memorable apart from its very short running time of just <UNK> minutes br br a young john wayne plays randy <UNK> who for reasons never really explained arrives at a saloon in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed while looking around a <UNK> arrives and finds randy there and they arrest him <UNK> him of being a gang member and demand to know where the rest of his gang is he is put in jail accused of the murders sally rogers whose uncle owned the saloon and was murdered arrives at the jail to see randy in order to <UNK> that he was one of the gang members she was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place sally doesn't believe that randy is a killer and doesn't <UNK> him so while the sheriff is out she slips him the keys and randy escapes while running away from the sheriff and his <UNK> randy conveniently stumbles into the <UNK> <UNK> in a cave who were responsible for the murders randy sets out to clear his name and also to bring the gang to justice br br randy rides alone can be a fun film to watch especially if you're a john wayne fan but at the same time it has far too many flaws that are impossible to ignore the film is also extremely dated as you would expect we have the terrible camera shooting which makes everyone look like they are moving in super fast motion and the dialogue is terrible the acting isn't great either and wayne's character is very wooden and he along with the rest of the cast look like wooden puppets who are being <UNK> by someone in this case it's by director harry <UNK> harry <UNK> is at the <UNK> and does a good enough job but the story is paper thin one can't help but feel that about ten minutes is missing from the start of the film as randy just arrives out of nowhere at the saloon and is looking to meet someone an explanation on why randy was there is giving later on which turns out to be something like he is a p i who was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the town to be honest i didn't really pick it up most of the time i was hoping for the movie to end br br but that being said i didn't find this film to be completely terrible i enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite fun at times but it really isn't a great film and isn't really worth watching or tracking down br br overall randy rides alone is incredibly dated and is a tiresome western with very few redeeming qualities can be fun but overall it isn't a great movie and is certainly one of wayne's weaker <UNK>
<START> there are three main problems with the film or rather there are three reasons why it isn't even a <UNK> worthy of more serious consideration br br firstly and this was always going to be true it's not nearly as good as the books however at least we could have expected to reflect some of the wit or depth br br secondly we have the production fantasy movies are in my opinion the hardest to produce well everything from the props through costumes scenery stunts and especially cgi is <UNK> br br finally and this is many be very <UNK> i just can't quite take the acting seriously i wasn't brought up in <UNK> so i can't really judge it may me my lack of <UNK> with films in polish all the same the lines seem very <UNK> delivered the casting could be better as well br br in <UNK> the only possible redeeming feature of this film is the remainder of the plot shining through not unlike a diamond ring on a rotting <UNK> br br on a separate note i heard that the books are coming out in english i haven't seen them yet but i can't imagine how one would even begin to translate them i would ask the english speaking reader to bare this in mind when judging the book
<START> an interesting movie based on three of jules <UNK> novels considering the special effects and computer enhanced animation of today this movie stands as an historic <UNK> of cinematic <UNK> and imagination <UNK> <UNK> has brought to life the images of the original jules <UNK> <UNK> this is a must see for classic science fiction and history buffs br br i give this movie 9 out of 10 enjoy
<START> the original road house was a classic cheesy 80s movie which although it didn't have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of star patrick <UNK> and the great supporting cast along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy br br 16 years later and mgm <UNK> attempts to re create the magic which left us all <UNK> one liners and <UNK> the three rules of <UNK> with a movie which quotes all the <UNK> best one liners and <UNK> the three rules br br were this an amateur fan made film it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of <UNK> movies as a <UNK> made film it falls flat on it's face right into the dvd <UNK> bin with its <UNK> <UNK> of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the original br br having said that with new lines such as i'm gonna kill you just like i killed your father no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original script br br i knew this was never going to be anything special being a straight to dvd sequel but i had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the road house name but what you get is simply just a 2006 remake of the same film with a little <UNK> added in br br were i the director i'd have removed all references to the first film so as not to <UNK> the original and it's characters as it is we got patrick <UNK> character now supposed to be dead killed off screen in a lame way by jake busey and his brother and son now the main characters who strangely enough have completely different <UNK> br br my favourite part was that <UNK> <UNK> drove the same car his father did a genuinely cool homage although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did that's a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the <UNK> movie br br also of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill <UNK> just like i killed your father and then proceeds to attempt to <UNK> him in a completely different manner amazing writing there i see <UNK> is listed as co screenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothing br br overall though this is an ok film if there's nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half or if you haven't seen the first road house but hardcore fans of <UNK> classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first as someone once suggested as an alternative <UNK> for this film even jeff <UNK> is glad he won't be seeing this one stick to the original road house and <UNK> the good old <UNK> days
<START> trying hard to fit into the scary space comedy genre this film falls down in two of these it does indeed take place in space but it is neither funny or scary the plot is dismal and the one joke concerning the intellect is <UNK> to death saying that paul as ethan angela <UNK> as <UNK> and brad <UNK> as al bert make the best of their ham script the <UNK> <UNK> relationship between ethan and al bert is hinted at but never explored whilst the attempt at sexual tension <UNK> and rick is so crude as to be laughable all in all this is a turkey that is best suited to late night tv preferably whilst do the <UNK>
<START> wow pretty amazing that something this bad could actually be made i am giving this movie a 2 because it is so bad it has a certain car wreck kind of appeal its so bad its comical and that does have a certain entertainment value plus there is a bit of gratuitous nudity and that is always appreciated br br so where do i begin the acting is beyond awful its like you are watching a high school play being filmed <UNK> russell must have done something really bad to have been forced to make this movie and her acting reflects how happy she is to be in the middle of this mess br br the rest of the cast is simply silly with the casting of dan <UNK> as an fbi agent the <UNK> on the top of this piece of crap his acting actually had me laughing at loud br br as for the screenplay and the directing c <UNK> <UNK> and mark l lester should simply be taken out back and shot
<START> human traffic is a view into an average weekend for a group of friends it is a fly on the wall view into their lives and minds which will show you how this group of friends relate to each other there are many moments in that every one can relate to like being out of you skull at parties and talking complete rubbish to strangers the characters are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the roles that they play in the movie the situations that they are in are all situations that we all have found ourselves in and that is where this film succeeds the topics of sex and drugs are handled superbly as to no get in the way of the characters relationships with each other the story to the film is not all that but that is not a criticism this is a film about people this is a well written film with a sound track to die for d <UNK> pete <UNK> has put together an superb selection of tracks for this file which all goes to make this one of the best films that i have seen in 1999 after watching this film i felt like i had been out <UNK> all weekend fantastic movie jo brand as the voice of reality need i say more br br
<START> a tedious yawn of a film that <UNK> nothing of the <UNK> and of its predecessor gold <UNK> of 1933 the production code was firmly in place by the time of this film's release so the humour is all of the hokey variety and gone are the dry one liners that sounded so <UNK> dripping off the lips of the gorgeous <UNK> from the first film a cast of second <UNK> stars and character actors go through the motions here and the on a show <UNK> seems awfully forced instead of the make or break world of broadway the show here is a charity event <UNK> by a <UNK> hotel who really cares whether or not the show goes on the score here is bland too of course the movie's big number is <UNK> of broadway which <UNK> a long fantasy dance number about a new york eventual demise from too much <UNK> doesn't exactly have the same effect as the <UNK> forgotten man number used as the finale in busby berkeley directs as well as <UNK> this film and whatever promise is built up in the film's fluid opening scenes quickly <UNK> unfortunately no one learned any lessons from this and there was yet another gold <UNK> movie two years later br br grade c
<START> with an interesting premise in the conflicts between europeans and <UNK> peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear this should have been a good film but the story is <UNK> by the director's <UNK> <UNK> with his own <UNK> <UNK> with a very poor script br br yes the natural setting is beautiful and yes the movie is authentic to its 19th century historical setting but the filmmaker keeps <UNK> the lily over and over again adding <UNK> upon <UNK> of over the top musical <UNK> not to mention a completely unnecessary voice over to the soundtrack that ultimately <UNK> the viewer and by calling attention to themselves take away from the story br br to me it was clear the director with his <UNK> closeups and the endless of the musical <UNK> of danny boy of all things was trying to make a new zealand version of an epic sergio <UNK> film something on the order of once upon a time in the west but given the <UNK> of the story most of <UNK> westerns were tongue in cheek not to mention that it's no longer 1968 he succeeds in making a parody of one br br too bad
<START> from troma which is my favorite movie company is a messy horror film that can be interesting but very dark and twisted br br <UNK> starts with a family in a car they get into an accident which leaves a daughter dead and a mother <UNK> the father eventually goes crazy and <UNK> prostitutes he sees his daughter in other people he kills for her meanwhile his now <UNK> wife is being raped by her <UNK> these are sick people br br <UNK> tries to be sick and disturbing and it does manage to do that as a good horror flick this is not most troma movies have a sense of humor to them but however this one doesn't
<START> i rented this movie after hearing chris gore saying something to the effect of five stars on that attack of the show show well when i turned around the dvd and it showed the 3 stages of hell well i had to buy it just to see the spectacle of a mother yelling at her son to drop her other son into a <UNK> pit br br i wasn't expecting <UNK> or for an hour and <UNK> minutes but i was expecting at least a <UNK> version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie well sadly there wasn't anything like that the 3 stages of death part happens right from the beginning and its pretty much downhill from there nothing really happens in this documentary it was pretty raw bare and <UNK> not a bad thing but there is a narrator in this one you'd expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary but he doesn't which would of been nice to have a message or reason for this doc there was no real reason to have a narrator there should of been just text explaining some of the less obvious scenes br br it doesn't really explain the lives of these <UNK> either it shows a few moments of some dramatic scenes which sound interesting but the reality isn't as great as it sounds for instance mom watching her son <UNK> with light <UNK> and <UNK> for the first time at a public park instead of seeing her reaction to the wrestling they show her <UNK> to the camera instead of say a interview later on or just actually witnessing her reactions br br document wise this one ain't the source material was flimsy to begin with nothing truly profound or interesting really happens no conclusion to a few of the more interesting stories no real point or final thought to backyard wrestling edited together badly and its and its basically a cheap failed rip off of beyond the <UNK> br br wrestling wise this is pretty boring the better <UNK> are at the beginning and slowly become less amazing and shocking if you have seen japanese wrestling indie wrestling or even backyard wrestling dvds than this wont shock and awe you if you want wrestling don't make the same mistake i did and see this one go get some <UNK> or dvds instead br br the only thing i got out of this documentary was how stupid people can be not for supporting self <UNK> or doing dangerous stunts but their reasoning for committing these acts the seem stupid for wrestling most of them are <UNK> and probably have a few issues in their head and wrestling is a type of therapy for them than the supporters seem even more idiotic mothers basically take the whole if ya cant beat em join em reasoning to cope with the fact that their sons are basically killing themselves school authority figures support their students in their dangerous stunts because its an alternative to joining gangs and to a lesser <UNK> doing drugs which is kinda funny since that segment took place in a rural town where like people live 20 miles from one another people are stupid thats what i <UNK> from this documentary br br if you want to see the reasoning and thoughts to someone <UNK> themselves in wrestling and basically what the back of this dvd promises get the life of nick <UNK> its more amazing and interesting than the backyard and a lot more entertaining oh and its actually good
<START> i was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work vivid cinematography and yes wonderfully explicit gore br br this film is no exception however compared to his later films the beyond zombie 2 city of the living dead house by the cemetery etc the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis <UNK> away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who <UNK> amongst the lush hills of italy the scenery is at moments reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> and then immediately <UNK> by mud and blood <UNK> terror <UNK> by <UNK> ruins the gore in this film is not quite as prevalent and seems restrained compared to <UNK> later films however splatter and giallo fans will most likely be <UNK> by a few close ups of <UNK> wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film br br overall a fantastic and mature film from one of our great italian horror directors
<START> guy <UNK> almost looks like flynn and this resemblance is the only one this film can claim nowhere in <UNK> autobiography is the <UNK> <UNK> character mention the homosexual encounter is <UNK> fiction and the movie's claims that flynn treated native labor badly are <UNK> director frank <UNK> hasn't made any memorable films and i find it lame for him to <UNK> flynn to further his <UNK> career br br
<START> i heard legends about this film quotes used so as not to insult films for a while so when i finally got the dvd with it i <UNK> started watching it by the end i had to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic <UNK> made nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end <UNK> br br this may be the worst film i've even touched and i used to be associated with troma for a while <UNK> family makes the bottom of <UNK> entries look like daring and groundbreaking art house <UNK> i could go on and talk about the <UNK> of a plot it has the <UNK> bad acting the painful inept directing the sets and props with their dollar ninety nine look i especially loved the plastic toy guns used in the <UNK> murder scene or the nauseating look and feel of this whole bag of garbage i think it was supposed to represent a drug induced <UNK> i have absolutely no idea how a drug induced <UNK> looks or feels nor do i want to find out but i guess drug <UNK> with burned out brains will love this film they seem to be the ones who made it i've seen many films from various worst 50 lists <UNK> opened by eddie <UNK> ones and eddie wood would be appalled by the sheer <UNK> and talentless of van <UNK> or whatever his name is i certainly don't want to remember it i've never seen <UNK> or its sequel but i strongly wish that <UNK> joined them on <UNK> rating fortunately this obscure garbage probably won't be seen by enough viewers to warrant it <UNK> many 1 votes and so much the better
<START> when the net was first being advertised the ads made it look ridiculous then when i saw it it was actually quite good angela bennett sandra <UNK> spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors then through a series of events her identity gets <UNK> by a <UNK> of shadowy people and she can't prove that she exists br br some parts of the movie are a little bit far fetched you'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie still it's a good look into what the existence of the internet may have <UNK> on unsuspecting people i do recommend it
<START> showtime falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying and a little south of what i expected months ago when i first heard about eddie murphy and robert <UNK> niro <UNK> up for a comedy overall it was pretty good as real life crime or cops go and plot for that matter it is pretty illogical but duh this is a comedy also while the special effects chases <UNK> shots and <UNK> blowing up were present but lower key than a movie i found it a bit tiresome and overdone 9 11 sensibilities aside for myself all that <UNK> <UNK> hyper effect stuff had been getting really old these past few years it seemed a lame substitute for characterization story and engaging emotions i hope the lesser <UNK> of it in showtime is an <UNK> of a trend in hollywood a trend <UNK> of less use of the silly less use of the exploding building br br <UNK> niro and murphy are two of my favorites their screen presence and charisma and even their character depth have been a joy to behold for many years that can't be <UNK> here they are engaging actors and entertaining and appealing in this movie i can't put my finger on it but perhaps the explosions the excessive fx and all of that <UNK> the final product perhaps or perhaps it was something else or a combination of factors that gives one the sense that the movie didn't achieve its highest potential whatever it was showtime was entertaining i probably will buy the dvd when it comes out but i had the vibe that it nonetheless wasn't all it could have been at least not all i had hoped for br br very good movie but not a great movie i gave it an 8 out of 10
<START> there's some nice scenery to look at here if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see any of it i'm a big fan of slice of life movies but these people are just plain bland although there's nothing political here the entire film can be looked at as a political statement in that it shows how communism destroys the individual making everyone the same bland animal that just spends its life sleeping eating and occasionally making love
<START> for a feature film the plot closely follows history or at least historical <UNK> but then the chinese who know the story very well from seeing it portrayed again and again would never tolerate it otherwise the attention to detail is wonderful especially for anyone who has read <UNK> account in the records of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> according to <UNK> <UNK> did indeed make an attempt on <UNK> life at the request of the crown prince of <UNK> before <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mentions both the head of general fan and the <UNK> rolled up into the map as well as the <UNK> being thrown into the <UNK> <UNK> although <UNK> <UNK> is described as no stranger to <UNK> he's hardly the <UNK> warrior portrayed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is indeed this film's weakest link in reality again according to <UNK> <UNK> he was a heavy <UNK> and put off his visit to for as long as possible spending a good deal of time with the ladies of <UNK> before the crown prince finally ordered him on his way he was in short a human being and was not looking forward to death although he was willing to accept it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is afraid of death but not his own he is the classic ruthless killer turned <UNK> <UNK> his love or maybe just affection for a woman and pity for several hundred children whom had buried alive not even two thousand years of hostile <UNK> historians claimed <UNK> <UNK> did this although there is a legend about him <UNK> up to their <UNK> and then <UNK> them is enough to make this former assassin kill again the melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being just plain boring the acting here isn't <UNK> though not very interesting given the character as for lady <UNK> in all the numerous stories i've heard about <UNK> <UNK> she's never come up anyway <UNK> li is famous enough for americans to have heard of her thanks to zhang <UNK> and there needed to be a love interest so here she is it's unfortunate that her performance is almost as wooden as <UNK> <UNK> character she's done much better in <UNK> for example at being subtle here she just barely manages presence but all of this is trivial compared to the extraordinary acting of li as himself <UNK> <UNK> is for the chinese rather what <UNK> satan is for us accepted as a villain but a noble one <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an awe all the way across two thousand years into the present and li captures his frightening will without <UNK> his humanity <UNK> performance is enough but the scope of the film is grand although the photography is <UNK> drab it does feel ancient the score is adequate <UNK> moving though very appropriate to the action though i've only seen it once i believe that <UNK> <UNK> should be given more credit for his camera work than other reviewers have allowed him the opening credits are <UNK> if five stars its absolutely average i given three more for li acting and <UNK> <UNK> as an actor writer and director
<START> the screen play is very bad but there are some action sequences that i really liked i think the image is good better than other romanian movies i liked also how the actors did their jobs
<START> dustin <UNK> debut feature isn't as bad as it's <UNK> to be a spanish italian co production filmed in italy with the director using the <UNK> dan ash the film is uneven but generally <UNK> and deals with a <UNK> of shady characters in search of a 1 000 000 hidden by gangster <UNK> romero who despite being third billed after elsa and hoffman himself <UNK> before the credit sequence has even rolled br br <UNK> performance obviously is nowhere near as nuanced as in later films but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to an <UNK> <UNK> an accident prone american <UNK> agent of <UNK> descent named which nobody seems to be able to get right sent out by his firm to retrieve the money and told to remain <UNK> but instead is forever getting into trouble though he ultimately proves surprisingly <UNK> by finding the <UNK> <UNK> the crooks and winning the girl as romero's daughter who's somewhat wasted here br br still the film's best moments are provided by suave gangster <UNK> apart from his would be hard boiled persona and the hilarious use of <UNK> he's <UNK> by a trio of <UNK> who more often than not prove a <UNK> in the <UNK> of his various schemes also in view of the story being set in rome it's odd that the police officer investigating the case is a <UNK> <UNK> an of the co production deal br br along the years i've missed out on <UNK> other italian comedy <UNK> <UNK> 1972 a number of times i guess mainly because leonard <UNK> only rates it 1 2 in his movies video guide but then million gets a bomb with <UNK> <UNK> directing and co starring the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of that film are certainly more respectable and i really hope it turns up again on italian tv soon
<START> formulaic slasher film only this one stars three ten year olds all born during a <UNK> <UNK> as the killers nice huh a little bit of gore and a nice nude scene may make this worthwhile for <UNK> fans of the genre others beware br br 1 2 out of
<START> when i watched this movie in my <UNK> i attempted for the soundtrack some bands of the soundtrack i still didn't know however during the film i already noticed her quality <UNK> <UNK> police <UNK> jones sensational soundtrack br br in brazil there is a long time this film didn't pass in tv today he passed in cable tv and i remembered to access the site to do the comment br br the end of the film surprised me a lot but it is what happens in the real life not always what thought about being the ideal it is what happens br br the life brings us a lot of surprises
<START> this movie describes a truly horrific event to be sure but it all falls down from poor performances from all the cast it is impossible to feel the emotion of almost any character as all the emotional scenes seem like parodies of themselves for example a character is shot at the start of the movie and you get the clichéd desperate am i gonna make it sergeant yeah it ain't <UNK> but it plays out like a sketch from a wayans brothers movie i don't know if they've made the war movie yet or something starring leslie <UNK> br br the sergeant played by sean penn reminds me of al <UNK> from married with children while fox is the greatest self <UNK> good guy cliché you can imagine thank god he <UNK> and <UNK> during it br br his emotional <UNK> is definitely more suited to comedies like back to the future than so called serious movies such as this br br to their credit some of the main scenes without giving too much away where they actually perform some fairly horrific acts are well done and do make us take the subject matter seriously but that is in spite of not thanks to the acting
<START> i was ten years old when i saw <UNK> i instantly had the <UNK> for michael watson and laura <UNK> they really do have some great on screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie i ordered a copy back in 1993 from full moon and i learned this <UNK> and <UNK> the servants have much bigger roles in the screenplay along with the king what most people don't know is that there was an alternate sequence that was supposed to occur in the ending scene michelle and <UNK> get <UNK> into a room and michelle has the idea for <UNK> to make her a vampire to help fight off and her demonic controlled ex friends however for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera another scene in the script that can be confirmed from the original trailer shows <UNK> drinking blood from a wolf or actually in the trailer you see him coming up with blood on his <UNK> br br this movie gets a 9 because it's one from my childhood and i have fond memories attached to the characters even though my favorite characters were <UNK> and michelle i think <UNK> is pure feeling <UNK> acting so much feeling in his work there
<START> this is probably one of my favorites so far although i have the first one and have seen curse legacy and vs demonic toys the only one better than this one is <UNK> vs <UNK> curse is the worst one in the series than the first one and then its legacy i recommend people to see this and vs <UNK> those ones who say this stinks are so wrong the story is well written and it is a sweet movie this is a classic movie even younger kids can watch and not be as scared when watching the others well this is my review you can call me its easy to know where that came from 101 <UNK> series you can watch it on <UNK> disney at 4 00 a m oh and don't laugh i'm a guy you will see more of my reviews in good time if you want to know why i watch it i'm 12 word of advice have a mental meal i also agree with you 1 but why people like the others is because they're more thrilling than horror and because the puppets are made to look scarier also you can call me
<START> this movie was beyond awful it was a <UNK> on the a s of the movie industry i know that every movie can't be a hit or for that matter even average but the responsible parties that got together for this epic dud should have been able to see that they had a <UNK> time bomb on their hands i can't help but think that the cast would get together in between scenes and <UNK> each other for being in such a massive heap of dung i can hear it now you <UNK> paid nope you i understand that this flick was more than likely made on a shoe string budget but even with that taken into account it still could've been better you wait for the appearance of a monster creature and when you finally see it it's a big yawn i'm so mad at myself for spending a 1 <UNK> on this stinker
<START> empty <UNK> of john <UNK> novel <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> but ends up being absurd it's a quirky goofy and bittersweet string of sketches attempting to explain a man's growth from birth to <UNK> and how he deals with the <UNK> of lust and <UNK> that surround him <UNK> is born to a <UNK> <UNK> mother jenny fields played by glenn close the various stages of childhood are played by three young actors before robin williams takes over as <UNK> reaches <UNK> the story follows him through childhood at a <UNK> <UNK> school where jenny is the school nurse through his high school passions wrestling writing and sex to marriage with his high school sweetheart children marital problems and a writing career jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist <UNK> an <UNK> cause the plot details an abundance of comic and episodes and outlandish adventures williams gives a <UNK> faced performance this script was not fitting for his <UNK> and <UNK> and thus his talent was wasted he's like an injured bird <UNK> out of control john <UNK> role as a father like <UNK> <UNK> wisdom also doesn't make sense this movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982 due to the popularity of robin williams and his new entry into movies williams had recently shed his <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and focused more on stand up comedy and movies audiences were confused by this film especially by its <UNK> and inexplicable ending
<START> at the rate these movies are <UNK> through the <UNK> from the <UNK> house it won't be long before we get down to the but for now it's a mirror that's causing problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth entry in the series a homeless man hands it over to artist <UNK> ross <UNK> who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past this mundane horror <UNK> along at a dull pace leaving us waiting for a build up that never comes as the various goings on lead to a dumb finale bland and lifeless with <UNK> acting and huge hair not helping matters
<START> this movie is so bad and <UNK> part 1 to 3 are so great nothing is good <UNK> a lot of gore but without meaning and the majority of time without originality the movie is about the past the present 1996 and the future of the puzzle box the creator of the box and his <UNK> fight against some demon but nothing link up seriously the 3 stories <UNK> is in the movie but it isn't <UNK> he is just a boring bad guy who kidnap kids and kill bird and the worse he talk too much a thing that i really didn't understand is why the dog from hell he can't be a because he had nothing human why the dog can be killed by the pressure if the other creature from hell can receive bullets without problems <UNK> is incoherent with the movie series in many ways for example <UNK> and <UNK> are old friend in this movie but it's impossible that <UNK> met <UNK> because <UNK> is just a soldier from the first world war and <UNK> is an old demon and she live in paris since sometimes like 200 years
<START> seagal needs to get back to <UNK> breaking bones and kicking butt no more of this slow motion crap like <UNK> and in the shadows fighting like half past dead exit wounds showed more of his fighting skills with some <UNK> which was ok but then he went back to b movie directors
<START> first of all there is a detective story by <UNK> <UNK> whose <UNK> 21 <UNK> had already transferred to the screen in 1942 with pierre <UNK> and the same actress <UNK> complained about <UNK> adaptation for both movies the movie from 1942 was excellent but the detective story side had been kept so why complaining as for <UNK> des <UNK> was now in a new phase of his brilliant career after having directed le and been <UNK> he had a lot more to say than a simple <UNK> complained essentially about the poor detective ending which i will not reveal of course but <UNK> focused on the social vignettes on his <UNK> psychology and he did not give a damn about the puzzle <UNK> la agatha christie by doing so he becomes the genuine predecessor of claude <UNK> who has always been closer to him than to alfred hitchcock whom he <UNK> much though <UNK> has great screen presence and you will love the song she really sings she was a singer too <UNK> son <UNK> bernard <UNK> gives as ever a <UNK> of gestures and words performance and he really pulls it off two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing the first one <UNK> the photographer she takes pictures of female models and <UNK> by subtle touches reveals us she's a lesbian of course the word is never <UNK> how could it be in <UNK> the police chief fabulous louis <UNK> tells her you and me we are not lucky with women the portrait of this cop is very detailed we learn a lot of things about him not necessary connected with the <UNK> plot he's a widower with a son he <UNK> and who runs into school difficulties particularly in <UNK> so we get to know all the characters in depth one of the most important <UNK> of post war french cinema
<START> i gave this show a chance because of white not for his character but mainly for the <UNK> the <UNK> voice <UNK> so anyway like i said i gave it a chance and i was very fond of it i never cared for the character so i was pleased to see mr white in a role other than the ever so annoying nerd and his <UNK> j <UNK> first called <UNK> but come the second episode everyone started calling him j was very entertaining and interesting br br i think my favorite episode was when j was dating the ex <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> kid don't you talk that way <UNK> my <UNK> this is grown up talk you stay down there the only <UNK> i have is that the show was suppose to have 3 main characters but mr <UNK> character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two who are married always had the back stories it isn't exactly a good thing when a story about those two possibly being pregnant takes <UNK> to j having to <UNK> his <UNK> dog br br other than that i really wish this show could have lasted a little longer it seems that people weren't interested in white as something other than the god awful annoying ass nerd known as br br hope they at least put it out as a dvd box set
<START> this movie is a pile of rubbish and to try and base it the first is just a farce the main thing that let it down for me was the usage of the one liners out of the first one which once said by classic actors such as sam elliot can not be <UNK> in any way i mean when dalton phones <UNK> in the 1st and he ends the call with stay cool that was great but when the <UNK> rings the <UNK> agent back home and he ends the call with stay cool it doesn't have the same ring now really does it there are other ones but i cant be bothered to post em up but i hope u get my drift they should of named this <UNK> wannabe
<START> the humor is non existent in this loser of a movie <UNK> top plays a <UNK> dude <UNK> who consistently blows the rent money on his goofy useless <UNK> then he helps an old guy broken down by the side of the road and <UNK> he's inherited a major corporation and on and on and on past the jealous relatives <UNK> the corporation hostile <UNK> the obligatory love interest <UNK> let's just say this movie is virtually unwatchable what <UNK> top has accomplished is to convince me never to go to his stage shows
<START> the buddy holly story is a great biography with a super performance from gary busey busey did his own singing for this film and he does a great job
<START> this story is an excellent tale of two boys that do whatever they can to get away from there abusive <UNK> father lord of the rings star <UNK> wood is outstanding in this unforgettable role this movie is one of the main reasons i haven't touched a single beer and never will as long as i live that might make me sound like a nerd but that's what i have to say it is a wonder why this isn't as a classic american tale
<START> the gates of hell opened up and spit out this film then closed again br br watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies i have seen like all other movies nothing makes sense in this movie br br it would really take too long to mention all the plot problems in fact except as a warning it really isn't worth wasting some of the nearly <UNK> space available on the internet writing about this film br br from now on i will check imdb before watching any film br br hot darn imdb is forcing me to write more about this film i guess i should warn you about edison force while i am at it but if you had to chose between the two pick edison force
<START> directors of the danny <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are responsible for the eye and its sequel and their premiere american picture plays like the grudge <UNK> set in a <UNK> a family of four move from chicago to a run down <UNK> farm in rural north <UNK> almost immediately their teenage daughter jess starts seeing ghosts of course her parents and the police are skeptical admittedly the film is well made and there are two or three effective scares but relies too much on <UNK> effect still the plot is a <UNK> copy of many ghost stories and the ending is anti climatic and <UNK> awful scares are on the low side too with a tendency toward cgi overall the is a pretty weak horror film that simply doesn't deliver 4 out of 10
<START> i was blown away when i saw the best years of our lives the acting script and master william <UNK> direction winner of best director in 1946 is brilliant br br the film is about three world war ii <UNK> who come home together on a plane and all by chance live in the same town they all are reunited with their families br br the first man al <UNK> played by march in his oscar winning role has to adapt to his wife <UNK> played by myrna loy and children peggy and rob played by <UNK> wright and michael hall being different than before he left for the war br br the second man fred <UNK> played by dana andrews in an role has to find a good job and adapt to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war he begins to find out that she is not the same br br the third man has a much more harder adaptation to make homer <UNK> played by harold russell in his oscar role he has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family's and <UNK> played by cathy <UNK> reactions to the <UNK> he has instead of his hands all of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different <UNK> the stories of these men are all <UNK> beautifully together br br this film truly <UNK> the meaning of a classic this unforgettable drama winner of best picture in 1946 is a film that everyone should see br br if i was asked to pick a favorite film i would pick this one br br out of 10 i would give the best years of our lives an 11 br br so the next time you rent a movie rent this one you won't regret it
<START> a comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies the <UNK> tells the story of an out of luck coach fields who takes a <UNK> tag bunch of college <UNK> and drives them towards the football <UNK> in the process this life long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself saving his relationship with his family and friends and finding that there is indeed no i in team br br i decided to watch the <UNK> version for this film it was thirty minutes longer and i though it may be better than the theatrical release hearing that people hated this movie after all thirty minutes of extra footage can add a whole lot to a movie well i certainly was wrong it was as bad as the recent meet the <UNK> but it was thirty minutes more of torture br br seriously who makes a close to two hour spoof movie a spoof movie is short because if it goes any longer it would be <UNK> honestly i love stupid comedies heck i liked date movie white chicks epic movie and little man i guess when it comes to spoof movies it is either a hit or miss and this one definitely missed br br on the lighter side from the many jokes in this film i will say about six or seven made me laugh even some that made me laugh out loud but that's not saying much following those jokes were more scenes of torture and <UNK> br br i can't see how people would say this is not a terrible spoof film in fact there is as much product placement in here like meet the <UNK> there are as many dance sequences and unfunny jokes i will say another thing i like about this movie is the songs they are some very good songs in here overall watch it if you like spoof films skip it if you like funny films
<START> this game has cartoon graphics not much violence and really short levels then why do people say it is so brilliant because it always holds your attention it <UNK> you and refuses to let go you will try for hours to try and find that damn flight <UNK> try to work out how to get into the room without <UNK> the guards etc the levels are short only when you know what to do until that you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find where to find <UNK> and so on and you'll have fun all the while you are doing it well worth a rent
<START> sure there's stuff here that the and <UNK> leonard have done before but so what if you want entertaining <UNK> and smart <UNK> kiss is near perfect offended by tongue in cheek porn don't get it talk about getting your sex and violence out of the way straight up keeps your <UNK> happy that's independent filmmaking 101 as for the brits making a <UNK> i highly doubt it this flick is clearly a labor of love and the budget probably not half of mr <UNK> <UNK> maybe guys don't like it as much as women i thought it <UNK> go <UNK>
<START> the people at abc forgot to do their <UNK> research so many scenes were just plain wrong the actor playing was very rigid there was no personality there it is very very obvious that this movie was on the bottom of the programming <UNK> <UNK> the move is so low budget the script is terrible conversations like you must follow the rules no the people are starving lame plus the movie was jumping like crazy from event to event in order to fit it into the two hours terrible a better use of your time would be to watch a <UNK> documentary on also cbs put out a miniseries on that is better than abc by far was a wonderful man and it bothers me to think that my <UNK> might get a hold of this abc movie and think that that is what he was really like
<START> charlie george norm <UNK> and <UNK> just say julie brown are a pair of cheerful murderous aliens who become stranded on earth and stumble upon a tiny western town they become deputy <UNK> and dish out a deadly form of justice to <UNK> murderers and others while getting on the bad side of some of locals led by wayne grace meanwhile their sexy alien daughter <UNK> arrives in a skimpy shiny outfit with her black human husband christopher m brown to find them and tv <UNK> and government agents turn up to fill up time br br from what i can tell this is a deliberate attempt to cover every possible genre comedy sci fi horror western in one movie and what a stupid unfunny mess it is despite energetic acting from the two stars the script is downright atrocious
<START> this showed up on a dvd a buddy of mine bought for me they had it listed as the savage guns which was an entirely different movie obviously the folks who <UNK> the dvd never bothered to look at what they were burning on the <UNK> br br anyway this movie is about as bad as they come the sound track is a combination tv batman early james bond spaghetti western lots of <UNK> around to this music it appears that the guy has to <UNK> between scenes to burn up some time and give the sound track folks something to do br br english is dubbed over the italian and it really shows i wish it had been just a little bit worse and then it would have had some of the campy feel of the ed wood films as it is it is just plain awful
<START> being a long time steve martin fan it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliched script the screenwriter must have just rented some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there it certainly is about the least imaginative movie i've seen in a long time i knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it began the african american stereotypes and slave references are pretty offensive as well but the thing that was the worst for me was to see martin in a movie without a trace of wit he probably is one of the most intelligent actors and here he totally sold out to a totally <UNK> down script he must be behind in his <UNK> to be in such a lame effort
<START> i like the most of the full moon pictures so i ordered this movie from the usa because in germany you can't get it anywhere i thought it would be so nice and amusing like the <UNK> or <UNK> series because they were full of atmosphere br br i was glad when the movie finally arrived br br but after watching this cheesy movie i was very disappointed the actors i think you can't even say actors are boring and <UNK> the story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and lousy br br i hope no one ever make a sequel or remake of this terrible movie
<START> hands of the <UNK> br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format <UNK> br br an <UNK> doctor eric porter uses <UNK> analysis on a young girl <UNK> <UNK> who turns out to be the daughter of jack the <UNK> and just as deadly br br unlikely hammer horror in which a respectable society figure takes charge of a beautiful young <UNK> without <UNK> so much as a <UNK> of scandal even when she takes to murdering all and <UNK> with a variety of lethal <UNK> broken mirrors hat <UNK> etc l w <UNK> screenplay wanders <UNK> from one murder to another <UNK> the <UNK> inherent subtext <UNK> obvious attraction to <UNK> in favor of commercial melodrama and the tone remains subdued throughout some of the gore scenes are surprisingly vivid even for hammer and these were <UNK> from the original us release despite an r rating from the mpaa though the complete version is now available on home video porter and <UNK> give excellent performances and the climax in st paul's <UNK> is a definite highlight but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and <UNK> directed by peter
<START> laughable would be a good term to describe this movie but since this movie deserves nothing good said of it i'll use the term god awful instead br br <UNK> around the adventures of a bunch of <UNK> warriors investigating the <UNK> <UNK> of the military on a semi <UNK> island the lack of a budget rapidly becomes apparent michael <UNK> a real actor but only in the sense that <UNK> was a real boy leads the bunch of fools through a series of monster chase and <UNK> hapless victim scenes there is some vague attempt at pseudo science to explain the presence of the giant <UNK> but it convinces the viewer about as well as the acting does br br as if this doesn't insult the viewer enough the movie also features what i'll call guns of never ending <UNK> i never saw mickey parrot or his female side kick change clips once during the entire film yet i can positively report they cap off at least 40 rounds each in any scene where they are required to fire their weapon forty rounds may not seem like that many but we are talking standard <UNK> here i figure 15 round clip tops and remember they never change clips nor even appear to carry any extra <UNK> br br it's dumb <UNK> like this which movies to the eternal fires of celluloid hell and rightly so the third rate cgi does little to help matters and the acting is best laughed at else you'll start crying why scifi channel repeatedly <UNK> out this <UNK> is anyone's guess br br my advice give this one a wide <UNK> a very wide <UNK>
<START> in my analysis of <UNK> <UNK> i wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of <UNK> <UNK> i think it's the same with this film this time it's not because of a tragic comedy element but much more because of the main character valentine although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous she manages her life with <UNK> and optimism it seems to me that she might be <UNK> image for a <UNK> youth the opposite seems to be the judge who is very <UNK> a grumpy old man who experiences big loneliness in my view valentine and the judge are pretty similar to each other the judge is just much older and has experienced many more <UNK> they share a different kind of <UNK> and they both discover that they can learn much from the other one finally i would like to stress <UNK> <UNK> performance she rounds off the run of amazing female <UNK> to the three colours trilogy
<START> not much to say other than plenty of wire fu and supposed monks ego <UNK> about kung fu and caricature japanese plotting to take over china all of this would not be so bad if not for the utterly fake japanese sword fighting if you watched a samurai movie or two you can tell that the japanese fighting in the movie is simply the same kung fu really circus stunt men doing the same things except with a japanese sword however there are a couple of fun moments such as when a japanese woman ninja tears off her clothes in mid flight to <UNK> a monk and captures him with a fishing net <UNK> there seems to be a bit of <UNK> as far as whether the japanese should be shown as completely despicable or if there could be exceptions the japanese protagonist is shown as largely <UNK> but not beyond <UNK> cruelty such as when he murders a <UNK> monk so that he may have his duel quite disappointing with a very silly ending does not for a moment evoke even the semblance of the idea of an epic battle
<START> this program was shown in an early morning time <UNK> on space a cable sci fi station i am amazed that anyone would pay for this or broadcast it it is incredibly amateurish br br the entire show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a closet with a bunch of circuit boards taped to the wall there is very little continuity between scenes and no plot a typical scene revolves around some lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long the dialog makes little sense and the special effects look like <UNK> <UNK> the actors are all adults but i have literally seen high school plays with better writing and sets this program is an embarrassment br br perhaps each scene would work as an a filler between shows instead of commercials <UNK> all the scenes together makes the limitations of the material extremely obvious
<START> i loved it it was really gruesome and disgusting i thought that the <UNK> of the human flesh was thoroughly the way that it was depicting the human <UNK> about jesus christ was really interesting the <UNK> about limbs and jaws was awesome brutally gruesome don't watch this if you have a weak heart you wouldn't be able to stand it
<START> the acting made you feel like you were watching a <UNK> play the story is full of holes and gaps and <UNK> around so you have no idea as to what just happened half the scenes are pointless there is not an <UNK> of character development the score soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about 70 of the scenes i'm glad i only rented the movie yet i still feel cheated avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances it seems like the bulk of the budget was spent on putting a few name brand actors in this less than bad film this movie is equivalent to visiting a strip club it tries to get you excited and interested but just as you think something is going to happen your thrown into some unrelated scene and left trying to figure out how you arrived there
<START> this version did not move me as deeply as the later hollywood version starring anthony hopkins and debra <UNK> while it was beautifully filmed and superbly acted the bbc version was more packed with dialog that <UNK> information which i found fascinating it gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual <UNK> and moral <UNK> that motivated c s lewis it was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the hollywood version but not nearly as visually stunning or <UNK> affecting still while i did not leave a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in the theater i did use one and at frequent <UNK> i enjoyed this film every bit as much as the hollywood version and was grateful for the <UNK> understanding i gained
<START> over the years some of them most enjoyable films have been about dysfunctional families br br <UNK> <UNK> is such a film br br this is an <UNK> film about a <UNK> jewish family br br this could be about any family in any culture we all know or would want to know people like those in this comic gem br br this 2003 delight was written directed by let us hope he a long career br br the movie is seen through the eyes of the 16 year old son who seems to be concerned with everyone in the family brilliantly played by cohen he was 18 when he made the movie br br he has been in a few since i know i will hunt them up hopefully this young man will become an international star br br the entire cast is magnificent i do hope i see them again br br i loved every person in the cast to some degree i think all who see this will agree br br it has been nominated for many international awards has won 8 it deserved every one br br now being a film in a language besides english it had a very limited run in the usa which i feel is <UNK> br br rent this film you will be glad you did br br ratings 1 2 out of 4 95 points out of 100 imdb 9 out of 10 br br note since the story is not new this is as high a rating it can get
