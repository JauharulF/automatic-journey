<START> i went to see this on the strength of albert finney alone he's one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver i'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly it's about a little boy who is about to be born but as his mother goes into labor he refuses to come out this sends god and the whole human being factory into a crisis and albert finney is called out of <UNK> to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born so finney takes the unborn boy for an adventure in the big apple in hopes of showing him all the reasons he should want to live br br despite the <UNK> of the plot i could have accepted it if the director had not tried to turn this into your typical hollywood sentimental <UNK> message film the film was rendered unbearable by a horrible soundtrack of the stock sentimental music that hollywood directors seem incapable of <UNK> br br he further butchered the somewhat unconventional story by giving away its hand at every moment whatever twists and turns were in store in the plot were completely given away by the way the story <UNK> it was as if the director assumed the audience is just a bunch of idiots who cannot see the obvious hints coming from a mile away br br even finney in his performance though satisfactory seemed a bit awkward and out of place and the little boy with curly locks though he was supposed to be cute was in fact rather dull bridget fonda seemed intent on trying to <UNK> <UNK> moore's performance in <UNK> <UNK> tears at a <UNK> notice br br i understand that the film has been <UNK> thus far at getting distribution in the u s which surprises me as i think it has the box office potential to be a modest hit appealing to both kids and sentimental adults as far as the quality goes it's not an awful film it's just not very good 4 out of 10
<START> greedy land baron in the tiny western town of <UNK> city wants all the <UNK> off their land using <UNK> tactics and <UNK> to get them to <UNK> seems the town is swimming <UNK> oil and when a swedish farmer refuses to leave he's <UNK> down by the <UNK> hired gun the <UNK> <UNK> son soon arrives slowly realizing what he's up against and attempting to <UNK> the rest of the residents to fight another <UNK> in the west story with everybody under the thumb of the villain who naturally holds all the cards derivative and uncomfortable at times to watch with a long wait before our stoic hero finally gets his up sterling half hearted swedish accent is a big problem though he cuts a <UNK> sympathetic presence on the screen and almost makes the picture worth watching director joseph h lewis stages most of the scenes <UNK> like a tv western and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> heavy score is no help though the rich black and white cinematography by ray is excellent an independent production released via united artists the film has a bizarre start beginning with shots from the finale followed by shots from the movie's <UNK> yet it does have a certain power which most <UNK> gets the viewer on side from
<START> no it's not citizen kane but would you expect it to be with a name like <UNK> it's the best damn summer camp movie of all the summer camp movies does anyone quote little <UNK> line by line or <UNK> summer br br this is just one of those movies that got into my brain when i was in junior high and stayed with me all these years every time i feel geeky i <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or when we're <UNK> in the brush in the forest i tell my husband i'm da <UNK> he doesn't get it it just doesn't matter it just doesn't matter i mean this stuff is classic br br disappointed with the dvd though wish there were special features maybe a commentary or a making of but the movie itself is a perfect <UNK> of life as an adolescent in the late '70s maybe not my life you can't help but want to run around out in the woods in <UNK> shorts and <UNK> high <UNK> and <UNK> hair every time you see this movie
<START> <UNK> is sexy and good but the stranger is less convincing <UNK> is sort of sexy but he is not a consistent actor this could be the director's fault in this case we are supposed to find him <UNK> in the extreme just because he is pretty but that's not enough the <UNK> wife is almost convincing 7 years marriage and she and character should be more settled with each other whether their roles are to be <UNK> or not they must have <UNK> by now i get that although i think the wife is a bit stiff in her role and not convincingly attracted to the stranger so that's a failing the <UNK> bonding between the <UNK> character and the stranger is better done even if we are not sure what it is i miss sexy english accent luckily he slips into it and out of the american pattern disappointing but with some great acting
<START> with the exception of the fine rack on clara evans this show was pretty bad so why did i watch it too much coffee and had to relax before hitting the sack watching <UNK> change into his <UNK> big chief outfit was amusing at best downright laughable at worst br br i could have made a better and special effects on my <UNK> br br <UNK> has seen better days this guy is a year younger than me and he's looking more and more like the scarecrow from his tv series days back in the early 1980 the women eye candy need to go back to acting school although evans size 40 and playing a 17 year old she's in her early <UNK> was a stretch the sci fi channel has done better that this but for us folks that don't get out to the bars much anymore i guess we have to take what we can get after all anything that gets you away form <UNK> and fox coverage of election 2008 these day is a good thing
<START> <UNK> of <UNK> had a lot of things that could've made this quite a good horror film creepy mansion a torture chamber a paranoid host a henchman a <UNK> in the <UNK> etc but sadly to say this wasn't made very well br br a writer and a <UNK> get <UNK> on an island owned by a count in a castle his slave and a mute maid the count becomes more and more suspicious that the two <UNK> men are pirates of all things and gets more inclined to turn on them and subject them and the mute maid who befriends them to torture and <UNK> sound not bad right br br well not quite i used to call this one of the worst movies i have ever seen but now i hesitate because it had so much potential it can't really be called one of the worst however seeing all this potential go to waste is a really big hit against this film all in all it's not a very good movie br br there is a very gothic suspense scene when our hero is <UNK> in the <UNK> and is confronted by the insane and <UNK> rotting bride <UNK> in a <UNK> wedding dress this was both creepy and disturbing the first time i saw the horror unfold in this scene man i wish this was a better movie br br this movie had all the right stuff to make this a moody late night <UNK> but ultimately took all the wrong turns i suggest someone remake this one
<START> this movie is very well done although the ending is given away too early in the film the four elderly men in the restaurant are what makes this film fun to watch <UNK> driver is a very talented actress and comes across wonderfully on screen
<START> i put this second version of the man who knew too much to my top 10 hitchcock movies together with frenzy it's probably the most <UNK> film among the fans of hitchcock i consider it far better than say rebecca which has gained <UNK> much appreciation br br the film contains many ingenious scenes most of them have been mentioned in other reviews but that's something to be expected from hitchcock it takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen but that time is used for preparing the following happenings which are full of intriguing suspense br br if you can ignore the clumsy rear <UNK> the only weakness of this film is the main villain played by bernard miles who is a rather flat and undeveloped character luckily there is a creepy assassin in the form of <UNK> and hank the little boy isn't as irritating as most kids in old movies
<START> first of all let me start by saying that i have been a devoted <UNK> of c thomas career ever since the <UNK> and the <UNK> he was an up and coming star in the 1980s with hits such as soul man also the future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to go on from there and really <UNK> himself in hollywood put it this way tom cruise had a bit part in the <UNK> while <UNK> had the lead look at cruise today but picking material like this drivel will only <UNK> career even more if that was possible why does he pick stuff like this a small part in a major movie would be of more benefit to him than this rubbish br br essentially the story here takes place in a post apocalyptic world where everybody lives underground where chaos <UNK> <UNK> is a shepherd protecting the flock of various religious leaders by killing off any <UNK> he's a hit man in other words br br the sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode the use of slow motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn <UNK> box and a directorial style that <UNK> on stupidity oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too br br i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie br br in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for <UNK> come on c give yourself some credit and <UNK> yourself away from these non hit wonders and try to <UNK> down and get a good part however small br br 1 10 and only because there is no setting for 0 10
<START> this twisted comedy is well acted and directed very funny and the production quality is outstanding it is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards br br everyone can identify with <UNK> having a bad day bad week bad life travis davis plays the role superbly richard <UNK> as tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right the old man adds to the humor of the story and who wouldn't love the <UNK> <UNK> br br this short will bring lots of laughs and don't miss the credits as they are playing at the end
<START> this movie is a real thriller it was exciting from shortly after the start till the very end if you are a real suspense nut this is the movie for you the characters were very well developed and the scenery was beautiful the story was very well written similar to some others i have seen but quite different in several ways a must see
<START> gypsy is possibly the greatest musical ever written so it's too bad that it's film version was such a disappointment to make up for that we have this re make which if not flawless is an enjoyable and well done adaption of the musical the script is completely accurate all the songs included and the staging remains close to the original <UNK> <UNK> staging bette midler is a <UNK> choice for rose her singing and personality <UNK> esquire and her acting splendid peter <UNK> is a fine if not a great singer and <UNK> is a straight forward natural louise in truth a live <UNK> of the 1989 revival with <UNK> <UNK> might have been a better idea if only because gypsy is simply more exciting on stage but this film is a fine translation of a great musical
<START> engaging entry from europe about czech fighter pilots flying for the <UNK> during ww2 it's always interesting as an american to see a new point of view on familiar events in history there's nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which this is filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative still it is compelling all the way through there is a good balance between drama romance humor action and symbolism that is understated beautifully by the director and cast this is a breath of fresh air after sitting through overblown and boring hollywood epics like pearl harbor a solid production all around this is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema
<START> well the <UNK> of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid if you like the type of film where shots <UNK> for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you a large part of it is like this with short <UNK> into the realm of <UNK> i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have simply a little <UNK> and pointless the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable <UNK> the film is fairly well shot the plot however has little to recommend a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano which might appeal to some people but <UNK> you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some <UNK> of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth not recommended
<START> this sequel is quite awful to be honest i'm a fan of kung fu movies and this is by far the worst i've seen bride with white hair 1 was actually quite good and this is a huge disappointment 1 was brilliant in some ways with an unique odd ball evil bad guy br br the couple from the first movie played a small role in this movie instead the movie revolves around a bunch of uninteresting characters trying to seek revenge on their fallen <UNK> but there's no antagonist in this movie so the revenge is mute br br the worst part to this movie is the kung fu or lack there of they literally had a street style knife fight the character at the end refused to fight because there was lack of choreography
<START> maybe we <UNK> just have a totally different sense of humour and <UNK> my lie the only problem here i have a <UNK> of all the dvds i own including those received as gifts which this was and so when entering a new one i always refer to imdb for such info as genre runtime director leads etc when entering this i noted that it was a comedy and so i decided to watch it at a time when i wanted something light and a good laugh well it was neither there were absolutely no laughs at all and an <UNK> amount of gratuitous profanity are there really radio <UNK> allowed to broadcast the sort of filth that steve jones <UNK> out what if a decent child happened to tune to his station br br rather than enjoy a good laugh or even a little giggle i found the whole thing thoroughly depressing i have given it 3 out of 10 but to be honest i don't know what those 3 are for i suppose the <UNK> of lighting and sound weren't too bad br br we have an ostensibly stone broke loser <UNK> <UNK> who still seems to be able to drive a reasonable car who pays for the fuel and live in what could be a nice apartment who pays his rent given the opportunity of <UNK> what might have been some sort of meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a nice girl he even blew that perhaps it was she <UNK> collins who earned this movie the 3 points the fact that she works as a stripper rather than a <UNK> is one of the few aspects of this movie that makes sense i make as much in one night doing this as i do in two <UNK> <UNK> br br unless you want to get depressed and bored to the teeth forget it
<START> i just watched this movie at the <UNK> <UNK> international film festival while watching the movie i had the feeling that i have seen a movie with a similar story before a movie with ray liotta but i can't remember much of it of course this one is a lot more dramatic especially at the end br br this is the story life becomes a lie that he can not longer sustain after 20 years lying about his entire life to his wife son and all the people he knows the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to go br br watching <UNK> make up lies is <UNK> and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thing the affair with a young girl was supposed to ad something but it doesn't despite that the movie is still funny <UNK> and involving either it makes you want to help <UNK> with his lies or help everybody else catch him i liked the <UNK> photography and the good performances br br 7 5 out of 10
<START> but then again what ever is i picked this up at my local store for you guessed it 99 cents plus tax i remember seeing this on video as a teen and thinking it was a cool flick too bad the film and my memories don't match regardless its not a too horrible way to blow a couple hours and it is neat to see some vintage bill paxton and mark <UNK> blah blah blah man oh man i cannot think of anything else to say about this flick just filling space to meet the ten line rule good <UNK> this is pathetic just how bad is this movie that the best i could come up with in regards to it were five of text so anyway ten lines of text eh hmmm ten lines are hard to come by when you can't remember <UNK> about a film you just watched
<START> i bought this film on dvd despite the stale review and that was idiotic that review was completely accurate and i have never seen any worse erotic film in my long life even if it partly was lovely filmed and had interesting surroundings plus a nice cover but my own extreme <UNK> c films are over 100 times more erotic just in the soft delicious aspect with probably less than 100 times of this films budget the story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book or any new exciting element of slave training except some very strange and sad developments then did the main male character <UNK> kinski not look a bit like the second master of o he try to play and not even lovely <UNK> <UNK> did look delicious in any scene
<START> this movie wasted 2 hours of my time and just make me wanna scream lame nicholas write the movie yes man but direct this maybe he should stick with writing br br i am so disappointed because i heard all the great review i was expecting something like knocked up they say this is from the maker of knocked up why can't i see the resemblance but this just felt like a shallow overdone theme kind of movie for me i am so disappointed actually it's not bad if you consider it as your average chick movie but that character of the band guy just get on my nerves br br maybe i was just not paying enough attention to the movie but yeah they have some funny lines and scene but i don't felt the originality and the ending make the movie a little bit better at least the ending is not some boring cliché one
<START> this is one of the best movies i have ever seen br br it's so full of details and every time you see it you'll find new things like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice and when the girls <UNK> they can't do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls and there aren't br br i have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their uncle visit them but why does his wife freak out else a fantastic movie the best asian movie ever br br i hope people will enjoy it there have been so many movie where the main character is skit so the <UNK> secret window and so on but this movie is way better than them
<START> the piano teacher is all about <UNK> character a middle aged classical piano <UNK> with a stoic <UNK> behind which <UNK> a <UNK> compelling <UNK> personality unsatisfying as a story but intriguing as a character study the film follows the <UNK> character through the term of her <UNK> relationship with a <UNK> delivering superb performances in the process not for everyone the piano teacher will play best with those into foreign films and character driven dramas dealing with dark issues a
<START> i seriously <UNK> know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released sure it´s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies i seriously <UNK> think that the people who hated gate really understood it gate in its uncut form much like the deer hunter shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life like the immigrants and in <UNK> and living in comfort and <UNK> like the settled americans in <UNK> and in the prologue and <UNK> living a hard life is painful but it can also be <UNK> as opposed to the dull life leads in the <UNK> also as michael <UNK> took great pains to make the picture historically accurate it is fascinating as a document of and maybe <UNK> of american life in old west <UNK> the dialogue is often genuinely clever and emotional combined with great music and cinematography the movie works like a truly poetic work of art granted gate with its <UNK> to <UNK> the viewer is not for all tastes however hollywood turns out so much commercial dreck each year which is so much easier to dismiss as mindless eye candy even when an example of it becomes a blockbuster that gate and <UNK> really do deserve more respect all people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make up their own mind br br
<START> sit back and let director lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of india when was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie this movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in india if you didn't want to visit india before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now this movie has dancing girls a chase scene and the <UNK> involved but it has a lot more thanks for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale i loved the ending we women don't want <UNK> in life we want reality p s i was friend at the film festival and met you briefly good luck with your distribution efforts and i'm talking up the movie a storm
<START> after watching <UNK> the rules of engagement i was just sitting in disbelief of what i was witness to a big cover up by the fbi a massacre by <UNK> ho trigger happy government agents i clearly remember the <UNK> <UNK> i was 17 years old at the time and watched it all on <UNK> i remembered <UNK> about all the children as i watched the <UNK> <UNK> compound burn in april 1993 i remember feeling sorry for the children but clearly felt that it was the fault of their evil leader david and the other <UNK> film shows clearly and beyond doubt even though it is biased that the fbi <UNK> over and over again i think that this film was a big <UNK> to the <UNK> of a new investigation of the incident in 1999 the outcome of this new investigation was in some sense predictable the judgement relied on fact that was just as grey as the facts that the <UNK> presented i was very disappointed about the verdict because as far as i know it didn't take into account all the lying <UNK> and evidence cover up by the fbi and other officials why have no one be <UNK> for <UNK> the work of the texas rangers <UNK> why were they allowed to <UNK> the crime scene and the compound shortly after the incident these are questions that i haven't been given answers to by the government most importantly what about the children in this new investigation i haven't been informed about who was responsible for <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> tear gas into a compound with many <UNK> for <UNK> this gas and i haven't found any answer to whether the children's <UNK> <UNK> due to the effects of the gas while they were alive if they did i would surely think that the janet reno or who ever was in charge of the raid should be <UNK> for mass homicide or <UNK> the question that was raised by but not mentioned is was is a direct plan for the people in charge and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building down with intent a plan that would have been accomplished with <UNK> or were the officials in charge so incompetent that their were unaware of the consequence of their actions both are equally frightening even if the <UNK> set fire to the compound the officials in charge surely provided them with the opportunity to do the job if the officials in charge knew as they claimed that the <UNK> would set fire to the compound why the did the tanks cut all the holes in the building making it into a <UNK> and why didn't they have plans to deal with the fire that they knew would occur dark questions that still won't go away the final and most relevant issue of this film is the way that the <UNK> are <UNK> by the government through the media who just <UNK> it in to the public i clearly remember the <UNK> i felt for the evil <UNK> that i saw on <UNK> in 1993 now that i'm older i can see a clear line of communication coming out of the government every time they are <UNK> up for a massacre of civilians along with the intended targets <UNK> people with words like they have different <UNK> values then us they don't enjoy freedom and they are a threat to our <UNK> and way of life makes them so much easier to
<START> the <UNK> series is a shining example of what b movies should be they fail in every aspect but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad <UNK> 2 aka the blade master aka cave <UNK> shows us <UNK> favorite conan clone <UNK> where we left him in the first movie after showing us a lengthy <UNK> of all the events of the first film this time the world must be saved from the a kind of bomb represented on screen as a bright light i guess they couldn't afford a prop this one features invisible <UNK> and samurai as with the first film lots of stock footage is used including one rather obvious bit from star wars thoroughly laughable and <UNK> bad this is an exception b movie
<START> i didn't really hate <UNK> i just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals the movie begins with a young girl named who works in a circus but while other children supposedly want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away from the circus during a <UNK> argument with her mother wishes she would drop dead bad move the mother gets ill with something presumably cancer and needs surgery on the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she finds herself personally the movie got crap for me as soon as she started dreaming the early scenes show the weird and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the <UNK> of the hospital and the filth of an apartment block but a soon as she dreams the whole films shifts to cgi land where nearly everything is a computer image the problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have while films like the wizard of oz seemed <UNK> to explore <UNK> <UNK> images in our faces and then <UNK> them away to give us another image there's little rhyme or reason to the design in this film and even though some things are very pretty the <UNK> is a masterpiece they just disappear so quickly that they're soon forgotten and her sidekick valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst overall <UNK> is like a pretty stake that you bite and find out is actually ash stick to the real world kids
<START> i saw this movie when i was a lot younger but it captured me i loved <UNK> and <UNK> relationship so much i was so <UNK> in <UNK> and love story i am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me i especially liked it when he first met her i just wish he had more time with her and their baby so you know in book three i was so hurt that he died i didn't really understand that because they had little time together i just loved patrick in this movie i just bought all three books together and i can't stop watching them my 12 year old son is stuck on it he likes the fighting in the war i cry every time i wish i could meet patrick and <UNK> in person it was a wonderful movie and cast
<START> in 2004 i wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie br br to me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule i think in many ways the best years of our lives is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the mid 1940s after wwii i believe coming home and the deer hunter both released in 1978 were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in the best years of our lives br br what really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when i was in college around 1980 <UNK> and many if not all of the college students <UNK> at the end of the movie br br this movie still packs a <UNK> and i'm very happy to read in other <UNK> other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time br br i'm very happy to see the movie <UNK> near the top 100 movies on imdb and <UNK> also though it was in competition with what eventually became a christmas classic it's a wonderful life arguably the best years of our <UNK> oscar wins including best picture were very well deserved br br i've just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years the best years of our lives is still a powerful beautifully acted and well crafted motion picture
<START> this movie was awesome if you want a movie with non stop <UNK> and laughter then this is right for you this movie was great because it took the serious robin hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at i first viewed this movie when i was around 10 and got most of it this movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved by order of the kings financial secretary h and r <UNK> br br everyone needs a little cary <UNK> robin hood in life whether or not its liar liar with the claw or saw br br this movie is worth watching
<START> the only good thing about this film is they managed to tie it with part one but other than that it was one of the worst films ever the only time you see the <UNK> is in a flashback and the flashback is just clips from part one a must not see on a one to ten <UNK> 4 gets a one
<START> the final installment sees sho and <UNK> looking <UNK> than ever in his <UNK> pitched against each other for one last battle this time in the future the plot owes a lot to blade runner but done in takashi miike's low budget frenetic comic style i did feel that it was the weakest of the three <UNK> films and although the ending was still outrageous it lacked the shock value of the previous two compared to the likes of <UNK> the killer and visitor q <UNK> final is nowhere near as extreme but is faithful to the other two films in the trilogy that said fans of the first two and fans of miike will get a lot from this as it ties all three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two protagonists
<START> police officer <UNK> jamie <UNK> files an <UNK> <UNK> alex br br a member of the south african <UNK> who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political <UNK> br br south african born attorney sarah <UNK> <UNK> meanwhile returns to her <UNK> to represent br br as well as steve friend who was arrested along with him and never heard from again br br this film is one of the best films to come out about the south african regime of <UNK> in the past br br everybody should watch it
<START> i am not kidding there's a scene in this movie where a <UNK> hits his head on a tunnel <UNK> and explodes with no <UNK> though into a million pieces it made some kid in front of me scream in terror in a g rated film br br this film might serve to convince children that santa <UNK> is evil his <UNK> are ugly <UNK> over the top and mean when santa here an <UNK> of satan appears all 200 000 <UNK> begin singing santa <UNK> is coming to town as though it were a <UNK> war <UNK> then in the reflection of this movie's <UNK> object a <UNK> bell that <UNK> hints of why you can't hear it <UNK> doubt doubt old saint nick appears looking like a stoic donald sutherland his face glowing like <UNK> from when we hear him speak his <UNK> voice sounds less like a jolly old <UNK> and more like james earl jones' voice <UNK> down about 20 frightening br br the <UNK> music is out of place boring and repetitive it doesn't follow any emotional threads as in <UNK> very effective score it just seems thrown in at certain points in order to generate feelings of warmth and magic it fails to stir partly because it doesn't match the imagery of the film there are some musical train <UNK> no pun intended where out of nowhere the eerie <UNK> score <UNK> abruptly into happy child voiced <UNK> about the title <UNK> it just makes the whole movie sound like it was rushed into production br br finally i agree with some other reviewers about how well dead everyone looks it does seem a little macabre at times the motion capture technique is good for allowing the kings island like roller coaster train sequences to look convincing from a distance but up close real actors should have been used overall nice eye candy for killing time in front of the tv but not much else here
<START> the name lucio fulci up images of graphic death and <UNK> in the minds of may fans thanks to movies like zombi 2 city of the living dead the beyond and the new york <UNK> fulci has a reputation for being one of the <UNK> directors in history and although many of his later movies certainly justify his reputation until the release of zombi 2 in 1979 <UNK> films did not contain anywhere near the amount of blood and guts he's know for in fact they were for the most part gore free instead relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing imagery to work don't torture a <UNK> hardly contains any gore yet ranks as his best br br don't torture a <UNK> is set in a small <UNK> town where <UNK> rules instead of logic the <UNK> are very <UNK> of <UNK> as well as anyone different often <UNK> them after a series of child murders though many people <UNK> upon the town including <UNK> thomas <UNK> who tries to <UNK> the truth about the murders while they continue to happen br br this is a remarkable film it's very well made with an excellent cast filled with many favorites of italian exploitation cinema it also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or lucio fulci but the real draw of don't torture a <UNK> is the disturbing nature of the movie little kids around twelve years old are shown mocking retarded people visiting prostitutes and being <UNK> sex by an older woman it also contains some very biting commentary on the middle class and the catholic church it is for reasons like this that don't torture a <UNK> was <UNK> throughout europe when it was first released and never was shown in the united states still don't torture a <UNK> stands as a monumental achievement in giallo cinema as well as lucio <UNK> best work i really can't recommend this one enough check it out
<START> every time i hear karen carpenter's voice there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues what an <UNK> beautiful and mature voice she had <UNK> cast in the title role does a good job however i thought karen allen would have been a better choice this is a <UNK> movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of karen and richard but also the personal struggles that karen dealt with and her disease the recording sessions in <UNK> studio are very nicely done however karen carpenter turned out there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers even if you weren't a carpenter's fan this is a nice story that depicts how a great talent can fall victim to the <UNK> of society
<START> have just seen this film in australia on satellite as i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the us of a regarding <UNK> well to be absolutely blunt this film is a <UNK> gem a big bravo to all involved i had only a small idea of what the film <UNK> as is most often the case for good effect and this certainly came up with cinematic goods the setting of the scene is effective in the <UNK> sense of the word with all the hairy confronting subjects of today's world in relation to one's own <UNK> family albeit <UNK> the first forty minutes sets such a professional theater i was not ready for the out loud laughs when they came although the <UNK> moment built via comedy and character as the family and neighbors came together in an extraordinary way br br all in all a <UNK> of who and what we are a most meaningful film and a must see br br please note the date of this review
<START> this is one of those movies that showcases a great actor's talent and also conveys a great story it is one of stewart's greatest movies <UNK> a few historic errors it also does an excellent job of telling the story of the spirit of st louis
<START> having grown up in the <UNK> pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a <UNK> of <UNK> into a delightful meal day to day this movie hits the mark good afternoon fare i understand that louis jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential gorgeous <UNK> parker everyone wanted to be in and i believe it has done well and held up over time best on screen kiss between hope lange and the late stephen <UNK> br br it may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual <UNK> i thought the movie was well cast except the awful acting of evans what a grease ball but he found his <UNK> <UNK> else other than that all stepped up to the plate
<START> this movie was great it had everything a true action fan could want plenty of people getting shot and or <UNK> minimal romance involving sex a hero that can be identified with violence at many <UNK> instead of pointless plot <UNK> up just one scene at the end and villains that are just asking for it bronson appears to be at his lowest level of in this film and it shows ed <UNK> makes a great cop and was <UNK> worked into <UNK> plot without stealing his spotlight the movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over <UNK> that you watch this film once and never again rather you want to see in action and the storyline just <UNK> it up this is great stuff
<START> i saw this short film on the dvd for <UNK> scott's film the there was no introduction by scott before the film it just started right up br br boy and a <UNK> is hardly an example of <UNK> scott's other work it bears no resemblance the film shows a boy played by tony scott riding around on a <UNK> guess what that's pretty all that happens the boy rides around rambling on and on with pointless confusing dialogue the film was shot in black and white and since it was directed by <UNK> scott i expected some cool cinematography or visually striking sets instead i was treated with nothing this film isn't even good for a first effort however i recommend that any fan of <UNK> scott should check it out at least once
<START> i was actually planning to see this movie when i noticed it in my tv guide but after about 5 minutes decided time is definitely more precious than who's that girl could ever be worth describing how bad <UNK> acting looks like is impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured on film this crap is an insult to movies and intellect i almost never rate a movie i don't see from start to finish but in this case the former is impossible 2 10
<START> i will always think of mr <UNK> as <UNK> gray if i live to be 100 br br perfectly acted and directed bringing oscar <UNK> insight wit and humor alive with an absolute and utter perfection unusual in television br br more proof that the bbc more than makes up in talent what it doesn't always have in money br br a must have for all <UNK> fans and indeed for everyone else inspired and <UNK> every one of the actors looked exactly right for the role and every shot was well done br br by the end i found that i loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired watch it then try to watch another version it's just not the same is it
<START> when a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of <UNK> <UNK> on animals crashes in a small texas town people start to die the county sheriff tries to investigate but is <UNK> in his efforts by other government officials it turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla on the loose killing teenagers in the woods br br i like low budget science fiction and horror movies i like monster movies so i thought that there would be a good chance that i would like this movie sadly i didn't br br i don't mind the bad acting the corny dialog the atrocious musical score or the giant plot holes that this movie has there are a lot of movies that have the same problems that i have seen and enjoyed in a so bad it's good kind of way br br but where others of that type and night fright <UNK> is that night fright just has terrible pacing and it drags on because of that there are scenes that just go on and on without anything happening the searching the woods for clues is just people walking in the forest for a long time there are several seemingly endless dancing teens at a party in the woods but nothing interesting is going on if these scenes were shorter the movie might not have been as boring though i don't think simply cutting those scenes would save this one br br i have now given this movie three viewings to make sure that i gave it a chance before <UNK> it in this review sadly it has gotten worse with each watch there won't be a fourth
<START> up at the villa fooled me into thinking i d be watching something similar to <UNK> park the film opens at a ballroom in 1930s italy which is populated by vulgar americans and uptight upper class brits but in truth up at the villa plays out far more like a <UNK> <UNK> production which is very bad news because it s a very slow and i do mean very slow romantic drama with some of the romance being very unlikely if you like slow romantic dramas you might like this movie i <UNK> t
<START> this movie was a complete waste of time the soundtrack was bad story was lame and predictable and the acting was terrible one of the worst 25 movies i have ever seen after the first ten minutes the rest of the film was completely obvious
<START> i watched this because a friend told me it was damn good and i watched a video on it so i was really into watching it i watched it and damn the fighting scenes are really good if the guys can't fight like that in real life they sure fooled me there isn't as much fighting as i would like i have to say but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular they don't show much but you can tell it's violent and cool but there's also the plot that goes around a love triangle between the main characters though it's a bit twisted <UNK> sung is a <UNK> guy who seems to love getting into trouble as well as fights he's the leader of his school and is the rival of won who's the leader of his own school a bit of a playboy hot headed and a rich boy then there's han a girl with not a lot going for her her father just passed away and she moved back with her mother the guy she liked is dating her old friend and then she meets won who goes to her school and <UNK> sung who calls her older sister eventually she discovers <UNK> sung is her brother fruit of one of her father's affair and he loves her despite of their blood relation meanwhile won falls for her and takes her as his boyfriend but she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother who <UNK> her love to her overall it's a wonderful movie but if i was really depressed after the end and i just couldn't help but think damn are all korean movie i watch about fighting death depressing stuff incest 'cause that sure was the case with old boy and temptation of wolves it's a very good movie but people have to be ready to cry at the end
<START> this movie is a must see for any war movie buff one of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as br br if i say its safe to surf this beach captain then its safe to surf this beach br br smell that you smell that lance what <UNK> son nothing in the world <UNK> like that i love the smell of <UNK> in the morning you know one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours when it was all over i walked up we didn't find one of 'em not one <UNK> <UNK> body the smell you know that <UNK> smell the whole hill <UNK> like victory someday this <UNK> gonna end
<START> this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching <UNK> in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was <UNK> give it a 3
<START> an off beat but very delightful performance by john travolta sets off this very funny comedy his interpretation of the <UNK> is as a <UNK> overweight ladies man and he certainly has a mesmerizing effect on the women he encounters on his trip to chicago john hurt is very low <UNK> in his role as chief reporter for chicago <UNK> owner bob <UNK> angie <UNK> plays role much as she did her role in four <UNK> and a funeral maureen <UNK> is neat in a cameo her comment michael doesn't suffer fools is just one of many memorable moments bob <UNK> is the only one of the lead performers who fails to connect a little to off the wall mainly you're there to see michael take on a bull <UNK> the <UNK> and lady dancers at a western style restaurant and fully demonstrate that he is complete free soul it is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing
<START> a question immediately <UNK> in this extremely <UNK> film who are the crazy people br br the answer become less clear as the film goes on br br <UNK> <UNK> loses the <UNK> note in her voice and while her voice is still high she is incredibly effective as the shell shocked betty in fact she is so effective i almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable br br this is the first time ms <UNK> has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task br br chris rock  though as foul mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as wesley he is able to <UNK> his manic energy and it only occasionally <UNK> and always when it is needed most br br there are some interesting <UNK> the first time you see betty she is dressed almost exactly like dorothy <UNK> from the wizard of <UNK>  then later in the film she is compared to dorothy when she says she has never been out of kansas before at one point the song that doris day was best known for <UNK> is on the soundtrack and then later charlie morgan freeman describes her as having <UNK> whole doris day thing going on ' br br this is an extremely quirky film with good performances by everyone including the supporting cast br br it has a surprising ending that as contrary as it sounds is actually fairly predictable br br if for no other reason see this film just to listen to the master of the human voice morgan freeman
<START> co directed by and starring <UNK> <UNK> this film short was based on a short story by dutch writer harry br br in the 10 minutes of the film's length you will get to see a life time as <UNK> <UNK> his long time fascination with a room he passes constantly in his youth returning to the city many years later he finds he has rented the same room br br using black and white film the <UNK> are <UNK> in this delicate telling of a tale the voice of <UNK> drawing you into his world br br a subtle tight performance from <UNK> <UNK> and 2 non speaking characters wonderful soundtrack by dutch musician br br at the moment difficult to see this movie as it is only available on dvd region 2 <UNK> <UNK> as a bonus track but is due to be on the re released dvd of the <UNK> another tight but very different performance from <UNK> br br see this film if you can
<START> historical movies always take liberties conversations are <UNK> where no one could actually know what was said customs are <UNK> to be <UNK> to modern audiences etc however historical films about actual historical <UNK> should make at least a minimal nod to history this film does not the only scene i actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who creeps into his chamber at night he confronts the dangerous intruder with i don't remember sending for room service the main entertainment value is in its badness i recommended my local video story put it on the <UNK> shelf
<START> this was the best film of 1998 and one of the best of the 90's yes it is a rip off of <UNK> but as the saying goes good <UNK> borrow great <UNK> steal and <UNK> has stolen brilliantly from some of the best plus added some genius touches of his own i gave this a ten which is very rare for me br br the main reason i am commenting on this though cause i could just rave all night is all those people who have seen it on vhs standard issue what are you thinking this deserves the full screen experience look at the ratio it was shot in i saw it 5 times at the cinema and haven't bothered to watch it on video br br <UNK> said
<START> honestly this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting heather graham could never live this down it has three titles for a reason to protect the guilty beautifully bad dialog do you like <UNK> and a plot only a mother could <UNK> this is your friday night entertainment br br my roommate rented this under the title terrified because he liked heather graham but terrified is what we felt after the final credits not because the movie is scary but because somebody actually paid money to make this turd on a movie reel br br horrible movie there are a few no name actors that provide some unintentional comedy but nothing worth viewing heather <UNK> dramatic climax also was one of the most pathetic and disturbing things i have ever witnessed i award this movie no point and may god have mercy on its soul
<START> not a bad movie but could have been done without the full frontal nudity of a 10 year old boy in one of the opening scenes this movie has excellent dialog which is certainly common among foreign films foreign actors still know how to act as opposed to american actors who let the cgi stunts and special effects do all the work for them this film is just good old fashion acting <UNK> did an excellent job as always the costumes and scenery are accurate with the time my only complaint is that they should have dubbed the english words over the french instead of using subtitles this could just be because i hate reading subtitles
<START> i came out of dark blue world feeling sigh <UNK> yet it was definitely a film needed to be made and it's truly well done from czech republic it's entertaining in spite of the <UNK> premise it is full of feelings the bonding and undeniably true friendship between the two lead characters one mature lieutenant pilot <UNK> as and the young ever so eager budding pilot as <UNK> the inevitable love triangle and the now and then <UNK> of the grim prison situations in <UNK> in the <UNK> it's all in one film put together by the father screenwriter and son director team <UNK> and jan previous achievement being the lovable <UNK> br br it's not as long as east west french <UNK> 1999 which was heart wrenching multi layered story about a returning russian doctor and french wife's ill <UNK> after wwii in russia the plot of <UNK> <UNK> title in czech is quite straightforward and has <UNK> of light humor music songs of wwii england sung in czech modest special effects of pilots and air <UNK> in the sky not elaborate like hollywood there's no need to be bing bang boom all the time when showing air battle scenes the sadness was explained up front in the beginning two <UNK> in english and wrap up with follow up <UNK> the film is not totally subtitled only when <UNK> the czech conversations the rest are in english be it very british or in czech accents so it's a foreign film with english language and includes british actors br br the three lead performances especially of the two czech pilots were wonderfully delivered there are nuances between the two of them even though it's the <UNK> mature vs the eagerly young i always appreciate tara fitzgerald yes there's <UNK> off 1996 opposite ewan <UNK> and pete <UNK> remembered her from hear my song 1991 opposite adrian <UNK> and ned beatty opposite hugh grant in <UNK> 1994 and the <UNK> who went up a hill and came down a mountain 1995 besides her appearances in <UNK> masterpiece theatre mini series br br <UNK> the fact that heroes defending one's country can be so ill treated and for so long 40 years thank goodness for worthwhile memories and the <UNK> of friendship unforgettable hence the pause for a ray of sunshine through a <UNK> glass window ironic or <UNK> that it's of a church where the hard labor took place symbolic of hope never give br br other recent films that have stories needed to be told with as the canadian from afghanistan taking a journey to with a personal in mind more than meets the eye behind a by iranian director <UNK> everything put together with <UNK> mitchell as a new mother facing sid sudden <UNK> death insightful film by swiss director marc <UNK> and his much talked about controversial film <UNK> ball i've yet to catch with <UNK> <UNK> billy bob <UNK> and peter boyle see the films without prior expectations or comparisons to films before just see it
<START> i spent three months living in the east end of london in the latter half of 1987 when the show had been on the air for almost two years it was considered a running joke there br br why because it had an all white cast every cast member and extra in the first couple of years was white br br the street where i lived was a long one with over <UNK> houses and to the best of my knowledge i was one of only three or four white faces living on that street we were on the corner of the indian and turkish quarters and even if you <UNK> those two races the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the white people twenty to one plus of course of the very few white people who did live in the area the vast majority were <UNK> like me a cockney accent was never heard br br that wasn't a racist rant just a simple statement of fact the bbc either couldn't be bothered crossing london to do their research before writing this soap or else they only had white actors available and decided to <UNK> it out br br either way as i say in the east end of the time we considered it a comedy show
<START> there's a <UNK> <UNK> edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any <UNK> telling us how we're meant to be feeling in everything was overtly sad sure powerful as hell but still in <UNK> it was delightful <UNK> but there are no such emotional clues or <UNK> for that matter in this one it's as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without <UNK> <UNK> i think that's what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three but finally the most <UNK> and <UNK> never has <UNK> honesty been quite so beautiful
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> has just three weeks ago been released in the uk and already i watch as countless letters <UNK> to the national papers and tv <UNK> claiming that it possesses a thin plot weak performances and an even weaker script br br you find me <UNK> this is <UNK> br br i would really like to <UNK> all doubt by first <UNK> andrew davies on <UNK> geoffrey <UNK> to create this wonderful <UNK> of sarah <UNK> novel by him with such a fantastic script kudos but i fear i must now change <UNK> br br i saw one of the premiere tv <UNK> here in the uk which shall remain <UNK> relentlessly describing <UNK> the <UNK> as a lesbian love story if they are and i assume they are trying to promote interest in the film then this is completely the wrong way to go about it aside from the phrase being a <UNK> inaccurate description by saying such a thing they are either a turning away those who would <UNK> be <UNK> by that subject matter or b <UNK> a class of people who will only watch to see some serious girl on girl action buy a video through this display of serious this and other magazines are what is a brilliant adaptation of one of recent <UNK> greatest works <UNK> the <UNK> is a story of love of passion of moving on of loss and of <UNK> it's not a lesbian love story no br br the end result is a stylish affair with excellent performances all round particularly from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and may direction wise it's <UNK> and <UNK> sometimes fast paced sometimes not but it never <UNK> to be anything less than compelling as a whole it's polished and well delivered the sex is <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> and although many will not class it as a real film it will remain among my favourites for some time to come
<START> this is a film that has garnered any interest or praise it has received simply on the merit of being a lesbian interest piece the performances are mostly <UNK> compared to better films in the interest genre the entirety of the film's watchable value is garnered through modest suspense over whether and when the <UNK> family members will say something <UNK> about their lesbian relationship the best element of the film is likely the beautiful new england scenery although much of the film is set inside it is hard to <UNK> how any viewer watching this film and not seeking <UNK> of their lifestyle or wishing to see that of others <UNK> even through poorly realized drama could appreciate <UNK> water in any significant way it is a terrible movie
<START> this game was one of the main reasons i actually got a <UNK> i remember playing soul edge sometimes called soul blade back in the day and i was hooked on it br br i did play the original soul <UNK> but i never got a chance to play it for a huge amount of time i did however buy the <UNK> version of soul <UNK> ii and that was what truly got me hooked on the series and i was <UNK> when i heard of soul <UNK> iii this game still gives us the classic characters such as nightmare and however it also adds several new characters such as <UNK> and the <UNK> night terror the true boss of tales of souls the <UNK> based chronicles of sword mode is a new feature which i really like it can be quite challenging in the later chronicles but it's a good addition to the series br br the soul <UNK> mode has several missions in which you must fight a certain enemy under certain circumstances the exception is final battle in which you simply must defeat night terror it's another fine touch that makes the game all the more fun br br in some scenes in tales of should you will be made to press certain buttons in order to get a different result this can be in order to dodge block an attack or to get a better ending every character has two endings all in all this is an excellent game and i'd recommend it if you're a fan of fighting games
<START> a female friend invited me to see this in the theaters br br after half an hour we walked out and went into the next <UNK> yeah we broke the rules in time to catch the beginning of against all odds br br i remember too many apes dancing around saying very little about the characters or introduction to the story captured either one of us or was even memorable it just dragged to the point of being painfully boring and believe me any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend br br the production values were excellent good photography and lighting but this was a major studio release and we came to see a movie not an art gallery it seemed like ralph richardson and <UNK> mcdowell were going to be wasted in such a poorly written film br br perhaps if you make into the second hour there is something worth seeing i do not have so much patience with my time 4 out of 10
<START> first and foremost i wish to aim a big mean middle finger towards the troma dvd distribution crew who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie's <UNK> killer on the back of the cover the synopsis just randomly mentions who's the person responsible for the massacre on <UNK> day for <UNK> sake i don't care how terrible or how predictable an 80's slasher can be just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point so a word of advise in case you also purchase the troma double feature containing <UNK> day and barbarian in dinosaur hell do not  repeat do not  turn the box around and read the back watching the film is already a painful experience but reading the back would really spoil everything br br now as for the actual the actual <UNK> oh boy personally i'm a fan of the cinematic <UNK> of <UNK> freed well actually i don't really know whether i should admire pity him all films are pretty bad amateurish but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good intentions unlike with <UNK> and beyond evil he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high school slasher films just to offer a minimum of originality all the victims in <UNK> day are promising <UNK> and members of the same track of coach george michaels awesome name i guess <UNK> freed is a fan of <UNK> during the opening credits we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field moments after winning a 30 seconds running race the debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team members weren't pushing her physical limits too much is raised but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to <UNK> kill everyone he she considers responsible for <UNK> death what a demented little movie the script must be one of the most incoherent ones i ever with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words there's a bloke <UNK> by a football attached to a <UNK> others are decapitated with an <UNK> big sword and the <UNK> bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of <UNK> <UNK> concentrates on the the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film for example <UNK> sister returns home from her military training and <UNK> starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death halfway through the movie however her character hardly appears in the movie anymore also the girls' <UNK> is referred to as a violent <UNK> but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well instead of carefully <UNK> suspense and misleading red herrings we're served disco dancing roller <UNK> sequences and  of course  numerous images of unattractive 80's chicks <UNK> their tops off despite being really bad <UNK> day could count on a respectable cast christopher george <UNK> city of the living dead greatly stars as the demanding coach carmen <UNK> when a stranger calls the accused briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and michael <UNK> dead buried <UNK> dog has a very amusing part as the <UNK> <UNK> out principal the teenage <UNK> on duty include <UNK> <UNK> and white heck for some horror fans the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count <UNK> day among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80's it's a dumb film but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed
<START> the <UNK> girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 now the daughter is 16 in season 1 and they live like sisters sharing everything <UNK> each other completely br br i like the <UNK> girls but i am not sure why the mother named lauren graham and the daughter named <UNK> short for played by <UNK> are both very beautiful women they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways there are some funny supporting characters such as luke scott <UNK> he and like each may be even love each other but neither of them really acts on it they have their little moments there are some other supporting characters most of them very funny and with their won touching moments br br what i like the most i think is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult the dialogue between them is quick sharp funny and sometimes touching as well the band they have is beautiful the <UNK> girls makes you feel good so try it
<START> being a self <UNK> slasher addict means that it's very rare that i get the chance to review many bigger budgeted movies with <UNK> casts aside from james successful box office draw identity there have not been any big name entries since the scream trilogy once again put wes craven's name back on the hollywood map that's why mark <UNK> the last stop  a mystery thriller with blatant slasher overtones instantly intrigued me with a decent line up including adam beach and <UNK> <UNK> and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds space for <UNK> <UNK> rose garden i must admit that the initial signs were very positive for this claustrophobic feature to the best of my knowledge there have only ever been three other snow bound slashers unless of course you consider demon possessed to fit in the category the first slice and <UNK> on the ice was the bone dry <UNK> blade then came the lisa <UNK> cheese feast that was <UNK> of blood and the enjoyable <UNK> followed some <UNK> years later br br during an extreme <UNK> state <UNK> jason adam beach battles through the snow to reach a remote <UNK> in the <UNK> mountains his task is to inform the guests that the road is closed and they must stay for at least one more night until a path can be <UNK> through the <UNK> conditions this news doesn't go down to well with the suspicious bunch which includes two <UNK> brothers <UNK> keith <UNK> and peter <UNK> a truck driver that really doesn't want to hang around william s taylor a randy couple of lovers winston and amy <UNK> and <UNK> ex girlfriend nancy rose the motel owners <UNK> <UNK> and p <UNK> johnson aren't <UNK> by the news either but they offer rooms to the stranded guests and attempt to calm the tense situation things take a turn for the worse when jason finds a <UNK> body and a bag full of stolen cash lying in the snow behind the <UNK> just like a chapter out of an agatha christie mystery the <UNK> begin <UNK> at the hands of a masked <UNK> that seems intent to re claim the money with so many dodgy characters to choose from and no way of leaving the crime scene jason has to attempt to stop the maniac before he kills <UNK> br br a good mystery needs at least a handful of shady suspects who each have a credible motive a remote location that no one can escape from and a smart protagonist to help unravel the clues fortunately the last stop provides each of those essential ingredients in a thriller that has its equal moments of brilliance and downright stupidity the film kicks off superbly as the dubious personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment that manages to keep the tension running high throughout the runtime malone keeps the interest levels raised as each character <UNK> their own reasons to attract some of the suspicion and to be fair the essential twist isn't one that you'll guess easily in fact i found myself watching the movie through once again to see if i could pick up on any hints that i missed first time around unfortunately when the maniac is revealed to be an over the top psycho that <UNK> like a comic book bad guy the last stop a huge amount of credibility thankfully all is not lost when an unexpected and brilliantly <UNK> plot twist <UNK> the film's finale br br similarities can be drawn with the excellent identity as the two plots are almost <UNK> james effort has to be the better of the two mainly because of the star billing of john cusack and the ever reliable ray liotta with that said though adam beach does a good enough job in the lead while <UNK> <UNK> amy <UNK> and the brilliant <UNK> keith <UNK> add some credible support rose acts as in this role as she probably does from day to day in reality and winston started fantastically before going completely overboard with the film's climax if you're a die hard slasher fan that's watching this for some bloody killings then you're going to be disappointed the <UNK> wearing psychopath only pops up once and the rest of the murders are committed off screen but as i said earlier <UNK> directorial talent means that the suspense is never too far off the <UNK> and you can forgive the few flaws because the <UNK> just about triumph br br the last stop is well worth a look for slasher <UNK> and movie fans alike yes there are a handful of <UNK> but overall this is a solid example of <UNK> hollywood talents if you liked identity then certainly give this a
<START> i saw this movie for the first time on a sick day from school about ten years ago compared to the made for lifetime movies i usually watched it became an instant though obscure favorite br br i've seen it maybe twice since then i think some parts are little cheesy maybe the plot could use some more action br br nevertheless it captures the fantasies and realities of children with <UNK> and warmth the magical realism is on par with that of <UNK> and the heart with that of the wonder years despite the particular development of my tastes i still find the subtle magic of this film the lovable characters and its simplicity enchanting
<START> time travel is <UNK> so i can give the script some <UNK> br br i also understand the concept that by changing just one <UNK> you can potentially change the way history <UNK> br br what i cannot understand however is the way the change in time <UNK> we are subjected to a series of which <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> evolution while this is a convenient plot device as it allows our heroes enough time to resolve the problem it makes no sense whatsoever surely if you change a <UNK> and that <UNK> has significantly or even completely altered <UNK> evolution then by the time you come back to the future the <UNK> process has already been established and there would be no need for waves after all why would a change that happened <UNK> million years ago need to wait until now to be effective the fact that the <UNK> was projected forward in time may give it some credibility but the life of that <UNK> <UNK> million years ago was significantly altered <UNK> any change to <UNK> history would have begun then and not be <UNK> upon a return to our current time br br to solve the problem the team goes back in time to prevent the change in <UNK> from ever happening by doing this successfully we see that the changes to evolution never happened and that no one even remembers the events surely what works for the solution should work for the original change i like a good <UNK> sci fi adventure but unless it is set in a galaxy far far away it needs to have at least some <UNK> in <UNK> possibility to make it truly entertaining br br good premise bad plot reasonable acting and in all fairness just a twist on jurassic park br br not on my watch again list
<START> this is a pretty good made for tv flick of the <UNK> <UNK> variety as in what if terrorists <UNK> a <UNK> in a big city in this case london lots of <UNK> at folks that say <UNK> all set in the event of an that then reveal that they're not exactly telling the full story and is anyone prepared for something like this you can bet not this shows the material for the bombs being <UNK> into the country the making of the bombs the <UNK> and double lives that the people behind it lead etc it also shows public servants i e <UNK> giving their all to save people when they aren't getting any help when the government doesn't want to send anyone else into the affected area also shows how woefully <UNK> are for any such <UNK> as the government talks everything up but then stands there with their mouths hanging open as the tragedy unfolds and could this happen right here in the good old usa well unless you've been living in <UNK> for the past 20 years something already has to an extent and don't bet that anyone would be prepared for something of this nature this is fairly realistic and yes even scary well worth seeing but just hope nothing like this ever really happens 8 out of 10
<START> after seeing purely <UNK> i came onto this site to review it but not only that i also had to check out the resume of the screenwriter director mark herman as soon as his name appeared on the opening credits i knew that i had seen his name before somewhere and after checking i found out he wrote and directed the film version of little voice one of the most underrated <UNK> british movies of the 1990s br br purely <UNK> is an entirely different <UNK> of fish it's a grim stereotypical view of <UNK> life and a very unfunny one at that everyone is either a wife <UNK> a single mother a <UNK> a drunk or a <UNK> since many scenes are set in a school the <UNK> teacher is a sadistic bully and that's the closest the film ever gets to reality oh and everyone is very foul mouthed which adds to the grim unlikable atmosphere br br i didn't like purely <UNK> much while i watched and now that i know who mark herman is i like it even less with little voice herman proved you can make an amusing uplifting comedy featuring northern souls but i had to ask where his <UNK> talent went in this movie
<START> you may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to the <UNK> but this is an absolute classic much scarier in premise than the first and very entertaining it only got a video release here in the uk but should be released worldwide for everyone to enjoy
<START> heaven can wait is a <UNK> bore and a candy <UNK> <UNK> lie i can't imagine anyone but film students sitting through it today don <UNK> is in almost every scene and while he has a <UNK> voice that no doubt contributed to his successful career in radio he doesn't have the charisma to carry this film <UNK> plays henry a <UNK> lubitsch wants to make <UNK> sexual adorable and amusing and so he directs <UNK> to play the part as <UNK> as possible the combination of <UNK> lack of charisma and <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> results in a lead character who is both deadly dull and completely <UNK> you wouldn't want to spend any time with this man he'd put you to sleep you wouldn't leave him alone with your daughter no matter her age something creepy would happen br br the movie's look is quite boring scene after scene consists of static overly <UNK> style shots of <UNK> dressed <UNK> age stuffed shirts and <UNK> in <UNK> busy victorian <UNK> there's so many and <UNK> and so much and sky blue and pink you need <UNK> br br this movie hates women as much as hardcore porn but it presents that hatred with a candy <UNK> and a sweet little bow on top the contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is sickening in one of the movie's most hateful scenes an elderly woman is sent to hell because she's not physically attractive
<START> i recently saw this movie for the first time i enjoyed it so much that i went right out and bought the dvd this movie is pure genius and only gets funnier with each viewing anyone can write jokes or funny dialog and have actors <UNK> them but the basis of this movie is improve how do they do it thank you christopher guest
<START> are pretty good at making me laugh at the drab <UNK> of my soulless life huh br br the film making here was incredibly <UNK> every piece of framing every deadpan stare every element of the colour palette every <UNK> of <UNK> or of those street <UNK> was there to hammer home this world's calm <UNK> br br in fact i think i might have found the general sense of <UNK> overbearing had its absurdity not been genuinely funny and <UNK> like when <UNK> is telling his boss that he misses children and looks up and the guy is smiling and halfway out the door it's a sort of sad but true reflection of working with people spending 7 8 hours a day with them seeing more of them than the folk you love but ultimately knowing deep down they don't give a damn about your troubles and you the same br br this might have been a film the had made had they been born in <UNK> and not <UNK> i think their humour is more aggressive and more wrapped up in <UNK> past but they have the same <UNK> of technique and their films have the same underlying sense that life is pretty <UNK> br br i'll stop before i talk myself into taking a bus into the <UNK> wilderness
<START> maybe if you <UNK> enough <UNK> this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70's there's an odd innocence to this movie and the sex is a lot more awkward and playful than the <UNK> pros who do it for the cameras now br br the real <UNK> here and really the only reason to watch this movie is the appearance of <UNK> <UNK> as alice she was a ford model and it shows she's got classic <UNK> ish good looks like a really cute <UNK> league <UNK> girl so what the hell is she doing in this cheap cheesy skin flick from my <UNK> point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie which might explain it and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part when she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she's <UNK> julie andrews or something i just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gonna be her big break or something instead of the near career killer that it was anyway she is damn cute and you kind of can't believe she would even get naked on screen much less do a masturbation scene a couple of <UNK> sex scenes with men and women and then do the real deal as a climax to the film it is also definitely not a body double at all that is our little <UNK> taking one for the team or for the greater glory of <UNK> or something it's pretty amazing to watch and it is definitely stimulating <UNK> but in a way i kinda wish she hadn't done it that was a very pretty talented young girl getting some really bad advice br br anyway my guess is that <UNK> <UNK> wherever she is has long long since wished this movie would go away she was very cute and appealing in <UNK> almost impossible to believe this is the same girl but it is
<START> just awful it's almost unbelievable that with characters and situations provided by <UNK> <UNK> such a plodding <UNK> <UNK> could result but that's television for you filler between commercials the first warning <UNK> sounds from the of the period re creation which screams <UNK> in <UNK> type and <UNK> cars <UNK> and and <UNK> jazz <UNK> played with all the attention paid to pointless arty detail the important matters get ignored br br like narrative clarity or <UNK> or competent writing and acting the plot sets one of <UNK> <UNK> hamilton <UNK> so whether he's called ham or <UNK> we think of <UNK> or dash investigating a bogus diamond <UNK> thus is introduced the young woman who supposedly carries the curse the <UNK> and talentless nancy <UNK> who went back to <UNK> where she <UNK> she belongs to a <UNK> religious cult led by jean simmons and seems addicted to drugs as well there's also a mysterious drug which <UNK> into rooms br br but enough the writing is never more pedestrian than when it reaches for the poetic or high <UNK> and the cast <UNK> it the only way they know how by <UNK> overacting simmons gets treated like minor <UNK> from old hollywood but the <UNK> dame treatment doesn't wash hector <UNK> for some reason enjoys second billing after coburn for a <UNK> part other familiar faces drift through doing little good for their <UNK> br br the actors aren't even photographed to look good jason miller is an <UNK> fright but extreme close ups of coburn are <UNK> too coburn probably <UNK> this role because with mustache he bears a strong resemblance to <UNK> he needed more <UNK> than that nobody has given him the <UNK> hint as to how to play his character or of the story's tone or of how the different <UNK> of the plot <UNK> together they don't at least not in this telling so he flashes his big cat grin whether called for or not br br the curse is available on <UNK> in a variety of <UNK> for those <UNK> enough to see for themselves the <UNK> is the <UNK> cut of all
<START> this is one of the few movies maybe the only that truly haunted me for years it was the first i had ever seen people tortured so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from <UNK> their teeth and screaming etc it was brutal the worst thing i had ever seen on film br br dr <UNK> played by joseph <UNK> is still one of the most evil characters i've ever seen on film and i've viewed thousands he was so sadistic that i would never watch this movie again nor would i recommend it he makes <UNK> <UNK> look like mr rogers if seeing people tortured is not your idea of fun then stay away from this film br br i know there are a lot of sick people out there many of them professional film critics who probably enjoyed this <UNK> sick story it's a b movie anyway with stupid dialog and some wooden acting by charles bronson this is not one of his better efforts even if it was there so many horrendous scenes in here you wouldn't want to watch trust me on this one
<START> <UNK> been is a real feel good film if you haven't seen it yet then rent it out i am going to buy it when its released because i loved it drew barrymore is excellent again she plays her part well i felt i could relate to this film because of the school days i had were just as bad i thought the plot was well written there was comedy and romance which are the type of films i love i loved the ending because even though you know what's going to happen it still leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting <UNK>
<START> for a series that was inspired by kolchak it's ironic that the x files first attempt at a vampire episode should land <UNK> on it's ass 3 has always puzzled me and at the risk of sounding like the dreadful hans <UNK> i've often wondered if i'm missing the point the story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don't match the box and the result is you spending a <UNK> evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea this <UNK> feeling remains no matter how many times you <UNK> the episode and no matter how much attention you give it i know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to by teenage vampires <UNK> drink my blood while listening to <UNK> but that's a risk i'm willing to take i've always been a werewolf man myself
<START> personally i've watched it because of <UNK> <UNK> appearance and i didn't really expect to enjoy the movie as such but surprisingly i kept watching it until the end br br let's face it it just one of the saga like stories and isn't particularly original or entertaining but strangely it just keeps you by the tv my opinion about will of their own would be much better if there wouldn't be one point that i just don't get br br there is lovely and really <UNK> scene in which <UNK> <UNK> character is running on the street holding baby in her arms the snow is falling she is cold scared and has no place to stay she doesn't know what to do next and then about 10 12 years later when things are better for her she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming about br br i just don't get it i don't see how is it possible that she would do such thing it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival after this character flip i just couldn't enjoy rest of the movie
<START> this film is not your typical hollywood fare though the <UNK> are so bad i often tend to stay away from movies rather than be disappointed however this little low budget gem is thoroughly <UNK> and enjoyable and definitely a keeper the actors are as varied as the characters they portray the buffalo setting is charming what a pretty city and the story <UNK> the lack of gratuitous violence sex and the f word doesn't detract in the least take the kids take grandma take a break from hollywood i give it an 11 out of 10
<START> when a bbc murder thriller is this <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> you know who the killer must be the homosexual br br who murdered the sexy blonde teenager who's also a <UNK> liar on her way home from school let's see could it be the mother who against all common sense is letting her <UNK> son make visits to his serial killer father behind bars could it be the moody son who's impressed by his <UNK> no nonsense attitude about women could it be the serial killer himself who seems able to manipulate events from behind bars a la <UNK> <UNK> could it be mom's boyfriend a teacher at the school whose affair with an ex student led to his wife's suicide or could it be <UNK> daughter who goes <UNK> everyone's secrets at school causing <UNK> misery no it's none of these likely suspects it's the homosexual br br the only mystery for the viewer is guessing who the homosexual is of course it could be anybody since the only characteristics of the homosexual are shameful <UNK> and a <UNK> to murder and otherwise make life complicated for the normal folks the homosexual is the invisible root cause of <UNK> <UNK> only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the <UNK> family come back together and things can return to normal whatever that is br br as for the cast both redgrave and <UNK> green are now officially past their sell by dates the world could get by <UNK> without ever seeing either on screen again but as long as the bbc has roles for the <UNK> woman and the misunderstood man i suppose they'll keep coming back in movies like this one
<START> this is truly a kung fu classic this film appears to have influenced martial arts films for decades the spanish guitar background music the competing schools the <UNK> high leaps onto the edges of <UNK> catching thrown spears cheating in <UNK> the secret training for an exotic karate technique themes of patience and <UNK> and more were copied by many later films such as the karate kid 1984 hero 2002 kill bill volume 2 2004 and kung fu <UNK> 2004 br br i feel lucky to have first seen this film in 1972 shortly after it was released just before kung fu films became mainstream and before bruce lee became a household name i saw it with two buddies of mine in a downtown san diego theater <UNK> by sailors and although the scenes of the glowing red hands and <UNK> <UNK> got some laughs clearly the audience was getting into it as was our little group it was a very memorable movie for me decades later i could still recall several specific scenes even after i had forgotten the film title this film is extra special to me now because one of those two buddies with whom i first saw it sailor kenneth lee hines of the kitty <UNK> has since passed away so this film serves as a <UNK> of that day together before we took <UNK> and karate lessons in subsequent years br br relative to kung fu films i'd rate this film as 10 10 but since i have to keep the larger film audience in mind i'll more <UNK> rate it as 8 10 due to obvious technical flaws i just recommend that <UNK> viewers consider those technical flaws to be proof of its vintage nature and of its authenticity and then <UNK> proceed to enjoy its <UNK> charged mayhem
<START> what starts off fairly well and quite disturbing quickly sinks into an annoying mess br br dee <UNK> of twisted sister <UNK> apparently penned the screenplay from his own idea and while the idea of a <UNK> stalking pierce freak has potential they really blow it here on uneven pacing bad dialogue and one of the greatest non endings you'll ever see despite some lifeless performances the director manages a genuinely creepy first reel this really looks like it's going to be a good low budget effort br br no such luck the plot goes all over the map and character relentlessly <UNK> out tiresome psychotic fortune cookie lines that are supposed to pass for meaningful dialogue worse the supporting cast barely <UNK> and the only halfway believable dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective <UNK> the internet br br what a waste of a great idea oh and there is a new twisted sister song if you care
<START> this is one of my favorite horror films of all time and i used to think it never really got its due that is until i read the glowing reviews here it seems many feel the same as i did when i first saw it br br it's a damn creepy film and i've spent most of my life watching creepy films i've always found dolls <UNK> and such damn creepy check out the dolls in beyond the door and of course the great trilogy of terror and what about the magnificent twilight zone episode living doll hell dolls are creepy and tourist trap has some moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck all aided by an excellent soundtrack that just makes <UNK> performance even more heart <UNK> br br i remember seeing the trailer to this film on late night tv and thing wow i gotta see that it was memorable and it's one of the only trailers i remember seeing as a kid that <UNK> me out took me years to see it but it was a treat br br stephen king also mentions this film in his <UNK> macabre book and gives it a glowing recommendation pretty good company br br this film will always be high on my list of must sees it's a real solid addition to the genre of the time and deserves place alongside the best of the 70s
<START> this movie is <UNK> directed by clive barker he really knows how to establish a <UNK> between the audience and the characters i think there is a sequel missing for this one barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of <UNK> that is one i think was a real garbage but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel has become a dark cult classic of horror films
<START> is the wife of russian filmmaker <UNK> who directed the more <UNK> known 1984 film come and see generally regarded as one of the most realistic war films ever bar none notable for its <UNK> poetic intensity but i believe it lacks the inner complexity of this even greater russian film which <UNK> not just the graphic outer horrors but she finds truly inspiring images focusing on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute insanity taking place inside these human beings the ending of which is simply awe inspiring bullets are flying and bodies are dying in a gun <UNK> over the opening credits where the intensity of the film never lets up throughout the duration focusing on grim faces worn out soldiers with next to nothing to eat a terrified population under <UNK> starving children with <UNK> mothers all cast in an immense landscape of endless white snow like <UNK> are flying 1957 this features a russian army in <UNK> a <UNK> shock early in the war when they were nearly wiped out the russian countryside has been <UNK> by german <UNK> who are <UNK> the citizens stealing what food they have forcing them under <UNK> to become their <UNK> eyes and ears what russian soldiers are left hide under cover of <UNK> but are forced to send food to <UNK> <UNK> this film follows two soldiers that from the outset are on a near impossible mission as there's little food left anywhere in the dead of winter one is healthy and fit <UNK> as while the other boris as is <UNK> down by a <UNK> sounding <UNK> and eventually a bullet in his leg that nearly leaves him for dead but his partner <UNK> <UNK> him as they step through <UNK> deep snow <UNK> <UNK> at some points with <UNK> protection against the harsh elements like so many other russian films nature itself becomes their <UNK> <UNK> br br spoilers everything is reduced to a matter of survival when they reach their destination the farm has been <UNK> and left in a state of <UNK> pushing forward into german occupied territory where the next farm is <UNK> by an elderly soviet <UNK> who fears nazi <UNK> the <UNK> soldiers think him a coward but move on where they are eventually captured and brought to a nazi camp in a nearby town and held as prisoners along with a proud and protective mother <UNK> who helped hide them <UNK> <UNK> appears as the <UNK> a russian teacher from a nearby academy turned nazi <UNK> russians torturing and <UNK> fellow russians is the depth of war <UNK> and is brilliant in the despicable role he's perfectly suited for from what we can see as nazi officers chat in close <UNK> to one another he is an <UNK> even among this group seen instead as a kind of gruesome black <UNK> undertaker who <UNK> sends men to their graves the audience is not <UNK> from witnessing acts of torture on who offers nothing but contempt while speaks <UNK> hoping to save his life but both are condemned to die though is offered a chance to serve the german <UNK> as a police agent the mother the elderly <UNK> and a child are added to this group spending one last night together alive where together they discuss the merits of a <UNK> mission of being a <UNK> a mother a coward or a <UNK> each seems <UNK> driven by a desperate need to survive but offers himself as a <UNK> example attempting to confess his guilt to spare the others where the <UNK> chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption br br by the next morning seems mildly amused mocking them at their sudden <UNK> to talk but <UNK> no one except who changes sides to keep his life in his thoughts that if he's alive at least he has a chance to escape but there is no from this torment what happens is shown with exquisite <UNK> and poetic grace as we witness the <UNK> of war without a single shot being fired as the execution by hanging is turned into a public spectacle where the villagers at the point of a gun are forced to witness the pace and harrowing intensity of this film is relentless as there is never a moment without impending menace <UNK> shot by <UNK> who died in the same car accident as featuring perfectly composed landscapes and plenty of camera movement much of it at close range using especially that of a fierce young boy at the end who eyes the condemned men who makes a surreal connection to the next generation without any words being spoken <UNK> by the psychologically horrific music of alfred which resembles the <UNK> yet <UNK> disturbing <UNK> music from kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey 1968 the sound design of this film is highly advanced and uniquely modern where the use of off screen sound continually exposes the raw nerves of each moment dogs <UNK> wind blowing bullets firing nearby <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> german or laughing <UNK> at their <UNK> which only <UNK> up the hideous tension to insane heights in many ways resembling <UNK> the passion of joan of arc <UNK> utter insanity is exposed here the relentless realization that you have no choice yet you are forced to make one anyway the nightmarish inner thoughts at the end are expressed where the <UNK> of the dead speaks volumes where voices continue to <UNK> inside the heads of the living like an explosion of <UNK> echoes yet only silence fills the crisp <UNK> air with a <UNK> <UNK> and a profound sense of loss
<START> sadly this film lives up to about 1 of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth for video game <UNK> book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept whether on paper or <UNK> <UNK> that does not deliver and not only that goes well under the mark far cry the video game released in 2004 created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of <UNK> would have <UNK> to watch the film if you are a <UNK> that has played far cry do not watch this film anyone else who hasn't played the game it'll still seem like a b grade acted b grade directed movie uwe boll hang your head in shame this should've been easy to make into a blockbuster the storyline of the game was incredible think jurassic park meets alien and yet you still managed to take it and <UNK> it into your own terrible recreation of an instant classic video game companies be warned if uwe boll comes a lock the door oh <UNK> <UNK> i look forward to seeing you make up for yourself in <UNK> what were you thinking taking this one on sigh
<START> the <UNK> is classic disney at it's best it's not considered as the ultimate disney classic along side the more well known disney films but it's a well made and fun film that certainly deserves to be a disney classic <UNK> is certainly a sure kids <UNK> cause it has all the <UNK> for a fun kids film i'll liked it very much as a kid i'm not sure if this film is a sure <UNK> to the adults who could watch disney classics for the nostalgia sake but i still enjoy this film as an young adult br br <UNK> <UNK> may not be so complex or innovative but it doesn't matter this film was made on that period where the filmmakers followed the <UNK> that the characters were the story and wise versa which <UNK> certainly shows the characters make the film they're all likable fun have great lines and have a great interaction with each other the voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling eva <UNK> as <UNK> phil harris as thomas and etc a <UNK> could have been the dogs <UNK> and <UNK> since they're <UNK> and haven't so much to do with the actual story but fortunately they're fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold br br <UNK> is both entertaining and cute but it's also a very funny cartoon the animation style and look fits perfectly for the film's french surroundings especially the city of paris looks <UNK> the character animation and design is great and the songs are really catchy too my favorite is scale and but the title song is a cute song along with thomas cat and the memorable show <UNK> everybody <UNK> to be a cat and the score by george burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situations br br overall <UNK> is in my opinion the best disney cartoon from the 70's and it's a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered so what you're waiting for do your self a favor and share this disney classic with your kids it deserves to be in their memories
<START> it couldn't br br from the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to behold throughout the immediate feel for the <UNK> of the <UNK> the <UNK> for the characters that is built up at the base level before the real action <UNK> up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around br br up against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of <UNK> from another planet the thing comes out on top and laughing who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today i for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew and the way that they all had some distinctive character traits this wasn't just a senseless bloodbath come slasher horror flick this film had feeling emotion br br i truly can't recommend this film highly enough i have yet to see anything in it's class that comes anywhere near to matching let alone <UNK> the near perfect acting and timing <UNK> in this cunning feat of cinema
<START> first of all i am from <UNK> where this movie takes place and believe it or not there are guys like and <UNK> including the silly <UNK> i know their comedy show from the beginning and my main fear was that the movie is just an <UNK> of their already known jokes but it is not the jokes are evolved through the story and make in their own special way sense but if you absolutely dislike <UNK> <UNK> hands of this movie everyone else it's worth viewing
<START> gregory peck and gig young are competing for the same girl and after peck sends young on a very dangerous mission they blame him for his reasons feeling guilty peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a <UNK> where they are <UNK> by the indians peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the <UNK> of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers ward bond <UNK> <UNK> jr <UNK> brand among others are excellent the script is derived from a novel by charles marquis warren who was a <UNK> in westerns as a writer director and producer the idea of using this type of men as heroes inspired many films that came out later including the dirty dozen made in 1967
<START> there are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie although it is a tad predictable drew barrymore does a very good job of being the <UNK> nerd in this film excellent casting choice what i found a bit hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept her in my experience that crowd has a longer memory than that and knowing how awful <UNK> character was <UNK> <UNK> at the start of the school year would have kept them miles away regardless of what rumors her brother drums up and does food really make him all that popular i doubt it as for rooting for <UNK> character to win big as a reporter well i would have hoped she could have come up with a story long before the prom a bit contrived having said all that it was a piece of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you don't expect too much
<START> as a european the movie is a nice <UNK> to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and <UNK> with other <UNK> although the circumstances were slightly different the director went to the new york film school from 1982 85 so one would think that he is drawing on this experience br br it is interesting how the film <UNK> the message that one should not <UNK> with the notion that for every stereotype there is some underlying truth for example the italian character is based more on the <UNK> aspect than on any well known italian stereotype the german character features a few more tried and tested stereotypes but the most stereotypical aspect about the movie is not a character but the central theme of infidelity as a critic observed infidelity is as crucial to french film as class is to british film br br both the main character and his girlfriend are played as not entirely likable which i think is deliberate and great br br it may be unintentional but some of the <UNK> have elements that could be taken as a metaphor for their <UNK> perceived role in the <UNK> the british woman has a <UNK> with an american who is an entertainer like a 1980's us president while the frenchman shows himself as the natural leader when the <UNK> shows up br br although europe is not as diverse as new york it is striking that we see only two non white characters one is a <UNK> woman with <UNK> features who despite appearing the age of our main character is not portrayed as a potential object of interest another is a spanish or rather <UNK> male who appears a bit invented br br one might ask why chose protagonists who were all from long established <UNK> member countries in western europe while these <UNK> reflect what he and i would meet as students in the 1980's i believe exchange programs in contemporary europe are much more diverse the <UNK> program <UNK> some 30 countries from <UNK> to eastern europe many of which are not <UNK> members i do understand however that the choice of <UNK> that are more familiar to the majority of the <UNK> may have been deemed necessary not to distract from the contrast wants to create between the <UNK> europe and the <UNK> europe br br despite minor <UNK> a great movie that made me consider going back to europe to live a french friend of mine also an <UNK> in the us captured our shared feelings in this piece of <UNK> if europe was more like the us i would leave in a <UNK>
<START> italian rip off of <UNK> and the drum is a badly dubbed italian life on the plantation yarn lots of people who don't look like they belong in the american south wear badly <UNK> costumes and wander around locations that look nothing like the american south the plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows the film promises hot steamy sex and lots of twisted violence but nothing ever really comes of any of it its all <UNK> its all probably <UNK> <UNK> i couldn't notice since its artistically <UNK> the final twist is at best laughable a major turkey
<START> one of the great <UNK> of life is that disney is so very successful at everything that they do if they were not we might have more unique little gems of animation such as the curious adventures of mr the story is that an evil king has <UNK> the throne of a place called up and down land i could have the name wrong he is hated by everyone his favorite <UNK> is shooting birds and at some point in the past he presumably killed the wife of mr a bird played with typical flair by peter ustinov leaving him with four young chicks to raise meanwhile we see that another of the evil king's <UNK> is painting he has done three paintings in particular a self portrait a painting of a <UNK> which he has fallen in love with and a painting of <UNK> <UNK> of whom he is jealous one night the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> climb down out of their paintings and run away together the self portrait of the king climbs down out of his frame as well and does away with the real king you think i'm making this up its the real plot and sends the royal police force after the young lovers mr then <UNK> the lovers in attempting to escape the king's forces br br the plot is wonderfully surreal and the setting up and down land is an incredibly imagined place full of <UNK> buildings accessible only by <UNK> its an equal mixture of the worlds of metropolis and 1984 and the drawings of dr seuss br br watch it for a very unique viewing experience that doesn't fit the standard formula for most animated features
<START> i am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes i feel comfortable writing it now because unfortunately i know exactly how this film is going to end br br the premise is simple enough <UNK> dog on the loose in a small town kills people great simple plot for a good fun camp 80s horror br br <UNK> no br br the main problem is this is based on a book stephen king and you can tell that is should not have really been adapted to film at least not with the same plot why <UNK> its boring the first 45 minutes tries to build depth to its main characters and create suspense it however lasts too long half the film the characters are unlikeable and we never care for them anyway and it just about creates zero suspense the <UNK> film according to plot and time to compare this to it the classic jaws everything that jaws does right <UNK> does wrong jaws created good characters and a genuine feeling of dread <UNK> does neither jaws effectively creates a scary creepy villain in its shark <UNK> has a dirty st bernard running about <UNK> and jumping and not a lot else jaws is exciting and unpredictable <UNK> is a <UNK> bore that remains predictable right to the end br br also confusing is the <UNK> of subplots that just act as boring red herrings to the films main plot br br if this film was <UNK> for the big screen and had a better director this could have been good but it wasn't it was a waste of 90 minutes of my life br br people on here are saying this is one of the best king adaptations im sorry you could not be more wrong the <UNK> is a hundred times better thinner is 10 times better and even the one with the cats is twice as good this in my opinion is one of the worst the only good thing was the action scenes with the dog looked real even though they were dull br br films ended now and it didn't get any better avoid
<START> i'm so sorry but i have to tell this film was the most terrible i have ever seen before i thought that it will be a good film after <UNK> what a sell there were nothing interesting in it except the beautiful hungarian women everything might be known forward it's a miracle i didn't sleep <UNK> all i don't understand how might you let make it i'm so sorry but i have to tell this film was the most terrible i have ever seen before i thought that it will be a good film after <UNK> what a sell there were nothing interesting in it except the beautiful hungarian women everything might be known forward it's a miracle i didn't sleep <UNK> all i don't understand how might you let make it
<START> there's a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating considering that it was made in 1953 this is a very courageous movie about <UNK> <UNK> the issue fairly seriously and <UNK> and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject and trying very hard not to stereotype the movie clearly makes the point that <UNK> are not <UNK> and that aside from wearing women's clothing they lead a relatively normal life it deals with the pain of not being accepted in society the plot revolves around a police officer <UNK> <UNK> desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a <UNK> so you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial in the context of 1953 subject br br having said all that i'm also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely dreadful in trying to portray <UNK> <UNK> edward d wood pain the movie falls into silly and at times surprisingly again given the era sensual fantasies that make the story very hard to follow the acting is wooden at best none of the dialogue comes across as real the actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others and worst of all there was no point to having bela lugosi in this movie this was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took on in the latter stages of his career pull the strings pull the strings poor <UNK> character called the spirit in the credits but really coming across as more of a mad scientist kept crying and nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie br br for artistic merit the movie doesn't really deserve much more than 1 10 however for the courage involved in just putting it out i'll give it a 3 10
<START> if you go to the cinema to be entertained amused so as to fill up your time do not go out of your way to watch this film br br if you go to the cinema to appreciate the depths of human kind the feelings of real people to explore the <UNK> of personalities if you go to the cinema to <UNK> magnificent photography be sure to put this film very high on your list preferably in first place the experience is profoundly rewarding causing the intelligent viewer to make diverse over the meaning of life itself with <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> the best he has done to date and even redeemed certain <UNK> in his earlier films which <UNK> a little of being aimed at hollywood this is not the case with this visual poem put to music hollywood could never get anywhere near the effect of this inspired human and <UNK> story br br in no way should one interpret as an <UNK> for <UNK> this story based on the real life of the <UNK> <UNK> is a cry from the bottom of the heart for life and love a reaching out for human compassion for understanding emotions was an <UNK> and intelligent man who after a diving accident off the rocks of the coast as a young man was condemned to live the next 27 years in bed a 2001 tv was the first version of this man's life on which i have already commented however <UNK> has succeeded remarkably at portraying this man with his permanent enigmatic smile and witty sense of humour in an equally <UNK> and intelligent way br br and <UNK> <UNK> rose to the occasion met the challenge head on complete with a accent producing an <UNK> compelling enthralling performance such that the actor and the <UNK> become <UNK> into being the same person on screen here indeed is an occasion to <UNK> your cap and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is driven on in his task by a magnificent cast especially <UNK> lola mabel <UNK> los <UNK> al <UNK> <UNK> and clara and <UNK> accents taking prominent part br br <UNK> produces wonderful dialogues as these six <UNK> among themselves one on one or in groups with excellent chemistry thus <UNK> that this young <UNK> born spanish director is an artist who knows what he is at and how to get his results his global concept of the film includes his own music interspersed with pieces by <UNK> and on record player br br whilst viewing i found myself a couple of times comparing him and this film with stephen and his masterpiece 'the <UNK> i refer to the way in which the dialogues work with <UNK> and passion and that careful sense of timing in each scene br br <UNK> photography is superb as usual as i have mentioned elsewhere on imdb he does not simply film the events and scenes he captures even the feelings and the atmosphere of the moment <UNK> catches that look in the eyes light and shadows such that his work behind the camera is at once another player in the story a superb artist br br is another landmark in the history of spanish cinematography among the best five or six works of art produced here in the last 25 years this film places itself alongside such cinematographic art as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de las <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 'a los <UNK> <UNK> and i think i must add <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br superbly <UNK> story of a real man and those who loved him around his <UNK> not to be missed
<START> while watching a mundane modern movie the runaway bride with my <UNK> age 22 she asked me since you've been watching movies since 1938 what is the greatest movie of your lifetime boy what a choice that is it took me all summer of thought and a some flicks before i made my decision it is the best years of our lives this movie has no flaws it is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story there is not a single part in the film which could be left out the young girl's <UNK> with her brothers lack of hands the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas the portrayal of a young man whose only was as a <UNK> jerk who became the leader of a group of men and was awarded <UNK> for his action a women who must now <UNK> to the husband who's life has been away from her for years the realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf the look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands a parents first look and reaction to their son's new <UNK> a man used to making life and death decision in a instant having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative <UNK> <UNK> structure this is no sympathetic tear <UNK> heart <UNK> act this was real life it could not have been portrayed any different this my friends is how it was this could easily be considered a documentary in this day of color film please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest b w filming editing and directing you will ever see the casting was perfect if i could i would make it <UNK> for anyone taking history film making creative writing <UNK> family or psychology to view and report on this magnificent example of the film makers art
<START> how could this get a 6 0 rating are we as horror fans so used to horror films being so utterly bad these days that when one comes along that has some and i repeat <UNK> redeeming <UNK> we get much too excited and give a rating that is just a wee bit too high the director has a certain visual flair no doubt about that but in between some decent shots he forgot a good story mood or scares it had a very slow first act lazy killing <UNK> annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist and what's with the portrayal of american teenagers in so many of these kinds of films do they always have to be this stupid irritating and so <UNK> superficial i don't remember teens being like this when i grew up here in holland all things considered in can't give this film anything more that a 4 out of 10 rating
<START> my wife and kids is a good and funny series that truly shows the <UNK> and problems that happen the most even in the best families br br michael kyle daddy is a man who is always trying to stop his children from doing <UNK> stuff like <UNK> drinking loving or making love when they do something wrong he is right there to correct them by the way he loves to make bad <UNK> br br janet kyle mother has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband she understands that their children are teenagers and like to do wrong things unlike michael does br br michael kyle is a dumb guy who believes in everything other people say in the beginning of the series he's such a cool guy and tries to be like his father but lately i don't know why he becomes a very very dumb dude and he starts being a <UNK> guy in the end of the series he falls in love with vanessa and becomes a father or should i say a dumb father who does nothing right br br <UNK> kyle is a typical teenagers who loves to party kiss and drink she has many problems with her parents because they <UNK> her <UNK> too much she has a boyfriend called tony who is catholic and is scared of everything so we can't understand what makes she date him i can remember one episode that they're prepared to have sex but michael kyle scares tony claiming that sex is very dangerous and deadly so he decides to guard himself until he's married br br i resume this is the best series of my life and i still watch it everyday after 3 years so i recommend to all of you mostly for teenagers
<START> okay so the movie went straight to video if i had paid to see this i would've been disappointed but at 2 am in the morning alone at night it's a pretty good fright hey that <UNK> br br
<START> film historians have said much about ancient epics that have been the interest of many directors from the beginning of cinema the <UNK> of such epics particularly biblical ones were d w griffith with his mother of all epics <UNK> <UNK> and cecil b demille with his flair for magnificent <UNK> costumes and lavish scenes who can forget his ten <UNK> <UNK> 1956 or the sign of the cross 1932 nevertheless here comes another epic made in the 1950s directed by michael <UNK> and based on the novel by the egyptian michael <UNK> already famous for his great classic casablanca 1941 wonderfully manages to <UNK> his film to the audiences of that time to <UNK> the most important ideas and facts from the thick novel and to recreate the lifestyle of the <UNK> who lived in one of the most amazing periods in the reign of br br the first and most important fact for me in this movie is the psychological development of the main character that edmund <UNK> plays having been brought up in a simple family by his step parents becomes a <UNK> all his life he never stops asking a question why and searching for the answer <UNK> love that he finds in a <UNK> <UNK> leads him to financial and spiritual disaster he has to <UNK> the mistakes by hard work in the house of death and starting to build up his reputation from nothing first he thinks that the only cure is revenge however in the long run he realizes that eye for eye is no solution finally what stands before him in very strange circumstances is the temptation to be a <UNK> nevertheless there is one moment he finds the answer for his questions that touched him throughout his life the story of the main character though based on the book is so interesting psychologically that every open minded person should consider this aspect in the film the main character's psychological struggle is <UNK> by the times he lived in the times when probably for the first time to that <UNK> the power of sword with the power of thought br br <UNK> movie also <UNK> one rule that all films of his era kept to great cast and lavish sets there are mostly british actors and actresses who give very nice performances how is it possible not to mention the <UNK> of ancient epic victor mature this time he is not <UNK> or <UNK> but a fighter a lover at last a <UNK> jean simmons appears in a very delicate role of merit a woman who loved all her life but it was too late when he realized that peter ustinov probably most famous for his gorgeous performance as <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> three years earlier does a great job as friend the <UNK> of the film is also played by two great cast gene tierney and michael <UNK> tierney is excellent as cold <UNK> of power the sister of <UNK> <UNK> gives a marvelous performance as insane when i was in <UNK> in paris and saw original face <UNK> in stone he looked very much the same as the actor in the film <UNK> an actress born in <UNK> is quite memorable as a wicked <UNK> and there is one more actress who appears only in one scene but whom it is hard to forget <UNK> evelyn as <UNK> mother this voice these eyes br br the sets are magnificent the director <UNK> the most <UNK> image of the <UNK> temple of the god that the <UNK> <UNK> to in the reign of iv i also loved the scene of <UNK> first entrance what a glorious picture that forever lasts in one's memory however there is also one aspect that i would like to draw the attention of all people interested to see the film the egyptian is similar to other epics in many respects but it also stands out as a unique film there are very few films which make such a wonderful use of different as for ancient times there is a mention of iron used first by the it's also the only film about ancient egypt which talks openly of magnificent <UNK> abilities it <UNK> shows the <UNK> of <UNK> particularly the moment of a <UNK> death for whom no one cares followed by the <UNK> and consequently the <UNK> mourning after the death of <UNK> finally the egyptian shows one historical fact there were other nations except for jews before christ where the spirit of god <UNK> in some human hearts yet the only difference was that it did not survive that long as at <UNK> because it did not have a strong the scene of death supplies you with so many biblical and christian values that you may think you watch a religious movie br br all things considered i highly recommend michael <UNK> film it is a great production at multiple levels an entertainment for epic fans an admiration of marvelous performances for cinema fans a soul feast for spiritual people finally it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things which happened thirteen centuries before the birth of jesus christ
<START> i saw this only because my 10 <UNK> old was bored he and his friend hated it but of course liked being at the movies this is the first time i've strongly <UNK> with ebert in many years there is not a single thing to recommend this film willis is good as always but the story stinks is unbelievable there is no real story no action no interesting cinematic sequences no surprises and worst of all the child star is a thoroughly repulsive slug guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have a <UNK> fat <UNK> for a kid by all means stay away and spare your child unless you want to <UNK> him or her there is no excuse for such lousy directing or writing and one hopes these filmmakers will suffer <UNK>
<START> this tough to see little picture played at the <UNK> <UNK> 2007 festival it is a wonderful and loving look at harry <UNK> using many famous faces who sit for interviews rarely seen tv performances and behind the scenes footage of <UNK> at work there's even a few shots from son of dracula this movie is the final and fitting tribute to one of the finest voices the most clever <UNK> and the funniest man in popular music it's a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and or performed his friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented hulk with a <UNK> wish for self destruction as a bonus you even get eric <UNK> performing the song with wrote for final album during the closing credits it's funny it's sad it's not in general release if this picture plays anywhere near where you live see it
<START> first of all the title daily is a lie br br every daily show program opens with an on screen visual of the date it was made followed by a pause and the opening <UNK> on the many days when they are re running a daily show they slip cue the tape and <UNK> the date and begin with the opening <UNK> giving the false impression that the show is a new one that's a lie there is no mention of it being a <UNK> and that kind of crap is just a small <UNK> of how <UNK> and <UNK> this show is br br furthermore it's only on 4 nights a week that's not quite daily meaning monday through friday another <UNK> but one i am grateful for br br it's sad to think that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main often only news source this leaves them woefully ignorant and much worse badly br br although it <UNK> liberal left politically this show can be amusing at times however its <UNK> is low facts and information are often cleverly twisted to fit the <UNK> <UNK> it's often hard to tell where the facts leave off and the fiction and comedy writing begin the result is pre <UNK> information designed to <UNK> and influence this is called propaganda br br the remote interviews are heavily in editing br br it really loses me when it <UNK> god and christians which it does all too often however you'll never hear anything vaguely anti <UNK> br br if jon stewart and company attacked anyone but christians it would be considered an offensive outrage the names in the credits explain the source
<START> let us assume for a moment that you haven't <UNK> with the <UNK> and you're wondering about the so called bad experience and just how something like that might play itself <UNK> well go ahead and pop in a fresh copy of the <UNK> see with film you have your clean <UNK> <UNK> and anything else directed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i e the experience from which you never recover sweet movie and el <UNK> and you're bad <UNK> <UNK> a category specifically reserved for a film like the <UNK> which is the sort of content those keen writers at the times who made all the right decisions with their lives and <UNK> from the <UNK> department of english refer to as <UNK> in tone by the third act of this don <UNK> directed movie you may not exactly observe that your two lead heavy hands have become <UNK> and assume all the characteristics of a <UNK> <UNK> nor will you exactly fall under the suspicion that your spine has achieved the same <UNK> shape and <UNK> of a fruit <UNK> tree <UNK> in age but you will feel something br br in 1970 when this film was filmed most americans were looking for an <UNK> for their collective pain a movie like the graduate perhaps a lot of world was going on and of course you had the nightmare break down of war in vietnam what you get with the <UNK> banal drug <UNK> aside is a screenplay adapted from a novel by a guy who at least for the moment wanted to be known as and direction from the director who helped bring about the work and career of sam <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> born in 12 chicago <UNK> less than 45 years after the great fire is showing his attempt at <UNK> with all that contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970's in the form of a classical film <UNK> the <UNK> is an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every aspect the shooting editing direction and story are all fantastic and you're not likely to see anything else like it undoubtedly a sinister film its effects as i've said both <UNK> and frankly it's hard to believe would ever universal attached its name to this picture but you are going to see upon viewing some of the sweet sweet camera moves and cinematographer bruce <UNK> <UNK> every bit of dark myth you harbor in your head about the american plantation south beauty with evil in every location shot clint eastwood needless to say has never been like this old clint he moves at instant from <UNK> to his eyes like two <UNK> in medium close up the rest of the cast is equally <UNK> and uncanny br br this <UNK> will never make the <UNK> 100 in my lifetime but that doesn't stop me from that it's one of the best american <UNK> sound films ever made while most people <UNK> it as a western to include the folks at the western channel the <UNK> is a problem because you don't really know what it is a sort of war movie a drama psychological thriller maybe the answer to all those emotionally <UNK> noir films starring kirk douglas i actually call this piece a horror film because when my old man who likes to kick back with the cheap gratuitous violence projected in <UNK> like the wire saw that high angle medium long shot of <UNK> page <UNK> a around <UNK> bloody leg <UNK> was pretty quick to suggest we watch something else like the <UNK> bowl right before he <UNK> to another room my advice watch this one and make sure it is on a very large screen preferably run on that home theater <UNK> you're <UNK> i would put the <UNK> right on order along with that important <UNK> purchase turn the out throw some cinematic light up on the big blank wall and try not to lose your grip because just like norman bates we all go a little mad sometimes even the <UNK>
<START> series as a whole jim <UNK> best work john hurt is the <UNK> often oscar caliber screenplays not surprising when you consider doing the writing oscar caliber acting always br br everybody loves 'the soldier and death ' but something about pushes it an <UNK> higher in my favor in the first ballroom scene the costumes the music perfection hurt and the dog typically semi interact with the story but this time pushes it up that extra notch in the <UNK> scene between hurt and the chemistry between characters is especially well developed more so than usual in the series in reference to the friendship between and the prince seen it see it again pay more attention to those of you who don't <UNK> adore this 22 minute piece of cinematic perfection never seen it i am so so sorry br br luck child not as sophisticated as but very clever in its own right this is a story about irony irony upon irony within irony i love it every character is acted to perfection with the exception of the <UNK> he was doing drama everyone else was doing romantic comedy i forgive him this is my favorite of the primarily comedic episodes and 'the soldier and <UNK> being examples of more dramatic episodes br br side note greek <UNK> what it lack in subtlety different writer it partially makes up for in <UNK> as it portrays the four chosen <UNK> with more sympathy and respect and history than is usual also check out the jim <UNK> hour if you can get your hands on it for <UNK> it features the man himself introducing the <UNK> the lion from <UNK> bride ' and no annoying opening theme half <UNK> half pure <UNK> muppet wit
<START> this movie caught me by surprise for years i have avoided many of harold <UNK> sound pictures as well as those of keaton because they have a generally well deserved reputation for being lousy compared to the silent films because the basic formula has been lost however when i saw this film i was pleasantly surprised to find i actually liked it once i accepted it really was not a harold lloyd film despite him starring in it this is because although it is nothing like the style of his earlier films it is highly original and lloyd isn't bad playing a totally different type of character br br as i mentioned above the formula of the old films is almost completely missing here lloyd does not do the old familiar stunt work the romance is quite unlike his early screen romances and the plot is just plain weird instead of the usual roles he is the son of a chinese <UNK> who returns to america for the first time since he was a small boy because of this though he looks like an american except for his white suit and helmet he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is chinese in many ways he's very naive about america and is like an innocent among wolves early on he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss this boss always produces a losing candidate for the <UNK> race because he is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a token candidate who has no chance of winning well the old <UNK> who they <UNK> run for office just died and he decides to run the naive lloyd he hasn't a <UNK> of winning well the <UNK> happens and lloyd wins this and <UNK> decision to clean up the town greatly <UNK> the old political machine and they stop at nothing to destroy honest lloyd just when it appears lloyd is headed to jail on a <UNK> up corruption charge he creates a scheme that is 100 impossible and very illegal to get signed <UNK> from the crooks however despite this it is incredibly funny and a great ending so my advice is at the end just suspend disbelief and enjoy br br an important note this movie is definitely not politically correct the word <UNK> is used repeatedly i found it offensive but considering the times i ignored it as you should too if however you are someone who can't and like being angry i suggest you never watch movies anyway as you are bound to become offended again and again
<START> i really liked this picture because it realistically dealt with two people in love and one of them having a disorder though the ending <UNK> me i know that that was the best way for it to finish off i would this to everyone
<START> very well done acting and directing this is a cross between the last don and godfather 2 one large plus for this production is that it is claimed to be a true story of joseph with a better music score to create mood it could have been a rival for both godfather movies
<START> despite its ultra low budget <UNK> <UNK> is the most successful portuguese film of 2004 and i must say a well deserved success what i love about <UNK> <UNK> the most is the intricate detail that <UNK> <UNK> went to keep you interested as to what is going on and just what will happen next it's very detailed and superbly advanced for a seemingly simple love story gone bad thriller what's even more enjoyable and ironic about this is the fact that the characters are in the same situation not one of them knows the entire story and are left to their own <UNK> making <UNK> <UNK> a cut above the rest this is definitely not a film you want to walk out on for a bathroom break as you will undoubtedly miss something important i feel one of the film's major attributes would have to be the environment that it <UNK> it's creepy but hilarious at the same time i read somewhere someone <UNK> this film by saying it's was like watching hitchcock and i couldn't agree more i love movies like that where you have to pay attention to everything in order to fully understand what is going on 9 10
<START> i had long wanted to watch this romantic drama with a wwii setting and now that i have all i can say is that it's a <UNK> masterpiece of russian cinema br br soviet films are known for their <UNK> <UNK> approach but thankfully this one's free of such emphasis with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a <UNK> girl doomed by the <UNK> of war for which he gladly <UNK> but from which he'll never return the girl a remarkable performance from is also loved by the young man's cousin and when she doesn't receive word from her boyfriend gives in to the latter and marries him he however is an aspiring concert <UNK> bitter about the war having <UNK> his chances for success and knowing too that the girl's still devoted to the soldier begins to neglect her finally word reaches the girl of her loved one's death but by the end of the film she has <UNK> to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of him br br the film features some truly amazing camera work which makes extremely <UNK> use of the screen space and by frequently <UNK> tracking <UNK> and high or low angle shots <UNK> great power to the unfolding emotional drama individual sequences are equally impressive two in particular the stunning scene <UNK> edited and <UNK> up to boot in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being <UNK> by a truck and the young man's <UNK> demise in an unfortunate incident at the front undoubtedly one of the best of its kind i've ever watched with the sun moving away from him <UNK> the life that's <UNK> out of his body as he <UNK> the wedding day he'll never have also notable however is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home that's been hopelessly <UNK> during an air raid as is her final violent <UNK> to the concert <UNK> which she tries to resist by repeatedly <UNK> him in the face taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> the <UNK> dvd of this outstanding film is a bare bones affair the <UNK> edition features a few <UNK> but being an <UNK> tends to be heavily <UNK> and hard to track down to boot <UNK> released it in <UNK> with another war themed russian classic <UNK> of a soldier 1959 which my pal at the local dvd rental <UNK> has told me is <UNK> br br the only other film i've watched from this director is the <UNK> epic the red <UNK> 1969 albeit via the much shorter u s release version a star <UNK> international production based on true events given the <UNK> artistic quality of the <UNK> are flying i regret missing out now on his famous documentary i am cuba 1964 a number of times when i was in hollywood late last year apart from receiving a one week theatrical run it was shown more than once on tv accompanied by a feature length making of
<START> well okay maybe not perfect but it was pretty close this movie jumped from crime drama to romantic <UNK> comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end but they did it smoothly and some in the theater found the bloody parts like the scene to be funny as well i just about threw up but i guess that's just me greg <UNK> is perfect as a soap opera actor he has the ability to perform those over dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice <UNK> his scenes with betty seem like something out of <UNK> in seattle or some other romantic comedy like that you almost forget that morgan freeman and chris rock are searching betty down morgan <UNK> fascination with betty was rather creepy considering that he could practically be her grandfather but the scenes where he is <UNK> with her photograph are definitely worth a few laughs chris <UNK> performance seems rather wooden but he has his moments <UNK> <UNK> is so sweet as betty the lovable waitress with the crude <UNK> husband who treats her like dirt it's very unlikely that she would have actually gotten a job at a hospital without any real <UNK> but hey it's a movie just go along with it her roommate <UNK> shines as well as a woman who cares about betty but doesn't quite know how to deal with <UNK> sickness and lastly there is <UNK> glover as a fan of his i naturally thought that the movie could have been funnier had he been in it more no one else has the same style of acting that <UNK> has and the argument between chris rock <UNK> and the sheriff about the soap opera is hilarious i guess i'm saying that i liked this movie quite a bit if you can stomach blood violence and a lot of foul language it's worth the watch and will give you plenty of laughs
<START> the best movie of the 90's the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> right i went into this movie with pretty high expectations and it was all downhill from there br br this movie was supposed to be this <UNK> movie on the drug culture of the early 90's and was going to allow us all to see inside this scene and <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> following the moral panic which followed the death of <UNK> <UNK> in 1995 unfortunately it has fallen a long way short br br where <UNK> was able to treat you like an adult on the subject and potential problems that surround drugs this just provided us with some <UNK> tale of the wonder of drugs and how it can like you know like totally open your mind cue some <UNK> about bill <UNK> and howard marks ad <UNK> it is painfully bad at times i mean the scene at the end between <UNK> and her <UNK> actually made me laugh out loud br br now maybe i am just a <UNK> but the way <UNK> leads us through this tale is like listening to that acid <UNK> guy you once met at a house party who talks to you about how the man is holding us back and how acid has released him from the <UNK> of modern society you just wanna shake some sense into him and ask him to leave the premises br br the script was a real problem for me because where <UNK> had <UNK> excellent book to <UNK> from this is written and directed by justin <UNK> the words jack of all <UNK> master of none come to mind you can see where his inspiration comes from particularly in the style of narration from main character <UNK> which sets the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera and <UNK> what is going through his mind as the scenario plays out the problem with this is that some of the speeches to camera are just painful to watch mainly this comes down to a lack of empathy for <UNK> but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that they just end up sounding like your average a level drama project the direction is fine and the intentions are good but it is so lacking in any integrity that you start to wonder what the hype is about br br saying that though it is not all bad there are moments which are genuinely very amusing and entertaining is the highlight of the movie for me for an independent movie it also managed to attract a high numbers of quality british actors actresses which maybe <UNK> why there was such a buzz about the movie br br best movie of the 90's not by a long shot but if you're looking for a solid sunday night movie then this might just be your bag inevitably though the movie is flawed by the hype that <UNK> it
<START> i love watching a good gory giallo unfortunately <UNK> is definitely not one of them it's long very long the story is tacky and makes very little sense even if it's very obvious the script spends so much time on the killings and the girls but it spends almost no time at all on the killer this leaves a big hole in the story we might get to see a bunch of young women <UNK> together but we get zero characterization of why the killer decided to murder those girls yes what happened to <UNK> is terrible but we still pretty much left in the dark over when why did the boring killer decided that it was worth going through the effort of <UNK> those oh so naughty girls it's all so contrived that i couldn't get into it one bit br br as for the look of the film again boring nothing memorable about it the actors boring the script laughably boring the whole <UNK> love affair between the teacher the blond and the student was really embarrassing what planet are they living on the music boring skip it
<START> at a saturday <UNK> in my home town i went with an older friend he was about 12 and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be ok it's rated g i was <UNK> by loud music strange images no plot and a stubborn <UNK> to make any sense we left halfway through because we were bored frustrated and our ears hurt br br i saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre my opinion had changed it's even worse basically everything i hated about it was still there and the film was very 60s and has dated badly i got all the little in jokes too bad they weren't funny the constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and there's absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on some people will love this i found it frustrating by the end of the film i felt like throwing something heavy at the screen br br also all the <UNK> songs in this movie suck and i do like them br br for ex hippies only or if you're stoned i give this a 1
<START> divorced single mom in <UNK> <UNK> town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to <UNK> into action her <UNK> love life pet project for actress co producer kate <UNK> who gives a warm nicely <UNK> lead performance yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so <UNK> that a faint <UNK> creeps in initially <UNK> helen <UNK> several of her friends reading the love letter to her an interesting visual joke but the first person they do this <UNK> with is ellen <UNK> who doesn't play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick different ideas are <UNK> about in the hopes that one would stick and the continuity is extremely choppy supporting cast including tom <UNK> and tom everett scott who mostly acts with his shirt off is very good but they can't save the final act which is disappointing low <UNK> in a quirky pleasant way but it is <UNK> good natured nothing more 1 2 from
<START> you can't really call roy prolific 6 films in <UNK> years nor can you <UNK> him of being conventional he doesn't do <UNK> at least when it comes to narrative you the living his first film in seven years is like a surreal documentary in which a large number of characters are observed doing nothing very much and if that sounds off putting let me assure you it isn't this is a funny accessible and surprisingly warm hearted movie a slice of life far removed from that which we normally see on the screen br br of course of <UNK> is hardly the proper <UNK> to apply to this movie since most people's lives are unlikely to be anything like this the incidents on the screen run the gamut from the almost <UNK> ordinary to the downright wacky and while characters may <UNK> by sometimes never to be seen again others to <UNK> as if anxious for <UNK> on them all a kind of <UNK> affection that and some <UNK> music ensure the time we spend with them is time well spent
<START> just watched this film and it actually made me want to write my first comment on imdb com even though i've been a user for more than 9 years the reason that i watched this is because i like splatter films and sometimes i like to test my limits and see what actually still shocks me first of all the gore in this film didn't shock me not even the idea that someone came up with this and made it into a film what really shocked me is that there seems to be a market for this kind of crap don't get me wrong i'm all against censorship but this film seems to me like it was made for some kind of fetish crowd that seems to get off on this type of sh t it didn't give you that same kind of disgust and guilt that one felt after watching films like august underground that film is terrible to watch but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting violence is in the case of it seems like it was made strictly to <UNK> people i prefer films that shock because they are well done and thought through like <UNK> <UNK> films or takashi miike's or funny games or man bites dog those films will stick with you for a while this film i will have forgotten by tomorrow and the only thing that will stick with me is the thought that somewhere out there there are people getting <UNK> by watching this sh t if you read this please check yourself into the next hospital or shoot yourself this of course does not apply to gore <UNK> who just love splatter you're cool peace
<START> when i went to the video rental shop to get a movie i saw this one and i immediately thought it would be funny the picture made it seem like a classic comedy type involving teenagers such as road trip which i thought would be worth watching when i turned the move on i was disappointed as the jokes were awful and cheesy the only bit which the director may have thought would be funny was somebody <UNK> over on a wet floor this is not a joke and would not make people laugh i actually considered turning this movie off coming to half way through i was annoyed with this movie as it was just a waste of time and money renting it out not enough care was taken making this film and not enough time and work put into it i found the acting to be quite bad as well the only time i laughed was at the extremely bad actions done which were really not funny i rate this film a 1 10 i hope you found this comment useful
<START> in yet another miserable attempt to make a quick hollywood cash in of one of <UNK> greatest masterpieces peter segal has created a monster taken out of context if one did not know <UNK> work before viewing the movie would be a lame big budget film that isn't sure if it wants to be fat joke and stupid comedy or just an ordinary action film with nothing to move on however as a young generation who just recently spent two months <UNK> over the five seasons of get smart the 60's tv show this movie <UNK> me from the moment i entered and saw steve carell <UNK> down the part the <UNK> agent 99 getting plastic surgery and <UNK> as an <UNK> who was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring of them it seems the screenwriters unable to be <UNK> funny in both dialogue and situation fell back on lame set ups for don adams famous lines flashbacks to fat camp references to <UNK> part in the office in the interview style camera angles they have and a female <UNK> that falls flat on its face br br for those who have seen the original the writers of this movie thought they'd include some memories they mention <UNK> <UNK> now a worthless tiny <UNK> dog that carell <UNK> the shoe phone the <UNK> of silence and his classic red car and the doors and phone that the show the classic music is back but now everything is updated generally for the worse <UNK> of silence is now some weird blue <UNK> force field control <UNK> are right under a museum that <UNK> past the movie lacks any creative random tech and <UNK> it with <UNK> in swiss army knives lots of the humor in the movie is <UNK> hurting himself or another character being hurt whether it be <UNK> spending two minutes shooting himself accidentally with the <UNK> or getting <UNK> by security guards or throwing up in <UNK> in the original smart would insult a big <UNK> attack him with no success and try to buddy up with him before getting <UNK> in this one he attacks without success and gets <UNK> it seems the screenwriters didn't understand the humor was established with the dialogue and not the pointless violence it's like they took the names from the show and cut out all that made it good in the first place br br the poster hides <UNK> face beyond that of the movie likewise <UNK> away from anything that could make it good they <UNK> the classic music with the over dramatic action and romantic music in big budget films whereas the original fed off a campy feel this one <UNK> quality with massive doses of cgi explosions and <UNK> sound effects i was really looking forward to this as i finished the original series just two months ago and it <UNK> in my top five shows of all time however this was a massive disappointment the credits say they <UNK> with mel brooks and buck henry but in all the things i've read on the internet they were largely left out of the writing process in conclusion if you want to waste your money on a cash in with little value and no respect to its <UNK> go for it but be prepared that the ride is not how you remembered it br br ps i almost forgot the george bush humor they mention falling asleep at fine art <UNK> working for their vice <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> over solving real problems if you're into hearing the same jokes you heard 3 4 years ago in big budget movie form chuck your money here
<START> don't get me wrong the guy's a success <UNK> but he got to the top by selling <UNK> plastic toys to <UNK> <UNK> so i get a little <UNK> when he looks at comic book fans as an <UNK> of that same market br br see the <UNK> iron man wouldn't be bad if it were <UNK> on a saturday morning and <UNK> exclusively toward children but it's not directed exclusively at children <UNK> characters are killed every five minutes and there's enough bloodshed and semi nude bodies to make network censors <UNK> so it isn't quite cut out for children's television br br so what audience is this video aiming for then it's the audience that enjoys <UNK> <UNK> story lines about <UNK> a <UNK> chinese emperor with 5 <UNK> rings that's who and i think that audience is small br br a lot of great writers have passed through <UNK> over the decades so it's a shame that marvel would risk their <UNK> animation <UNK> on so many questionable <UNK> and <UNK> who like mr are better <UNK> to action figures during saturday morning cartoons how many <UNK> <UNK> do marvel have to endure before they come up with a better <UNK> br br br br animation just passable <UNK> some segments are better than others a low budget look all throughout this ain't no bakshi ralph and it ain't no <UNK> don cg <UNK> okay but far from impressive br br story a <UNK> of clichés all over the place convoluted contrived and uninspired br br characters so why is <UNK> even here if all he does is add to sexual ambiguity hmmm her <UNK> in a wheelchair tony misses his mom asian chicks are hot and apparently little else the female lead is thoroughly <UNK> by the end br br performances can't blame competent voice actors for a bad script br br art very western <UNK> very clean lines faces are very derivative of eastern art very boring <UNK> very bland cg br br conclusion not great but worth a watch for the fans and those who enjoy superhero <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> a valuable what not to do course for junior animators
<START> astounding that something like this could find its way to be viewed by the public i knew it was by uwe boll i found it in the bargain bin at a store for 2 still pretty <UNK> considering but morbid curiosity led me to view this and br br 1 i am fairly sure this is a rip off of seven silence of the <UNK> and american psycho all rolled into one with dialog that may have been written by <UNK> br br 2 casper van <UNK> plays the main character and he's so absolutely bizarre and creepy that just about anyone would know he must be the crazed serial killer br br 3 jennifer <UNK> plays the good cop that invites a serial killer to her apartment for a home <UNK> dinner and what does she get for her trouble i'll let you guess br br 4 michael <UNK> plays an intense cop who drives a <UNK> bug new style that is with a <UNK> on it a <UNK> bug that'll strike fear into <UNK> hearts when they see that coming br br 5 van <UNK> breaks up with his fiancé but she still has an not engaged party complete with not a wedding cake imagine everyone's surprise he shows up he was of course invited and they all get shot br br 6 actually this should have been 1 really the killer in this is known as the monkey maker this is without a doubt the stupidest killer name anyone could have come up with in a million years presumably it has something to do with the see no evil hear no evil speak no evil saying complete with monkeys it's possible that monkeys had something to do with the script too br br 7 oh yeah and there's a club that van <UNK> visits near the beginning of the film there's bad disco music i mean really bad and a chain link <UNK> cage with uh gang members beating the crap out of each other with baseball bats that's what it looked like and of course this is only the tip of the iceberg the really cool stuff goes on in the basement where some questionable actor talks some woman into <UNK> a confession before she gets shot this being i guess a snuff movie not quite sure how this fits in with the rest of the film and boll probably wasn't either so if he wasn't worried then i won't worry br br an incredible piece of non entertainment that will make you feel like you're watching something from a parallel universe a parallel universe that's kind of like <UNK> but where things are just enough off where they don't seem right you have entered the boll zone exit as quickly as possible don't look back br br 2 out of 10
<START> an art student in rome is possessed or something she has dreams of being nailed to a cross and satan himself <UNK> her he possesses her i think and turns her into a sex addict that's about all i could take and i turned it off br br a pointless exorcist rip off i caught this on cable back in the 80s and was horrified and not in a good way this movie is supposed to be a horror film but turns into nothing more than a sex film disguised as a horror movie there's tons of pointless female nudity and the actress playing the lead has to <UNK> herself more than once we see her being raped by satan a hot looking guy <UNK> coming on to her own father gotta give her points for bravery add to that bad dubbing editing the rape scene looks like it was cut a bit lousy acting and a story that makes next to no sense the one disturbing sequence her being nailed to the cross almost works but the lousy special effects ruin it this is one of the few horror film that was so bad i stopped watching skip it
<START> corny and some really bad acting but for a <UNK> <UNK> film about right on par saw this movie back in 1985 mostly because i liked sword and <UNK> films what was i thinking arnold is in it playing a high lord trying to make sure an ancient <UNK> is destroyed before it blows up the world <UNK> <UNK> is the title character who at the time was <UNK> girl and a pretty bad actress movie producers like to cast playboy type women who cant act in low budget b movies <UNK> <UNK> it up as <UNK> and arnold acts wooden as lord there is also bergman who was in the original conan movie as <UNK> here she plays the evil queen an obvious camp to her conan role and then one of the most irritating child actors <UNK> ernie <UNK> as prince who should have been slapped hard and sent to bed what a little irritating some of the <UNK> <UNK> too bad but the music really sucks special effects are cheap and look very 70's like the explosion of the evil <UNK> castle at the climax of the movie br br overall a very low par film but b movie film buffs might like it for its <UNK>
<START> a few <UNK> ago i remember reading an <UNK> by a feminist film <UNK> who briefly mentioned <UNK> russell this <UNK> wrote that the of the <UNK> that r played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man even when he wasn't worth it br br i thought of this <UNK> after watching <UNK> of br br kathleen turner exudes the same strength and style as russell in her portrayal of prostitute china blue she's the object of affection for two men the loony priest played by anthony <UNK> and a bland <UNK> boy who's marriage is slowly <UNK> and she won't let either of them have a piece of her until br br i won't give away the ending but i will say that this is ultimately bland <UNK> boy's fantasy no matter how hard ken russell tries he can't disguise the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the mtv generation except its class and gender politics make those old black and white films look revolutionary by comparison
<START> i can't even begin to imagine why everyone hates this movie so much it had me literally crying with laughter several times i trust you slept well actually we had a bit of a rough night ah the <UNK> of adultery br br admittedly the ending is a little flat but still has its moments the <UNK> <UNK> obvious fake as flew into the ocean beach house <UNK> br br personally i think this is the funniest movie i've ever seen br br 10 10
<START> this is bad movie there is no denying it as much as i'd like to tommy lee jones is about as good as he possible can be with the script they gave him and he had a couple of decent action sequences that felt really out of place due to their acceptable quality br br somewhere along the line someone figured that all of the shortcomings of script could be if they were to hire every single <UNK> actor in the business unfortunately even truly deeply talented actors like goodman beatty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> macdonald <UNK> taylor vince and <UNK> we forget mr jones himself can't fix the wooden dialogue and plot progression that went absolutely nowhere br br in fact at one point i looked up sure that the movie had been running for the past 2 hours only to find that i was <UNK> minutes into it br br perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot about the ghost <UNK> soldiers that seem to be of little to no help to the story other than slightly <UNK> from the confusing business at the end with the picture if you haven't seen this movie disregard this past statement which may seem <UNK> and know that it is not you will not understand it any better after having watched the movie br br the most interesting thing about this movie may be that it is actually a sequel to the movie <UNK> prisoners starring alec baldwin in the same role carried by tommy lee jones in this movie i may have to watch it now first to see if it is as bad as in the electric <UNK> and second because i can't seem to no matter how hard i try break my man crush on alec baldwin
<START> i would say that this film is disturbing the brutality is depicted in a very sick way it's like a <UNK> in 40 minutes in the same time it is a cruel <UNK> in human behavior the scenes are <UNK> starting with the <UNK> of the horse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen every emotion is exploited to extreme the frustration of the butcher the love for his daughter almost incestuous the rage when he finds out she has been abused every feeling is so natural and so wrong this film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way the message of the film is that one's life can change in a second as a consequence of one's behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the most powerful and can determine one's acting i'd loved the unique manner of filming the simplicity and the brutality accompanied with the silence in which only inner thoughts pierce through
<START> universal studios version of <UNK> 1996 is a great heartwarming film for the entire family with good values and sentimentality it is the story of sandy a teenager from chicago who reluctantly spends his vacation with his uncle porter in the <UNK> this ultimately changes the teenagers life and he grows up in the process he learns to appreciate nature and to have a respect for the environment i grew up in the 1960's and the nbc television show <UNK> was my favorite childhood show <UNK> wood is perfectly cast as a 1990's sandy and gives an excellent performance as much as i liked the nbc television show and mgm theatrical feature films with luke <UNK> as sandy in the 1960's i liked this feature the best i feel <UNK> wood is the best sandy with respect to luke <UNK> i feel <UNK> wood has more of a range of acting talent and <UNK> more as an actor which makes his performance excellent and more believable i think <UNK> wood is the best young actor working today in films director alan <UNK> also wrote the screenplay and has done an excellent job as both writer and director of this film paul hogan gives a comical and likable performance as <UNK> uncle porter mr <UNK> performance perfectly <UNK> role as sandy i am a big fan of underwater films this film was beautifully shot in the <UNK> like <UNK> 1965 <UNK> was the director of photography was bill butler a s c who <UNK> the film jaws in 1975 mr butler is a very talented cinematographer the underwater director of photography was pete <UNK> he did a superb job with the underwater cinematography i enjoyed the film score by joel this good film score featured crosby stills and <UNK> among other talented artists this motion picture was shot in <UNK> like <UNK> in the aspect ratio of 2 35 1 if possible try to see this film in a scope version as originally framed and by alan <UNK> and bill butler another very nice thing is that mr <UNK> gave the original sandy luke <UNK> a small part in this remake he portrayed bounty <UNK> 3 in this film this was a very kind gesture on mr <UNK> part as you can tell i am a real true fan of this film sadly this beautiful film was met with harsh words by the majority of movie critics i originally saw this movie on my birthday may <UNK> of 1996 in a movie theater it meant a lot to me i have it on numerous video versions the vhs versions are in pan and <UNK> the <UNK> version is <UNK> 2 35 1 i even have a <UNK> in 2 35 1 from hong kong which is <UNK> but my most <UNK> possession is an original <UNK> theatrical feature print which i will treasure for the rest of my life thank you mr <UNK> <UNK> wood paul hogan and everyone involved for making this a memorable movie for me to enjoy br br p s i must add that the quality of the universal dvd is superb it is the best dvd as far as quality i have ever seen the color and resolution is spectacular the soundtrack is great i think universal must have used the same transfer for the dvd that they did for the <UNK> version the <UNK> scope print is <UNK> and <UNK> film really has a wonderful look to it a great tribute to a wonderful film the dvd's resolution is even superior to the <UNK> quality it's just spectacular thank you universal home video for the great quality control and transfer many <UNK> for doing a superb job on this wonderful family film also many <UNK> to you alan for all your extreme kindness to me it's a real honor to know you review <UNK> updated june 27 2005
<START> as a <UNK> student this movie depicts the ignorance of hollywood in the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house it is less then a foot from <UNK> which has an average <UNK> of 1 <UNK> degrees <UNK> this stupidity is witnessed again when stan goes to save subway 4 his shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing <UNK> and to finish off this monstrosity of a film they come up with the most illogical solution stopping a <UNK> flow with <UNK> k <UNK> earlier in the film a <UNK> voice can be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow fire fighters have tried cars and <UNK> common sense <UNK> this film is a preposterous and gross understatement of human knowledge
<START> star rating jodie <UNK> michelle <UNK> <UNK> rodney <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> banks steven seagal not quite as bad an actor as kevin <UNK> but you get it is a modern day robin hood listen close you can hear brian adams music playing in the background no not really the kind of guy who steals ill gotten blood money from drug dealers and uses it to keep run down <UNK> open but now he's been approached to drive a <UNK> van in a heist from las vegas in one of those last things before retirement type jobs but of course it all goes wrong and he winds up the <UNK> for the big guys at the top and in jail here he meets a guy named although you wouldn't know it from paying attention to the movie ice cool who he forms a friendship with and ends up breaking out of jail with once free he's out to prove his innocence locate the missing money and naturally get even with those who framed him br br of all <UNK> recent straight to video films today you die has that look about it most of all that it belongs in a cinema even with a rap star as his co star like his previous cinema films half past dead and exit wounds yes it seems when he's not making films about looking after the environment he's pretending to be black and co starring with <UNK> but is not a cinema film and that's a luxury the great one is never going to be enjoying again until under siege 3 <UNK> if ever br br the film opens with a slick polished look that <UNK> attention but it all quickly goes down hill from there once seagal hits prison the plot quickly loses it's <UNK> indeed character just seems to pop up out of nowhere without any introduction as his sidekick and from there you quickly lose interest in it br br that's it i know i've said it before but i think i mean it this time i don't think i'm going to be giving any more of these straight to video seagal films any time i honestly have no enthusiasm to watching shadow man at all in fact i can honestly say that i've not really enjoyed any of his <UNK> films up to this point and today you die is certainly no exception an <UNK> boring effort all round best avoided by all
<START> this series continues to <UNK> and annoy how are they going to drag this out for another year each episode offers up more and more questions whilst providing the answers to very few to quote another very popular website i believe that this show has now jumped the shark br br will i keep watching it br br probably br br will they manage to keep the show on air till it ends br br probably not br br how did two <UNK> doctors fail to notice that <UNK> was still alive how did 30 plus people not notice a corpse wake up and walk off with a knife still in her back how did someone have enough strength to create two <UNK> and climb up a tree to <UNK> kate br br we've now introduced a <UNK> br br same time next week yep
<START> having seen and loved this film in australia i was very keen to get me <UNK> on a copy i got one on dvd back in the uk only to find that it's a very different edit br br the domestic edit i saw is the uk and i presume european edits spends a lot longer on the narrator played by <UNK> dead brother and in truth that and few other points to no real benefit br br it is not a serious criticism but the oz edit is just and i think more assured br br i can't say why they felt it needed <UNK> for the overseas market br br so careful about which one you go for br br i went for both
<START> wow my mom bought me this movie because it was on sale really cheap in some store in my town and she knows i love scary movies first i looked at the cover and <UNK> thinking that it was some ordinary b movie trying to be scary i was so wrong i made the great big mistake watching it alone my parents and my brother was asleep and it was really late after i seen the movie i was so scared i was shaking i didn't even dare to go up and take the <UNK> out of the vcr i slept with the lights on br br this movies main story is about some teenagers who drives off the road and have to spend the night in the woods telling scary stories the first story is really scary and it makes you hug a <UNK> really hard if you watch it alone the second story is scary too but not in the same way as the first one the third story my favorite is really really creepy it scared me most of all stories it is about a guy who is driving around the country on a motorcycle one night when there's a storm outside he goes to the closest house and knocks on the door a girl opens and she is mute don't wanna tell you more but you will get chills when you watch it i might add that my were really <UNK> when i watched it <UNK> tales ' main story has a really interesting and surprising ending i know some guys said it sucked but me my boyfriend and my friends loved it and it was a long time since we got that scared rating 10 10 oh by the way it is not like urban legend at all it is so much scarier
<START> chuck <UNK> the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy is often considered to be the best of the three while i find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons i would have to <UNK> that is the most finely <UNK> script here the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and <UNK> run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of <UNK> and <UNK> on routine as a long term <UNK> fan i have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently <UNK> who gets all the best lines the famous <UNK> trouble being one of the all time classics and does most of the work bugs plays the role of cool <UNK> while elmer as always is the <UNK> <UNK> part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that <UNK> and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old <UNK> who comes off worst being shot in the face again and again his <UNK> ending up in more and more ridiculous positions it all builds to the inevitable climactic <UNK> you're despicable as intricate an example of chuck <UNK> impeccable timing as you'll come across is a true classic
<START> <UNK> blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people br br it's editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen br br the music really tied into the story which made the characters come to life the editing made the story more <UNK> and captivating br br i was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast most notably s br br i can't wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer <UNK> <UNK> hudson
<START> imagine that <UNK> episode where friday and gannon go into a typical 1970 <UNK> of hippie <UNK> but instead of giving everyone a lecture they get some that's joe in a nutshell br br this film of a working class <UNK> and a rich guy who's just killed his <UNK> drug dealer boyfriend has dated terribly and most of the supporting acting is stilted but it's still interesting to watch peter boyle then about 35 plays joe the <UNK> and he looks like james gandolfini in her film debut susan sarandon plays the <UNK> eyed daughter and while she doesn't necessarily hint at her future greatness you can't take your eyes off her
<START> a buddy and i went to see this movie when it came out in 1980 it was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place it lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it it was so bad that we laughed all the way through it since that time we rate movies based on kill or be killed as the worst movie of all time like other reviewers have mentioned it is so bad that it is funny it isn't worth a second look that's for sure i just can't bring myself to give it more than a 1 because i don't think the makers of the movie intended for it to be so bad and i can't give credit for an accident sorry
<START> i grew up in the 90s therefore you must understand that i witnessed <UNK> the <UNK> of the greatest i was there when brink appeared <UNK> johnny <UNK> etc these movies <UNK> my childhood when these movies came on not only myself but whoever i was watching them with would stand completely in awe for <UNK> talk about it for the week to come and catch it again the next weekend i don't think words could express the amount of excitement disney brought br br even when i watch them now the dialog doesn't seem that bad so effective in fact that i actually remember parts of conversations literally word per word from movies i saw over ten years ago the characters are believable funny granted a little stereotypical but that's what makes disney's charm br br i sat my little brother down in front of the disney channel to try and convey and make him understand my feelings for enter stuck in the <UNK> my brother looked at me slightly puzzled asking me if i had always been gay i feel more disappointed and betrayed now than what could i compare this to when han solo found out <UNK> sold him out to vader br br half the movie and i'm not <UNK> is flashbacks there is no talent in these young actors some of which are older than i am whatsoever the plot is ridiculous it feels like a bunch of old rotting corporate people over at disney sat around a table and asked themselves how can we seem hip to these youngsters ok maybe all the were like that but they at least made a little effort to not let us realize they think we're complete idiots br br and apparently this type of movie works stuck in the <UNK> is rated almost as much as <UNK> or <UNK> how is this possible got even <UNK> and people prefer them now though apparently the lack of curse words is enough to give it 10 10 for some people christ it's a completely different generation
<START> there are movies that are just a different version of another one not remakes but just similar to others it is not although it talks about mafia it is watched in another way and often it seems just a secondary theme i went to watch that movie for case because the theatre was full and i was satisfied at the end it surprised me because of its black irony or cynicism and there are more and more interesting items to analyze it doesn't follow the classical ways of movies it is just different and i think not to be the only one to like that i am very happy also because it is italian and i was afraid that italian directors and producers were not enough brave to change themes in this movie you can watch new italian style as well but is not <UNK> into clichés i hope to be understandable enough i know it is difficult i hope also that this movie can be <UNK> out of our <UNK> it is a good product to <UNK> i want to point out also the music very good soundtrack the movie needs it because of its long silent pause and they are covered perfectly by that music many <UNK> to the director and thank you cinema needs these movies
<START> this is an excellent film the <UNK> scenes were well done it was also the right balance of war and love the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been <UNK> by so many to so few
<START> spoilers to understand what really happened first you have to be a warrior to stay alive in real war to think off line <UNK> and not linear otherwise you will come to false conclusions that gray was dumb or unstable person truth is something completely different he was firm hardened veteran and only way he could be killed by capt is that he wants her to kill him it was his way out he choose it he was not man who will <UNK> if you've never been on a first line you can't understand it he intentionally prepare his own suicide first he <UNK> mary jane than intentionally acted as a dumb than argue <UNK> incident before witnesses to protect her later after she done what he wants her to do if it comes to trial than gave her son a bullets to assure he could load her gun later came that night loaded her gun woke her up put her gun in her hands acted as he was attacking her after shot first time he raised knife and cried one kill so she shot him again and before died he put knife off like he was trying to took him back again after first shot he also gave her a message with his last cry after first kill everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life this is the the only way for me to die as a man yet to be killed by somebody i love is my choice and my only war and army is not what you thought so far grow up finally and save your life till you can she left military life at the end she did understand him and he did not die in vain the man who helped him to prepare all that and after to carry out the trial and the outcome of that trial was <UNK> sam <UNK> with help of lt tim macy macy didn't know what is really going on and what will be the outcome but did what he was expected to do he took photos of mary jane and gray by order of <UNK> sam <UNK> who gave that order because gray asked him to do that after she refused to leave army what <UNK> <UNK> asked her to do <UNK> <UNK> convinced <UNK> to charge her with a <UNK> murder he knew she cant be found instead of <UNK> there was some possibility to be found with taken photos <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> argue <UNK> incident to <UNK> to prevent <UNK> to have any doubt about <UNK> murder charge but let it be revealed during the trial what greatly influenced the jury i have no doubt about outcome of that trial why <UNK> <UNK> did that way because he will do anything gray ask him to do why because he saved his life on a battlefield why mary jane choose to go to trial because she was a person who have integrity a principles and that is why gray choose her it has to be somebody deserving somebody <UNK> keeping his secret about what really happened that night she also prove her honour br br
<START> <UNK> as the title of the movie is in germany is a another attempt to show one of the most interesting roman <UNK> better known as <UNK> although this attempt at least tried to show a more historic accurate <UNK> than the amusing but completely <UNK> <UNK> peter ustinov played in <UNK> <UNK> it still is a major failure and to those imdb <UNK> who still believe that and propaganda is true please read a book about <UNK> that was published less than 20 years ago <UNK> did not burn rome this is proved he did not murder he did not torture kill and for pleasure he was the first emperor who banned the gladiator fights the movie still shows a lot of mistakes errors and is by the way made in a really cheap style especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing the palace looking like some villa the city itself looked like well like a cheap set the acting was between good and sub par the music nearly insignificant and the movie soon <UNK> after <UNK> became emperor to a rushed bad edited mess without any clear narrative structure so there still is the potential for an epic biography of <UNK> that shows the true <UNK> who was one of the best who ruled rome despite the lies of et al
<START> with a 500 budget and a bottle of <UNK> br br if you are a fan of c movies with no talented actors whatsoever a ridiculous story cheap effects and lousy camera work this film delivers br br all others be warned you could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder br br the film is good for some laughs though watch it with some friends and discuss how not to make a movie br br 2 10 for unintentional comedy br br why the hell do you have to write 10 lines i have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler
<START> one night at is a very funny movie that is more intelligent than what it should be its form is more sophisticated than what i expected and its <UNK> was superb the thoughts behind the movie <UNK> stupid men are are <UNK> that's what i have to say about this movie is that not only does it hate women but it <UNK> men it doesn't have any sympathy for any of the men really it seems that way because of the form but the ending says it all nobody cares br br the form has the first 2 3 of the movie told in flashback by three characters dillon the stupid bartender reiser the stupid lawyer and goodman the stupid <UNK> than <UNK> cop the story is therefore always perverted by their own self images and altered realities <UNK> <UNK> fantasy is a great touch in the end we never really know the truth and nothing is what it seems dillon was never that innocent etc br br actually the rest of the movie is funny too from the <UNK> of the last 5 seconds of the movie to the overly <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> the movie seems to have an energy all its own everything is just out of the blue and nothing seems to make sense do we really care if it does no br br it is also a very dark comedy but has a shallow presentation think nurse betty or <UNK> very candy <UNK> outside dark <UNK> inside if you like your movies random dark or just purely mean see this movie this one will satisfy your <UNK> for the <UNK> that is one night at br br 8 10
<START> this movie is not what it appears to be clint eastwood is not dirty harry or a cowboy here the movie's appeal comes from its careful manipulation of atmosphere and theme it's a gothic tale set in the civil war and as such all the film's action or lack thereof takes place inside a house populated by southern <UNK> of all ages and <UNK> br br the horror comes from viewing the whole story through the eyes of the clint eastwood character seeing him stranded in the house and held captive by the women is a very <UNK> experience indeed and who is <UNK> here exactly are the women <UNK> by eastwood's incredible looks are we the viewers <UNK> by both his sexual <UNK> and the potential <UNK> <UNK> it <UNK> or does <UNK> refer to what the director does here holds us enthralled for a short space only to maybe let us go don <UNK> does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing films i had the pleasure of watching
<START> had it not been for to kill a <UNK> this movie would be much more famous had it not been for gregory peck as <UNK> the acting here would be much more <UNK> had it not been for william <UNK> perhaps to kill a <UNK> might never have been written in his shadow br br i found this movie to be sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies to kill a <UNK> may not have been as original as i'd always thought it was perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie oh the <UNK> is different but the underlying story a lone righteous white attorney against a white southern town defending a black man is all too familiar and written by a woman <UNK> concentrates on rape the ultimate betrayal to a woman while this movie concentrates on brother against brother hatred the rape a man feels by <UNK> betrayal br br there's not the depth of <UNK> here not the comfort that brings with his presence so you're just left with the sadness that whether she intended to lift the plot from this movie or not <UNK> lee's <UNK> reflects nothing changed in that 10 or so years since the time she may have read book and saw his movie while in college in <UNK> and <UNK> or not took most of it as her own in later years nothing changed in race relations and some may say nothing has changed even now these many years later br br it's all too sadly familiar and one wishes there were an of our day to make it all right where <UNK> leaves you with hope of that <UNK> in the arms of and waiting for a morning of better times this movie leaves you just sad that pride from black people might equal or better the pride of white people but pride from either is no answer at all br br rather it's the answer of we need comfort that we are all flawed and that in our <UNK> we should have mercy not pride when facing each other in our differences
<START> what we have here is a film perfect for anyone that <UNK> in the world of post those who sit in their home <UNK> money by buying and selling sensual less and <UNK> a system that values little other than the <UNK> of self br br the beautiful filming i always appreciate fix and soft boxes makes it an even stranger place to travel through both enjoyable to look at but frightening to comprehend perhaps that's overly dramatic but its true br br journey through his hell is <UNK> tragic his quest is honorable <UNK> and precious the conclusion is necessary and we are left not sure if he's better off which is the perfect conclusion br br highly recommended to all people who view their world with a critical eye and especially to those who don't perhaps it will encourage a reflection or two
<START> this is a great dark offbeat little film a modern day adaptation of the quest for the holy grail myth it's a sleeper if there ever was one i saw it on cable some years ago and taped it i've <UNK> it to many of my friends and everyone loved it
<START> in the late eighties and early nineties the decline and death of independent video companies like <UNK> and media effectively shut off italian horror films for much of it's american audience <UNK> italian genre films also <UNK> in quality and <UNK> br br occasionally movies like primal rage sequels like beyond the door iii <UNK> 2 and a few <UNK> <UNK> films <UNK> out onto video but most remained <UNK> until dvd in the us for nearly a decade or longer movies from these lost years became very sought after and talked about among horror fans br br of these films cat in the brain is probably one of the most hyped of all due to the <UNK> of lucio fulci fans and the fact that it was not only directed by but also starred their idol fulci himself br br though not quite <UNK> best it's still better than most of his later efforts his <UNK> fan base will probably love it italian horror and giallo <UNK> might also enjoy it depending on their tastes but i'm not sure about anyone else people who only watch hollywood stuff might not want to take the word of the many glowing reviews here br br one thing i personally found fascinating were the scenes featuring probably <UNK> <UNK> only lasting contribution to italy <UNK> studios the name is instantly recognizable to any fan of italian movies until i saw it here i could only imagine what it looked like
<START> happy <UNK> birthday to valley girl great soundtrack plausible story wonderful performances captures the spirit of the 80's the <UNK> of the and the <UNK> a wonderful rendition of high school life and gritty downtown from a suburban perspective br br the soundtrack contains songs by modern english <UNK> <UNK> sparks <UNK> <UNK> the the psychedelic <UNK> men at work the <UNK> and br br this movie truly is romeo and juliet minus the double suicide set in 1980's los angeles <UNK> dad played by <UNK> forrest sonny <UNK> anyone is hysterical as a hippie idealistic dad who wonders how he <UNK> such a <UNK> <UNK> yet he doesn't judge ya dig
<START> richard gere and diane lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending i get really angry about lets just say its not my cup of tea just like the dime store romances are not my cup of tea br br the plot has a doctor stopping at an <UNK> and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with he goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life br br well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line this is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women <UNK> and the men shake their head in disbelief i wouldn't be so <UNK> to the film as a mindless romance except that the film takes a turn in the final reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this it really ruined it for me br br if you like romance give it a shot though wait for cable
<START> wow i just saw demon wind a little while ago and i don't think i'll ever be the same it has the power to inspire nightmares but for all the wrong reasons actually br br never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make up for no damn reason or similarly so much bad zombie makeup that makes you hungry for those halloween green <UNK> br br or so much naked old lady for that matter but then there was the shining br br the plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm as does the dialog the last shot of the film is just so silly that its beyond description it's like some drunk college student got together with some pals and decided to throw bruce willis type dialog together with i guess <UNK> dialog from some elm street film the result is jarring and it'd be truly funny if it was intended that way br br ah what the hey i'll laugh anyway br br hell get together with your friends and watch this but make absolutely sure you're drunk first or you may go insane particularly if you're a college film student br br cheers
<START> i saw this version of hamlet on television many years ago and have seen every other version since whether television or movie however this is the one that remains the <UNK> depiction of the story for me most excellent derek <UNK> made hamlet real for me before i saw this version shakespeare was simply <UNK> to me and i never tried to understand the <UNK> english having seen <UNK> hamlet several times not only <UNK> my knowledge of literature but also that of my family i promptly checked the play out of library and read it and <UNK> over the accompanying recording <UNK> rendition attracted me to a deeper knowledge and yet i have been <UNK> for a video of it for years and years to no <UNK> it gets a very high rating from viewers why then has it not been released on video it's the only hamlet that i'd <UNK> in
<START> for a kid's movie this is great as an adult and mother i enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter there is a lot going on in this movie the following might be considered a spoiler <UNK> learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this movie she also learns not to give up hope and to master her anger i loved the sense of <UNK> you get from watching <UNK> and her sister and friends solve the puzzle there's nothing in the movie i found offensive or inappropriate for young viewers in fact i felt that the moral messages of the movie were superb and well done br br the animation was pretty good i really enjoy the ice <UNK> scenes and think that they were very well done there's a lot of action in this film so i suspect that most kids would enjoy it not just the ones that are really into <UNK> my daughter actually picked it out because of the <UNK> she loves horses but she enjoyed the movie very much my daughter is <UNK> and was able to sit through the whole movie and enjoy it she really liked the action scenes and any parts with horses involved br br one thing that i was thinking about was that many people object to <UNK> and ken because they are so beautiful yet i think that kids just like adults like to look at beautiful people and things it's natural as adults we enjoy watching beautiful movie stars too it's wonderful though that the <UNK> character and her boyfriend have a lot of personality while it's fun to watch pretty people it grows old if there is no substance behind the pretty face br br overall i'd say this is a great movie for kids and parents will enjoy it too
<START> the storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile <UNK> acting is pretty flat and poor <UNK> is ok the rest of the cast are cardboard <UNK> somehow almost everything about this film <UNK> mediocrity the plot is lame the only thing i liked more or less about this film are the fairly original methods the <UNK> uses to end his victims technical details are worse than the most far stretched <UNK> and <UNK> and halfway the movie one wonders if the director even cared about detail credibility some spoilers <UNK> i mean an machine with a pure <UNK> wave <UNK> a man's <UNK> a with full body muscle <UNK> and one working <UNK> finger sure a killer <UNK> a man's <UNK> whilst keeping him alive to allow the rats to feast on him followed by a rat aiming for the guy's face what's with all that stupidity then there are quite a few continuity goofs but you can find those elsewhere here on imdb honestly i found it a bit of an insult even to my limited intelligence br br waste of time still 4 out of 10 to keep my girlfriend from kicking me
<START> i usually don't write reviews for shows unless i've seen them in full however there were so many positive views of this show on here i felt it was necessary to balance it out with a bit of realism br br this show is hysterically bad i don't think it was meant to be but it is i see that there's lots of praise being <UNK> upon the show and i honestly can't understand why this show is so poorly acted the dialogue is so awful and the plots are thin around their holes br br i think that this show is interesting in that it is a definite <UNK> test of your standards some elements of the show work and perhaps those elements are just more important to some people than those that don't work which make the show nearly unwatchable to people like me br br if you enjoy making fun of a show as you watch it <UNK> clichéd lines and such this can be an enjoyable show to <UNK> if you have that sort of time on your hands br br the pilot is a pretty fair example of the whole show if the nonsense <UNK> cliché ending doesn't leave you in a dumb shock then this may be a show for you
<START> there's something frustrating about watching a movie like <UNK> by <UNK> because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out however by the time the credits roll there's no saving it the whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story where sandra <UNK> and ben <UNK> homicide detective characters <UNK> through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more <UNK> the longer the movie goes on although <UNK> is strong in her role it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing ben <UNK> talents are wasted in a forgettable role he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated <UNK> <UNK> as well as chris penn who has a role so <UNK> small you feel sorry for a talent like him anyway the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all the two teen killers played by ryan <UNK> and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well it's too bad they weren't in a much better all around film <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker bottom line it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan but everyone else will live a <UNK> life without ever seeing it except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks
<START> directed by the same <UNK> that put and com a once promising online film community <UNK> out of business and off the net because of his directorial style and method of filmmaking on his next film girl's best friend br br the hole suffers from this look at me i am a filmmaker style of filmmaking that is becoming the near standard in today's hollywood to the <UNK> of content br br the hole actually starts out with a unique concept but that concept and the promise of captivating content soon is destroyed by the look at me directorial style of filmmaking br br there are some funny moments that still shine through the <UNK> but it is a painful short to watch br br how sad it is when the new breed of filmmakers choose not to be a servant to the story but rather try and <UNK> on and off screen heck they don't care as long as they get their studio deal house on the beach and a new car content and presentation are secondary issues br br the real sad part of all this is hollywood <UNK> the look at me attitude so much that the whole aesthetic of filmmaking is changing rather than present a story in a straightforward way that puts the story first today's directors are getting experimental i e look at me br br is it me or am i the only one that was really put off by opening minutes of <UNK> that movie went on to rise above directorial attempts at look at me filmmaking unfortunately this short film by mr does not br br 3 out of 10 rating from tv
<START> i have to admit that i approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread louis de <UNK> novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100 faithful br br all the way through i found myself convincing myself that the movie was <UNK> and had stripped the <UNK> plot back so far as to render it redundant the ending however is much better than that in the novel and i could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards still the john magnificent cinematography stephen <UNK> great score etc i felt did not <UNK> my initial <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a heavily <UNK> script br br but two days later i was <UNK> again to see and although not perfect i have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de was concerned was not a fully rounded character his <UNK> spirit which gives way to <UNK> <UNK> is spot on and <UNK> the superb double act of penelope <UNK> and john hurt perfectly david <UNK> is quietly effective as <UNK> the nazi officer trying to <UNK> his feelings for his <UNK> italian friends and his <UNK> <UNK> complex to those around him and the fine <UNK> italian supporting cast bring de world of <UNK> alive br br on leaving the cinema second time around i finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully <UNK> the story of ww2 in cinematic terms my hat goes off to john <UNK> who despite the almost expected critical he is receiving from the british critics any director who has had a major success like shakespeare in love behind them is always a target for these <UNK> <UNK> has managed to transfer a <UNK> difficult book to the big screen with such heart <UNK> and humanity the core virtues of the novel in fact that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now br br if you are a fan of the book like me it's hard but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing try to <UNK> the book from your mind for two hours <UNK> yourself in the glorious <UNK> atmosphere and discover dr as if for the first time pretend you're watching something made from an original screenplay and i guarantee you won't be disappointed br br in fact you'll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or dvd br br 8 10
<START> enjoy the opening credits they're the best thing about this second rate but <UNK> time killer which features passable performances from the likes of eric roberts and martin <UNK> the main part however goes to newcomer tommy lee thomas who looks a bit <UNK> for this kind of action but who nevertheless occasionally manages to project a <UNK> kind of the first time we see him he's bare <UNK> <UNK> and engaged in that favorite <UNK> activity <UNK> wood after this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which he's <UNK> by his <UNK> and <UNK> with electricity a la mel gibson in lethal weapon he could use a better script however since the manner in which he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing there's also talk about millions of dollars which apparently is tied in with this investigation but which is never explained there are a few <UNK> though sending john <UNK> undercover as john wilson is an amusing play on a presidential name and co star <UNK> ross nolan shows promise as an <UNK> who early in the proceedings is shown <UNK> by his <UNK> and getting <UNK> by a <UNK> guard one final note the movie's low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of extras despite the impressive size of the prison it only seems to hold about 12 inmates note the cast credits at the end aren't too helpful for the record the <UNK> bald headed guard who uses <UNK> nolan as a <UNK> bag is played by bill and the young fair haired guard who electric shocks to tommy lee thomas is played by marc
<START> this indie film is worth a look because of the enormous talent of its creators wallace and <UNK> forbes mr has directed the young cast and he is to be praised for this effort br br the premise of the film is a <UNK> tale of the danger for wanting something one can't have which is the story of alice and ed after living together for a while alice suddenly gets restless because she <UNK> she's lacking experience in the sex area alice and <UNK> relationship while not an example of ideal happiness is a comfortable way to share their lives with one another that is until the moment alice and claire her sister happened to <UNK> into a sexual encounter by another couple that has no clue of being observed br br this incident makes alice <UNK> her own sexual life with ed she finds it lacks substance when she <UNK> other <UNK> ed is shocked to put it mildly but not wanting to <UNK> alice he decides to go along what happens next is that both alice and ed enter into a world that's been unknown to them the people they meet in the end are not worth the trouble they sadly realize at the end they were made for each other br br the film is worth watching in order to see the amazing <UNK> nicholson who we happen to have liked in another indie film <UNK> ms nicholson reminds us of a young shirley she projects such a <UNK> quality about her that is hard to take one's eyes from her whenever she is in a scene this young actress proves she is an accomplished performer who gets better with each new appearance basically she carries the movie her alice is a study in <UNK> alice is a decent woman who thinks she is <UNK> in pleasing ed because of her <UNK> br br jay <UNK> is an excellent match for ms nicholson both do wonders together his ed is perfectly credible we have known people like him deep down inside he is a good person who suddenly gets himself in a situation he didn't call for yet he goes along only to discover he is too decent and not cut out for a life of gratuitous sex with the willing women that have no problem with a <UNK> in the <UNK> just for fun br br the rest of the cast is wonderful lauren graham does some amazing work as claire <UNK> <UNK> sister andy is also wonderful as the grounded carl the nerdy friend who finally finds out <UNK> when he meets penelope a single mother as penelope helen slater makes a albeit of a short appearance in the film br br the director is enormously gifted who will no doubt go places because he shows he is well suited for the job
<START> i love old monster movies for the pure camp value this one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing br br the acting is pure 1950s stilted crap you do get used to it when you've seen enough of these the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable you're just there for the giant bird br br the science in this movie is hilarious a monstrous <UNK> <UNK> that can manipulate anti matter intent on <UNK> havoc and eating people an alien who has come to earth to nest some of the best scenes in the movie that don't have the bird in them include the scientists explaining what is going on br br a lot has been said about the ridiculous bird <UNK> it looks like a new baby bird bald and ugly with <UNK> <UNK> it even like a hungry angry <UNK> however the bird scared the crap out of my three year old who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening it's a bit creepy br br i was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg somehow the egg is not <UNK> by an <UNK> shield but i'm a bird lover what can i say
<START> i think hollywood should seriously consider never doing another biblical film again if <UNK> <UNK> is going to be the norm aside from the horrible completely uninspired acting from the whole cast voight and <UNK> undoubtedly <UNK> the day the agreed to do this film the time line has been completely <UNK> i also missed the part in <UNK> about the pirate fight on the deck of the <UNK> or the traveling salesman coming by on his <UNK> boat hello everyone else was dead except for <UNK> and his family according to <UNK> god <UNK> <UNK> and added plans to build the <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> how i also don't remember reading anything about <UNK> wife constantly <UNK> him during the 40 days or <UNK> wandering around <UNK> eyed and <UNK> all the time the script writer obviously had very little knowledge of the book of <UNK> or just didn't care that his abomination of a story completely <UNK> it

<START> so you have the spoiler warning but i would argue that you cannot spoil what is already rotten i assume they changed the name to the <UNK> just in case within s reputation had <UNK> it br br after paying the cable rental for this movie i considered saving my household garbage for a month and <UNK> it to the writer director he had his garbage delivered to my home so i thought it only fair that i return the favor br br the movie opens with a suggestion that the scene is in the desert of <UNK> i'm not sure why they picked <UNK> maybe the writer is a fan of the ali g show but they should have just started inside the cave because the outside was obviously not <UNK> it was the first clue that i was going to hate the movie br br the movie has no redeeming qualities save one it's consistent everything is terrible the writing the directing the acting the cinematography every aspect of this film is just bad and i like bad films goofy films b horror films but this was just plain bad and stupid and hackneyed and predictable and boring br br to get a feel for the film go into your <UNK> room with 5 of your friends and turn off the lights put a <UNK> turned on into your <UNK> and start it <UNK> now all of you start screaming and yelling at the top of your <UNK> that's it br br for a complete re <UNK> have 5 of the 6 people in the <UNK> room play dead on the floor toss <UNK> <UNK> on them turn the lights back on stop the <UNK> now have a guy in a gorilla costume enter the room and rape the last person standing br br <UNK> br br <UNK> reading through the other comments many find it remarkable this movie was made on a low budget that's not remarkable making a crap movie on a huge budget is remarkable <UNK> making a good movie on a low budget is remarkable like blair witch which i thoroughly enjoyed making a crap movie on a low budget isn't a bit surprising and you can expect more of the same if these people are still making movies because i can't imagine anybody would hand them a pile of cash after watching this br br is the low budget an excuse for a terrible film no and it's certainly no reason to watch it would you eat a dog dung <UNK> just because it was cheap to make br br the imdb rating for this film over time will be interesting to watch it should trend <UNK> <UNK> but only if the number of unsuspecting innocent viewers can the movie <UNK> ability to beg their personal friends to give it 10 stars

<START> a 2006 online <UNK> of <UNK> top 100 favorite animated television series of all time <UNK> by tv placed this series in fourth place that tells you everything you need to know so go and watch it i won't comment on the story simply because i don't want to ruin anything i only urge you to keep watching after you saw the first episode the animation is really good and above tv average the best thing about this series is that there is finally something new i mean it's not groundbreaking but still it offers a fresh new idea and likable characters you won't regret entering world br br and the best thing a movie is coming soon
<START> the movie starts off <UNK> enough the use of imagery and simple short clips convey the bigger story which would normally need a considerably higher budget than the one here however it did start to worry me as it continued combined with another overly <UNK> max payne type voice over the movie was starting to look not so good i hoped it was just the introduction to the story br br the story is what really caught me and took me to this movie the idea that a research scientist has created a virus that actually <UNK> the cells it <UNK> from other <UNK> was an interesting scientific idea then that subjects who had the most bizarre <UNK> sought out the scientist and offered to be his human experiments made me think this could be one very good small movie yet the introduction hadn't gone well br br there did seem to be a change of pace as the movie turned to recorded interviews with the four main characters in the movie the test subjects although the acting wasn't superb there seemed to be a lot of scope for character development throughout the movie and the <UNK> were done quite well with a varied mix of characters however these faded through the movie they weren't used again after a few brief clips and i did feel that there was a missed opportunity to provide some great character development by <UNK> back to them however it wasn't to be br br the imagery becomes increasingly <UNK> from the story often repeating to represent something that is still happening this and <UNK> is reflected in the annoying and distracting commentary it began <UNK> words one after the other short meaningless sentences and <UNK> none too relevant or interesting scientific <UNK> if there was something to be described four or five words would be used it was too long repetitive <UNK> <UNK> you're getting the idea br br now this could have been to reflect the confusion and of the character slowly becoming caught up in his own thoughts rambling due to lack of food and water what it actually did was to cause me to totally switch off to the voice and by the closing stages of the movie i found that i hadn't been listening to some of the <UNK> br br a number of times that an event occurs the camera shows all the characters one after the other for their reaction which seems to be somewhere between confused and thoughtful there are repeated fades from the same scene to the same scene for instance a character sleeping fades to black then fades back in on the character sleeping again look we know the character is asleep we know time has passed please move on overall there are just too many atmospheric cuts and long hanging shots to fill time br br the acting was not bad and the characters were okay but not exploited and developed when they were <UNK> there were some truly <UNK> moments for example when one of them asks if they are hungry the camera looks to each of them and returns to a group shot they pause look to each other turn back to camera and say slowly no it raised a <UNK> or two their dialogue was slow glossy and either it was missing altogether or totally unnecessary there seemed to be no middle ground where the dialogue hit spot on br br however there were some good scenes but they were really hard to find unless you viewed them in isolation and this is what it almost looks like has happened with this movie the film has been looked at as a series of scenes and not as a complete story br br nowhere is this seen more than in the main storyline the characters are infected with the virus that has been killing the animals the one that was being <UNK> for them we're told that it develops in stages to something dramatic and so that is what we expect what we get are the characters eating loads together all throwing up once together water <UNK> from their mouths in unconvincing <UNK> then they all fall asleep these are the <UNK> which all happen really early in the movie then they all say good together when asked how they are and that's it that's the virus done nothing else happens br br there could have been so much more done with this movie so much more developed with the virus and it protecting them from all manner of harm it could have explored a serious change of these characters as it infected and took over them it could have developed these characters shown them making decisions and doing things that connect back to their character shown in flashbacks to the interviews br br the ending isn't even confusing intriguing or thought provoking it just shows something that happens and that's it although in the long drawn out style with the irritating voice over above it i really <UNK> with this movie and watched a number of press members walk out including one famous tv critic leaving within the first twenty minutes i stayed but <UNK> the lost time
<START> please if anybody gets the chance to read this before watching the movie if it can be called so <UNK> from it do not waste your time i too watched this film right after finishing the book and was seriously disappointed the main character is basically a new made up <UNK> for she shows no resemblance ever to the book she's so lively and laughing all the time if there was one thing the author wanted to set on this was that she was a very shy <UNK> character please all the most important parts of the story which are supposed to convey to the ending are simply not taken into account and the rest made up i think one is better off using the time to either read a little bit of the actual novel or simply do nothing
<START> i saw the <UNK> of this movie during the 2005 phoenix film festival and was very impressed with the skill director jeff <UNK> <UNK> in bringing this <UNK> topic to the screen the cast of characters <UNK> perfectly and allowed us to examine the issue of a senior wishing to die on his own terms in a very warm and humorous way peter falk was brilliant as morris and the supporting group of family members and friends were perfectly cast in their roles the interaction of the family friends and <UNK> with morris created a realistic view of how families address the issue of their parents aging and their wishes to die with dignity br br although this movie is ostensibly a movie about a jewish actor and his family it is truly a movie about all families the jokes the family and morris crack during this romp through the life of a force of nature are fresh and realistic childhood <UNK> adult <UNK> and failures and hope for the children are integral to this screenplay while many will question how you can make the topic of suicide humorous i thought the treatment logical and <UNK> if you are not afraid to shed a few tears or laugh at the <UNK> of a family struggling with this issue then you must see this movie br br the movie was awarded best picture at the phoenix film festival
<START> a true <UNK> and a bad film even for the chan series i like a good charlie chan film or even a reasonably good one but this one falls way short of the mark charlie is <UNK> to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power the mystery is very pedestrian and the acting doesn't fare much better the only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> brown he gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces but after that the <UNK> are rather slim benson <UNK> is here as tommy chan and <UNK> up with chan's daughter of all things what about sidney <UNK> he is pretty decent but looks like he is <UNK> to carry the film what i noticed most was the way the film was shot chan director phil <UNK> of whom i generally like most of his entries uses lots of long shots with no action like charlie's initial walk into the house from outside why the film is only 64 minutes long for crying out loud shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than he was <UNK> to this probably isn't the worst chan film ever made but up to now it is the worst i have sat through unfortunately
<START> have you ever seen one of those shows that became so popular that it could eventually get away with any crummy nonsense and repetitive <UNK> gimmicks that it's creators can get away with if you haven't then you've never seen family guy br br fans of the show seem to think of it as witty edgy and poignant it's none of these it is however dull repetitive insulting and uninspired br br the humor of the show comes from two sources br br 1 irrelevant idiocy the show often has flashbacks to things that have nothing to do with the plot and are mostly just absurd and pointless and then there's the random movie references in which the shows characters <UNK> a scene from a popular movie without effectively <UNK> it or <UNK> it at all which isn't funny br br 2 the same crap that's in every episode the show the one guy is a sexual <UNK> with <UNK> ha isn't that funny hey ya know what's even funnier making the same joke about him anywhere between one and fifteen times in a single episode and don't just tell it numerous times in a single episode make sure you drag it out so that an entire scene is devoted just to telling the one joke now also imagine that this same routine is used over and over again for practically every character in the whole series br br the offbeat un pc humor isn't as un pc as they would have you believe mostly they just say whatever morons think about the latest newspaper <UNK> politicians and random celebrities br br the series had it's moments but now i think it's time just take the show off the air and be done with it br br you know what is funny i still like this more than <UNK> of the valley of the wind
<START> i watched the first episode and i found it to be a very wooden performance br br i have watched the original from it's early days on big girls <UNK> to the last series on channel seven and kim was a great <UNK> and it's humor is something that most people get br br however in this american version i found it to be dull molly shannon is to <UNK> to be day wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> figure <UNK> clothes isn't as good as what the original <UNK> wore i also found that <UNK> seemed to be <UNK> her belly out a lot she is obviously a australian size 12 where kim should be australian a size 16 18 br br the <UNK> from molly and <UNK> is obviously so scripted and there is pauses where there shouldn't be pauses or the pauses are a bit long as someone suggested there could be a laughter track in there during those pauses it's like molly and shannon are not used to each other there is no mother daughter chemistry br br phil was okay he had the eccentric air around him like <UNK> however craig was to handsome and not the sweet plain humble brett from the aussie version br br i found watching this was like watching a very bad stage play the acting was pretty much wooden and the exaggeration of expressions wore the funny off after ten minutes especially her <UNK> scenes br br to sum up i find this show to be a waste of time the script obviously has been <UNK> down for americans which most on the board say they prefer the original if nbc wanted to show and kim why not pay the producers the money to screen the original br br all i can add is <UNK> you are one smart cookie for not letting the producers use your character of sharon
<START> riding high on the success of rebel without a cause came a <UNK> wave of movies arguably this is one of the best a very young <UNK> excels here as the not really too troubled teen the story concentrates more on <UNK> of <UNK> than any traumatic <UNK> the supporting cast is memorable <UNK> directs like an old pro just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously
<START> a wonder my favorite film the most important film about relationships ever made brilliant writing magnificent directing image systems and symbolism that leave you thinking about it all days weeks years later wow a truly great work of art
<START> max cash a <UNK> boat captain who works off the <UNK> island san sebastian is hired by sarah who's looking for legendary boat el <UNK> and its stolen treasure that sunk out in the <UNK> in the <UNK> century but something seems to be protecting the <UNK> of the ship as people who knew anything about it are being killed br br i have to agree with those that were under the impression that this was going to be a horror feature instead what we ended up with was a low rent b grade late 80s take on 1977 deep sea adventure film 'the <UNK> but with a <UNK> supernatural origin and an <UNK> of mystery the story is a tame <UNK> so many inconsistent angles don't make a <UNK> of sense and encourages a pace and the technical side is clunky nice exotic location and under water photography though while the <UNK> performances weren't too bad either a gruff wayne crawford is <UNK> witty and june <UNK> is fair along side him <UNK> able is pretty much eye candy there are some bizarre developments that <UNK> and one or two eerie sequences however there's a real lack of <UNK> most of the <UNK> deaths happen off screen except for the bloody <UNK> opening kills done by something unseen again just another thing that leaves you high and dry the music is generic with its <UNK> <UNK> to warn us of approaching danger and the <UNK> shots get a good working out <UNK> but watchable
<START> its a feel good movie that made me feel good some in this genre can be <UNK> sweet but this script is restrained the movie is funny and fun the acting is great br br if this were a musical i would have left the theater <UNK> the tunes
<START> lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience i've ever seen not only it's the mother of coincidence but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head the story takes a completely new direction br br take this <UNK> for example the us marine whom gives <UNK> the way to become a <UNK> is <UNK> brown playing a character named joe in the last episode he is playing <UNK> the <UNK> partner in the <UNK> destiny uh yeah right br br i guess that all of us will have to wait to see what's next in the life of the wonder people in that strange island in the middle of nowhere knowing that several of my favorites characters <UNK> <UNK> and mr <UNK> have an unclear destiny br br i believe that along with 24 and the shield this is one of the best tv shows ever of course keeping twin peaks at a special place
<START> they don't make movies like this anymore  though some may say that's a good thing although this was amongst the first of disney's pg rated films it has more of the feel of the g films their studio turned out in i e freaky friday the world's greatest <UNK> than the pg films that came out in the early i e watcher in the woods <UNK> something wicked this way comes because of disney's backing midnight madness obviously had a large budget a huge cast and a ton of diverse locations go to show that but <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> hunt and spectacular visual style weren't enough to save the film from being an enormous flop a failure at the box office most of us were introduced to the film on hbo in the early back in the days when the same films would be shown <UNK> times a week oh wait  they still do that essentially hbo did for this film what cbs did for the wizard of oz  they created an enormous cult audience for a <UNK> sweet mega flop br br the biggest problem that makes this a bad film is that there's too many characters and very few of them are fleshed out  eddie squad don't even have names the blue team although they're the villains are the most endearing and have the most work put into their characters with the exception of the girl who can't act doesn't have enough to do harold perfectly played to the <UNK> by stephen <UNK> is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the film the other standout character is goof off played with tons of charm by now director andy <UNK> although then dr pepper <UNK> david <UNK> was supposed to be the star his character often comes off obnoxious particularly when <UNK> against his brother adam michael j fox while everyone has favorite characters i don't think anyone who loves the movie could disagree that <UNK> and fox are the only two characters that you really learn anything about br br despite the film's many flaws and bad actors most of whom fell off the face of the earth after this movie it still works because the actors appeared to be having fun and fun on the set equals fun on the screen come on what college jock doesn't dream of floating around in a beer <UNK> and what girl doesn't dream of stealing the show at the local er i guess it would be at a rave nowadays campy <UNK> clean fun for anyone who was young in the it's only fitting that this has finally gotten the massive video release that it deserves but where the <UNK> the widescreen dvd release with the commentary trailer and the full version of the song that plays in the disco
<START> wealthy horse <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> have a long standing no <UNK> policy with the <UNK> of manhattan but what happens when the <UNK> latin son falls for a certain crawford with bright eyes blonde hair and some <UNK> moves on the dance floor 20th century fox musical has a glossy <UNK> yet seems a bit <UNK> around the edges it is very heavy on the frenetic <UNK> like dancing exceedingly thin on story betty <UNK> an <UNK> hour replacement for alice faye gives it a boost even though she's paired with <UNK> don <UNK> in <UNK> make up and slick hair also good charlotte <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> aunt a <UNK> driver who's constantly asleep on the job and carmen miranda playing herself who else the stock shots of <UNK> far the action filmed on the fox <UNK> and some of the supporting performances are quite awful by the time of the big finale most viewers will have had enough 1 2 from
<START> all american the biopic about the famous <UNK> dame beloved coach is an excellent sports film to watch not ever having seen it we were surprised by the technique used in the movie by director lloyd bacon who shows he was ahead of his times in <UNK> football games the result is a vibrant picture about the man responsible for the legacy of the sport br br the film presents from his humble origins in chicago to his studies in famed <UNK> dame university in south bend indiana he was an ambitious man who had a vision about how the game should be played luckily he went to give his beloved <UNK> dame the glory he was after br br pat o'brien looks a bit older when he starts as a <UNK> in fact he doesn't change much throughout the film but he is fine as mr pat o'brien shows he could inspire the players under him by just being a father figure <UNK> page plays bonnie the wise woman who understood her husband's call in life ronald reagan plays george the who was a legend that died much too young but who left a legacy behind donald crisp makes a good contribution as father john callahan who was mentor at the university br br this film will delight not only sports because of lloyd <UNK> direction and the fast pace he gives to the movie
<START> yeah it may not be for adults and some adults may find it stupid but if you don't think about it it's really not that bad br br the story has alvin and his gang going across the world in search of <UNK> for a bad person and the <UNK> that they come in contact with br br so the animation is good and the story is cute and the songs are forgettable but it's a good movie br br i give it a 6 out of 10 or out of 4 stars
<START> i know that many people will have automatically given this film a rating of 1 just because it doesn't have the huge budget and top of the line special effects that they are used to i however knew what i was getting myself into when i popped this into the vcr br br i don't think we get much more low budget that this unless we are filming a family reunion the lighting is awful sound quality is at times incomprehensible and the acting is ultra bad by almost all involved but this is still a fun movie and the plot is interesting enough it centers around a fellow named tom russo <UNK> felt who has been down on his luck with his job he is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work putting even more pressure on himself as he begins working more hours we see him slowly <UNK> into madness and obsession and he becomes suspicious that his wife cheating on him and begins to brutally murder the various men most <UNK> guys that he feels are responsible br br i must say that the gore effects are extremely cheap but fit with the overall tone of the film the brutal ways that tom russo comes up with to murder these men gives us an idea of just has mad he has become the pacing of the film is also very good and there is rarely a boring moment the ending really doesn't follow the rest of the plot of the film as it seems to want to go from a psycho slasher film to a dawn of the dead wannabe but it is entertaining nonetheless and i must give tim ritter credit for wanting to use an unconventional ending br br i can honestly say that i enjoyed this film but it is by no means a good film if that makes sense it's budget is its main stumbling block and the consequences are almost too much to overlook i do not recommend this to people who are totally spoiled by the big budget movies and who can't have an open mind to ultra low budget films you simply won't enjoy it for others and fans of gore i say give it a shot you will find at least something redeeming in it br br my grade d
<START> the acting is generally pretty weak the dialog was also apparently dubbed in after the filming so it just doesn't come across well what do you want for a tv movie br br <UNK> o'toole was ok there were a few strong lines from the parent of the queen br br otherwise these kids weren't quite up to it didn't impress my kids either br br on the upside it is only an hour long considering that it got through plot and character development in a <UNK> fashion the settings and cinematography are ok too br br some other viewers may like it for sentimental reasons
<START> i think it was <UNK> <UNK> who said that the best movies either involve the joy of making movies or the agony of making movies this flick is definitely of the first type <UNK> and juliet is a pleasure to watch from start to finish the zany <UNK> <UNK> this <UNK> is <UNK> i don't think i've laughed so hard since i saw monty python and the holy grail it's that good
<START> saw this at the hong kong international film festival over three years ago i went in with no expectations since christopher nolan was a no name at the time but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things i saw at that festival it worked well on the big screen with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood mr nolan gave a good account of its making at the end enough to put anybody off starting out as a film maker i liked it better than <UNK> although this was perhaps due to the lower expectations and the fact that it was more of an art house movie
<START> for me this is a good series i am kind of disappointed that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> died but more upset that micheal <UNK> to everyone about who killed them and if any one can answer this what was that guys name who was supposedly henry <UNK> he was like the leader of the others or was that ms clue anyway if you know his name cool well trying to think of what can possibly happen next after they finally didn't press the button does that mess up the whole <UNK> project thing and i personally thought it was cool how they had that key thing underground that <UNK> used to shut off the <UNK> thing yeah and what was the whole point of that i am just glad they didn't press the button finally but what happens to the people in the <UNK> like mr echo john charlie and well <UNK> probably died but what about the others i think they survived i forget well this is just my little thing on what i thought about this season finale
<START> a young woman leaves her <UNK> life for a new one in the city and there she meets another woman with whom she falls in love with their relationship turns physical quickly and they both believe that they are soul mates until one day the <UNK> girl comes home to find a man in their bed her lover then reveals to her that their relationship was just an experiment and she really likes men um kinda like the anne <UNK> and ellen <UNK> thing so anyway the <UNK> girl broken torn and <UNK> by this discovery moves out and begins to discover what the real world is all about as she falls into the hands of all sort of <UNK> and <UNK> people in 19th century england
<START> a beautiful sensitive film that brings home the <UNK> and cruelty of wars no matter what the so called reasons the performance of cage and <UNK> were quite impressive but it is to the older greek characters that go the highest <UNK> irene <UNK> is as gorgeous as ever though some scenes seems a little long at times this film will be a heavy oscar <UNK>
<START> i watched this movie thinking it was going to be absolutely horrible and was ready for all the <UNK> bad special effects etc but i was pleasantly surprised not to say that it's the best vampire movie i have ever seen but it certainly isn't the worst i liked the whole alternate reality dream state that played into the movie the graphics were quite well for a straight to dvd movie and i liked the overall look of the film i enjoyed the main character <UNK> i usually end up hating the female leads but there was something about her that kept me interested yes she does make some bad decisions but that was to be expected yes the other characters were stereotypical but i was expecting that too i don't know if i'd highly recommend this movie but give it a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised i'm putting this one on my guilty pleasures list
<START> i'm trying to find something of value here the best i can <UNK> is that <UNK> wanted to make a movie as tedious painful <UNK> annoying illogical and brainless as the experience of being in love if that was his goal then he succeeded but the solution to his exercise is really a drag to watch br br there is one scene that screams for a spoof <UNK> <UNK> the features of <UNK> face to the features in a landscape all i could think the whole time was <UNK> ice two lonely <UNK> wearing army <UNK> on a frozen lake in <UNK> br br the only other point of interest was the <UNK> of theory of climatic <UNK> the <UNK> are presented as paradise and things get <UNK> worse as they get <UNK> hell being <UNK> french switzerland that was kind of funny
<START> if you are looking for a phony hollywood action movie this won't be one for you if the truth is what you seek rent or buy this from a true story the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was is happening in south africa and many other places br br for historical knowledge this rates up there with stories such as the <UNK> <UNK> list or <UNK> millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists this movie may help them learn and may even help them dig deeper
<START> for a movie that gained so much recognition and <UNK> this <UNK> to baby is one big mistake it starts off that andrew adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother the acting is terrible as andrew grows up in his <UNK> and looks terrible with his <UNK> in face never ending grin and dukes of <UNK> clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of satan in fact thats all he does is drink and falls <UNK> all over himself as he tries to come to grips with his past and the last memory of his mother driving away on a bus screaming to him he finds a friend that seems to be an angel but he's quickly killed off and <UNK> in a <UNK> scene in which he looks more like a christmas tree andrew gets and the cult with the members of the first part test him to see if he's really the son of satan his dumb self fails the test and gets up off the alter <UNK> with makeup and jumps of the stage of a night club and dances like a clown on crack this scene is memorable and well worth a watch the ending is terrible and somewhat predictable considering how stupid he is in the whole movie do not watch this piece of trash or you will loose respect for the first part
<START> this excellent movie starring elizabeth <UNK> is long <UNK> for release in dvd form the same can be said for her earlier also excellent movie a case of rape i can only hope that my comments <UNK> some <UNK> soul into placing both elizabeth <UNK> movies on one dvd to be made available to her many fans i for one believe this excellent <UNK> role was unfortunately stereotyped by her role on <UNK> and as a result more serious acting roles were not made available to her i am confident that if these two movies perhaps even a trilogy with the legend of <UNK> <UNK> were released in dvd form her fans would set the record straight on how highly they regard her serious acting abilities
<START> my age 13 br br james cole played by steven seagal is sent to help detective jim campbell played by <UNK> wayans solve a series of killings in which the victims are <UNK> since cole has arrived on the spot he notices that the killings have changed a little and thinks there is a different killer it becomes personal when his ex wife is murdered and campbell finds his <UNK> on the body campbell <UNK> the mysterious cole and finds out about a very shady past br br i am not a fan of steven seagal i enjoy action movies but he is the worst actor i have ever seen this film is not much fun to watch at all incredibly dumb and obviously steven <UNK> acting performance is absolutely horrid <UNK> wayans isn't too bad though the only redeeming thing in this film is the occasional good action scene although most come round because of insanely stupid reasons the plot in this film is absolute <UNK> i didn't care for it at all the whole <UNK> man past of <UNK> character was stupid all the mafia fights and fights in the restaurant were there for almost no reason give this film a miss br br australian <UNK> ma 15 high level violence br br rating 35 out of 100 quite generous
<START> after watching this film i decided that it was so awful that i must join imdb and write a review to warn other people of the pit falls of renting buying this film to be fair to the film there is only one good section to this film and that is the end credits cause then you know that this crap is well and truly over i watched it to the end in the hope that i may get a little bit of pleasure out of the film just <UNK> more <UNK> and an old man talking to himself if you watch this film too many time so will you as for val if he keeps <UNK> films like this he may as well kiss goodbye to his acting career there is no point in even writing about what is in the film as that has already been done keep your money and sanity and keep well clear
<START> first the recent <UNK> of this movie is a huge <UNK> judging from the cover you'd think this was some kind of scandal movie about <UNK> playing a character having sex taking drugs and whatever this is just a cheap market scheme she's barely in it and does neither of the things the marketing here is unbelievable and i'm surprised the filmmakers hasn't <UNK> br br the movie itself was to me a huge disappointment it seemed like a sunset beach episode directed sloppy handed by a teenage quentin tarantino and thats not meant as a compliment mind you br br i think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story it seems to be about nothing just about cool teenagers <UNK> around living <UNK> the <UNK> the characters themselves does have some personality though but the movie doesn't use its potential as said there's no story of any substance here it seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colorful mtv ad it definitely has that feeling br br still though i guess some people might enjoy it but i'd say there's far better movies like this around
<START> my god ryan <UNK> has made a lot of deep characters in his career this is one of his wonderful acting jobs for me this is a very deep movie needs a lot of concentration not because is difficult to watch just because you understand it if you put your shoes in this kid even though has everything and has famous father that is a writer has a deeper mind you don't understand why he kills this poor kid until you really heard what he has to say and you start to think at least to me that a lot of things that he says is true simple kid sweet very gentle in a way normal like any teenage but inside of him suffer because he start to look at the world in a different way then you understand why he did what he did i recommend this movie for those who likes deep drama
<START> this is not exactly what i would call a mad max film after seeing road warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film i felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this it supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film and was <UNK> with the mad max franchise bad idea the casting was not exactly the best i mean come on tina turner one of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains no <UNK> no not even a decent nothing really even happens if you are going to plan on seeing this sub par action flick can it even be called that make sure you see mad max 2 or mad max or better yet both another problem with this film is that there are too many people even the <UNK> battle sequence is dull max doesn't even kill anyone the music is bad the characters are bad not in the good way and after seeing this film it left a very bad taste in my mouth
<START> this movie is never going to be on a list of the top 50 films of all time but if you're <UNK> a list of fun films this isn't a bad place to start <UNK> tyler is amazing captivating and <UNK> and everyone else is dead on right for their parts it's a 21st century counterpart to tom jones in other words just good <UNK> fun i think that this may be <UNK> breakthrough film on her way to major stardom with no nudity she <UNK> sex in this film it's no wonder all the boys give her toys how could they help but do that for a helpless innocent such as <UNK> jewel
<START> i've seen a fair few films from the far east recently some were excellent battle <UNK> <UNK> affairs the eye and some were not so great versus the triple cross then there are ones like and which while flawed i still enjoyed br br the basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with <UNK> has upon a community sound silly yeah thats what i was thought firstly the good stuff direction was top notch sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish secondly the story was original and like other writers commented very <UNK> <UNK> it was interesting what it reminded me most of however was early <UNK> films like <UNK> and <UNK> br br the acting wasn't great but not too horrible either to be honest i was actually bored on a few i felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow my main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be true horror and yet not so enough to be considered a comedy spoilers below br br spoilers some good scenes <UNK> machine and i liked the final shot <UNK> at first i thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later i realised the meaning and liked the end however because of the lack of seriousness in the story combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school <UNK> that i did not care for the characters much in the end the final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little while in reality i couldn't really care for the girl or her boyfriend spoilers end br br so overall i kinda did like this film but it frustrated me and i think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes couple of other points the main girl is quite pretty and cute and the song that plays at the end is good too i rated it 7 10 br br
<START> it started off weird the middle was weird and the ending was weird but i really really liked it a modern day version of <UNK> <UNK> but that is really irrelevant interesting story and casting clooney was great and i applaud him for taking on such an role so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again lots of surprise stars why isn't holly hunter in more do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected flick
<START> it goes without saying that a <UNK> of <UNK> has to be made when a true story is being adapted for the big screen but if you shoot a fairy tale that has next to nothing to do with what actually happened why call it <UNK> and make the audience believe this was a halfway true story the godfather trilogy <UNK> many real characters and events once upon a time in america does it too but they don't claim to be telling true stories br br spoiler br br in the movie benny has this grand vision of a in real life <UNK> had to argue him into going to <UNK> benny deemed the notion of a counterpart to <UNK> <UNK> idiotic and he'd have preferred to continue his life as a playboy in l a not until much later benny <UNK> to the idea but of course he's the hero of the movie so naturally the idea had to be his br br in the movie benny wants to use count to get close to <UNK> in order to <UNK> him because he was hitler's partner and hitler killed jews in gas <UNK> after all obviously we're supposed to like benny so the screenwriters invented this nonsense in real life at that time nobody knew about the gas <UNK> least of all benny who was completely <UNK> in politics in fact he did use the <UNK> connection and he did visit <UNK> but not to kill him but to sell <UNK> to him he even met <UNK> and <UNK> during his <UNK> in italy br br the whole <UNK> subplot was nonsense <UNK> didn't turn <UNK> <UNK> he didn't seek <UNK> with benny benny didn't kill him that was up to albert at least they got the name right br br i guess it was supposed to be very romantic to have virginia return to benny offering him the money she had stolen the movie even goes so far to tell us via text <UNK> that she <UNK> returned the money to <UNK> after <UNK> assassination let me just say <UNK> just doesn't get more <UNK> than this br br this list is by no means <UNK> there's the issue with <UNK> family not living in l a the way benny deals with and <UNK> the portrayal of <UNK> a <UNK> corporate type <UNK> a lovable teddy bear benny himself an aging <UNK> who wouldn't have reached age 12 if he had regularly gone <UNK> in situations like those in the movie and what's more who neither has the good looks nor the charisma of benny <UNK> and many others apart from a few hard facts <UNK> right in this flick br br spoilers end here br br all in all this is the one mafia movie that manages to be even more ridiculously bad than harlem ny but honor where honor is due this is a feat in itself
<START> i'm not in favor of death <UNK> but in this movie it couldn't happen fast enough just to end the movie i don't understand why this movie is rated as high as it is it fooled me into a bad night
<START> this movie is standard goofy sci fi fare from the 50s in its favor the plot does manage to pull off an alien invasion without actually producing the aliens themselves but come on now if aliens needed energy and could <UNK> it from sources like <UNK> bombs why would they come to earth why wouldn't they just suck it out of a star the only credible reason for the presence of <UNK> is a direct attack on earth society not the mere collection of energy nothing like that is even <UNK> <UNK> may have been built by a superior race but its activities on earth are the most primitive the end that the scientist heroes plan for <UNK> is based on nothing but pseudo scientific <UNK> it amounts to the reverse the <UNK> which has been used so much in bad scifi it has become a joke in itself low and behold this causes our <UNK> visitor to release its <UNK> energy no one in power seems to care about the impact the release of that much energy which by the film's end includes among other things the entire <UNK> of a <UNK> bomb will have on the surroundings and unfortunately by the time the movie ends the surroundings are the <UNK> of los angeles <UNK>
<START> every time i've seen this movie i get the same impression some parts of it are so amazingly stupid bad that they crack me up they aren't intentional and there are a lot of them the rest is just plain bad stupid and or irrelevant a movie like evil dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result <UNK> stupid and cheesy because sam <UNK> succeeded at what he was trying to do this movie doesn't have that excuse it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably the crap result gets <UNK> on top of the crap writing and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest rating a movie can be given is one for ' watching this movie has the same effect as listening to a billy madison <UNK> everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i should be able to give this movie something around a 5
<START> a rich old lady calls on a <UNK> <UNK> to woo a <UNK> away from her silly soon to be married <UNK> br br let us be gay is an interesting little domestic comedy which features some <UNK> dialogue courtesy of celebrated screenwriter frances marion good performances while perhaps a bit <UNK> at times this can probably be blamed on the difficulties with early sound technology which tended to limit action movement br br norma <UNK> can be credited with appearing in this minor film rather than using her <UNK> <UNK> as irving <UNK> <UNK> to insist upon only a grade pictures she is especially effective in her first few scenes where <UNK> flat makeup makes her almost <UNK> her extreme from <UNK> to <UNK> could only happen in hollywood but it's <UNK> <UNK> to spend much time worrying about that br br rod <UNK> doesn't come off too well as <UNK> <UNK> husband quite popular during silent days the <UNK> were not especially kind to him and his career would suffer here his role is not in the least sympathetic and one has to wonder what <UNK> <UNK> moves women to desire the <UNK> so much br br magnificent marie <UNK> is on hand as an eccentric long island <UNK> as a great friend of frances marion one can easily imagine that the part was written <UNK> for her full of <UNK> she is very humorous however the tremendous warmth essential goodness which would very shortly make her hollywood's biggest star are largely missing br br among the supporting cast hopper scores as a <UNK> society <UNK> as does <UNK> playing a comic butler movie <UNK> will spot little <UNK> moore as <UNK> young son elderly mary gordon as her <UNK> both uncredited
<START> think <UNK> but with a death curse a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> get their hands on a game that takes the life of some one who is playing it supposedly it was made from the skin of a witch during the spanish <UNK> and carries a nasty curse br br okay <UNK> and just sort of watchable tale isn't anything you haven't seen before frankly its a been there and done that story that hits all the right buttons in such away as to have no real surprises far from the worst thing that <UNK> has run but certainly its not the best there are better choices out there but if this is your only choice you won't completely hate it
<START> if it's an art and <UNK> film there is not enough art not to mention <UNK> br br if it is a thriller there is not enough thriller br br if it is a teenage drama there is not enough drama and as far as teenagers are concerned there is not enough and too much <UNK> br br i thought it could be a trailer for tony <UNK> <UNK> movie but there is no tony <UNK> so i guess been cheated it's not tony <UNK> biopic br br if it's an action movie it lacks explosions which would have added some interest to it or at least would have make jump the sleeping ones into their <UNK> br br most of the characters seem to be dead inside but it's not a zombie movie in fact if it is a movie there is not enough plot if it is not a movie it lasts too long to be a music video br br if it's a music video well it's an album i will not purchase
<START> a lecture over the life of the tormented magician named ray charles his <UNK> on the piano made fire music and his nostalgic voice created exciting cool tunes each <UNK> that ray was facing never kept him down and he found his way all over conflicts a real lesson a great team of producers help recreate the era and armed with great costumes <UNK> and settings one will follow <UNK> story believing its true direct filming an icy music <UNK> and <UNK> the audience with clever sound editing but the most important part of the movie is jamie foxx his acting is really superb the most diamond polished acting ever seen he lives his role he is the ray of light
<START> all of the great horror movies of the 70's 80's and even the early 90's from psycho to texas chainsaw the original not that <UNK> over wb crap to silence of the <UNK> the characters in these movies were based upon the crimes of ed <UNK> the writers and directors <UNK> into the true story for the inspiration for creating some of the greatest fictional movie killers of all time br br the old horror films were great because even though the crimes were loosely based upon the facts of the case of ed <UNK> they were truly fictional and far removed from the true story br br in the case of this movie they've created a fictional horror film in which they tried to capitalize on the true story in order to sell a cheap poorly acted love story between two characters that nobody really cares about in fact in a good horror film these two characters would have been excellent victims br br end of lecture br br in short this film was like wearing <UNK> underwear on a cold afternoon <UNK> on a nice cup of <UNK> vomit
<START> all you need is great house a babysitter and a phone simon west directs this thrilling and chilling remake of the 1979 original this version is more of a thriller than a horror flick emotionally tense with an <UNK> fear factor jill johnson <UNK> belle needs to work off an excessive cell phone bill she takes on the task of <UNK> the two children of dr and mrs derek de <UNK> and kate <UNK> grant the house is a beautiful wood and glass masterpiece secluded and peaceful the kids are already in bed the wind builds and is joined by down <UNK> rain the phone begins <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the babysitter is soon in a frantic mode of survival in fear of the creepy stranger on the other end of the phone br br belle is great as the innocent smart and strong teen babysitter the voice of the stranger on the phone is that of lance <UNK> while the physical stranger is played by tommy also featured are katie cassidy and brian kudos to james <UNK> for the atmospheric original music
<START> let's not fool ourselves okay we all know that this film was made because of the success of the grumpy old men movies unlike those however this travesty has zero humor and very little heart br br gloria <UNK> is the sole shining light to be seen it breaks my heart that she was finally given the chance to show off her skills to a new generation of <UNK> only to end up in a piece of dreck such as this there was a touching scene which featured her being stood up by someone she was falling in love with her fine performance was the only quality acting going on in out to sea everyone else is just going through the motions 2 10
<START> the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it but i soon learned that i had been <UNK> i had thought this movie would be something like a road trip american pie deal but i was wrong this movie is one of the dumbest i've seen in a long time the <UNK> version <UNK> you in to watching but will completely disappoint you the acting was terrible and sound effects just <UNK> it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building go out and get or road trip instead i can't believe national lampoon put its name on this don't buy it don't rent it don't waste 2 hours of your life on this
<START> <UNK> n <UNK> is voted on of the worst films of the year by its hard to believe the famous <UNK> have produced this lousy movie it was presented as a movie for the family but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy nor does it make you laugh but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy the title song is the most annoying song of the decade i'm the neil i'm the man rock star superstar <UNK> is one of worst actors ever with no acting talent after making many super <UNK> and not receiving any movies from a producer rather then his family he gives a total crap performance that <UNK> you to death who is and will always be known for being sister gives a dreadful performance both actors have the most annoying chemistry and are very immature for their age it has a special appearance by the very cute in a pathetic role the ending was so <UNK> and stupid i cant believe i actually paid money to rent this crap
<START> i was not old enough to really appreciate the original <UNK> squad but i knew everyone thought it was cool i have some of the books that were written based on the series in my screen to print collection and they're pretty light duty so i didn't expect much from the movie that's a good thing because this movie was bad on a long <UNK> br br i admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the 1960's hit the movie audience though has gained sophistication in 30 years at least i think so i certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original <UNK> squad concept with now old car chases now considered poor camera work <UNK> sounding soundtrack and poor script and all on the big screen in the 1960s we didn't care as much because we had minimal expectations an integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough it was that another thrilling episode of <UNK> or <UNK> br br rating this episode against usual theatre releases the story was well i'm not sure i should even say because i'm not sure there was one drugs are bad whatever the script was silly when the characters are <UNK> dialog and <UNK> the plot with lines like i <UNK> him say so on the phone and i think i got a plan we really are in trouble no wonder the acting was dreadful no one knew how to say such idiotic lines br br if i were claire danes i'd be going after my agent with a flame <UNK> right now actually i think everyone in and watching the film has a right to seek <UNK> br br and where was the <UNK> in that squad i realize these kids just got out of juvenile hall but no one had a <UNK> suit <UNK> only meant young and integrated what happened to white go go boots perhaps the costume department was going for gritty but all they got was dirty and <UNK> br br since the movie was completely true to the original series and required special behavior from the actors <UNK> stunt men etc we should appreciate it more unfortunately i still don't like it if i wanted to watch 60's crime drama i'd buy dvds no thanks
<START> it was a terrific movie i like to watch it again and again the actors were awesome the movie kept me on the edge of my seat i would recommend this movie to anyone i wish lifetime would put this movie on dvd i would most definitely purchase a copy this movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with you may think you know someone but you never know my daughter watched the movie with me she thought it was great all i know is i will watch this movie every time lifetime <UNK> it it's the kind of movie that keeps you glued to the t v i wish lifetime would <UNK> the movie but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen
<START> the pace of the film is <UNK> slow in parts but if you can tune into its <UNK> speed and lengthy <UNK> then it is a satisfying piece of intrigue the story of the first emperor of china his childhood sweetheart and the personal cost of power the film is very atmospheric the extremely mannered and polite ceremony and ritual <UNK> with sudden brutal violence filmed in a way that evokes shadows and cold spaces battle scenes are rare and short the focus is on the battle within the individual on what is right to do and whether the ends justify the means the <UNK> journey from idealistic <UNK> to ruthless <UNK> is aiming to be subtle but gives little background or convincing insight into the motivation of the emperor indeed his actions and aims do not really change throughout only <UNK> <UNK> attitudes to him are altered the most interesting performances are <UNK> <UNK> and the titular assassin as they <UNK> when to fight when to <UNK> when to kill the most expensive film ever made in china at the time the emperor and the assassin does not rely on <UNK> emotion or big battles but rather a brooding atmosphere of menace and <UNK> <UNK> li fans will be <UNK> to hear she is as stunningly beautiful as ever giving an understated performance
<START> this movie is the funniest danish movie i've ever seen br br the plot is funny surprising and danish humor is unlike any other and it gets you every time the entire audience laughed 90 of the time it was incredible the characters are so well played and the two actors <UNK> and <UNK> lie play their best ever br br i would highly <UNK> <UNK> this movie you won't regret it believe me
<START> black water is one of the most tense films i have viewed in a long time the story moves fast as it follows three tourists all great actors into a swamp on a tour with a butch tour guide on a small boat soon after dropping anchor in a remote area of the swamp they are <UNK> over by something huge in the water br br <UNK> the three manage to make it into a tall tree nearby as they realize that a crocodile has attacked them throughout the next two days they have to desperately try to escape from the <UNK> evil <UNK> eye and he doesn't seem to want to go away the movie drags just a tad bit but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget it's so much better than <UNK> and other recent crocodile underwater predator thrillers the tension is heavy and all three leads give terrific performances truly chilling this movie struck a deep <UNK> of claustrophobic fear in me apparently based on true events
<START> this movie could have been great it is not in my opinion the storyline is <UNK> the editor appears not to be able to choose between a guy ritchie style of storytelling and a more straightforward one there is a great emphasis on excessive violence including torture too much so if you ask me the characters are very shallow and <UNK> <UNK> i would have liked to see more depth there it is hard to identify with the main character as a result the movie remains shallow as a whole br br the movie says it gives the <UNK> an inside view of the british criminal <UNK> more in particular the <UNK> <UNK> football <UNK> <UNK> cocaine heroine and violence lots and lots of violence violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general in this movie no one seems to use his or her brain we're looking at a bunch of animals in clothes like i said there is not much of a plot and the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired br br if you're a male below 30 like gore and hardcore violence and think that's entertaining than this is a movie for you if you're looking for a movie portraying real people with a well developed storyline suspense and depth well you can skip this one
<START> i am not familiar with the <UNK> other works but this movie is a piece of crap br br i never saw the mst3k version but i can tell you mike and the <UNK> probably didn't save it br br i love a grade z movie as much as the next bad movie fan but this was almost unwatchable br br there was no credit for who did the voice of the dark one sounded a bit like patrick stewart at times br br a group of high school students who found a junk super 8 camera in the trash heap could make a better movie than that
<START> i watched this film on the advice of a friend who assured me it was one of the funniest things he'd ever seen sadly this person is completely lacking a sense of humour and i was forced to endure two hours of the worst film making i have ever seen please do not watch this film 1 10
<START> i had a very hard time sitting through this film unless you really are very pro adultery and like to hear people endlessly talking about their sexual exploits i can't see how you could enjoy this film <UNK> most of the main characters <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> and their <UNK> about their many <UNK> grew tiresome about the only element of this i appreciated was the disgusting scene where the one character was <UNK> and blood was <UNK> everywhere because he'd picked up an <UNK> big surprise hmm br br if you want a good film watch the sequel barbarian <UNK> despite the general unlikable nature of many of the characters the sequel is very involving and more realistic well worth your time
<START> this movie is sort of similar to better off dead as it has some of the same stars this one though isn't quite as good granted it is rather funny and enjoyable there is something about better that i like well better this one has these guys going to to spend there summer vacation while there they meet this girl who's trying to save here house from this guy who wants to turn it into a <UNK> restaurant this guy really doesn't seem to like <UNK> cause in one scene he sticks it into <UNK> water and puts in a <UNK> so he can hear it scream the main character is torn between this girl and the girl of the son of the guy who wants to make the restaurant somehow or another this leads to a big boat race showdown kind of like in summer rental though it works a bit better here and fits into the plot a little better though what is the deal with boat races at this time was there some weird fascination with them for the most part this movie delivers laughs at a good clip but better off dead was still better cause it was the first and the jokes worked better
<START> let's get one thing straight i like much of <UNK> work unlike his other high kicking <UNK> seagal and van damme he can actually act this film however does little to enhance his reputation it's not exactly unwatchable but i am not in any hurry to watch it again either in fact if i never saw it again it wouldn't bother me there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on it's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film instead the director has chosen to almost try and <UNK> his audience into <UNK> with too much over the top violence and very little characterisation br br the biggest problem i have is with <UNK> co star <UNK> it <UNK> me that the producers of this film went to all the bother of hiring a stunning beautiful for my money anyway and talented actress like miss and then give her such a pathetic one dimensional character to play with if she was hired to simply add a bit of <UNK> to the movie she doesn't even do that very well there's no nudity in the film and also no sex scene worth mentioning strange really given the amount of violence in this film it <UNK> me why the producers have taken such a conservative attitude to sex and nudity are we living in 2007 or in 1957 what the producers of this rubbish and probably the actors as well have forgotten is that films are meant to be fantasies like most of the inhabitants of this planet my real life is very boring i would love to be chasing terrorists be able to handle myself like mr snipes and hook up with a beautiful young thing like miss this film <UNK> none of those fantasies very well which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review
<START> the problem with making a movie like this though is that the finale the <UNK> de la <UNK> of the movie the battle between the two <UNK> up ships must be done well <UNK> this scene in is obviously done completely with little model ships in an <UNK> <UNK> there's no tension little explanation of what exactly is going on and what the <UNK> is of the stand off br br the film takes quite a few liberties with the surrounding story as all true stories do when converted to a movie such as the union <UNK> and most notably that of betty stuart madsen a virginia belle br br it <UNK> to making a possibly decent movie involving an interesting story on the to preaching about the <UNK> of slavery it was out of place in this historical drama and was a cheap <UNK> to bring in the women viewers it only succeeded in <UNK> the <UNK> about the film
<START> this is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say of i didn't think they made movies like that anymore walter matthau gives his usual over the top performance but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the scenery leaves endearing grease <UNK> he is like that great uncle we all know that still wears <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> everyone but we still love anyway br br jack <UNK> performance reminds us why he had more golden globe nominations than anyone else 22 he gives a true to life performance of the basically <UNK> ordinary man' even in the <UNK> of a farce br br this film will probably not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor designed to confront or offend but will appeal to people who appreciate broad farce played with a straight face br br the entire supporting cast is excellent in their ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character br br brent <UNK> gives a marvelous performance as a professional version of a <UNK> lizard anyone who has known professional <UNK> in real life will immediately recognize the type he is playing he nails the type perfectly his rendition of merits study as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic br br the plot is rather a straight forward <UNK> marry <UNK> theme that has the usual results just because a plot theme has been done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated but rather that it is a timeless theme br br the rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals exhibit their skills in the roles that are written for them instead of <UNK> for the spotlight in this film even the second <UNK> actors shine it is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film br br the plot may be standard and thin but it allows the performers to shine br br this film is a true treat for people who want to see professional actors engaging in their craft the plot falls away and the performers shine
<START> if you saw the grudge a another mediocre ghost movie then you should know what to expect just worse a lot worse this time instead of being in japan with all english speaking people we are in spain with all english speaking people it is interesting that not one shot of this movie actually looks like spain and could have been entirely filmed in a studio back lot oh and a place with <UNK> cause there's a good 5 mins of footage of <UNK> with no one on them how spooky br br this one is terrible in every way imaginable the acting by the mom and dad don't help matters at all anna <UNK> is the only person that delivers a decent performance in the film but i hate anna <UNK> so you can imagine my own private hell viewing this film br br there is one good moment in the movie however when a villain is trying to explain the convoluted plot to anna <UNK> character and she doesn't understand any of it and asks a bunch of stupid questions and he <UNK> out you idiot you have not understood anything lol well i happen to understand this film is a piece of garbage 0 stars
<START> i'm sure a lot of guys will love this movie the only woman who shows any balls unfortunate pun <UNK> is made to look talk and seem like a guy the other 2 women are portrayed either as sexual objects with one thing on their mind sex being sexy with sex as their only <UNK> and skill <UNK> or as freaked out pretty little <UNK> who's <UNK> <UNK> any strength and professional authority they had before all hell broke lose doc the only strength <UNK> has in the end is the result of some advice from a big strong man besides my negative gut reaction as a feminist i have to give the camera work props and ethan hawke is great in the very first scene after that his performance loses steam empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy at least the film <UNK> the subject of the <UNK> of good bad in the criminal mind
<START> just had the misfortune to see this truly awful film br br think of that scene in <UNK> at the end with the slow pan in on that woman now remove the pan add breathing and <UNK> men to the mix and you have what the entire 2 and a half hours of humanity was br br the inspector is a true <UNK> not even a <UNK> just a dim witted slow moving <UNK> how they ever solved a crime is beyond me br br obligatory sex scenes are awful and br br eventual villain of the piece he raped and killed an 11 year old girl is <UNK> very early and no surprise unless your are similarly <UNK> br br uninspiring camera work br br the director was there saying that it is up to the audience to provide their own interpretation on the proceedings i assume he also meant provide their own dialogue there is <UNK> all adding to its boredom level inventive camera work just static shots totally <UNK> away the obvious beauty of the landscape the film is being shot in and plot br br truly awful br br 0 out of 10
<START> i realize it's a small <UNK> <UNK> 8 votes as of this <UNK> but 5 9 out of 10 i'm giving this movie a 3 and even that's generous i've tried to watch this movie three times now the saturday night 9 p m premiere on scifi channel and the saturday night at 1 a m and <UNK> night re <UNK> and i've fallen asleep all three times before the movie ends which leaves me with a <UNK> list of unanswered questions for example is lance <UNK> that <UNK> for cash that he has to keep playing supporting roles in these god awful <UNK> sequels is <UNK> <UNK> banned from doing any non <UNK> movies can't the creators of this franchise do better than a monster that looks like a <UNK> <UNK> alien who walks like he has a stick <UNK> up his a when are the <UNK> characters in these movies going to realize that <UNK> and <UNK> don't hurt the <UNK> why don't they try <UNK> another stick up this <UNK> a instead and lastly are the writers of this movie so <UNK> challenged that they couldn't come up with names for the two <UNK> families more original than the and the <UNK> while you're at it why not write a screenplay about a fictional president and name him george bush someday i may have the mental <UNK> to watch this movie all the way through without <UNK> off to sleep until then if somebody has the answers please let me know
<START> long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and cover girl is no exception to the rule br br a story of a dancer in a nightclub who becomes a cover girl and famous the old <UNK> applies here that happiness and fame always don't mix br br the dance routines are <UNK> choreographed what dancing and chemistry between rita hayworth and gene kelly br br otto <UNK> is the older gentleman who discovers hayworth when he sees her picture that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at the <UNK> <UNK> grandmother br br a jealous reaction by kelly drives rusty hayworth into the arms of broadway producer lee <UNK> br br the picture is basically history repeating itself at the end br br to add to the glory of this fine film there is the always wise cracking eve <UNK> and the hilarious phil <UNK> appropriately named genius in the film
<START> i rented boogie nights last week and i could tell you when i watched the film i had a blast if you think that when you watch the film you will get by the porn i mean yes if your not a porn person who can't bother being by it than this isn't the film to see but the thing is the whole film isn't really about porn well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through the actors played there roles perfect especially mark <UNK> john c <UNK> and william h macy the sex scenes of course are terrific but mainly focus on the character's hype in porn films until there struggles excellent film one of the best br br <UNK> <UNK> 10 10 a
<START> no music no stupid <UNK> a reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in india and based on a real encounter <UNK> in india that is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> how many criminals the lead has killed well you already know that bit brilliance exudes <UNK> <UNK> in the role as a relaxed and <UNK> indian cop the one liners are just hilarious the plot though slightly predictable on review is intriguing all the same another one of the films from ram <UNK> the factory movies which are either decent or really good <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> close to very good but yet remains one of the top 70 films released from india commercial and artsy included br br what is great is the story telling is relaxed and showcases finally in an indian flick how the police network works the cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny the producers are trying for a cannes release which is interesting made by debut director <UNK> i think thats his name br br again <UNK> y o <UNK> <UNK> is brilliant away from his silly shouting roles of the past just shows what a good director can do with a good actor really good stuff if you are interested in indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief br br again <UNK> is the guy who carries the movie on his shoulders and <UNK> the style of the movie relaxed funny intelligent and <UNK> good good acting nice direction all in all great stuff <UNK> ram <UNK> <UNK> company both indian flicks
<START> this movie got better with time i can't believe that it has been forty years since i saw this at the age of 15 yes that's right movie ratings were not yet a reality so any teenager could walk into any movie imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both midnight cowboy and in the same year imagine the times bobby kennedy and martin <UNK> king has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and <UNK> was the <UNK> <UNK> chance to stick it to the man you'll see where robert downey jr got his <UNK> brilliance his old man was an instant hero to kids like me no punches are pulled in this classic and aging hippies will <UNK> when they <UNK> this era hopefully new flower children will be <UNK> by it and this current era of <UNK> will come under the same <UNK> my era was subjected to
<START> boogie nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster films although it doesn't fit into that genre itself the rise and the fall we see the rise of several individuals some of them from complete obscurity to achieving great heights and then falling from grace due to their <UNK> br br i believe that this is the first feature by writer director paul thomas anderson and it's a great start i saw elements of other <UNK> influences such as robert altman but the film holds its own in originality and plot development br br character development is the movie's finest feature i really identified with all of the characters and felt their pain and their success with them all of the performances were brilliant it was especially good to see a small part performed by real life porn veteran nina hartley br br basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result being one of the best films of 1997 which was <UNK> at the oscars probably due to the <UNK> as they would say subject matter and the general <UNK> of the academy
<START> if you like to watch movies because they are pretty you should be okay with this one if you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie skip it at the end of the movie i still didn't know why killed the women the way he did when you set up such a <UNK> serial killer it would be nice to know where the <UNK> <UNK> from in dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn't the best but at least the <UNK> of how he killed the girls was explained they also hinted at a dark background for <UNK> character but didn't explain didn't really say why <UNK> child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed didn't give much of an explanation for the little kid's problem etc if the rest of the story is compelling i don't care about details like how <UNK> all the fancy electronic equipment and underground <UNK> or why the fbi wasn't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer's mind thing would work but i do like to have a sense of what <UNK> the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner
<START> <UNK> is my favorite band so when i heard that this double dvd was coming out i was understandably excited i'll just cut to the chase here and say that if you are any kind of <UNK> fan you must run out and buy this right away it's absolutely spectacular it blows 'the song remains the <UNK> completely out of the water why this material was never released before is beyond me the footage presented here really shows at the peak of their game which i never really felt that quite did jimmy page is the best ever without a doubt and these performances make <UNK> <UNK> look like a <UNK> be on the <UNK> for the live jam <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> jimmy page br br <UNK> led <UNK> br br 11 out of 10
<START> surface from the day its <UNK> first showed in the summer of 2005 was a <UNK> on one hand it seemed so high concept and plot driven that to the it felt like it would work out better as a motion picture or several plus it felt like it was <UNK> attempt at a lost killer on the other hand one may have realized that the story was too <UNK> to tell in a movie or two and fans of lost seemed intrigued br br so after one and possibly only season on nbc the show is on an <UNK> <UNK> that could either put it in the vault on sci fi or filling a gap in <UNK> <UNK> in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond its ratings were some of the better on the network which isn't saying much but the show has been taken off the air with no real official <UNK> of its future br br so is it worthwhile yes br br surface follows a continuing story format driven by plot with next to no filler episodes almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot much like a motion picture no filler episodes which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode yet the show's double edge helped made up for that big things seem to happen every episode but since it feels like a movie you end every episode feeling like little happened and you're left wanting more that <UNK> of the show though shows how great it is the cast is solid the three main leads including the beautiful lake bell as laura put in a solid performance every episode each driven by their own reasons for finding studying the creatures the supporting cast including ian anthony <UNK> and the brief performance by <UNK> <UNK> fill out the cast well the story is slow to start my one regret it doesn't really pick up until a 3 4 episodes in to the short 15 episode season but the latter half of the season makes up for it the visual effects are stunning one's jaw will drop when you see an <UNK> view of one of the creatures <UNK> a ship as well br br many of the show's problems can be <UNK> by <UNK> the complete first season and not having to wait a week or three to watch the next episode br br in short if you've missed the first season and you're curious go back and watch it it's no twin peaks in terms of <UNK> but the high concept nature of it puts in in league with that lost and other similar shows with a flair for action and adventure enjoy it
<START> hollywood is one of the best and the beautiful things that had occurred in my life i admire and am very much fascinated by the way hollywood <UNK> ideas and <UNK> them it makes me wonder about the scope of human brain i saw a long time back but the story direction cast and of all acting is still fresh in my mind the story begins with our lead actor sutherland saying during sunrise what a beautiful day to die for all of us it's a story which shows emotions that are sometimes <UNK> in our mind during our entire life never able to understand few things in life it shows us to get motivated and to improve our quality of life anyway i suggest it to all that watch it once
<START> this was by far one of the worst movies sandra <UNK> has starred in ben affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts this is definitely his <UNK> and acting is not i actually lasted <UNK> minutes into this movie before i was so bored with it i felt compelled to leave the theater it's a bore from beginning to well <UNK> minutes into the film anyway the premise of guess what happened to me on the way to the has been done over and over to death somehow there just doesn't seem to be anything funny or romantic about people cheating on each other parents should be aware that this may not be a suitable film for your teenage children especially <UNK> ones that may view sandra as a hero there is a scene where the writers producers directors thought it would be nice to show how acceptable it is to smoke a joint while driving and then have no consequences at all when caught i'm no <UNK> and i <UNK> my share when i was younger but i guarantee you i won't take my teenagers to see it and they're solid a b students if you want to see a good sandra <UNK> movie rent the net or hope <UNK> which i believe are two of her best works
<START> as i was reading through the comments i was surprised to come across one that said this movie was not very profound i have to has to be one of the deepest and most thought provoking films i've ever seen yes the acting and the music were excellent they have been praised over and over in the reviews however i also praise the heart of the movie it <UNK> with deep meaning and is a story of redemption it is about two very different and very flawed characters beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die it is about a man seeing more value in a girl than she saw in herself it reminded me strongly of the book redeeming love by <UNK> rivers which has a similar story of redemption yes the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking but if you look close enough you may just see yourself in these characters sometimes the <UNK> things in life are not pretty but they are real
<START> i bought this film from e bay as part of a lot of about twenty horror flicks all about a dollar a piece when watching this my first impression was that it probably was from the late 80s later on i began thinking the <UNK> park posters on the wall and everything else seemed to hint that i was dealing with a more recent film realizing that the flick became an unbearable torment the last 3 minutes were the longest in the movie history the film just refused to end is there a genre such as horror for children in that case this film is definitely it if there are parents perverse enough to want to introduce their <UNK> to horror i suggest this would be perfect for kids of about 6 8 the only thing i really liked was greg who was much too good an actor for that kind of nostalgic retro bottom part of a drive in double bill
<START> i have seen shallow grave years ago and that was one of those movies i kept in memory for a very long time it was intense from beginning to end and with plenty of sudden twists but all of these made sense br br i can't tell the same about dead bodies above the title is a <UNK> that claims it to be even better than shallow grave this is a big lie br br dead bodies <UNK> strength and gets far less convincing during the movie br br two supporting characters for example turn out to be a whole lot less innocent than they first appeared to be that could work as a surprise but it didn't surprise me i could see it coming minutes before and that is a big difference with shallow grave br br another thing i have to mention is that characters in this movie often respond not very realistic they behave like that more often when the movie gets to it's end br br i would have found it far more interesting if some of the characters would have stayed completely innocent not knowing what is going on it would have been better for the contrast with for example tommy and his friend who have to carry a huge secret with them br br but no for some stupid reason the makers of this movie decided that all characters should show their darkest sides it does not work in a movie like this br br the end felt much like an open end it left me with an <UNK> feeling i expected a whole lot more of it br br at first i would have given this movie six stars because it is not entirely a bad movie i liked watching it most of the time br br but occasionally i saw some really poor acting and unrealistic scenes and because of the disappointing open end i stick to four stars this time and because it turned out to be a mistake that i have spend my time and money to it unlike shallow grave i will probably forget dead bodies very soon it is just not such a special movie br br the makers could have done a far better job with this movie it is a shame that they did not
<START> lauren debut movie is well directed with a nice polished feel to it there's a strong storyline going on with a meaningful point to it all even if at the end nothing is resolved hence the name <UNK> water the storyline revolves around a lesbian couple and their battle with ones mother for acceptance 7 5 10
<START> everything that you need to know about the pornography of the late 70s and early 80s is all wrapped up in paul thomas <UNK> boogie nights although the film is completely fictional it is actually supposedly based on the story of porno <UNK> john holmes br br in southern california in 1977 eddie adams mark <UNK> is working as a <UNK> in a nightclub one of the regular customers is <UNK> jack <UNK> burt reynolds and two of his <UNK> <UNK> waves <UNK> moore and heather graham jack and eddie meet and jack realizes that eddie is well a little gifted br br so eddie stars in jack's films under the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> he becomes a big porno star no pun intended and seems to be on top of everything then comes the 80s when video <UNK> film and jack's porno empire begins to collapse along with <UNK> <UNK> and everybody else working in the field br br boogie nights is a really well filmed drama there is a little bit of violence but p t anderson makes it more stylized and it kind of is a <UNK> approach to the of pornography especially when vhs became the standard medium for making <UNK> br br a lot of bizarre and unique characters are introduced william h macy has an interesting role as someone working on the films whose wife keeps having sex with everybody i especially liked don <UNK> role as buck the <UNK> salesman the best performance is boogie nights was definitely burt reynolds a 90s classic
<START> this film had some funny moments <UNK> the main character was well cast along with some other decent supporting characters the opening shot of the movie set the tone but the direction and story went downhill from there aside from a twist at the end interesting and funny also i wish this film had better direction and a more developed story without giving any of the plot away the whole idea is better good i just wish it was executed better in this short film the potential was there but it just didn't deliver the goods
<START> this movie has a twist that caught me off guard it made me go over the scenes in my mind to see if there were any clues along the way loved the gorgeous roy <UNK> and joan <UNK> acting the beautiful haunting music stays with me as well as the intriguing story
<START> the funniest thing about <UNK> is that one of the main characters lewis <UNK> has writer's block and apparently so did the screenplay writer for the film this is sad as well as i guess by large this is supposed to be a comedy or <UNK> but that's the funniest thing i can remember from watching this br br three friends go out and drink one night on the way home two decide to get their <UNK> told by a gypsy as they call her those two lives fall apart while the third friend stands by then nothing happens br br i hope i didn't spoil the movie there but really this extremely low budget bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started but quickly into the depths of hell yeah i'm being harsh honestly it wasn't that bad it was just blah br br the aforementioned writer was annoying to watch though he delivered maybe one or two of the only two funny lines the clichéd ladies man the only one that didn't get his fortune told was just annoying the only bright spot was the remaining friend the married dad whose fortune was told that something big was to happen to his son and he needed to be prepared he was funny genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie unfortunately that's not saying much br br perhaps i'm being too cruel heck they got the ambition to make a movie went and got funding and accomplished something unfortunately however i can't at all recommend the film on the basis there's hundreds of thousands of other independent movies that have hundreds of thousands better ideas and <UNK> this one was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretched another <UNK> boring minutes
<START> loved it this has to be the best horror flick of the 90's i br br was at the edge of my seat i jumped a couple times wonderful br br acting it is totally horror but it was funny when it was meant br br to be
<START> the only reason there is a question mark in <UNK> is not because i haven't seen every film released in 2001 thus far it's because this film was only made partly in 2001 the rest of it was stolen from roger <UNK> other dinosaur films <UNK> 1 3 br br i have a confession to make <UNK> 2 is perhaps one of my favorite b movies it borrows so much from james <UNK> aliens it's not even funny but i love it i can't explain exactly why it just works for me i liked the sets i liked the cinematography i liked how they borrowed from aliens it's all a bit ironic that cameron at one point was an of <UNK> with films like battle beyond the stars 1980 br br i own the <UNK> trilogy on dvd and the most i can say for part one is that it has moments the most i can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it watchable br br now we have <UNK> which does not continue that series instead it borrows entire scenes from the <UNK> trilogy and builds a movie around it and somehow roger corman was able to get eric roberts and corbin bernsen to do it now i'm not saying either roberts or bernsen are at any kind of career high but they were both at one point what could be called respectable actors not here sure actors react to effects they won't even see while filming all the time here however they are <UNK> to <UNK> footage from films that are between five and eight years old there's even a whose costume was <UNK> directly after a character in <UNK> 1 apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy back br br when <UNK> was announced i was a wee bit excited i was however disappointed when corman said that they'd be using the old dinosaur models from <UNK> apparently corman decided after this interview was <UNK> that he wouldn't even do that and its not that he couldn't find an fx crew to do it the script for this was clearly written keeping in mind that the story had to be built around pre existing stock footage br br don't compare this to ed wood ed did better than this at least he only used the stock footage of bela once in one film there are ways of <UNK> stock footage into a movie and <UNK> takes this <UNK> upon technique to a new low even if you liked <UNK> 3 primal species stay away from <UNK>
<START> i must i was a little skeptical when i entered the cinema to watch french comedies tend to be so self satisfied nowadays that only the most stupid ones score high at the national box office but i was surprised that though the humor does not always reach the level of the <UNK> <UNK> the many references to the vision of the world in the 1950 which represents are hilarious et the director managed to recreate film making style of that time with an astonishing <UNK> to put it short a bit of a good surprise not to mention the excellent performances from various secondary actors and at least for once jean style which can get on many people's nerves perfectly with the character he plays
<START> the director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns have a look at the outfits everybody looks well <UNK> well <UNK> well dressed and well <UNK> as though ready for church even the horses look well <UNK> and shiny this is a western for crying out loud it's supposed to look dusty nasty and <UNK> and then there's the amateurish acting of the females in this bird the whole lot a dozen or so all pretty and well <UNK> were just <UNK> raped and widowed but hardly a tear flows instead they all look with great interest if not downright lust at the newly arrived magnificent seven who they subsequently feed <UNK> and comfort with love during their battles with the <UNK> the same directing criticism goes for lee van <UNK> who does a reasonable good acting job our lee playing the law just lost his dear wife but lee hard as <UNK> rock shows no emotion whatsoever and finds himself within days of his <UNK> demise in the arms of a <UNK> widow with whom he together with her <UNK> walks off into the future the <UNK> and then there's another thing that always kind of bothers me with this type of films it doesn't matter how many dynamite induced explosions take place in the middle of a pack of some 50 horses never mind how many shots are being fired at the <UNK> on top of them only the crooks get killed and the <UNK> always go their way <UNK> in one piece i know silly <UNK> it's just a movie it's not the worst western ever made but prepare for some serious <UNK>
<START> the fact that this film was shown at <UNK> suggests to me that the print must have been acceptable enough for such a showing now the question is why isn't this long lost and important film available in dvd or even vhs a large number of persons in europe and the usa have for many years hoped to see this film if for no other reason than the wonderful music written for it by <UNK> what does one have to do to get such a wonderful production as this available for a wider public not just <UNK> to the at london having been a devoted <UNK> to music for many years and aware of this film please someone <UNK> <UNK> do the right thing and bring it out as a dvd
<START> so good the acting cutting directing in there may not be the best ever but the dancing the moves the heat and the passion in this movie is definitely the best well <UNK> for me it really touched me inspired me to learn dancing i even especially <UNK> to this site just so i could vote on it and contribute my support for this movie for this movie it literally gave me <UNK> when i watched it i love it jennifer grey is so pretty patrick is so sexy in there the first thing i'll do tomorrow on my way to university will be to drop by the video store n buy a copy of it n watch it again n again till i am old n <UNK> n cant dance with the movie any longer before than i need to learn all the dance moves there
<START> the <UNK> triangle we are told in this waste of celluloid is the <UNK> to another time and dimension and can be crossed using cheap special effects by bad actors <UNK> inane dialogue br br i simply was unable to decide who the makers of this thought would be its target audience as it seems impossible anybody could <UNK> even a <UNK> of pleasure from the outcome avoid its not even bad enough to be good
<START> based on its current imdb rating as well as several plot <UNK> i didn't expect much from <UNK> but how wrong i was br br from start to finish you're kept deeply <UNK> in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while even in terms of <UNK> en scene and cinematography the director excels and creates a film <UNK> of great imagination if you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining but also provocative compelling and genuinely extraordinary then make this the next film you watch br br i'm hoping heath <UNK> tragic death will have lead to more people picking up this film he was an incredible talent and his performance in this is one not to be missed don't make the mistake of judging and this amazing film before you've seen it
<START> i can barely find the words to describe how much this piece of trash offended me why is it that american filmmakers always go out of there way to portray as a bunch of backwards ass bush babies and worse yet cast people to play who sound utterly ridiculous when they try to imitate the accent we are not all extremely dark we do not all walk around carrying <UNK> whether for work or protection we do not walk around naked in our homes and we do not practice voodoo we are doctors lawyers <UNK> <UNK> and women musicians actors and filmmakers i am sick and tired of watching all of these portrayals of as a bunch of wearing who do nothing but sit around all day smoking <UNK> on a beach or shooting guns in the air when we're not living in our tree houses yes we wear clothes yes we have electricity no <UNK> is not legal on the island and chances are we speak better english than you the worst part is this isn't just me being angry and bitter these are actual answers to questions that most who have traveled overseas have been asked at some point read a book before you assume what's it's like in another country and worse yet decide to make a movie about it br br welcome to the land where all we do is murder white people and beat our <UNK> drums tales from the crypt has officially <UNK> me along with the entire crew of people who worked on this garbage especially the writer
<START> you may like tim <UNK> fantasies but not in a commercial like show off lasting 8 minutes it demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace
<START> the <UNK> children besides being a very good made for tv movie shows the very disturbing result of <UNK> it is quite a statement about how being made to act within the confines of what is considered good behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and an individual i think that this is a movie that parents who want to maintain some semblance of the thought that within the hearts and minds of youngsters should watch with their children and discuss what the movie is saying i don't know if that was in any way the intent of this movie but i have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best movie devices against the wish to have children <UNK> to an unrealistic and <UNK> <UNK> of what is in the best interest of anyone other than that of the children themselves i hope to one day see this movie on dvd i am at the starting gate waiting
<START> what can i say about the pleasure planet that i <UNK> t said about <UNK> other tedious soft core porn films very little it s just another movie with a very weak plot used to set up very unconvincing set scenes between male non actors who spend too much time in the gym and <UNK> who have obviously had <UNK> <UNK> actually the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of film as the cast members <UNK> their <UNK> together giving <UNK> expressions like they <UNK> got <UNK> or something no wonder a lot of people claim sex is over rated they <UNK> probably watched too many of these films on late night cable stations
<START> well made documentary about a <UNK> race sanity and the loss of both br br i remembered reading sir francis account of his trip around the world when i was in high school as i watched this film what an adventure that was br br deep water tells an equally fascinating story br br it takes a special person and an excellent sailor to manage a non stop trip around the world alone br br this film does a great job of <UNK> that br br i love to <UNK> and my brother races j 30s br br but i could never accomplish such a feat
<START> i think vampire movies usually are wicked even if the film itself isn't all that good i still like it <UNK> its got vampires in it but this stinks it really does give vampire movies a bad name br br for a start the <UNK> really shows i'm not usually that bothered about low budget films one of my favourite all time movies is el <UNK> which only cost but i hate this the actions a load of crap as well <UNK> to a <UNK> camera which gives you headache br br <UNK> not much more to say other than don't watch this i bought it for <UNK> 50 as it was an ex rental and i feel cheated out of my money even for that low price
<START> what we know of <UNK> suggests a <UNK> with a healthy sense of <UNK> who lived amongst <UNK> and thieves and <UNK> and put them on <UNK> his themes were sex death redemption above all finding the sacred within the <UNK> he lived at a time where homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally involved <UNK> in a society defined by the <UNK> <UNK> the boy for the <UNK> of his scream br br you can't fault derek <UNK> for his cinematography nor his <UNK> of paintings and you certainly can't <UNK> the man of <UNK> away from the homosexuality but frankly <UNK> never <UNK> beyond 80s caricature italian <UNK> becomes the 80s london art scene complete with pretty <UNK> and sean bean is a sexy bit of northern rough his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> performs a transformation worthy of a mills and <UNK> why miss lena without that gypsy you're beautiful <UNK> provides <UNK> with a particularly trite motive for the murder which left him <UNK> br br this could have been a visually stunning treatment of a man whose life was dangerous exciting violent and <UNK> but who nonetheless <UNK> the lives of ordinary people to the status of renaissance masterpieces looked on by and kings instead what you get is pierre et <UNK> do italy the pretty bodies of young boys are shown to perfection but never the men who inhabit them <UNK> appears to <UNK> the london art scene showing it shallow and pretentious to use <UNK> and renaissance italy to make the point is to use a <UNK> purse to make a <UNK> ear in fairness this film remains visually stunning but ultimately as two dimensional as the paintings it describes
<START> how did so many talented or at least charismatic actors wind up in this <UNK> nothing is very good about this movie but the worst things probably are the screenplay and the directing br br apparently this is director <UNK> heart piece as he's both written and directed it and acted in as well he's a card magician himself and seems to have named characters in homage of other famous <UNK> this was his first feature film as far as i know and chances are it's his last br br it's hard to point to exactly what makes it so poor  but i'd say the story and character's are not believable the screenplay and the directing doesn't give it any boost the director plus  the poker scenes are bad in the worst hollywood manner super hands hollywood rules the supposed twists in the movie are either totally predictable or totally unbelievable they just end up <UNK> a <UNK> to a story that at best can be described as a few decent scenes
<START> having just come home from my third viewing of the curse of the were rabbit i decided to jump on imdb and see what others thought i noticed a lot of brits loved it while those in america just didn't get it that really doesn't come as any shock as america doesn't get what english is br br wallace and <UNK> are very english middle class english in fact with a hint of <UNK> throw in for good measure the film is a lot like our two heroes simple and <UNK> it has a nice and gentle plot so the children don't get lost yet there's enough <UNK> there to keep the adults amused too there's some light innuendo which seems have to have offended the <UNK> oh <UNK> drama but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment when people get offended by a <UNK> <UNK> you know the world's messed up br br one quick note to those all american so far that i have seen who think chicken run is a better film chicken run was made to <UNK> to your sense of humour and i think it suffered because of it curse of the were rabbit is witty english and intelligent thomas the tank film was ruined because it was made to please the americans and i'm glad nick park did not let that happen to another great british institution br br to sum up you can keep your chicken runs your your that kind of crude crass slapstick comedy just doesn't compare to the wit and grace that is wallace and <UNK> in curse of the were rabbit english to the core and long may wallace and <UNK> stay that way
<START> even those of us who like cute animal pictures and i <UNK> them would be hard pressed to find any merit in this <UNK> bad travesty of a film perhaps inspired by 101 <UNK> with its smart and loyal dogs its dumb and <UNK> humans and its <UNK> happy and predictable ending the alternate title 101 <UNK> springs to mind that would just about cover everyone involved in its unfortunate production i <UNK> it as some inane hollywood <UNK> of british customs before learning to my horror that it actually is a canadian film done in victoria <UNK> that phony british theme park of a town while sucking tax dollars out of <UNK> on that equally phony pit of canadian mediocrity let me count the ways it is bad the <UNK> plot the <UNK> script the dismal performances and <UNK> direction the <UNK> clever animals the endless clichés and predictable slapstick on second thought neither i nor those <UNK> the imdb have time for a complete <UNK> of its <UNK> yet were i to detail its merits this space would remain blank trust me it is bad a <UNK> <UNK> in the vast <UNK> of truly terrible canadian cinema if you have seen it already my <UNK> if you have not stay away from it as you would <UNK> or <UNK> plague or other movies with cute animals don't even let your children see it <UNK> their tiny minds be <UNK> by the even <UNK> minds of those who <UNK> <UNK> and filmed this <UNK> <UNK> perhaps tonight when i <UNK> i will have a nightmare with ghastly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the bed table as i flee in frantic flight i hope so it will be a far far better thing i do than watch this <UNK> banal but then i might dream that i had to watch it a second time and the sheer terror and cold sweat of that makes me want to stay up all night <UNK> at the very possibility of seeing it again even as a bad dream i might even find something worthwhile to watch in its <UNK> maybe godzilla or attack of the killer tomatoes perhaps the <UNK> video for my built in <UNK> <UNK>
<START> if you re not old enough to remember <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> here s the <UNK> they re a couple of film producers and from israel who set up the cannon film company in the early 1980s the only israeli to get a worse press than these two was begin begin probably deserved the bad press but <UNK> and <UNK> were a god send to film makers because no matter how bad your script was they d happily <UNK> your movie and would normally employ directors who <UNK> t direct and actors who <UNK> t act in fact you often got the impression that people would just walk up to and <UNK> ask them for some money and they d <UNK> without seeing the film maker s resume if only producers nowadays were so <UNK> br br the young warriors <UNK> t a cannon film but <UNK> and <UNK> did <UNK> it and it has their signature all over it it s badly directed badly acted badly edited but it s the script that jumps out and attacks you with its awfulness it starts with a bunch of high school <UNK> getting involved in all sorts of zany pranks in fact the first 20 minutes of the movie plays out like a sex comedy and it s something of a shock when the young warriors turns into a vigilante movie but it s not just any type of vigilante movie like <UNK> 2 or death wish 3 notice a connection they re both sequels and they re both vigilante movies made by cannon films no this is a laughably bad vigilante movie about pretty boy high school <UNK> and their <UNK> going on a mission to wipe out <UNK> this film is proof that <UNK> and <UNK> were giving money to people regardless of their film making abilities and you have to worry about people who seem to spend their entire <UNK> on making movies set entirely around <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the 60s and 70s what lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by these <UNK> it's a shame really as in the 1940s and 1950s <UNK> <UNK> meant quality because they produced so many wonderful tom and jerry cartoons however with the major cost cutting efforts of the late 1950s cartoons in general began to look pretty poor and budgets were <UNK> in fact william <UNK> and joseph <UNK> were fired by mgm and replaced by a team of czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons so in the late 50s the team was out of work and decided if you can't beat 'em join 'em and began producing horrid little cartoons themselves with horrible animation backgrounds and writing br br it's unfortunate but the <UNK> production of crappy cartoons worked too well making them rich and the most successful producers of cartoons of the 60s and 70s during this time again and again bad production values was their norm and a long list of very forgettable cartoons were created in this case the amazingly bad inch high private eye a completely unfunny and stupid idea if you want to know what the show was about the title says it all br br rotten to the core and strong evidence that the production team had total contempt for us kids
<START> i just watched this movie last night within 30 minutes of the start i was hoping it would end br br it had a promising beginning the first 10 minutes the premise of this movie friendship that goes nowhere after they've spent days and years together in separate <UNK> in hotel rooms is just not believable he does kiss her somewhere along the way and she feels <UNK> so terrible about it br br very little substance to grab your interest the acting just does not hold up he is very passive regardless of how much of the movie is shown the viewer never develops any type of a caring connection with the characters on the screen you learn that her next <UNK> will be as boring as her previous one do you have a cigarette he doesn't smoke he wants her to stop smoking doesn't she know this by now br br she calls him in the middle of the night to visit him after a year's absence she comes in through the door they don't even hug or kiss or express any type of emotional connection he doesn't even lean forward to lift her <UNK> to help her in that is not how real people behave this is not how best pals behave br br when he receives her phone call in the middle of the night she is in town for one day he shows little interest to see her face acts more like she will be a burden for the night at this point they've known each other for two years and he hasn't seen her for a year not believable not real br br supposedly he has written a book on <UNK> and yet we never see him write or read or discuss any of his interests in physics with her not that she would be able to handle the discussion we learn that a <UNK> in l a costs 50 it wasn't the <UNK> type mind you he has no problem that fruit we also learn that the airport <UNK> down when a few really really fake snow <UNK> fall off the sky i'm sorry but was that in l a too br br we never see how these two characters survive we never see them at work we never see them struggle they are always on vacation they have <UNK> time they have no <UNK> whatsoever br br nice life unreal life unreal characters bad title bad movie
<START> well sadly i can't help but feeling a little bit disappointed after my much much much anticipated viewing of just before dawn jeff is a terrific filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do great things with a tiny budget but i nevertheless expected to see a far more sadistic and gruesome early 80's slasher but actually i'm beginning to think that isn't the one to blame for this but we <UNK> are it's more than obvious that intended to make his take on the backwoods slasher look like deliverance and absolutely not like friday the 13th which immensely <UNK> the sub genre one year earlier the horror and constant sensation of menace doesn't mainly come from the demented <UNK> with their <UNK> but from the genuinely ominous and isolated <UNK> <UNK> where this movie was shot in case the film seems slow and <UNK> this is only because takes his time to introduce the dark woods and eerie mountains as extra characters in his film we hardly ever see the killers in person but there always appears to be someone <UNK> from behind the trees or from underneath the mountain <UNK> bearing this in mind just before dawn becomes a highly admirable horror effort and actually a lot better than its contemporary blood <UNK> colleagues amidst a nearly endless selection of gory and sickening slashers successfully puts the emphasis back on tension and character development the plot revolves on five twenty something friends heading for a camping vacation in the <UNK> woods where one of them owns a small piece of land the woods are deserted and naturally the <UNK> ignore forest ranger <UNK> george kennedy advise to return back to civilization shortly after they brutally encounter an <UNK> family of which the twin sons have murderous <UNK> all five main characters are surprisingly likable and convincing no irritating stereotypes for which you don't feel sympathy anyway like <UNK> girls or football <UNK> as a result of this natural character you automatically cheer for them even when they eventually almost turn into <UNK> themselves the sublime camera work supplies the film with an at times unbearable tension level and brad chilling electronic score only adds to this effect just before dawn is a fine slice of early 80's horror as long as you don't desire blood to <UNK> from your tv set
<START> very disturbing but expertly crafted scripted and intelligently directed with a good eye for color and detail mary beth hurt sandy dennis and especially randy quaid are unusually good the story centers around a young boy bryan wondering where all the <UNK> they eat every night comes from his parents hurt quaid strange behavior causes the school psychiatrist dennis to get involved it is a gruesome cannibal movie but it's not bad if you like <UNK> you'll love this if you don't like parents stay away from the film just giving advice to cannibal lover and <UNK> br br rated r for strong adult themes and graphic violence
<START> <UNK> wasn't just one of the greatest soviet russian but one of the great masters of the cinema among griffith <UNK> ford hitchcock welles and others one of the greatest things in all his films was the edition very personal and in this movie is exceptional this was his first sound movie and the use of the musical score by great russian composer <UNK> in the sequence of the battle is a perfect contrast between music and image watching this film is like taking a class or lesson in cinema something that no many film directors can afford i never get tired of watch real classics like this film i hope that in near future more people will recognize a great work of art
<START> i find it difficult to comprehend what makes viewer's feel this is a powerful movie i would guess that the main intention of this film would be a character study and the effects of racism in a british community it is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two dimensional and the acting is at the level of a college performing arts course i'm always <UNK> of <UNK> another word for being too lazy to write a decent script i was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience who laughed when they surely were supposed to be moved by the story racism is a serious issue but i think a subtle approach in cinema works far better than laying it on with <UNK>
<START> a man is pulled off a london street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect dull banal film bored the hell out of me more an idea then a film i was half way into this <UNK> minute film when i realized i had no idea who anyone on screen was it was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center there is just an <UNK> of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough its not and while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it especially if one has seen the other better films of a similar <UNK> rendition with reese <UNK> for example
<START> a slight case of murder is an excellent tv movie which is <UNK> worth the price of a rental william h macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress and then has to try to <UNK> the crime although that may sound dark the film is actually quite light hearted and funny with many memorable lines acting is harder than i thought you ever see body heat i think i owe bill hurt an <UNK> and my personal favourite for next week answer these two questions about film noir what do these people do during the day and why is it always <UNK> the film has a great supporting cast including <UNK> real life wife <UNK> james <UNK> and adam arkin a must see for macy fans
<START> okay so i am <UNK> through my mom and <UNK> extensive dvd collection mostly because they don't charge late <UNK> and i come upon a thousand <UNK> i was stunned that here was a movie that had jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer with a small appearance by jennifer jason leigh that i had not seen i don't think i had ever even heard of it before well this is exactly the kind of find that i dream about since i have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and me with a few exceptions neither of us can even get them to consider watching the lord of the rings movies but my dad loves the matrix trilogy go figure we have very similar tastes in movies br br it was a particularly awful day today weather wise it <UNK> rain all day so i popped in this movie and shortly after i was <UNK> br br this has to be one of the all time best <UNK> i have seen jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer are great in their roles especially since they are playing very different types jessica <UNK> character is a people pleasing <UNK> who despite her being the senior child in the family rarely takes a <UNK> role rather she <UNK> to her father jason <UNK> and sister rose pfeiffer and is hell bent on teaching her little sister caroline leigh how to follow suit michelle pfeiffer plays a very strong <UNK> cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger at her unhappy life contained this movie is five years prior to white mind you so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong angry character br br i would have to say that this movie will probably appeal more to women however true movie buffs who enjoy a film for what it is regardless of genre or target audience will have a hard time denying the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do the people involved and those who love them i don't know how i missed seeing this movie before now but it sure was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon enjoy
<START> we all want to fall in love the experience makes us feel completely alive where every sense is <UNK> every emotion is <UNK> it may only last a moment an hour an afternoon but that doesn't <UNK> its value because we are left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives br br i love watching people fall in love it must have something to do with the excellent chemistry between the main characters br br mark elliott a charming sensitive american war <UNK> arrives in hong kong at the dawn of the korean war he finds in han an awesome beauty of true grace br br han a lovely <UNK> doctor is captivated by <UNK> <UNK> and insight br br it was instant attraction when they first met the two <UNK> a passionate affair leading them to fall deeply in love br br their love is so strong so wonderfully expressed that highlights <UNK> married status and the difficulties of the troubled time of the korean war communism and race relations br br <UNK> is an inspired choice for the role not only does he have an <UNK> screen presence but he brings the perfect mix of enlightenment compassion and emotion to the part br br opposite him oscar winner jennifer jones perfect in her oriental look <UNK> beautiful in that traditional and modern asian inspired jones <UNK> her role with personal emotion giving her character a charismatic life of its own she delivers a heartfelt performance turning her character into a woman who <UNK> a spiritual and emotional awakening br br her scene in that <UNK> hill where she takes <UNK> is <UNK> touching specially when we heard <UNK> voice <UNK> we have not missed you and i that many thing br br henry king who has established himself as a masterful director of romances <UNK> the theme tune by alfred newman in the air above the <UNK> harbor his film is colorful elegant with excellent cinematography and set design br br nominated for eight academy awards this beautiful and sensitive motion picture won three best costume design best music and best score
<START> after the general a film that <UNK> the life of <UNK> gangster the general to such heroic proportions that it made the average <UNK> person sick along come kevin and his attempted portrayal of mr lynch or martin <UNK> aka the general the acting is so bad that this crime drama becomes a comedy for the native dub and a tragedy for the kevin spacey fan in short is the movie worth a look no unless u like bad acting with hilarious <UNK> irish accents ah sure to be sure to be the story is ripped off from the <UNK> successful 'the <UNK> which despite is <UNK> of a well known <UNK> animal in martin <UNK> is still worth a look on a domestic scale because it shows real working class <UNK> and on an international scale because of he true irish acting and killer cast including john voight all in all <UNK> decent <UNK> is anything but a decent film avoid
<START> typically i'm a comedy guy i rented this at the video store under comedy and thought albert brooks awesome and rented it it seemed like the romantic comedy and i remembered i hated those and had the full mindset of hating this movie br br boy was i wrong br br while this is a romantic comedy it's acted by an amazing lead supporting cast brooks hunter cusack and nicholson and everything works well within itself the script sounds real and not forced like this could be happening in the news station you're watching at night it takes your emotions and makes you enjoy hunter and brooks and <UNK> hurt which makes the ending a bit <UNK> and <UNK> but it shows how you don't need a happy ending to end a movie you just need a truthful ending which is what everyone got not everybody's life ends well and it shows in broadcast news maybe people don't like the ending because it's not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies but it works it's real and it's genius broadcast news is a classic in it's time and a fine romance movie up there with casablanca well maybe not that high but it's the only other romance i can think of that i like br br broadcast news 9 10
<START> <UNK> and z boys is a documentary about the <UNK> team and their influence on <UNK> it also focuses on the history of <UNK> it was directed by <UNK> <UNK> a member of the original team and was written by <UNK> <UNK> and craig another member of the team the documentary stars the members of the team and is narrated by sean penn br br the documentary talks about the beginning of <UNK> and how it evolved from surfing it <UNK> popularity in the late 60s and the 70s its decline in the 80s and its in the 90s <UNK> was introduced in <UNK> the <UNK> of the poor side of santa monica california the team <UNK> from the surf shop which <UNK> the first modern <UNK> the documentary mainly consists of the original team members talking about the past in the team the <UNK> they won and their popularity and <UNK> it focuses on three particular members of the team <UNK> tony and jay adams three of <UNK> and probably the best three members of the team br br the interviews in the documentary were usually voices over <UNK> footage from <UNK> in the late 60s and 70s very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed but when you do they are shown in black and white while the <UNK> footage was in colour i think <UNK> <UNK> used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past i e the glory days of the team and not the present the documentary is very fast paced in that we often see clips of impressive <UNK> over up beat music of the era such as <UNK> <UNK> led <UNK> and david <UNK> and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point knowing nothing about <UNK> i e not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground i was very surprised that i found this documentary so interesting the reason is that this <UNK> was more about the team than the actual sport of <UNK> so while i couldn't relate to <UNK> i could relate to the boys in the team because it was made by actual members of the team it gives it a little more depth and authenticity br br all in all i would have to say this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen it gave me a whole new insight not just into the team but into <UNK> as a whole for those who love <UNK> i can only imagine how it must be even more interesting seven and a half stars out of ten
<START> few would argue that master animation director <UNK> miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability br br no too many are focused on john amazing ability to steal other movies plots turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be <UNK> as a genius but i <UNK> br br miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually <UNK> themed and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance still miyazaki almost never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies children br br that said i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability where else are you going to have a film where a three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move enthralled a 7 year old my niece <UNK> loving it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> a 12 year old my nephew aaron who's review was of course it was good everything miyazaki san does is good a <UNK> year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er that would be me and a <UNK> year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and i'm <UNK> the older too and loving the <UNK> of the child characters br br and that is what i respect most about miyazaki san he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker on the surface could be seen as a simple story about a little fish girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there a little boy names somewhat like the little mermaid but there is an entire different level at play here true to form miyazaki his film with intensely strong female characters mother mother the older ladies in a <UNK> home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong <UNK> br br but the girl who takes the cake is herself once she decides that she likes the human world she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams her father is trying to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish but young knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination br br once human she teams up with her friend whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a <UNK> that has been inadvertently caused by on her quest to become human frankie <UNK> yes he's related to the <UNK> brothers can we just get past that please gives perhaps the best performance in the film as young which is good since he has the most lines his character is also strong <UNK> but also very <UNK> and friendly characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific br br in the end father <UNK> must cope with his daughter's decision and his wife's wishes to allow her to be human he hopes that and will remember him <UNK> and once again miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical bad guy although miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this it is honestly what makes his movies magical and yet <UNK> no one in real life is completely a bad person all humans are various shades of gray and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters br br and then there's the animation itself in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the <UNK> amounts of effects shots in this film especially the water miyazaki has chosen to <UNK> no cgi whatsoever certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means but every film in this was hand drawn and i for one was extremely grateful for that the character animation was extremely fluid and there even appeared to be some lip sync going on quite unusual for an anime film the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored <UNK> and had an effect all its own on the audience this is what animation used to look like and what it should look like br br in the end i found to be thoroughly enjoyable certainly not miyazaki's best in my opinion that honor is still held by <UNK> delivery service but still a 10 star fun movie for the entire family
<START> <UNK> brother where art is a <UNK> retelling of <UNK> <UNK> set in 1930s <UNK> and rampant with splendid <UNK> that is the trademark of the brothers <UNK> three hapless <UNK> make their escape to find treasure and more than their share of adventure in this delightful film george clooney is in fine <UNK> form as the <UNK> <UNK> leader of the trio but the real acting kudos go to john <UNK> and tim blake nelson as his goofy but lovable <UNK> dubbed the bottom <UNK> by <UNK> character after they receive <UNK> by full <UNK> in a river the three cut a record under that <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> for the cash and <UNK> become overnight <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> status the film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical and there are some incredible <UNK> of film making here the scene at the <UNK> <UNK> is a real <UNK> and is so similar to the scene when <UNK> friends rescue her from the <UNK> castle in 'the wizard of <UNK> that it almost amounts to cinematic <UNK> and what an amazing work of <UNK> it is without giving away the ending i must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory on a par with the spectacular finale of <UNK> another one of my favorites <UNK> <UNK> is a must see a perfect 10
<START> normally i don't like chuck norris films i appreciate his work as a martial artist and his fight scenes are usually fairly well choreographed chuck is undeniably one of the martial arts <UNK> so in my local used <UNK> i found a film i hadn't seen before and took it home br br while the acting in this movie was worse than most norris films i was hoping to see at least one fight scene i quickly began to realize that this wasn't a typical norris film rather it was a christian film destined to illustrate the good will win out <UNK> br br there is really nothing on the <UNK> to indicate that this is a christian film with the exception of the label <UNK> entertainment which i had never heard of before i'll certainly keep that in mind the next time i see a film from that company br br i don't have a problem with christianity i do have a problem with <UNK> <UNK> if someone is going to make a religious film at least have the good sense to indicate to the viewer that such is what they will get the only redeeming part about the exercise is that i spent only 3 25 to spend <UNK> minutes to watch a great martial artist not fight at least it was during <UNK> time and i spent some of that cooking and eating br br in short if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts film and not hoping for much don't bother with this film because it doesn't even offer that
<START> really bad italian horror movie a sort of remake of hammer infamous frankenstein must be destroyed this time with a lady frankenstein taking over the business from father a few <UNK> several <UNK> bits of dialogue no tension at all forgettable
<START> i expected a lot more out of this film the preview looked interesting so i decided to check it out bottom line is that the adventures of sebastian cole only had one decent thing adrian <UNK> br br i really like <UNK> and found his performance to be very pleasing the character is designed well but everything else sort of just <UNK> along through the duration of the movie clark <UNK> is really good but i don't think that his character was explained too well i mean there's not too much to explain he wants to become a woman still something was missing br br the obvious low budget of the film was nice to see i enjoyed that the movie was filmed on just a script a bad one at that and just a few actors it was a nice change br br while the main idea of the film was actually okay it became disappointing to see a lot of scenes that had nothing to do with it just thrown in here and there like i said the script looked promising and i must say that i was interested where director <UNK> williams was headed but it was basically a very slow movie with not too good of dialogue br br sebastian started to look good towards the end but again it fell right back down into a hole the acting was mostly good the writing is in need of some work yet the budget of the film helped it out in the long run br br i would recommend this to someone if they wanted to watch a quiet movie with a strong lead character but other than that i would stay away personally i wouldn't watch it twice
<START> a combat veteran fresh from <UNK> of training <UNK> with an old friend in <UNK> and gets caught up in a power struggle with a ruthless land baron br br but do you really care about that if you're even reading this page you must know something of what to expect it's your typical chop <UNK> complete with ridiculous <UNK> mega corny villains apocalyptic sound editing and a camera that begs for your attention the only reason for being seen in public with this film is the fight sequences wonderfully choreographed by mike stone and true master sho <UNK> franco <UNK> ain't no <UNK> either assuming you can see around the mustache br br well i'm being too harsh there are some good laughs enjoy christopher george repeatedly screaming ninja and delivering arguably the <UNK> death scene ever captured on film
<START> if the caper genre owes a lot to walter huston it also has a debt of <UNK> to jules <UNK> a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his <UNK> when edward accused him of being a communist the end of his american career would have meant the end of mr <UNK> but moving to europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his hollywood demise br br <UNK> is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to mr <UNK> vision he decided to adapt <UNK> le novel because he saw the possibilities for turning it into a caper film that became an instant classic jules <UNK> was <UNK> in paris when he discovered the city that were going to serve as the background to his film the bad weather paid off for mr <UNK> as the streets were always wet and not much had to be done to show them that way br br when we first meet tony he is playing cards tony appears to be in bad health he <UNK> all the time and <UNK> <UNK> after losing all his money he goes to see jo the <UNK> who tells him about a possibility for a robbery at <UNK> <UNK> the fancy jewelry store at a tony section of paris they pass the idea through mario who suggests <UNK> the <UNK> an expert safe cracker br br tony who has come out of prison recently learns that his former lover is now with a creep that owns a night club upon confronting instead of love all he feels is contempt and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his place has no love for tony who is his natural enemy because of his connection with br br when the day arrives the gang is able to get to the apartment building where on the second floor right above the jewelry store the owner lives but he is away everything goes well and the gang gets away with the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> a typical <UNK> man takes a ring as a <UNK> which in turn he gives the <UNK> at the night club this <UNK> mistake is the spark which <UNK> the well thought plan br br jean made an excellent tony he showed a tired man who was possibly doing his last robbery carl robert <UNK> and the director jules <UNK> are seen as jo mario and <UNK> the <UNK> jewelry thieves marie plays marcel plays with a subdued intensity robert <UNK> who would go to direct movies later on makes an impression with his <UNK> one of men br br the film best asset is the great camera work by <UNK> who captured the atmosphere of paris and the locales where all these criminals operate from georges music plays well with the action in the film jules <UNK> was peculiar in his choice of films that he directed and unfortunately that is our loss because this man was a genius as proved mainly with the naked city night and the city and <UNK>
<START> romantic comedy movies are definitely the most <UNK> genre for <UNK> from average movies and source of frustration for viewers this one is a perfect example of this and got a place in my top ten worst movies br br history is far from creative and jokes are weak i found no reason for a single laugh during all the movie characters are plain and the performance of the actors and just good history develops slowly it's tedious and <UNK> ending is also <UNK> and sugar <UNK> br br this is one that movies you watch in a rainy saturday afternoon when you have nothing better to watch in my humble opinion
<START> the film is very fast moving bizarre and colorful it's like mad max on speed <UNK> tons of and make up also very cartoonish as that said cartoon sequence pops up here and there the plot is also very <UNK> but i'll believe it's meant too be the thing that really drives me crazy in this movie is the characters they are painfully irritating especially rebecca played by <UNK> petty she's really annoying i'll believe she is the most annoying creature i've ever seen the editing is also annoying very mtv stylized another thing that's missing from tank girl is an exciting adventure the humor isn't much funny either it has some nice visuals though br br however a lot of people love this film most of them are women and that's not weird at all because this movie is all about girl power tank girl this is a real chick flick and the best example of an hate love film
<START> oh man this movie is amazing it's very good it's a story about a man who isn't so accepting of black people he sits at a bar drinks on his night out and he <UNK> about hippies who are anti war and how blacks and hippies don't deserve to get any <UNK> <UNK> this movie is very realistic because it portrays a guy joe who represented a lot of guys back then and now too the story goes like this joe is in a bar and he <UNK> shoulders with a rich guy who just accidentally killed his daughter's hippie boyfriend and this rich goes to the bar to <UNK> what he just did and while he's doing that joe is in the bar <UNK> about hippies and people who are against the war the rich guy accidentally tells joe that he killed a hippie and obviously joe <UNK> the rich guy cause joe hates hippies amazing movie watch it to see what happens next i liked this movie because it was reminiscent of those days in the early 70's i liked the way movies were shot back then in those days very good stuff it's not like today's movies basically the movie gives you an inner look into the mind of the lead character joe i like the theme of the movie about the working man who's <UNK> his ass trying to make a living
<START> this film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market br br you have a young couple in love but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence when the boyfriend goes to jail the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals who are everyone in this movie except for the cops first she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord jim brown money she becomes <UNK> property then she's basically <UNK> in a military style crack house that the movie is named for br br as if this isn't enough reason to see this movie you also have anthony playing a seemingly conservative school <UNK> <UNK> but he's really a major crack dealer in a sleazy yet hilarious scene he demands sexual <UNK> from the heroine because she has no money for a fix in an earlier scene it was established that he is her <UNK> that scene and another where jim brown forces her to take a hot shower because she stinks are hysterical lead actress <UNK> kay was really good in this film tarantino bring her back br br it's not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that tarantino is a major fan of this it has just the right blend of comedy action sex romance and yes a central message to stay away from drugs jim <UNK> villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80's b villain wings <UNK> in vice squad sometimes i think there should be a b movie oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged in the meantime let's hope that the modern straight to dvd filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor
<START> there's no other word for it fox dumped this out with no marketing of any kind nobody in the country other than those who have been looking forward to this film know anything about it all the red <UNK> have <UNK> it has to be a mess it can't be anywhere near as good as office space right wrong though office space it ain't this film definitely has satirical bite and wit it's a misfire on certain levels but who's to blame is left to mystery br br based on what is currently showing in theatres i can say <UNK> is a good movie it's funny sometimes laugh out loud funny it's effective sometimes ingenious what it isn't as far as i can tell is finished we will see something come of this film again whether it's an extended cut or <UNK> alone it can be hilarious it's <UNK> at times br br leaving the theatre looking around at the mall i was surrounded by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and stupidity it's not quite as <UNK> a <UNK> as 1984 but this movie paints an ugly future for our culture and there doesn't seem to be much anybody can do about it anyway go see this if you can and try to find out what happened that it was so specifically buried
<START> this program is a favorite of our family and we feel it must be released on dvd by seasons the title of promised land is very apt as it is a positive statement about all the good that is left in this great country and the people who live in her it's a god bless america type of program with inspiring stories old fashioned values down to earth characters truthful and <UNK> messages beautiful scenery and well written humor and drama it's a show the entire family is able to enjoy and benefit from without worrying about bad language adult themes <UNK> violence etc we always felt blessed when we were done viewing an episode and can't wait to see each one all over again when they're finally released on dvd
<START> i have seen this film on a sunday evening and i must say there is no better way to end the weekend i am totally pleased with the humor and the warm charm this film offers it simply leaves me in beautiful mood watching this film means having a great time and keep a warm feeling br br the film offers sharp black british humor and feels very fresh to me you really enjoy the story and the characters brenda <UNK> is so great i don't know exactly why she's too old to be a love interest for me and too young to be my mother but i really feel comfortable when she shows up in the movie br br some may say the story was thin and predictable but who cares there simply has to be a happy end dancing in the sunshine are the characters stereotypes or cut outs i don't know better i don't care i just loved them and enjoyed watching them br br furthermore i must say that i usually don't like romantic comedies but this one is outstanding a black comedy with a heart of gold
<START> the only redeeming scene in this movie is when the robots are sent out to fight <UNK> there was one good spinning side kick and that is the best 3 seconds of the movie unfortunately the rest of the movie has very little to recommend it there are better spoofs out there
<START> i saw bits and pieces of this on tv once and when a friend recommended it i began looking for it even though it seemed no place nearby had it i finally got a hold of it in an <UNK> store and couldn't wait to watch it oh that i had seen it a couple years earlier and could've really enjoyed it i was surprised that this movie was only 80 or so minutes long and i think this is what made the plot and story so lacking the plot really does sound like a good one both on the trailer and the movie comments a teenager <UNK> jesse <UNK> and his <UNK> stray lab yellow are <UNK> on an island during a storm on a boat trip with his father bruce <UNK> together they manage to survive the wilderness and wait to be found and rescued still what is never mentioned is that everything is <UNK> and the events of the plot are very rushed there is a possible love interest between <UNK> and sara but they're never shown together for more than a moment yellow is a mischievous dog the parents are reluctant to keep but in a few days he seems to be appreciated enough to join a boat trip the scene of the mother <UNK> rogers mentioning vaguely what death is like to the younger boy joel <UNK> doesn't go anywhere in no time we learn that 9 days have been spent on the island then suddenly it's 14 then 19 of all the animals a <UNK> could be exposed to in the wild only 1 kind a wolf attacks them why couldn't something else have been a problem instead of having the same type of animal maybe even the same one strike twice there are few views of how <UNK> <UNK> food except when he discovers fruit and roots and when he a trapped rat if he knows so much about survival skills why weren't more scenes with it shown the one thing that made me blank was why the dog didn't have much part alone when he is rescued and the dog is left behind on the island there is no scene showing how he survives without a <UNK> help i wished i was more open to this when watching it but i did enjoy some of this the acting was good and the score was enjoyable though i found myself wondering why the father looked so much older than his family and why he and the main search and rescue conductor share names this is a good movie for kids but though the protagonist is 14 nobody over 10 would be interested with this
<START> wow i've never seen nor heard of this film it just came on tv 2 00 am and i am in complete awe setup a bunch of rich fat cats are out <UNK> one knocks a ball into the rough it lands by a ninja a <UNK> man walks over to pick the ball up the ninja grabs it <UNK> it in his hand man pulls gun ninja pulls ninja blows <UNK> into gun barrel gun explodes this is just the beginning of the greatness people everyone must see this movie 10 big <UNK> fat stars from <UNK>
<START> even allowing for my <UNK> love of the first two films in the franchise and sweeping away any sort of biased <UNK> i might of had for the character of max i just can't bring myself to rate at average this <UNK> waste of space that so nearly <UNK> what had gone before it br br gone is the rugged nasty streak that brought feeling to the character mad max gone is the <UNK> feeling of <UNK> in an apocalyptic world and more <UNK> gone is director george <UNK> passion for the franchise the dreadful score matches the cartoon heart of the film it seems that the makers didn't really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make this third and thankfully last <UNK> sure the stunts are spot on to be expected by now and of course miller manages to paint a <UNK> desert landscape by purely <UNK> from what he has done before yet he clearly <UNK> for fresh ideas with the action since the road <UNK> <UNK> glory of the <UNK> <UNK> pursuit is <UNK> here only he uses a train instead br br it's just a very poor show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events back in the mid 1980s but when viewing the three films together now <UNK> just comes across as a director losing his edgy approach whilst sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action and the truth is that neither of those genre <UNK> would have worked <UNK> in the context of this series anyway i give the film 3 10 purely for one real good <UNK> fight sequence while the stunt men here deserve some credit at the very least but this is the third time i have tried to like this film and as <UNK> for punishment as i undoubtedly am i wont be trying again ever
<START> in a minute to pray a second to die clay <UNK> alex <UNK> is an unhappy outlaw with a ten thousand dollar bounty on his head and <UNK> <UNK> br br realizing his days as an outlaw are <UNK> he wants desperately though somewhat reluctantly to take advantage of an <UNK> being granted by rough and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> robert ryan excellent performance who badly wants <UNK> to <UNK> his ways and accept the <UNK> as an example to others while in the <UNK> <UNK> of outlaw mario plans to kill <UNK> to stop that from happening br br also starring arthur kennedy <UNK> and a slew of other familiar european faces this is co written and produced by american spaghetti western <UNK> albert band also responsible for the pre <UNK> film <UNK> at red <UNK> br br though the solution to the main character's <UNK> is lifted straight out of howard <UNK> el <UNK> the script is solid pretty fresh and <UNK> this has a great balance of action and story and alex <UNK> is great in it he really should have been a bigger star br br in defense of the shorter well dubbed english version personally i'm past that age where the longer version is always the better version and the ending where <UNK> is ironically <UNK> down by <UNK> bounty hunters after his <UNK> is needlessly <UNK> and completely destroys the film's message about hope and redemption br br call me old fashioned but i <UNK> for <UNK> and felt he earned that happy ending
<START> if i was still 5 i might find it scary it is i guess a low budget film the acting is not good but could be worse the filming and special effect is awful the story line is thin and not worth to <UNK> on too much time is used on boring shouting scenes the chases or fight with aliens remind me of kids fighting with scary masks on some gore with blood and body parts would scare a 5 year old kid i guess apparently scare the crap out of some of the persons in the film br br it is far from reaching anything like the film tremors br br this turns out to be an incident and we see alien ships nearby earth it make you wonder if any will make a sequel
<START> and totally non scary film the characters doesn't interest at all and most of the time is spent in a car the dog is at best ugly never really scary to interest a more threatening menace would have been needed at least a few people you care for and evokes some emotions in you and not the least something interesting must happen something unexpected as it is this film just drags on and on in what seems like forever maybe a saint <UNK> was not that smart to choose as the terrible threat to life and society br br in most scary movies thrillers mystery just whatever genre there must be characters that sparks interest and makes you want to know what happens here you really don't care you just wait for it all to stop and wondering if it wouldn't be better to see something else one of the weakest king adaptations
<START> the trouble with this sort of lyrical film making is that you either make a masterpiece or a <UNK> there's little middle ground putting it gently this is not berlin <UNK> of a city or man with a movie camera unfortunately it's not much to look at either br br the problem with this one is that it's <UNK> and half baked as if michael moore had come on board it doesn't really have anything to say or rather to show us with pictures and sounds uses images <UNK> to <UNK> a <UNK> this is just a <UNK> in search of a point though quite inadvertently the movie tells us more about the mind of uncle sam than it <UNK> there is something profoundly <UNK> about an anti technology anti <UNK> anti media movie that is so profoundly <UNK> up with technology <UNK> as i say and not as i <UNK> you just gotta love the <UNK> eh <UNK> there's something sour and <UNK> about this episode both the prior episodes had moments of <UNK> and <UNK> this time the tone is consistently <UNK> it simply doesn't work over this duration as <UNK> will tell you br br <UNK> <UNK> is a mess the digital stuff is particularly misguided it gives the whole thing a totally <UNK> look and it also <UNK> the <UNK> nature of the <UNK> i mean i pity the guys part of the joy of was that it was a homage to the use of <UNK> film but now <UNK> film's an historical <UNK> they have to <UNK> on the digital <UNK> but i don't think they bring it off the digital stuff often looks like video <UNK> from <UNK> or bbc world and with the found footage well the digital manipulation is often ugly and usually just silly and the false colour and <UNK> kept me thinking of br br <UNK> br br james bond title sequences br br <UNK> odd as it may seem there is also the possibility that the movie has been simply stolen by <UNK> <UNK> performance it's about as <UNK> as a lawrence olivier voice over the images would have to be jolly compelling to stack up against all that charisma br br philip glass himself is on odd form never expected him to knock off the <UNK> <UNK> made me laugh which of course is not the desired response to any part of this movie there's even one piece of music that sounds like perhaps they've changed his <UNK> br br from our department is geoffrey actually a <UNK> indian at all or did he just do a in hollywood hills oh and are the various snippets bits of footage from earlier <UNK> in the trilogy a commentary on the way these movies too are part of the global media <UNK>
<START> there's not really that much wrong with crash of the <UNK> basically it's a few episodes of rocky jones space ranger <UNK> into a film it is extremely dated however treatment of is a good example of this one has to remember that it was <UNK> to be shown to children in the 1950's in this respect it succeeds if you like children's sci fi from the 1950's go ahead and take a look at it you'll see john <UNK> in a pre sgt <UNK> role he does a pretty good job in it all in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10 not great but not bad
<START> i <UNK> at imdb solely for the purpose of warning others about this movie does anyone ever get funding for projects like this that's the mystery farewell to harry might be the worst movie ever except that i tried to <UNK> the others that rival this idiocy bad plot not credible logic runs throughout i can't spoil this movie for you by revealing anything that would make your experience less enjoyable there is nothing enjoyable about this movie i have the cd and will send it to you for free it is that bad first come only served if i know you this offer is void because i wouldn't <UNK> this movie on anyone not on purpose you have been warned
<START> this is definitely <UNK> most and thought provoking piece not to say that <UNK> or insomnia are bad but they were definitely up to more hollywood standards while following is more of an indie flick the story is very brilliant and very well developed overall watch this if your a fan of any of <UNK> work i'm sure you'll be able to appreciate it more
<START> when i went to see bon voyage i expected a good <UNK> on the order of grand hotel 1932 and les <UNK> de <UNK> 1944 it was better than that with few exceptions none of the characters were totally good or totally evil just as in real life the acting was wonderful especially those who played <UNK> and <UNK> the photography was amazing as it <UNK> the period perfectly and managed to be shot in around <UNK> during a time of new public works but managed the look of june 1940 costumes and make up were accurate there is so much in this movie that it's worth a second viewing it's exciting funny and ultimately touching n b be sure to see it in a theatre with good quality projection it's in wide screen and in the theater where i saw it the in the first 30 minutes had the subtitles at the bottom in focus but the actors' faces slightly fuzzy this was ultimately <UNK> but <UNK> from the pleasure of the film
<START> this is a good film for die hard <UNK> fans okay i'm sure it's not as good as what the child's play movie were like but this can get really funny and enjoyable <UNK> laughs are hilarious br br spoilers br br now not one doll but two meaning double the impact jennifer <UNK> played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie br br if you have seen the child's play movies this would be a worthy film on your <UNK> collection but if you've never seen the child's play movies before <UNK> will be a new start of course you'll not have a clue on how <UNK> got into his current state cause i'm not telling you but you'll figure out why <UNK> is very popular br br overall a very enjoyable movie
<START> the hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from agatha christie and of course <UNK> <UNK> s set on a country house on a weekend as always all the guests are suspects and it's up to <UNK> to figure out the truth with movies like this it's always best not to give too much away so i'll stop here what i loved in the <UNK> was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way when <UNK> arrives everybody is around the body for example everybody seems to be the <UNK> there's that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story br br you can expect a wonderful time giving <UNK> as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised a cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experience br br the actors are all very good as a curiosity notice edward <UNK> who played dr watson in sherlock holmes nice to see him after a few years <UNK> is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the time br br i did find out who the murderer was but still it's not predictable and it's also very believable br br so in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasure br br
<START> stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy chaos begins with stan curiously pulling <UNK> leg cast string and manages to push the doctor billy gilbert out the window <UNK> on to it getting ollie strung up to the ceiling when the situation <UNK> down stan gets <UNK> clothes as the doctor wants them both to leave and he also manages to sit on a <UNK> accidentally left by the nurse filled with a sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is driving which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and a little predictable classic comedy it isn't great but it's a black and white film worth looking at stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the <UNK> comedian okay
<START> honestly mr if you do a drama movie in a high school setting following a bunch of teenagers through a school day and if you mess up the time frame and jump back and forth if you do that you can't use the exact same visual story telling device of elephant which is using a camera that is passing of from one character to the next and having scenes shown 3 times from different angles you just can't do that because this is such a blunt rip off its hard to believe anyone gave this more than a 5 rating br br where elephant which was released 3 years prior to this movie uses school shootings or to be exact the <UNK> shooting as the <UNK> point for its script 2 <UNK> uses teen suicide and seeing the reviews the shock value of that subject worked its the same slow story telling a lot of dramatic piano music all leading to a finale you know from the beginning at least the characters look like they tried hard to be somewhat different in that department so you got a <UNK> gay guy who looks acts like a <UNK> <UNK> a hunky lover boy who can't deal with his gay side brother and sister from a rich family who both got their very own problems and here comes the nose dive br br you also get a spoiled <UNK> chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ever a guy with medical conditions who <UNK> his pants because of 2 syndrome who actually never heard of the invention of <UNK> but rather <UNK> his pants in the <UNK> and then change into new clothes and does so every day wow as hard as this movie tries to be realistic this is the most absurd thing i have ever heard he gets beaten up on the toilet and is obviously ashamed of it but doesn't wipe the blood of his nose when going through the whole school with wet pants and a bleeding nose thats new age realism directly leading to the twist and final character who turns out to be the suicide victim br br after watching the very realistic life of teenagers one day including incest rape teen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pressure for <UNK> and appearance and the gay subject mentioned before kind of like your very realistic daily soap trying hard to be we watch a girl die we met once in the beginning of this movie and who has no reason but that the guy she had a crush on left the room when she was talking to him in a thoughtful piano playing sequence btw seen that somewhere before and it gets even better before <UNK> her <UNK> in a painful long scene of yes and no she asks 2 guy if he is ok constantly smiling and then she cuts her <UNK> with <UNK> in a school toilet br br now you got a movie that is a total rip off of elephant fails with some really sloppy story telling the whole rape incest thing was pretty unbelievable too by the way and people call this a shocker br br what the heck is going on is all it takes to take some pseudo dramatic music boring story telling and adding a shock subject on top and people think there is a major deep message here i think elephant is way overrated already but that movie was the original while this here is an obvious rip off failing on many more levels i have never ever seen a more <UNK> stealing of a whole movie concept in my life and believe me i watched a hundred of horror movies so i know how low you can go there this is a total let down in all <UNK> its nor realistic its stolen its damn slow and by all means i wonder whats more useless another romantic suicide many give this point to the movie which makes me wonder if they only watch romeo juliet all day long because there is dozens of movies which deal with the subject in a clear non romantic and more realistic way or this ridiculous set up come on i am still trying to work out if 2 guy or the suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous
<START> two hands restored my faith in aussie films it took an old premise and made it fresh i enjoyed this movie to no end i recommend it to those people who like guy ritchie films bryan brown was fantastic and just about perfect in a role <UNK> made for him ledger was dumb and his performance <UNK> a very satisfying movie for me
<START> one of the better teen comedies to be filmed during the 80's valley girl has a young nicolas cage in a starring role deborah <UNK> is fun as the object of <UNK> desire and whatever happened to her look for veteran actors <UNK> camp and <UNK> forrest as <UNK> hippie parents they're quite funny
<START> two little girls strike a friendship one tries to convince the other she's a witch the other is a <UNK> who <UNK> to the would be <UNK> will on and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls with many a dramatic cut away as they pose shocking questions you know the kind sweet little children shouldn't ask such as how do you make a deal with the devil <UNK> creepy br br in the end the <UNK> is sick of being controlled by her <UNK> friend her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end but by the time it comes you won't care in the least br br i can imagine this film may have been frightening to a very religious 1960s mexican <UNK> but it doesn't even hold up as a charming <UNK> it merely drags on it is boring it is pointless it is not to be watched br br there are many here who have a lot of good things to say about it based on their knowledge of the director's other works and of course that common <UNK> everyone says about pointless films ah the cinematography is wonderful those reviewers probably have a point but for the ones who found this movie with no prior knowledge who don't care about its photography its atmosphere or its whatever else it has for these viewers then who just want a good movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half do yourselves a favour folks br br skip it
<START> johnny <UNK> has gone insane br br in the first jackass he delighted in practical jokes more so than the physical stuff  his opening car rental gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more akin to some type of extreme <UNK> camera  but in jackass number two he's really off his rocker br br beginning with a sequence where he is chased through a living room by a bull or later when he rides a rocket a stunt which almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket and especially when he stands <UNK> in front of a defense <UNK> and takes a <UNK> of to the stomach <UNK> is a madman in the first film <UNK> and steve o  notorious party animals  were the daring ones but you know it's pretty bad when you see <UNK> <UNK> them to do a stunt br br this is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by <UNK> constantly trying to one up each other it will eventually end in death for one of the cast members  in jackass 2 steve o nearly loses a leg to a shark <UNK> as aforementioned is nearly <UNK> with an explosion from a rocket and so on and so forth jackass 3 has already been confirmed <UNK> to the success of 2 and frankly i can't imagine any stunt out performing the bull run in the opening scene of this film  that's incredible footage it's almost unbelievable and i wondered whether it had been <UNK> but apparently it was 100 genuine which is actually kind of frightening and in terms of extremes jackass 2 far <UNK> its predecessor  it also feels more cinematic than the first film with less of the cheesy titles <UNK> stunts that were made famous on the original mtv television show br br unfortunately the boys were given too much freedom here and a good number of the gags are simply lame <UNK> in <UNK>  i can enjoy the occasional <UNK> gag but watching a man <UNK> himself on a <UNK> toilet or see steve o take beer up the butt yes honestly gets grating after a while even the frat boys in the screening i attended  who were enthusiastic when wee man took a playing card up the rear and got <UNK> by a <UNK> chair  were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film it's not a matter of getting away with as much as possible  it's a matter of saying is this even entertaining or funny many times sadly it really isn't br br but for every lame stunt involving <UNK> matter and <UNK> on people's faces there are some brilliant hidden camera bits wacky director spike adaptation dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked with <UNK> breasts and no shame and my personal favorite skit involved <UNK> as an irresponsible old man out for lunch with his <UNK> letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people that's classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an r rating it's a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff  including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank  with <UNK> jokes along the way br br still there's enough sheer spirit and <UNK> in this film to merit a viewing and it's really taken the concept of <UNK> in cinema to new heights
<START> i was 13 <UNK> of age when i saw this greatly <UNK> film at the adams theatre in <UNK> <UNK> i purchased the program and later bought the soundtrack still have both i am now <UNK> <UNK> and have not seen it since possibly once on network tv in 1960's one of the greatest casts ever assembled great score and production please let another generation see this great film it was my introduction to opera and aided with my understanding of tolerance please family of or release this classic soon
<START> the third film from the polish brothers is their best most beautiful imaginative film yet though many audiences will have a problem with lack of traditional dramatic structure stick with it jack the plot is difficult to <UNK> so just know that the story includes agents trying to <UNK> a city god in a cowboy hat the selling of angel wings and a sick orphan but it all works m david extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at the performances of the actors working with the polish <UNK> offbeat script are pitch perfect and give the film its emotional punch the strong <UNK> audience member will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story the comic and moving actors and finally the incredible courage and command that michael polish shows behind the camera again all of these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together <UNK> in one of the most incredible things you should run out and experience a great great great movie
<START> i went along to this movie with some <UNK> the original is a masterpiece of both writing and acting and unfortunately my fears were realized this is a <UNK> piece of work and i sat in the theater waiting for the wit and humor to begin i'm still waiting it seems <UNK> the storyline to the present time just didn't work and the <UNK> of characters an absolute travesty why did they introduce bette <UNK> character when she disappeared just as quickly as she arrived the related character in the 1939 original was an integral part of the plot the women in the cinema laughed a few times but nothing touched me as being funny with the exception of a line from meg ryan talking to her mother about her situation and telling her that <UNK> not like a 1930's <UNK> i sorely wished i was viewing the 1930's version it was all too <UNK> <UNK> stick <UNK> and really needing some of the <UNK> wit and clever dialog from the original play i still watch the original movie and pick up a line that i have never caught before there is no sense of closure to this new version and whilst the 1939 movie is politically incorrect by todays standards each thread was tied up and when the movie ended it did so strongly this remake should be labeled with a warning for any viewers if you know the original don't bother i felt cheated by losing part of my life in a cinema watching this <UNK> piece of fluff bring on the jungle red
<START> the cure is a very touching and poignant drama the film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends one of the boys has aids the boys become good friends despite <UNK> at first the film shows the boys journey to discover the cure which is in <UNK> according to the national <UNK> and how it affects their relationship the acting is wonderful i have never seen <UNK> <UNK> do better and the movie is just plain touching i couldn't stop crying with the shoe scene this is a good <UNK> keep the <UNK> nearby 8 10
<START> it's initial premise is based on the american civil war but it's ultimately a love story we start at the beginning of the war where the main characters kidman law are obviously aware of each other and there's an obvious attraction they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war the main thrust of this film is for <UNK> character to return to <UNK> and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns the reason it fails to convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before <UNK> character leaves for battle it's difficult to believe the premise that 2 people <UNK> for each other so much given they've had so little contact everything else is just about fine <UNK> <UNK> and her <UNK> father and his <UNK> are lovely <UNK> as is the threat from the gang chasing sure it's a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great an <UNK> attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless
<START> wow i'd hate to sound <UNK> but anyone that rated this movie any higher than i just have must have an i q that reaches <UNK> low depths which reach out beyond time and space and connect at planet hopper is a <UNK> for making this movie wow this movie <UNK> fred <UNK> <UNK> looks i actually considered <UNK> fred ward some money in <UNK> for that miserable <UNK> he owned in this awful film jodie foster of course didn't have much to work with but still manages a terrible performance throughout joe <UNK> oh my joe <UNK> who mysteriously is not cast plays the ultimate stereotypical joe <UNK> movie character complete with mob killing and constant use of the f word you won't believe your eyes dean <UNK> watching him in this mess made me feel bad for him because i actually thought he was either <UNK> or <UNK> retarded throughout the course of the film jon <UNK> must have been <UNK> himself when he agreed to be in this along with vincent price bob dylan and charlie sheen i know what you're thinking great cast i know and it was the worst great cast film i've ever seen dennis hopper directs and stars and does equally bad in both areas how the man could have directed easy rider and then this is far beyond my excellent imagination his outrageously bad hit man character accent is beyond the <UNK> of horrendous and only is <UNK> by the hilariously bad ending they hopper and foster are the most uninteresting couple i believe that i have ever come across in my exposure to the world of cinema and you will be cheering for them to lose and then be <UNK> <UNK> by the ending what exactly are the two of them wearing at that action filled conclusion i don't know but i do know that if i ever meet dennis hopper i will make immensely make fun of him for being responsible for this waste of celluloid join me ian
<START> pretty darn good for a french film i have not seen any of catherine previous films and so have no opinions about this compared to her previous work french cinema usually sticks to the ultimately arty films and leaves the shoot em ups and star vehicles to hollywood that is probably a good business <UNK> as no other <UNK> film industry will likely have the resources to compete on those sorts of projects films about film making are often a bore as it has little <UNK> for people not in the business but this one held my interest much more than i thought it would in spite of the title oddly in english it really isn't much of a comedy in spite of a few <UNK> moments i've only seen a few of anne films but she shows a generous amount of talent and range from the action psychological drama of la femme <UNK> to the <UNK> comedy of innocent blood this film also <UNK> her range as she plays a more or less ordinary woman yet is still compelling on the screen kudos also to <UNK> with whom i was unfamiliar she plays a very <UNK> actress for most of the film whose talent is drawn out at the end if you don't have to have car chases and explosions to be entertained check this one out
<START> los angeles <UNK> tom reed vincent <UNK> survives a tragic auto accident but ends up going to prison in the high desert of california when his time is up he lands in a small wind swept town named <UNK> <UNK> his first stop is a bar where he quickly <UNK> a beer and gets hired as a bartender so much for ex cons having a tough time finding work this is the first in a long line of <UNK> that make up the plot of writer director harris silly attempt at modern desert set film noir br br his first night on the job tom meets a sexy femme fatal named sunny alexandra <UNK> who hangs out with a family of bad boys the <UNK> of uncle dean <UNK> henry and his two <UNK> the drug addicted owen kevin <UNK> who is <UNK> husband and <UNK> soldier randy <UNK> s brian austin <UNK> after his shift is finished there's a shooting and dr tom just happens to be nearby he agrees to treat one of the wounded and most importantly not tell the cops i'm not sure that's a good move for a guy fresh out of the pen but this script co written by diane fine has very little to do with logic br br tom makes a series of poor decisions that get him further and further <UNK> with the criminally inclined boys including stealing medical supplies and <UNK> into the sack with sunny everybody in the theater is screaming don't do it walk away but tom does it anyway br br in a classic film noir like body heat or double <UNK> we root for and empathize with william hurt and fred as they get sucked into the web of bright sexy <UNK> femme like kathleen turner and barbara stanwyck it's not their fault we'd probably be tempted by all that money or that particular dame too but dr <UNK> weakness seems to <UNK> from stupidity more than circumstances sunny is sexy but not a very compelling character and there's no money to <UNK> him you're left wondering if he attended the same medical school as dr nick <UNK> from the simpsons br br the silly script would have you believe that a rural home has almost everything you need to treat a <UNK> to the stomach and that one so wounded could easily hop to attention and effectively participate in a fist fight it gives us an implausible car chase with one of those the club things to the <UNK> wheel oh that oil <UNK> that just <UNK> no one noticed that br br i wonder how such a ridiculous script ever got green <UNK> perhaps brian austin <UNK> has more juice than i gave him credit for it's obvious that he took the relatively small role of randy a hot headed murder to show producers that he had more acting range than he displayed on <UNK> br br it's also sort of sad to see nicholas <UNK> playing a stereotypical hispanic drug dealer he deserves better than this br br if you have an iq over 50 <UNK> <UNK> will have you shaking your head in disbelief i'll give it 3 stars for the unintentional laughs and the scenes with the sexy miss <UNK> running around in her red <UNK>
<START> sophisticated sex comedies are always difficult to pull off look at the films of blake <UNK> who is arguably the master of the genre and you will find just as many misses as hits for if a film of this nature ever fails to work it can never fall back on the tried and true toilet humor of a teen sex comedy i e american pie or warm the audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy i e julia <UNK> entire career it can only maintain a push to the end and hope that the audience can appreciate the almost required irony of it's resolution br br written by husband wife team <UNK> and <UNK> forbes seeing other people opens with engaged couple ed alice jay <UNK> <UNK> nicholson only seconds away from rear ending the car in front of them as the frame <UNK> we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters from here on out we welcome that the story about to unfold will enjoy a point of view from both <UNK> br br two months shy of their <UNK> ed alice already look and act like an old married couple in an early bathroom scene their actions alone show us just how comfortable they are with each other and how long they have been together so when the line to <UNK> the plot forward is <UNK> <UNK> from the least likely of the two it is as if the very relationship itself is calling for a change even if it means it's own destruction br br once all the ground rules are set ed can not sleep with her mother or for that matter <UNK> <UNK> the two head off in their separate directions in the hope of finding some meaningless sex to <UNK> their relationship at first everything seems to go as planned as their daily <UNK> only help to fire up the passion between them but predictably as the deeper emotions of regret and jealousy begin to emerge they soon find themselves growing apart and on the verge of breaking up all of these actions leading to a resolution you may or may not like depending on your own degree of cynicism br br for a comedy like this you need a solid cast with supporting characters just as strong as the leads and director does not disappoint here he has cast two of my favorite actresses as sisters <UNK> nicholson lauren graham and allows them to play to their strengths for nicholson who has always reminded me of a young shirley <UNK> she brings an air of <UNK> and vulnerability to alice even when her actions seems less than so and as for graham an actress who has <UNK> she could <UNK> an entire howard <UNK> ensemble she steals every scene she is in with an edgy no <UNK> persona br br as for the guys jay <UNK> is <UNK> here as is josh charles malcolm in the middle 's byron <UNK> has to be <UNK> for taking on a british accent and letting it all hang out but the real treat here is andy <UNK> and his sub plot involving single mother helen slater while his scenes almost seem to belong in another movie they are by far the funniest and his dead <UNK> delivery steals the show br br for an independent production seeing other people has a more personal and <UNK> feeling something that would be noticeable absent from a big hollywood film of this kind not to mention that this film also has some genuinely funny moments unlike say most hollywood comedies in general br br rating on a 5 star system 3 1 2 stars
<START> i thought the movie started out a bit slow and disjointed for the first hour however it became more absorbing fascinating and surprising in its last two hours so while it starts out like a cheap horror film it <UNK> into a beautiful and wonderful fantasy film br br bridget fonda stands out as the snow queen this was her best performance and it is sad that this apparently was her last performance as she has not acted in the last 7 years she absolutely <UNK> both the beauty and <UNK> of winter br br my daughter age 14 found the film a bit frightening so if you are showing it as family entertainment please stay with your child and <UNK> her or him that it is just a fairy tale fantasy and not to take it too seriously br br it is really one of the best fantasy films that i have seen in a long time slightly better than <UNK> or any of the lord of the rings it is about as good as the golden <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> height of the scale of this movie <UNK> me about a week ago i posted a commentary on the <UNK> silent epic <UNK> in hell referring to it as <UNK> then i encountered the bros blood red planet wow br br it's all about the scale of the thinking behind it the bros and colleague john <UNK> were thinking so big that the <UNK> of arthur c clark stanley kubrick's 2001 a space is lucky it was released thirty two years before this sweetheart as a matter of fact kubrick had it easy with a budget actual actors and major studio backing for his little star trek ripoff and all that arthur c clarke had to do was write the damn thing what's so hard about <UNK> around a <UNK> the brothers on the other hand had to think radical outside of the box and quickly they <UNK> a half dozen of their friends colleagues including a hot <UNK> chick bought a bunch of colored <UNK> old office supply <UNK> for every keyboard <UNK> and hands free phone <UNK> they could find got everybody identical black made off with every tin in the county learned enough 3d <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> a couple of space ship fly <UNK> spent a couple hours <UNK> up a script executed what is easily the most frightening space monster puppet since that horrible little monster <UNK> the <UNK> carried around with him was fried by <UNK> spent literally days working with a vhs camera and an to shoot edit their film and came up winners this is the best d i y direct to home video fan movie space epic i've ever seen and in <UNK> to the amount of talent resources at the <UNK> of the filmmakers <UNK> even <UNK> run or battlestar galactica the original series as being a chilling look at our future right down to a <UNK> wearing a <UNK> matched ill fitting 2nd hand suit as a species we are doomed br br seriously for a minute though it is a vast improvement upon such later epics as the dinosaur or alien <UNK> which is funny since it was made before either of those masterpieces somewhere along the lines the started taking it easy on themselves this film is executed with a certain conviction that gets you to believe that you really can breathe in a <UNK> wearing a dust mask and two biker <UNK> <UNK> and the scene where the alien beast <UNK> a <UNK> crew member made me immediately think of where i'd seen that before godzilla vs the sea monster where the giant <UNK> monster <UNK> <UNK> two and eats them on camera that made me cry when i was a kid br br this made me cry as an adult because here i am wasting my time trying to be some sort of critic or writer or writer critic and these guys get to have all the fun actually making a real feature length sci fi epic with lots of cool colored lights a hot chick and a talking slide <UNK> named <UNK> one of the flight crew even gets to wear his black space baseball cap backwards <UNK> with his <UNK> like that clown from <UNK> is this supposed to be a joke no it is an epic statement about humanity from humanity and for humanity that deserves to be seen by anybody who has the <UNK> to not take any of it too seriously look for it on a 2 disc box set called galaxy of terror in your favorite <UNK> <UNK> dvd <UNK> which is probably where it belongs but how many of us can say yeah they have a couple box sets of our movies for sale at best buy br br 4 10 anyone lacking in a sense of humor might want to try silent running or maybe <UNK> but someday an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will <UNK> a <UNK> of this movie and decide that we actually are not to be messed with good work guys
<START> i <UNK> walked into this trap of a movie br br if i could turn back time or simply get a <UNK> i would be happy br br it was 7 <UNK> and cinderella man didn't start until <UNK> so i rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 7 and i dare say god reached out his hand or <UNK> it and allowed me to <UNK> myself for my film <UNK> by sitting in for this film br br it may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my <UNK> male <UNK> however there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing this movie was at most worthy of a <UNK> project budget and i think i've seen better in those play acting french shorts that we used to do about louis br br maybe it's because i'm canadian and this film was for the la <UNK> <UNK> crew and their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was me when i realized that then entire audience save me <UNK> up at all the jokes and <UNK> i fully understood the hinted humor but i just could not relate br br this show did show me supposedly how gay men date and build relationships however even if it was their purpose of the movie i feel that the <UNK> was focused on too heavily the humanity seemed lacking but again maybe that was the point simply to be avant <UNK> and to make a <UNK> br br i guess with a low budget and poor equipment you have to make your movie as loud as possible in order to get crowds and cash return i really wish i had simply read my <UNK> van instead <UNK> i was totally the wrong audience
<START> what a refreshing change from the pg movies that have teen girls jumping in and out of bed young high school boys counting how many girls they can hook up with kids drinking doing drugs etc etc etc carl has written so many books that are enjoyable but hardly classic literature but he has finally written something that middle school kids want to read and this movie sends a message to kids that maybe they can make a difference that maybe their voices can be heard filmed in south florida the scenery is beautiful and natural and real who cares if its predictable and a little corny so was free willy and look how well that did this is a good family movie a rare breed
<START> the first time i saw this movie it didn't seem to go anywhere when i watched it a second time though it made a lot more sense give it a chance watch it more than once there are a lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it the cohen brothers brilliantly <UNK> actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline the combination of <UNK> leading role <UNK> well with <UNK> and <UNK> supporting acts john <UNK> appearance in the movie is hilarious the soundtrack is great as well this movie has become a household favorite for my family 10 10 for sure
<START> i watched this movie based on the comments of a few that said that is was bad but funny but you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced they make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art this is funny at times but annoying for the most part and to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that <UNK> a majority of the events depicted one of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the and arrive to find it fully lit the have also managed to hook into the power <UNK> very impressive but this is just one example and for what its worth the music sucks the acting sucks the two cute girls are annoying the obnoxious guy is annoying the so called handsome lead man is a geek and the black girl who fall for him is a fool her father is the worst actor i have ever seen i am not sure the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience
<START> it doesn't matter whether you've experienced the plight of the elderly in america or if you're just plain clueless uncle frank and matthew give you that clue in a straight forward funny wake up and smell the <UNK> sort of way by the end of the film it is obvious that while being totally entertained somehow you've also been educated a terrific film by a terrific up and coming talent in the movie field matthew is a name to pay attention to
<START> i watched this film with a group of nazis a french <UNK> and my ex girlfriend on a small island in the br br when the tape was started myself and my girlfriend were tied to a wooden stake at the far end of this cave like area i told her to close her eyes and no matter what happened not to open them the <UNK> and the <UNK> didn't close their eyes and after a few seconds started screaming the <UNK> faces <UNK> and the head <UNK> br br after a few seconds the video tape popped out of the vcr and landed back in it's box and the top <UNK> shut myself and my girlfriend were left <UNK> br br <UNK> to this experience the video <UNK> was put in a wooden <UNK> and <UNK> in a huge warehouse of identical wooden <UNK> never to be see again
<START> wow what a bad film not frightening in the least and barely <UNK> the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling what's that line from a famous critic she runs the emotional gamut from a to b <UNK> that about sums it up not even good for camp value i wasn't expecting oscar material but this and gosh her friend's a ghost you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid not to see that one coming br br this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the movie going public if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower on the bright side at least it's not a full two hours long

<START> death wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be terrible acting implausible ridiculous death scenes creepy evil for no reason villains the last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film especially in the scene where the decent <UNK> citizens string chains across the street knocking down the evil <UNK> and then shoot them only to be joined by the neighborhood children in celebration and how can i forget the elderly woman with the <UNK> she's sweeping out the <UNK> and if that's not enough let's not forget how quickly the <UNK> give up after is killed i'm laughing just thinking about it br br i also love the death scene of girlfriend he just walks away after seeing her get blown up it's little things like this that make death wish 3 such a bad movie and i'm not even mentioning the bizarre soundtrack br br i watched this movie because of martin <UNK> who i seriously think is one of the finest character actors ever and who's own getting beaten up by the <UNK> scene is hilarious and i walked away with a new favorite movie thank you death wish 3 for making me laugh so hard br br some other things i forgot to mention 1 the weird sound effect after says cash when buying his used car ha it's so evil sounding 2 mandy mandy did the writers run out of tough guy names 3 the fact that the gangs apparently have a lend and <UNK> thug exchange program i need some more guys and that mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building 4 at the end of the movie after blows up is it just me or does it look like the street gang is about to break into choreography as they're giving up just watch how in sync they are after the female punk gives the stop <UNK> br br i love this movie nothing cheers me up like death wish 3
<START> at least if you're a disney fanatic well of the variety who loves their live action films as well as the animated stuff if you're a kid if you're a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize you're an adult if you love absolutely any film that features animals especially when they're doing tricks or if you're just not too demanding air bud world <UNK> is somewhat enjoyable to watch i'm a disney fanatic i enjoyed this film enough and i'll gladly watch it again br br but boy does it have a lot of problems the main flaw <UNK> from a combination of too many characters too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all in the space of <UNK> minutes we've got adults getting married teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it teen competition for love and jealousy <UNK> playing spy games dogs falling in love dogs playing soccer dogs having <UNK> manipulative parents <UNK> do anything to make their kids win being taught a lesson by their kids <UNK> <UNK> and crooks cooking up and <UNK> elaborate plots i'm probably forgetting something but that's 10 big plot issues to be dealt with with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them and presumably <UNK> them into a coherent whole that's both not too complicated this is a kids' film after all and that's also humorous and heartwarming not surprisingly director bill on his first turn being completely in charge he has a lot of previous second unit experience wasn't quite up to the task i'm sure it didn't help that there were at least three screenwriters involved and probably <UNK> producers as well br br the end result is that air bud world <UNK> is extremely choppy events occur with little justification and worse often little explanation people figure out and do things primarily because they need to and fast so that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than 90 minutes from one cut to the next time might jump ahead six months or so we have both adults who seem like maybe they're mentally disabled and kids who just <UNK> figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action some of the threads should have simply been removed because it's difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as you're introduced to an idea it's already passed you by br br also not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a rip off of one hundred and one <UNK> <UNK> minus a cruella de <UNK> character and another problem is that given the way the film is edited i have to assume that the dog air bud probably couldn't do much with the soccer ball unlike the first two films a dog playing a sport is almost an <UNK> here and when we see him it's in very quick glimpses every once in a while these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animation br br yet for someone like me there's a cheesy charm to air bud world <UNK> the script and performances often <UNK> between ridiculous hokey and kinda clichéd i tend to like that combination it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre and at times like the ending when the film completely <UNK> <UNK> and basically becomes a commercial for the u s women's soccer team air bud world <UNK> is so blatantly tacky that you can't help but love it
<START> i am partly a fan of miyazaki's work i say partly because most of his films fall into two categories brilliant and boring sadly this film falls into the later category br br this film suffers from the same fundamental problems as miyazaki's recent film <UNK> moving castle an intriguing premise is set up but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some <UNK> events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it br br the first third of the film reveals the post apocalyptic world the story is set in and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold from then on things go down hill the middle part of the film is mostly made up of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> propaganda and the ending is heavily marred by the <UNK> on the kind of <UNK> <UNK> which ruins a large number of japanese animated films br br overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators what is left is something which is visually stunning although sadly the version i saw was an <UNK> generation copy with poor colour which gives rise to the common myth that <UNK> shows her bare bottom when flying but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused
<START> a look at three <UNK> who are way past their prime now they look back on their <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> their present <UNK> played by floating has <UNK> off men and has made a good living as a everyone on the block owes her the other two <UNK> and wish they could land husbands but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will meanwhile their children one has a son and one a daughter are both about to get married not to each other is <UNK> at how much <UNK> her daughter has become than her and <UNK> tries to convince her not to marry the man concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature but they are also understandably self serving after her son leaves she'll be alone a bit into the film two of former <UNK> come looking for her one a man so obsessed with her that he tried to get her to commit double suicide with him the other one of her <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately he comes for her money not her love the way i've described the film makes it sound <UNK> depressing but it's really not sad but not <UNK> so it's more bittersweet unfortunately i only <UNK> liked late the story seems better when i look back on it but it is very slow and dull i actually <UNK> off twice during the film and i wasn't at all tired before i started it this is the kind of film that i can appreciate more than like it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of <UNK> more famous films 7 10
<START> sure this film was retarded but you expected that the moment you looked at the cover box it's a b movie and on the t a factor this movie delivered <UNK> it was funnier than expected while it was by no means a work of comedic genius like the party animal or <UNK> as far as b movies go it was worth the watch if you're into that sort of thing anyway br br christians and morally oriented <UNK> groups this is soft core adult entertainment if you don't want your children watching sexual content and nudity then you should keep your children away from this film
<START> despite the apparent <UNK> similarity with the simpsons loud fat dad mum 3 children a pet typical suburban home family guy is actually <UNK> and <UNK> opposite to the simpsons its avid use and sometimes too much of <UNK> gags has been its main stay since the first season while some hit the nail on the head the <UNK> <UNK> and danny <UNK> bit in season 5 is spine hilarious others are less successful coming across as contrived and they can be annoying especially when they don't advance the story line the jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insulting br br the chemistry between and brian <UNK> lends itself to pure comedy gold so much so that chris and meg only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family br br however the feature film <UNK> the <UNK> story is horrible thank goodness it went straight to dvd br br contrary to tiresome comparisons with the <UNK> simpsons seth approach with family guy is actually very different it's much more politically incorrect and amazingly a lot more <UNK> br br creator of <UNK> and <UNK> john <UNK> criticized family guy for having extremely low graphic standards from a standpoint i don't think it looks that bad though the <UNK> and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful br br all in all a great series to go with a great big bowl of <UNK> <UNK> in ranch <UNK> and ass jokes
<START> i am truly sad that this is the first bad review i've ever made for a movie ever i could stand to watch this movie and it is the second movie in all the movies i've seen that is just a <UNK> the first is open water that just had no point whatsoever the next karate kid didn't have any mention of daniel correct me if i'm wrong please and that ending line came as a shock it was like if must fight win then it showed the bird flying around and the pan <UNK> was playing and i was like oh okay so it'll take a while for this next part and then the credits hit the screen br br <UNK> man hopefully i will never have to review a movie in a bad manner again i apologize for those of you who like the next karate kid i really really do
<START> i saw this title again on i also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same with me i am 35 and he is 17 he liked it and i did too it still is funny a little childish a times but still very clean entertainment <UNK> shah is hilarious in multiple roles this sitcom would still fare better than many of the recent serials on tv but obviously some people obviously like mundane <UNK> that come out today it would have been nice that <UNK> <UNK> would have continued for all the seasons he is no longer alive today i would wish if someone could list all the episodes here br br who can forget the lines <UNK> <UNK> ho <UNK> <UNK> what a relief boss <UNK> 30 years <UNK> experience <UNK> br br and the title track <UNK> jo <UNK> teaching us to live the life as it comes and take enjoyment out of it the life of common people br br i still like this sitcom it may not seem as funny at times but certain episodes are still hilarious
<START> while the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film i could have stopped there and gone on with my life she does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects but not really enough to add to the <UNK> of the film br br i also felt she went a bit overboard with many things if a guy said a filthy comment grabbed her or made some disgusting gesture to her i would say go for it bring him down he's a pig what bothered me though is she would walk around in revealing clothes and be surprised when guys would look at her and give them hell about it br br i think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and a big part of who we all are guys will look at beautiful women especially when they dress <UNK> just like women will look at men when they are wearing a tight tank or no shirt at all br br some women may hate me for this but i hope not i have much respect for women i was raised by one i also come from a spanish family and we are very <UNK> my grandmother was the center of my family for years but i don't really feel this did anything to help women's rights and from what the filmmaker even said herself some women were offended by her project
<START> i saw this movie on the festival 23 24 <UNK> of august after a friend of mine said this is a very cool movie about the history of <UNK> i didn't now what to expect from this movie was it recorded by a couple of <UNK> who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks or was it a documentary about <UNK> br br so i went in after waiting for about an hour <UNK> out any expectations br br this movie is really a nice piece of work about the beginning of <UNK> it started with the team who where a fine group of surfers this is taking place in a not so nice area to live in at a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on so they try something else <UNK> was a fact br br if you were a part of the team in that time you where one of the cool guys girls because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the team so they were trying all there new tricks now on a <UNK> br br in no time <UNK> was popular again there were a couple of <UNK> and one national competition the team was taking part on several competition and also the national one but what they were doing on there <UNK> was unbelievable but the jury didn't now how to judge them so they put the whole <UNK> world on it's head br br anyway i can tell you the rest of the film documentary but you must see this one with you're own eyes because then you can feel the vibe of this movie this movie got a lot of style for me so i rewarded it with a 8 br br <UNK> from and the rest of holland see you
<START> the premise of the film was very promising sort of a gay <UNK> dynamite type of film and to be fair there were some funny moments and funny lines but it really wasn't very good overall the script and dialog felt like a local sketch production full of clichés and scenes that were predictable br br however there was enough that was amusing that i stuck around to see how it finished since there were hints that something special happens at the end but it seems that either the film ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt almost skipping directly from what looked to be the key conflict in the film to the final credits br br overall it was very disappointing but not completely unwatchable
<START> thunder alley finds <UNK> banned from <UNK> tracks after causing the death of another driver stanley adams might want to put him on his team of <UNK> but the other drivers aren't for having him around br br desperate for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up with an auto stunt show owner jan murray who's paying him <UNK> and trying to capitalize on <UNK> bad <UNK> he's got to take it but <UNK> <UNK> who's <UNK> daughter provides another reason to stick around br br the rest of the film is <UNK> struggle to get back to the <UNK> circuit while at the same time <UNK> both <UNK> and his current girl friend diane <UNK> personally i would have taken <UNK> she has it all over <UNK> br br thunder alley is helped by location shooting at the southern <UNK> tracks and good film footage of <UNK> racing not helped by a rather silly story which <UNK> into the real reason for <UNK> problems and his rather unrealistic <UNK> from same br br still fans of <UNK> might go for this
<START> it was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies and there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off but the biggest problem i had was the fact that it stays with <UNK> movies the director and writers of the <UNK> somehow forget to get creative while i must admit that i laughed at certain scenes the <UNK> could have been so much funnier the actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie a spoof demands this and that is the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this because of the failure of the cast to do so the jokes never hit their mark some scenes take forever and normally in spoofs that doesn't have to be a problem take naked gun for instance their is always something happening on screen in the <UNK> they didn't even bother to let stuff happening in the background only a couple of factors make this movie worth watching it still is fun to spot the movies that are made fun off and <UNK> williams as <UNK> his parody on cuba gooding jr as radio was hilarious he seemed to be the only one in the cast to get the idea of what a spoof is about not entirely bad
<START> it takes a while to get <UNK> to the sound of sons of the <UNK> but then you thoroughly enjoy it if the soundtrack would be played by an orchestra like max <UNK> or <UNK> it would lose its <UNK> character the music <UNK> the film everything seems to follow its rhythm the whole cast is excellent ben johnson and harry carey jr are the young men <UNK> the <UNK> ward bond is the mormon leader and <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> actress ford was able to make of what would be an ordinary western something totally different and original showing us the music the dances and most of all the people
<START> after the turning point of night must fall robert <UNK> for the most time came into his finest films and performances here comes mr jordan they were <UNK> the lady in the lake ride the pink horse the <UNK> charm june bride even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable rage in heaven mr and mrs smith but <UNK> wanted to do more and more production and directing work in 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance he played <UNK> lang an <UNK> movie star who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girl's boyfriend br br apparently my view of this film is a minority view most of the views given are <UNK> about it i thought it was a dull witless script with ann <UNK> heroine not very appealing as a character she <UNK> <UNK> as a star and this helps when he is called in to assist the authorities but after awhile i found there was no chemistry between them the script was also devoid of much fun although <UNK> and <UNK> winters did try the only thing i recall to this day as a joke point was that taylor holmes is the wealthy father of <UNK> and he is an admirer of winston <UNK> so he always dresses up as <UNK> and we see him wearing a <UNK> broad hat smoking a large <UNK> and painting <UNK> bald head helps in the disguise that was the most memorable joke from this film not much of a real memory br br <UNK> went into early television and finally won the attention and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures his last contact with the movies was his direction of the <UNK> hours about <UNK> william bull <UNK> starring his friend jimmy cagney it is a far better film than this for his overall film and television career i will give this mediocre film a 4 that strikes me as generous
<START> this don <UNK> clint eastwood strange and hypnotic drama was left by the <UNK> in 1971 and what a pity a fascinating character study with some great women for <UNK> to deal with <UNK> page was one of our supreme actresses and she's perfectly cast young jo ann harris is a <UNK> <UNK> and elizabeth <UNK> who died too young is undeniably repressed br br a 7 out of 10 best performance c eastwood released the same year as dirty harry this did no business beside getting some good reviews seek this out unless you're only into explosion films very subtle and frightening this piece will stick with you
<START> this is probably the only female ninja movie ever made it's great as a b film and the action sequences are a lot of fun to watch this movie is just so deliciously 80's you'll never see another film like it check it out for some 80's retro fun
<START> if there's one thing i've <UNK> from watching george romero's <UNK> it's that if you stumble upon an mysterious old <UNK> that someone has obviously gone to a lot of effort to hide just leave well alone there's probably something nasty inside br br obviously professor gordon <UNK> robert <UNK> character in brooks monster isn't a romero fan <UNK> he <UNK> open the old wooden box he finds buried in his yard only to ancient demon that possesses his body initially causing him to eat and vomit rather a lot br br when the demon eventually <UNK> from body during chemistry class and begins to <UNK> the students into <UNK> flesh <UNK> <UNK> it's up to <UNK> jack brooks <UNK> <UNK> to try and stop the foul creatures armed only with a length of <UNK> and <UNK> by a <UNK> hatred of all things monstrous br br the dvd <UNK> for jon low budget monster flick promises one hell of a fun ride offering cheesy thrills and <UNK> of the kind one might expect from your average 80s creature feature <UNK> <UNK> rubber monster suits gruesome gore and absolutely no cgi <UNK> for the last 15 minutes that's exactly what viewers get non stop <UNK> effects a silly <UNK> <UNK> style demon <UNK> and <UNK> macho monster <UNK> br br it's a shame then that the rest of the film's running massive 70 minutes or mostly spent following jack as he goes about his boring everyday business <UNK> visiting his shrink going to chemistry class and <UNK> his girlfriend if you think you might enjoy a film that focuses primarily on <UNK> with childhood trauma and anger management buying spare <UNK> from a <UNK> shop and the chemical <UNK> of <UNK> then this is the film for you but if it's a massive dose of monster mayhem you're after then i'd advise looking elsewhere
<START> <UNK> georges <UNK> film is quiet an example of the french transition cinema a film between the realism of the <UNK> cinema and the full of magic and symbolism <UNK> vague with some spots of the american classic films but not imitating it the director tales us a story about love crime and the importance of points of view we can find great actors too <UNK> is impeccable br br is interesting too how we can find aspects of this film nowadays <UNK> des inheritance is <UNK> in woody allen tradition <UNK> a crime situation in a <UNK> environment the naive ending is also typical in steven spielberg's good ending films and finally i would like to point out the <UNK> sensation during the photography session between jenny <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in which the first one confess that she thinks her husband is being <UNK> and exactly with the woman who is <UNK> her that scene is exactly the one between natalie portman and julia roberts in closer mike <UNK> 2004
<START> a very potent drama of small town south dealing with an innocent black man's murder of local <UNK> do <UNK> striking cinematography and good narrative via flashback take us through the uneasy relationship between the suspect and the son of his lawyer a still powerful story that <UNK> the sidney <UNK> films of racial prejudice porter hall has a great role as the murdered man's father trivia this was actually filmed in home town of <UNK> miss with many of the residents used as extras
<START> i saw this film in the movie theater i was taking classes at the second city chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense it is a <UNK> film about one of second city's native sons br br everyone knew about <UNK> history everyone knew how he died some even knew that the <UNK> did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in <UNK> or comedy br br but hey the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world and <UNK> also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect br br this movie well forget the idea of poor michael who is a really great actor being in a really astonishingly bad film and really only <UNK> to doing an <UNK> of the man br br forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of <UNK> work and all the snl scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie br br screw the idea that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow bob work kinda saying okay we are about to mess with belushi now lets go after <UNK> too they also decided to take the premise of it's a wonderful life and turn it into it's a horrible life on crack br br is he a guardian angel or the devil is the <UNK> machine the devil's assistant electronic device how many different endings can you <UNK> onto to a movie it is one of those movies after it is over you look at the person you are with and in stunned disbelief go what the hell was that in some circles this movie has become a kinda cult classic but for good reason br br a good cult classic you sit around the screen and make fun of or throw out snappy one liners to the screen a cult film is never good and most people would never watch them in any serious context br br if you want to watch some classic bad late 80's fair stoned rent <UNK> if you want to know about john belushi you can get more information off of the walls of second city chicago than this movie
<START> it is 1969 <UNK> <UNK> belle is an 11 year old girl growing up with an <UNK> vision of her 19 year old sister faith cameron diaz faith is the <UNK> the truth <UNK> the <UNK> of all the <UNK> in the world then one day <UNK> and her mother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> receive word that faith is dead faith has killed herself both <UNK> and <UNK> are overwhelmed by this news and although <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> can't let it go <UNK> decides to go to europe and find out what happened br br it is now 1977 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is 18 and decides to go to europe over the <UNK> of her mother to discover the truth when alive faith was <UNK> from a man she called wolf christopher <UNK> though wolf claimed not to know anything about <UNK> last days <UNK> convinces him to tell her everything within days wolf realizes that he hadn't let go of the past either and he joins <UNK> on her <UNK> to <UNK> br br in the end wolf is able to tell of <UNK> decent into drug abuse and his own guilt at not <UNK> the suicide although angry <UNK> realizes in the end how human and fragile faith really was br br i liked this movie i'm old enough to remember the bank <UNK> of the red army and i was 10 in 1969 this story was familiar ground for me i can still remember young men trying to decide if they should go to canada or not to avoid the draft br br the story is simple but probably occurred several times in real life during that period <UNK> belle was enjoyable and fun to watch as she portrayed the young <UNK> sister excited by what was happening around her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> easily into the role of the older <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was the ever supportive mother a role she is all too familiar with on american tv unfortunately i would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with cameron diaz played the immature <UNK> perfectly though at times her performance of a 1960s <UNK> seemed to come off a news reel of all the characters it was christopher <UNK> wolf that made the most growth when we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the movie we can see he is a <UNK> man he is a patient and kind man filled with anger at the world's <UNK> in the end he realizes the direction he and faith are headed is wrong and begins to grow up deciding he should fight against injustice in his own way faith refuses to join him in this and it eventually leads to her death <UNK> wolf is the most real of all the characters br br i recommend this movie it was enjoyable and thought provoking the invisible circus is rated tv ma but there is very little <UNK> sex or violence in it the subject of the movie is the reason for the rating
<START> doctor who is amazing it is <UNK> of it must be the boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure and the girls will like the emotion and feelings that go around br br <UNK> <UNK> was extraordinary as rose tyler she was so emotional and made rose so real br br david <UNK> is also so witty and funny and it is so enjoyable to watch br br but now <UNK> has left and rose is stuck on a parallel universe with her on off boyfriend mickey and her mother and father he died when rose was a baby but this pete tyler is from the parallel universe it will be very strange with martha being the new companion as i have only ever seen it with rose apart from the runaway bride with catherine <UNK> br br better be good br br but nobody can beat rose
<START> i won't go to a <UNK> and say it's the best love story of all time as some have said that's fine people feel very deeply about this film you either love it i believe or you simply hate it i don't want to say the best of all because that is simply too for me to make a statement like that however i feel very <UNK> about the english patient as well as millions of other people do br br the awards say it all br br i don't agree with critics on many levels however the ones that picked this one i couldn't agree more br br 9 oscars br br <UNK> wins br br <UNK> other nominations makes this love story on the top of the bunch br br from the director anthony the story that bursts onto the screen and as mr from t v s seinfeld said <UNK> i simply can't take my eyes off of it in this instance i don't agree with response but the story builds and takes the right time needed to make it's case beautifully the cinematography john won multiple awards as well as it ought too i have not really paid much attention to juliette <UNK> until now well not entirely true i loved her performance in sabrina lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship next to harrison ford but this was simply an incredibly <UNK> character for her and as deeply talented as she is she simply <UNK> in her own subtle and <UNK> way she was just what this film was looking for i'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress ralph <UNK> was also spectacular in portraying count de i had a new respect for his ability after seeing this one what can you say except see this picture again
<START> this show is the single greatest thing to come out of america since the simpsons not only does it have thousands of new ideas but it's actually controversial see the jewish joke season 1 episode 1 and isn't scared to <UNK> people off however the great minds at fox have canceled it along with greg the bunny and <UNK> so make sure you buy the season 1 box set while you still can it'll be the best money you ever spend it's definitely a show that gets better the more you watch it as at first the constant flashbacks can get a little annoying and don't always seem to fit the story properly however after a couple of episodes you realise how brilliant it is and how well it <UNK> to any other show currently on air at the moment
<START> i still can't describe what to feel when i received this by the site such a rare movie so little spoken and known is difficult to find even to fans but the contrast past and present is devastating now i hold a dvd of the movie with the finest quality possible as i did in atlantis the other rare movie i bought by the internet i saw this one at home with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off and <UNK> at the experience i didn't know what to expect <UNK> i always searched some kind of disappointment when i saw a film by luc i never had seen before but it never came this movie was no exception from the start i understood that the person who makes a film like this as a first feature is destined to be big in the future and so it happened this won several <UNK> including the highest prize in a film festival of my country which makes me proud and it shows that this movie is many bigger things this may be the most original after the war movie i have ever seen beating mad max in originality and artistic feel there is not a problem with this movie its cinematography is genius as well the <UNK> of the actors i am also proud to say that finally i saw all the movies of my favorite director and have a copy of almost all of them joan of arc is still waiting for me to buy the dvd this movie is most of all a work of style and dedication which makes clear why luc is a director of my choice good taste beautiful framing excellent use of music i also <UNK> at eric first feature length score and the promise of great achievements did well to bet in its boy genius the man who would later change the face of <UNK> and <UNK> relation between movies and their public let's hope starts working in a new directorial project i will be the first to cheer it until then i recommend this movie to anyone who need to learn a lesson of how good movies are made with little money i loved the atmosphere of the movie which by its black and white cinematography suggests us an even more depressed view of the world after the holocaust this movie works by the sheer magic of movies showing in pictures what we can't explain by words and i'm with all the people who wrote comments to this movie and liked it good choice a great hug to everyone who sees this and feels that a little of their lives were changed
<START> i highly recommend this movie to everyone my son and i read the book first and then saw the movie while the book was better in my opinion the movie was still great my son and i agree that while we like the book version the best we liked the ending of the movie better than the book ending the scenery is just tremendous and the soundtrack is a must have the fact that jimmy <UNK> has a small role and provides music is an added plus luke wilson does a decent job in his role of officer and is pretty much what i had mentally imagined would look like when i read the book i'm surprised that this didn't do better in the theaters and i'll be waiting for the dvd to come out
<START> in the line of fire is one of the best thrillers i have seen it builds and builds to a great climax this film really draws you in your heart is beating and you are out of breath from the action the cast turns in strong particularly clint eastwood and john <UNK> this film is expertly directed by suspense master <UNK> <UNK> thrillers don't get much better this don't miss it
<START> this this coming of age <UNK> set in chicago in the early 60's we follow a group of <UNK> friends as they <UNK> through the ups and downs of their lives the two central characters are <UNK> <UNK> jackson <UNK> and his best friend richard morris hilton <UNK> both of these boys have promising <UNK> <UNK> is a great writer but a lazy student and has just received a college <UNK> for basketball when they're not hanging out at the local diner shooting <UNK> with their friends or hanging out at a friends house or chasing girls they're skipping school riding the trains through chicago or going to quarter parties on the <UNK> br br things go wrong when <UNK> and make the mistake of getting involved with two <UNK> and go <UNK> in a stolen car the police pursue them and they are arrested but thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher <UNK> <UNK> morris they are released but the two <UNK> are not and <UNK> to get revenge on <UNK> and thinking they blamed the whole thing on them br br this movie is very episodic but it still works because thats what life is a series of episodes some funny some sad some romantic some bizarre the film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic and the situations are all believable and <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> pursuing a beautiful girl or a party turning violent when some <UNK> decides to start a fight or dealing with a <UNK> younger sibling but even when a situation isn't personally <UNK> like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to con a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie the sequence is still hilarious br br <UNK> was the basis for the classic 70's sitcom <UNK> ' which aired on abc from 1976 1979 even though the show is most famous for the character <UNK> he is not in this film nor is there any character remotely like him the humor of that show was very broad but still funny the humor of <UNK> is <UNK> to life and thus more entertaining br br additionally the soundtrack is wonderful classic songs from that period by diana ross the <UNK> the <UNK> martha the and <UNK> robinson play throughout the film adding to the fun youthful <UNK> tone of the film
<START> yes the votes are in this film may very well be the plan 9 from outer space for our generation but whereas ed <UNK> film for all its flaws <UNK> a certain charm despite it all this film <UNK> the word <UNK> to the <UNK> degree in fact i'd suggest to the <UNK> of the <UNK> english <UNK> to <UNK> this movie as a key example defining the that word in the next update to the <UNK> br br <UNK> top is a performer of such abysmal ability that normally rational people that i know once they hear his name become homicidal <UNK> dedicated to wanting to kill mr top as soon as possible indeed if one goes to amazon com and look at <UNK> reviews for <UNK> movie and other performance dvd one will find several that could be <UNK> as death <UNK> to mr top br br one other curious fact about this film i recall that mike nelson the head writer for <UNK> 3000 in his book <UNK> mega cheese about movies good and bad said he saw this film and shortly <UNK> couldn't recall a thing about it including the title obviously mike was suffering a classic reaction to trauma viewing this atrocity was so soul numbing mike nelson had to block it from his mind evidently in a later chapter in his book mike nelson had <UNK> his of this film from the review he offers mike nelson was definitely not grateful for the <UNK> memory br br the only comment i offer about the film and it is not a spoiler it's simply god's honest truth it's not funny none of it is not even a <UNK> of it is funny
<START> caution several spoilers br br someday somewhere there's going to be a post apocalyptic movie made that doesn't stink unfortunately the <UNK> is not that movie though i have to give it credit for trying br br kevin <UNK> plays somebody credited only as the <UNK> he's not actually a <UNK> just a <UNK> with a <UNK> in the <UNK> of a western america <UNK> by some <UNK> catastrophe he <UNK> with isolated <UNK> by performing shakespeare suddenly a pack of <UNK> called the the self <UNK> <UNK> of the west <UNK> upon a village that <UNK> visiting and their evil leader gen <UNK> will <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> after much misery and numerous efforts to break <UNK> spirit he escapes thus ending a lengthy section of the movie that could have been told better in a three minute flashback br br we now finally get to the major premise the escaped <UNK> finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town hoping to get some food under <UNK> of being a <UNK> a number of the village people led by young ford <UNK> <UNK> want to get in on this <UNK> act which does not sit well with <UNK> and his <UNK> and <UNK> finds himself the <UNK> and unwilling leader of a band of at war with the br br the idea of the versus the bad guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds the depend for their <UNK> on the fact that the <UNK> they prey on are isolated from one another the can destroy any one village but could not stand against all their victims united to <UNK> the <UNK> must communicate with one another and a working mail system would thus be a big step toward putting the out of business so it really makes a lot of sense that <UNK> would get medieval on our heroic mail <UNK> unfortunately eventual defeat is not the result of the <UNK> <UNK> against him but instead your old <UNK> cliche the one on one <UNK> between him and <UNK> nor is there even any real attempt by the <UNK> to use the mail to work together to solve their problems all the mail seems to be the standard hi aunt debbie stuff played for maximum sentimental value br br the <UNK> is one of the most predictable movies shot for shot that i have ever seen now i don't <UNK> try to ruin movies for myself by <UNK> to figure out what's going to happen next but here we're talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort i just knew what was going to happen next whether or not i wanted to know after a lion is <UNK> <UNK> eating people a <UNK> seeking the escaped <UNK> <UNK> into the <UNK> after a noise and we are then shocked when the lion eats him a bunch of villagers are rounded up and shot by a firing squad and one of the villagers sings out some famous last words right before being shot to my immense lack of surprise a covered statue is <UNK> to show exactly what everyone knew was going to be there <UNK> <UNK> to pick up a letter from a <UNK> kid we saw earlier in the movie a man tells <UNK> that no sir you can't just take my wife <UNK> runs the unsuspecting <UNK> through though he is the only person in the theater who is unsuspecting br br but it is rank <UNK> sentimentality that really <UNK> the <UNK> olivia williams playing <UNK> lover <UNK> is worst served she <UNK> her heart into the material and gives her very best effort to make it sound natural and sincere she tries so hard it's heart breaking but nobody could ever have made the lines i have a gift for you <UNK> you give out hope like it's candy in your pocket sound like anything but the <UNK> <UNK> that they are another example is the scene where a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> past a little boy ignoring his <UNK> letter only to turn around stare at him for what seems like five minutes and then thunder back to pick up the letter why didn't <UNK> just pick it up the first time no real reason it's just an <UNK> that tries and fails to give us a feeling of <UNK> by dashing the kid's hopes and then <UNK> them br br <UNK> and predictability <UNK> at the end as the statue of the <UNK> is revealed i sat thinking please don't tell me they're going to show the statue and then cut back to the scene with the <UNK> kid surely that is too <UNK> too obvious for even this movie then alas the music <UNK> and we did indeed cut back to the <UNK> little boy smiling as his letter to his maiden aunt is <UNK> away and i held my head in my hands and thought somebody shoot me it felt like having thirty pounds of apple pie <UNK> down my throat br br gen <UNK> is a more <UNK> villain than normal your standard issue post apocalyptic villain is the <UNK> <UNK> s o b in the valley <UNK> is shown to be a little nothing of a man inside who tries to make himself feel important by beating up on others although some menace is thereby sacrificed <UNK> is credible in a way most villains aren't unfortunately will <UNK> overacts and although we are told early on that <UNK> utterly destroyed his last <UNK> in five seconds of hand to hand combat actual fighting skills shown at the end of the movie are absolutely ludicrous br br the acting is otherwise pretty good <UNK> has done better but his <UNK> was an as mentioned olivia williams is very impressive <UNK> <UNK> as ford does a sincere and credible job james <UNK> <UNK> score is competent though short of the epic standards the movie was going for but it's not enough to save this film br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> i am amazed anyone likes this film i never walk out of movies but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster the white characters are saints and the asian characters are practically nonexistent and worthless to the story they exist only as objects surprise characters of other races fare much better the twists and turns were laughable and predictable but if you're reading this you know that already paul <UNK> is a hack hollywood can't even do <UNK> movies right do yourself a favor and watch a much more honest take on race relations harold and kumar go to white castle
<START> i never saw any of john <UNK> stand up before i watched freak and after seeing it again on hbo comedy recently it was better more <UNK> and with things that at the age of 14 i couldn't understand quite before spike lee did a wonderful job directing keeping the visual angle up to par with <UNK> <UNK> and the style of personal storytelling it's substance and style <UNK> together but we get <UNK> <UNK> about race and sex the bits about sex are classic but a lot of it is about family and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father even when things get dark in some of the stories there's something fresh or crazy or random that <UNK> pulls out to get a laugh and it works more often than not if something does fall flat for me at any rate it might be his personality <UNK> here and there but overall it's the kind of fun material that isn't <UNK> but is so true to itself that it <UNK> find it if you can
<START> ben a fine charles <UNK> his young daughter k t a cute and his new girlfriend <UNK> the extremely attractive <UNK> are on their way to a birthday party for k t they unexpectedly get <UNK> in a remote southern town where no one is able to leave and with the exception of ben k t and <UNK> no one can get in either to top that off children are disappearing and adults are being murdered at an <UNK> rate ben helps some of the locals sheriff pete l q jones <UNK> moore and jack charles robinson the local priest try to solve the mystery br br this early 70's devil themed horror movie actually <UNK> the exorcist and combines a bad day at black rock type plot of a rural town with a great big <UNK> in its closet with horror elements for interesting results it actually sent a few chills down my spine this viewing as it <UNK> moves along its ominous path the moody and <UNK> atmosphere is established quickly and holds for the duration the ever growing sense of panic gives it a real kick some memorable set pieces include the bizarre opening of a toy tank turning into a real one and <UNK> a car flat not to mention twisted nightmare vividly and <UNK> realized by director bernard and crew <UNK> <UNK> music is subtly sinister and gives it that extra sense of <UNK> br br the <UNK> and professional cast does some fine work especially the ever engaging martin as the <UNK> doc <UNK> and producers actors l q jones and moore br br just the fact that the whole plot is right under the <UNK> of our heroes makes it that much more scary jack the priest starts leading them in the right direction but will they be in time to put a stop to things it's an enjoyable little <UNK> worth re visiting just speaking for myself i was able to appreciate it a lot more after giving it a second chance i can say now that yes it is indeed under rated telling a good story in an interesting unconventional and effective way br br 8 10
<START> this movie changed my life <UNK> performance was nothing short of incredible and i still haven't <UNK> from his <UNK> from the 1990 oscar nominations and as <UNK> as the shines in this movie you can't <UNK> the brilliant writing and direction that <UNK> this masterpiece in to the highest <UNK> of achievement in film if you haven't seen this movie drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy i guarantee it will blow your mind and if you don't like it then i just have one question for you gonna do when the 24 inch <UNK> and runs wild on you
<START> it's awful br br pretty <UNK> review i know but it has been a long time since a film has left me in such a <UNK> state wondering how the hell a film like that gets made br br the last time it happened was last years turkey to <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> is an ex con trying to better himself through self help videos endless <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> he lives by the <UNK> these <UNK> <UNK> br br he stumbles across a washed up nightclub singer played by <UNK> bennett and has an <UNK> his new career is going to be that of a talent agent with the singer as his one and only client br br <UNK> by his <UNK> singing girlfriend played by <UNK> he sets up shop and tries to <UNK> career with results br br the <UNK> is the reason why <UNK> are so <UNK> of australian cinema it is poorly constructed lame and way too long <UNK> minutes for a comedy that should barely have <UNK> the 80 minute mark br br every scene is too long and are very repetitive the audience is not given a character to <UNK> with a vital <UNK> in a film like this supposedly about an giving it a go br br the downbeat and frankly poor ending comes at the end of 30 minutes of the most mind numbing dialogue and scenes that have you crying out for a power failure br br this film is a failure on all levels made worse for <UNK> audiences by its liberal and use of various gold coast palm beach location and its laughable use of <UNK> <UNK> names like norman park and
<START> <UNK> was great as julie and pat was once again magnificent as mr <UNK> but there should have been more references towards the other three movies i mean come on first off where's daniel <UNK> makes a very brief mention of him and that's it daniel was his best friend and should've at least made an appearance in the movie he could've helped <UNK> train julie san on the flip side the music stayed true to the movie though with a little more <UNK> bass to <UNK> the wonderfully played pan <UNK> it doesn't feel like a karate kid movie unless you hear that pan <UNK> thank you overall a decent movie though we miss you
<START> i have seen this film on 3 different occasions on the first occasion i was <UNK> over by this film it appeared as a very kind film to me i hated this film as a sentimental garbage on my second viewing however my third viewing <UNK> my belief that it is a good film there is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between mr kramer and <UNK> kramer there are some scenes in which meryl streep appears a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life dustin hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to <UNK> with the recent task of his child's custody there was even a controversy on the sets of this film according to the master cameraman <UNK> there was a shot in which he just escaped getting hurt as the character of mr kramer in order to show the intensity of his anger decides to break a glass hard luckily nothing happened to <UNK> kramer versus kramer shows the destruction of a family structure it also tells how family must be <UNK> if there are kids involved
<START> this movie clearly has an agenda which could be summed up like this never never cross the border either physical or <UNK> let's <UNK> everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else let's pretend all are evil satanic or drug dealers all that is outside one's country's border and specially us borders is dangerous <UNK> and people there will hate you or envy you or try to steal you or something else the based on true events is only a perverse tag that can be <UNK> on anything to give it some aura of credibility or in this case just to help pushing the film's ideology down some <UNK> throats out there the <UNK> of the film lies in the fact that it <UNK> countries people and all else into very black and white stereotyped categories <UNK> into disgusting people mexican police into a bunch of corrupt cops <UNK> into the right wing morons <UNK> into almost hippie and so forth is there anything good about the film i hardly think so but may be you think differently
<START> i would like to comment on how the girls are chosen why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women every episode their is always more white women then black one's as if to say white women are better looking then black women i would like for once see more black women then white and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more <UNK> but i would have thought since you as the head <UNK> of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice you are just a big <UNK>
<START> the kid is a really good family movie about a <UNK> image <UNK> russ who has lots of money a good job nice house etc the only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice one day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears this gives russ a second chance to make things right bruce willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance the kid is a nice heart warming movie for everyone
<START> lazy writing bad acting and wooden direction lead us to a 2005 canadian made tv movie called <UNK> not to be confused with about eight other movies using the same name <UNK> spelling and her doctor <UNK> move from to his small hometown where they run into his old gal pal who decides she still loves him she gets pregnant with baby don't ask and starts knocking off anyone who might get in her way as she plans to reunite with her old flame the actors playing the old gal pal and the doctor are not worth mentioning as they act <UNK> than flat <UNK> isn't much better but at least she is something to focus on as the plot <UNK> here and there before arriving at a very lame and all too familiar conclusion watch instead the hand that rocks the cradle
<START> anyone who enjoyed this series when first broadcast i rushed home from school to see it now is of a certain age so i can only add my comments to those asking for a dvd release to <UNK> those of us to <UNK> the memories of first <UNK> before it simply becomes a piece of <UNK> tv archive history if so many old tv series from the sixties and seventies can be released why not this surely the rights <UNK> can't be that difficult most of the shakespeare lines i can quote comes from this iconic series and i remember <UNK> them with my school <UNK> as we tried to <UNK> each other's memories of the text peter rightly deserved the credit for having the <UNK> to bring it to the screen this surely was public <UNK> at its finest robert hardy and sean connery fighting to the death it's riveting stuff and from the beginning of the bbc <UNK> golden age come on bbc clear it and license it please march 2009 so finally the dvd is here and <UNK> to those who have made it happen the picture quality is remarkably good and the performances every bit as good as the memory thought now all those who for it must buy it and <UNK> those magic moments br br uk viewers given the series was made in the uk by the bbc using british actors it's strange that the dvd release is not available there on region 2 europe dvd and can only be <UNK> from the us and played on <UNK> players it seems hardly likely that there are major rights issues perhaps the market was felt to be too small so why on earth wasn't it released free ' so everyone could enjoy it
<START> this is a hard show to watch it's not something to sit back and relax to it kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons people get screwed over raped tortured and die like flies there are male organs everywhere there is <UNK> <UNK> and blood oz is a brave show it brings up issues like racism homosexuality prisoners reality and most of all capital punishment it is in my opinion also successful in doing so unlike for example the single <UNK> medium br br it bored me sometimes it had some weird story lines and they spent to much time on characters that just didn't interest me strangely enough i found season 1 to be quite boring if i had watched it while it aired i think i wouldn't have continued to watch it i love seasons 2 4 season 5 and 6 are watchable although i think it shouldn't be allowed to utter the words <UNK> and death row in the same sentence br br there are so many marvelous characters to root for the old guys bob and who i absolutely fell in love with from day one said and four very strong and charismatic leaders in their own way <UNK> hill who's monologues tied the episodes together so efficient the staff with people like sister pete and ray also brilliant also minor characters that was only in for a couple of episodes or a few seasons but left a good impression as well br br my favorites are the <UNK> brothers their relationship was the most gut wrenching and <UNK> i seen on television if there is anything i will always remember about this show it's them there will never be another pairing or what to call it that will make me <UNK> so much thats why when the ends come for them as well it almost hurt to much i wish it would never have happened i wish i had never watched it br br but good one <UNK> i do recommend it
<START> only watched this to see joe <UNK> in an early role and honestly wished i hadn't bothered he can and has since done much better than this crap cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least no wait one line only was funny where mr kent joe and his family are having dinner with this nut job as he's been invited for dinner lord alone knows why <UNK> to mr kent you know what it's like dog you've been there mrs kent not lately <UNK> expression was funny but that's it one line does not make a great comedy and this <UNK> is so far away from being funny it should be <UNK> to the nearest trash <UNK> it's only good enough for that joe <UNK> glad to see you don't appear in rubbish like this anymore you are far superior and a great great actor
<START> while it was nice to see a film about older people finding each other and falling in love and the performances by andrews and garner were not bad this picture <UNK> on the and <UNK> at every turn every <UNK> in the plot was in view from a mile away
<START> this is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world the social criticism of our shallow <UNK> oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the war is hell cliché <UNK> by a mythical journey <UNK> to cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate with extreme prejudice a rogue colonel who's left behind the <UNK> concepts of justice to create his own world when i saw apocalypse now in 1980 i thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece in particular i found the final segment of the journey with brando which <UNK> <UNK> heart of darkness to be rather boring i finally got around to seeing apocalypse now <UNK> and the flaws have been taken care of <UNK> makes the movie an outright masterpiece certainly among the top 100 films ever made <UNK> performance now seems full and complete perhaps rather less mysterious but much more profound martin sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting <UNK> ever assembled it's great to spot a young harrison ford scott glenn etc in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as the work of robert duvall fred forrest lawrence fishburne and sam <UNK> is greatly enhanced by the additional footage if you've never seen this film skip the original and head straight for <UNK> i wish we could get a gangs of new york <UNK> from <UNK> to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece
<START> first i would like to apologize for my rating of 1 the only reason i give this film such a high rating is that i can't delve into negative all this is a spoof <UNK> aside and while i certainly have tried to give it due consideration have left me with a certain notion namely this is quite possibly the worst film ever made on any level and in any plausible of <UNK> <UNK> seriously i tried i'm just as in to any indie born for cult video distribution film as the next buff but seriously this movie sucked <UNK> balls br br honestly if i had directed this film i would have seen it as a legitimate cause for suicide
<START> now i'm a bit biased since i'm a big fan of late night television i've been a loyal fan of jay leno for about 6 or 7 years and think he's one of the funniest most talented comedians out there and david <UNK> is one hell of a comedian as well though i only watch his show unless <UNK> a repeat during commercials or when he has a better guest than jay on the show daniel <UNK> and john michael <UNK> are both fine actors and they very much <UNK> jay and dave but did they disappear into the characters nope <UNK> barely nails down <UNK> voice and expression <UNK> at a high pitch sounding like a <UNK> marlon brando <UNK> nails down david's facial expressions for example his trademark <UNK> but he doesn't nail down <UNK> voice those who aren't big fans of late night tv might be a lot less biased there's a couple comedians who can do dead on <UNK> of jay why couldn't they have selected one of them for the part and the same goes with dave i'd rather they had norm <UNK> play the part norm doesn't look a hell of a lot like dave but he did a great <UNK> of him on snl hey you got any <UNK> that was so hilarious br br however i learned a lot about the late night wars which i had very little knowledge of at first i never watched the tonight show prior to when jay leno was host so i didn't know about the struggle to finally replace johnny carson and the countless <UNK> that finally convinced dave to move to cbs i knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very <UNK> and kathy bates gives a <UNK> performance as the foul mouthed former executive producer of the tonight show she basically steals the film br br my score 7 out of 10 br br
<START> having enjoyed <UNK> and i was looking forward to this third part of the trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way although it tries to represent <UNK> <UNK> in the form of sport science trade and other forms of competition it lacks the global scope and even the <UNK> developed themes of its predecessors war is chaos but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals br br <UNK> is flawed by being a chaotic <UNK> of images that does little to develop its theme on the plus side it wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of last <UNK> wars br br <UNK> is also so <UNK> that several times i had to remind myself that i was not watching an <UNK> promoting the american way of life perhaps this reflects the ongoing war on terror when representing sport as war the prominent team <UNK> <UNK> that the usa was depicted as the winner hence it missed the opportunity to depict some of the many sports around the world and showing that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of <UNK> <UNK> br br apart from <UNK> the footage seemed to have been shot on a budget in the confines of new york and there was little recognition of life as war in the rest of the world the gallery of faces <UNK> gave only a nod to the existence of important <UNK> outside of the usa the makers missed the point that <UNK> does not mean br br the philip glass soundtrack sounded much like every other philip glass score i've heard with the possible exception of <UNK> and at best can be described as <UNK> neither adding to nor <UNK> from the chaotic imagery
<START> sherlock holmes basil <UNK> and dr watson <UNK> bruce have been hired by the british government to protect a swiss scientist dr <UNK> william post jr he has a bomb that the british want to win the war unfortunately the evil dr <UNK> lionel <UNK> is working with the nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctor and his invention br br moving sherlock holmes to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea but it does work for one reason basil <UNK> arguably he is the best sherlock holmes ever put on the screen he plays the character so well and accurately that it doesn't matter what era he's solving crimes as for <UNK> bruce as watson everybody has problems with it he plays watson as a bumbling old fool that is not the watson of the books you seriously wonder why holmes puts up with him still he does grow on you in a way then there's <UNK> having a whale of a time playing <UNK> the discussions and battle of wits between him and holmes are just great i've never liked dennis as inspector <UNK> he's such an idiot makes watson look like a genius and post jr is pretty good as even though his accent <UNK> keeps changing br br this movie is done <UNK> and runs only a little over an hour still it does have it's slow spots and i never understood the secret code section br br still worth catching if just for <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> i remember seeing this film in my late teens or early <UNK> on tv probably hbo i watched it with my parents a brother and a few friends since that was about 30 years ago i don't remember a lot of the story i do remember that the entire group of us watching agreed that this was the funniest movie we had ever seen when it was over our hurt from so much laughing my dad worked at a hospital so that made it all the better br br every time i see the party in the tv <UNK> i look to see if this one is there too to my <UNK> it never is although i loved the party i feel this one is funnier peter sellers was great as a crooked hospital <UNK> why it's never been released on video is a mystery to me it's a classic but it appears that nobody under 35 or 40 has been allowed to see it i'd buy it in a second if they ever release it to dvd
<START> it seems incredible that the same decade which brought star wars to the screen such <UNK> tripe as this and many other movies i am reminded of the similarly lavish but equally wretched <UNK> elsewhere br br whatever motivated a list actors to sign on for such wastes of celluloid is frankly beyond this writer they must have been very very desperate to be perfectly <UNK> roger moore's appearance in any movie is the kiss of death although extremely handsome in his youth his entire acting career has been <UNK> upon an ability to raise one <UNK> every emotion from a to b is conveyed by this simple <UNK> his were the dog days of james bond lee marvin on the other hand has featured in some very worthy <UNK> perhaps most <UNK> your and 'the dirty he has a comic streak but he is much better when he plays it straight br br the excellent ian <UNK> is a throwaway hardly <UNK> <UNK> up as a mute african everyone else just turned up for their pay <UNK> br br the only plausible and watchable element is the german <UNK> it looks like a very large model but it is <UNK> massive and appears authentic as do its crew the rest isn't even <UNK> the childish comedy <UNK> with the brutality and violence in a story that <UNK> clumsily about as if the script itself had had too many <UNK> of lee <UNK> <UNK> here is a director who simply doesn't know where he's going there are hints of 'the african <UNK> a snatch from 'the pride the and one or two other rip offs from movies who's titles don't come readily to mind br br strangely i have seen it 3 times each occasion it has been shown on television when i have been laid low with a cold or the <UNK> perhaps that is <UNK> my judgement but not much br br compare it with any indiana jones movie and you will see what i mean br br i have given it two stars one for the <UNK> and the other because it finally comes to an end though heaven knows it takes long enough to do that br br time for another i think
<START> for a while it seemed like this show was on 24 7 then apparently there was a second season or some other kind of <UNK> of this horrible show about the two most vapid and <UNK> people who have ever been filmed all the other comments have captured the essence of these two selfish <UNK> perfectly not much less can be said about them besides what everyone else has said br br i doubt these two ladies have souls and more than likely they made some kind of <UNK> bargain in order to get their on a television series may the <UNK> protect the human race from any more exposure to the ghastly girls
<START> i wasted 5 dollars renting this complete piece of crap dr <UNK> is the most <UNK> lead character i have ever seen the movie was full of every cliche you could ever think of and contained not a single ounce of originality there was the typical <UNK> portrayed by rugged <UNK> all the guys had those <UNK> proud to take attitudes that are as stale as <UNK> christmas <UNK> the concept and deaths were really cool but they lose all novelty once the monster is revealed read the spoiler at the end nothing else is really revealed though the ending is the biggest cop out you've ever seen i predicted everything before it happened including who would die and how the dialogue is lacking and that's an understatement by far there's mostly just random yelling thoughtful staring and <UNK> sentences the actors are just god awful i don't want to talk about this movie anymore it's making me angry i just wonder if the director even watched it when it was done br br spoiler alert save 5 dollars the monster is just a bunch of ants that evolved so now they need bones so they can move around <UNK> the fact that this serves no <UNK> advantage whatsoever and that the ants just killed whoever was available though the movie acts like they kill out of necessity this movie made me dumber the end consists of the lead idiot killing the mother <UNK> a big blob thing which destroys all the other ants pretty cliche eh he almost <UNK> out at the end because of a sudden emotional <UNK> to the mother thing that <UNK> him give me a break
<START> a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this <UNK> puppet show take on <UNK> <UNK> there is nothing especially clever <UNK> divine comedy was a brilliant piece of social commentary this film is a vaguely <UNK> student film with <UNK> to high art br br i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the <UNK> <UNK> at some icons of the political and or religious right and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their <UNK> icons <UNK> be that as it may few of those <UNK> actually rose to the level of satire br br the high point of the movie is a sudden <UNK> of <UNK> rock on the subject of and the revolving door it's really a shame that the entire film couldn't have been a musical that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school <UNK> and added a far stronger element of fun
<START> many americans are lazy and this has <UNK> itself even in our dvd watching many of us don't like to take the time to read an hour and a half or more of subtitles so we choose not to see many foreign films one film that is totally worth your time no matter how mundane a task you might think the <UNK> reading is however is the green <UNK> it's by far the best foreign film i've ever seen and tops many american films i've seen lately as well it's a complex situation told in a remarkably simple and funny dialogue the character depth derived in this film is amazing the way and sorry if those are spelled wrong feed off each other's <UNK> <UNK> is downright spectacular the actors were well cast and i'm very much hoping that a sequel is in consideration it needs very little of and what's her face just give me and on some sort of journey with supporting characters and more amazing dialogue to the author of this fine screenplay i say write more the story itself is rather twisted but you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy anyhow with no <UNK> please check this movie out
<START> i have only seen this once in 1986 at an artsy theater in <UNK> but i remember it like i saw it a thousand times this morning hilarious <UNK> for teens playing <UNK> with all e beautifully animated taking off her eyes shaking them back into position then putting them back on and poignant the end of the world the <UNK> of a <UNK> br br required viewing for the human race calling this simply a cartoon is like calling the great <UNK> nifty <UNK>
<START> as a word of explanation disney's the kid has absolutely nothing in common with the charlie chaplin <UNK> classic of the same name what we do have is a pleasant enough though unbelievable feel good family comedy as only the folks at disney can provide br br bruce willis in a change of pace plays a self centered stuffed shirt of an image <UNK> he <UNK> not only his <UNK> but those close to him as well you know that he is going to have to change before the final credits br br into his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of <UNK> character as a nerdy 8 year old played with <UNK> pie conviction by spencer <UNK> disney always finds these kids somewhere this forces willis to come to grips with his past and well you know the rest br br appearing as <UNK> love interest is emily <UNK> and lily <UNK> as his executive assistant both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the inter action between the willis and <UNK> characters br br the kid though not the greatest of disney movies is one nonetheless that you can sit down and watch with your family and come away from with a warm feeling
<START> this movie must be <UNK> to the rest of the world an absolute masterpiece with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in sweden the one with the newly <UNK> hotel with the <UNK> wooden figure of an old <UNK> minister is absolutely the best of the four odd story about love or career i would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended br br also the unique pause in the middle is something i've never seen before br br can't wait for the series if they're doing one or the extended dvd apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 3 5 hours
<START> i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other i have seen many movies starring <UNK> smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago this movie contained an all star cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it it is a movie that you can sit down with your family and watch though we would have to cover the kids eyes a few times due to the <UNK> love scenes overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1 10 scale lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must have
<START> beautiful emotional and subtle i watch this movie at an art center with a smaller screen in a film room with 95 of senior citizens i wish bigger cinema like around here would show it great cinematography by wong and christopher doyle since i understand <UNK> it's a lot easier for me to understand the movie as simple as the story goes many english speaking viewers didn't get the whole story three old ladies next to me keep <UNK> and have no clues about the movie br br spoiler they were surprise when i mention that mr <UNK> did sleep with mrs <UNK> and they have a son she went to <UNK> trying to tell him but didn't br br spoiler br br the <UNK> translation of the movie title actually means <UNK> like moment or memory the phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was and short the whole movie pretty much fit the title not to mention the <UNK> cheung sam br br my favorite scene was <UNK> the street corner in the alley it looks so beautiful the sun shining on the old and faded wall at night in the dark in the rain <UNK> a poetic moment i felt a strong sense of <UNK> of their relationship seeing them standing against the wall and talk quietly i felt a terrible <UNK> when mr <UNK> was <UNK> his <UNK> moment and mrs <UNK> cried on his shoulder bravo wong <UNK> <UNK> br br as much as i like this one <UNK> express still top my favorite however i'll give this one a 10 as well as a point of reference <UNK> only got 7 br br if you love art you will love this movie don't miss it
<START> wow stella shorts are great lots of <UNK> from the state and stella the tv show i never knew that stella could have gotten any better then they were on the tv show stella or even comedy central presents stella i also never knew short comedies could be any good my favorite ones were pizza <UNK> leaves the woods and david <UNK> to a meeting with his long lost cousin greg i think over all that david was the funniest one its funny when he doesn't make sense i like the music in the shorts thats something i pay attention to a lot they always had good taste in music i wish they still made shorts either that or bring back there sitcom i hope they continue making good and funny comedy
<START> i expected it to be good after i'd seen some other superb moments and read much about it but this movie is brilliant clever very bright emotionally and perfect in all moments every movement is there for a reason everything fits so closely and true and honest this is the movie about the beauty and innocence about it's simplicity
<START> the trouble with this film like so many other films that fail is the script br br the script is so <UNK> it <UNK> around all over the place what is the story here ok it's a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be <UNK> into 100 or so minutes some selection and editing is required but this script just didn't <UNK> or edit enough it didn't render <UNK> life down to one or two <UNK> pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through them <UNK> the bigger picture of the whole man br br the movie wanders from being a straight plodding <UNK> biopic to semi <UNK> using new shots <UNK> up to match archive footage to sub true life <UNK> stories movie of the week the whole i'm bringing up a son who doesn't know i'm his dad <UNK> to political conspiracy theory movie etc etc it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be and the half hearted citizen kane like narrative structure reporter <UNK> people from <UNK> past is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more <UNK> and <UNK> than it starts out br br the movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important the whole scene in the <UNK> office after vincent <UNK> pounds the window screaming i'm <UNK> hoffman i'm <UNK> hoffman i'm <UNK> hoffman i'm acting i'm acting i'm acting could have easily been cut all that happens is the psychiatrist says you have <UNK> disorder here's some <UNK> and the two women in his life say we could see you <UNK> more often and bang that's it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless <UNK> scene it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high and watch <UNK> footage from <UNK> <UNK> and hoffman phones god pointless tells us nothing about anything yet when it comes to a important moment like the drugs bust the film making is so <UNK> the situation just comes out of and doesn't make any sense to the audience suddenly he's dealing in heroin where did this come from why what is going on here br br i being a middle aged would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of 'the man' 'the 'the etc as brutal be suited <UNK> hippie hating <UNK> it may have been like that in 60's america i don't know i wasn't there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy <UNK> br br having said all that vincent <UNK> was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch <UNK> <UNK> in anything even reading a bus <UNK> though she just wasn't right for this part
<START> there's nothing left <UNK> about this perry and <UNK> masterpiece as good as any of the best episodes thankfully it was still filmed in time before the late james <UNK> sadly passed away to be included in it to show his talent br br it shows right from the start how the platoon is formed from the state of national <UNK> showing the boys as inept under captain arthur lowe and sergeant wilson john le <UNK> as they usually are through the series br br along the way does his usual longing to show authority but the <UNK> can't help but let him down at every turn during <UNK> and <UNK> an invasion they have a chance in the film though to redeem themselves when they actually capture the nazi <UNK> who take the church <UNK> hostage br br that was a nice finale especially as had been able to prove himself to the general being given one last chance to shape up a great film plenty of good lines and laughs it's another one for the dvd <UNK> i'm glad the bbc is repeating it and on this day 2 8 <UNK> they deservedly had <UNK> army <UNK> not to be missed
<START> ok i don't kid myself that this is the typical gay love life but since when are straight romances in real life as they are on the screen this movie is well balanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself it was a riot to see hugo <UNK> play a sex obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his <UNK> houses for his <UNK> with the <UNK> darren tom <UNK> and having seen him in <UNK> queen of the desert only the day before he is probably one of the most secure in their <UNK> actors around anyway the plot <UNK> smoothly and the male bonding scenes were a hoot thumbs up 8 10
<START> this film has to be one of the most boring films ever made the only thing i liked is using <UNK> esquire lighting in most of the scenes the music is awful and the pace is so slow that you can watch it at the speed and even then it would be slow the story doesn't exist it doesn't even have any shocking scenes br br it is classified on this site at least as a horror but it's not it's a sort of an art film exploring the dark side of the human nature if you are into that kind of thing and can stand the slow pace then watch it but i'd rather recommend you something japanese e g <UNK> the killer i think that the only reason this film was never in theaters is a fear of audience committing collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom generated by this movie these 80 minutes of it's length would've been better spent watching the paint dry br br i gave it 1 10 simply because there is no 0 in the pull down menu
<START> <UNK> high is such a great film that even with the <UNK> sound track urban landscape wardrobe and <UNK> it still doesn't feel dated the sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itself br br instead it <UNK> you right into it that is a <UNK> of a good movie from start to finish it doesn't miss a beat and i never grow tired of watching it br br it's ending is unique in the respect that it's one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings there may have been a few since comes to mind but <UNK> was the first and much more emotional
<START> killer <UNK> the day the damn broke 1 10 finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof even by the low standards of disaster movies excuse me allow me to correct myself even by the low standards of made for tv disaster movies this is truly awful where do i begin br br the <UNK> may have once seen a photo of a <UNK> but i doubt it most especially large ones that generate electricity have oh i don't know a power plant nearby some gates for water to run through heck even a high tension <UNK> wire or two br br the <UNK> is also somewhat two count them two employees staff the entire <UNK> all three shifts and the employees were apparently <UNK> from a clichéd ridden world war two film as they <UNK> and rather needlessly have long <UNK> death scenes complete with photos of floating by heck one of them manages to get shot by the <UNK> itself in a way that defies description br br the special effects consist of flowing water <UNK> on <UNK> of the town in a method that makes a sixties godzilla film look like the matrix a three year old drawing with a blue <UNK> on the film stock would have <UNK> better results since the disaster money shots are worthless how is the rest of the film br br needless to say the script and acting follow the special effects lead this is no diamond in the rough this is the rough so is it a guilty pleasure killer <UNK> is awful enough to generate some laughs and the film itself has that earnest incompetence that makes a good cult classic but bad disaster films need to age like a fine wine <UNK> the <UNK> meteor it is also <UNK> that michelle green hiding from the <UNK> in a <UNK> with a golden <UNK> will ever match the great henry fonda being <UNK> by that are supposed to be killer <UNK> check back with me in
<START> peter lorre gives one of his most evil performances as the owner of the titled place the plot has a new government agent being put on the track of peter <UNK> character when the g man's contact his killed by one of <UNK> agents the g man is sent to prison for the killing even though everyone knows there is more to the story lorre has the man <UNK> into his care and brought to his island where he is mining <UNK> lorre wants to know what our hero knows but he isn't talking and a battle of <UNK> is set in motion br br this is a good solid little thriller that doesn't quite make a great deal of sense plot wise but even so the film holds your interest i had put the film on last night in order to use it as something to drift off to instead i found the tale riveting enough i was up an extra 70 minutes lorre is the reason that one falls into this his quite demeanor is unnerving he does very little but its clear from his orders and the way everyone <UNK> to him watch how they light his <UNK> that he is a bad dude br br worth a look if you should run across it

<START> le 2004 is a beautifully made film that takes small carefully <UNK> steps towards its ending that need to be <UNK> in order to be enjoyed from the <UNK> landscapes to the tightly <UNK> world that the hero <UNK> we are taken by the director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel we like the hero will never escape from the <UNK> intensity and <UNK> <UNK> of his criminally driven mafia world that the film <UNK> mafia stereotypes whilst <UNK> in them makes it all the more successful the <UNK> grave the inevitable brutal <UNK> and overwhelming are laid bare and exposed for what they are just brutality and business and no more life is about being part of the corporate machine that is <UNK> crime and not about love or living for self family or others our hero is indeed a hero in that he gives up his life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful <UNK> the resolution of the misery suffered by his only <UNK> in the hotel and in order to escape his <UNK> prison the consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time see it
<START> the film's subject is poignant and very real it happened one can debate some artistic liberties taken by director and scriptwriter the subject is what makes the film <UNK> nothing else i saw the film for the first time after the real was <UNK> down in new <UNK> and had served several years as an elected member of <UNK> in india by the way she was not the first <UNK> elected to <UNK> as some reviewers stated the so called <UNK> have been elected to the indian <UNK> for decades in reserved br br while <UNK> <UNK> as a director is a hero to many india because he made <UNK> accepted international films <UNK> queen and elizabeth and a tolerable kiddie movie called mister india which was accepted by the average indian audiences and even got oscar nominations for elizabeth i do not place him as a top notch film director from india he fails in every department as a director except perhaps that he succeeds in getting some above average performances from his actors subtlety <UNK> charm are not easy to find in his films melodrama <UNK> in them br br his idea of using ali <UNK> vocal rendering of the song in the early parts of the film was perhaps his single major achievement on the <UNK> sound track of <UNK> queen and then perhaps the <UNK> doors during the gang rape sequence otherwise the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music one associates with them br br if you are looking for a good living indian film director who makes realistic cinema of international quality it is not <UNK> movies you should see it is the later works of three indian film makers <UNK> and <UNK> and of course <UNK> <UNK> it is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support that <UNK> had to give them and their films an international <UNK> for instance <UNK> <UNK> made in <UNK> or <UNK> based on <UNK> <UNK> are more complete as films to an intelligent viewer dealing on the state of the <UNK> in india <UNK> did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence but merely suggested them of course <UNK> <UNK> did not make <UNK> while effort them br br to credit he is <UNK> and used his limited talent and modest resources in the <UNK> film industry to take his products beyond home audiences for that effort i <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> queen will remain a great subject awaiting an accomplished director to deal with it
<START> following the movie that represents the <UNK> of the 1980's ninja genre namely 'the revenge of the <UNK> fans were to this bizarre offering that mixes ninja <UNK> with spiritual possession the end result being not <UNK> in nature to that somewhat horrifying experience when one spies a <UNK> of human <UNK> floating <UNK> towards <UNK> in a public swimming pool br br take for instance the supposed <UNK> introduction which is set of all places on a golf course here we witness an evil green clad ninja <UNK> a group of <UNK> for apparently no discernible reason whatsoever although i must admit that the shallow <UNK> attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport does <UNK> me somewhat though <UNK> perhaps that's why he murdered them yep i can relate to that after all actually later in the movie we are told that one of the <UNK> was a top scientist but this story line is never <UNK> upon nor <UNK> to ever again br br anyway back to the intro the police proceed to surround the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell out of the assassin and they have to keep on shooting him because he just won't stay down yes literally hundreds of rounds are <UNK> into him and still he gets up to <UNK> of the law <UNK> numbers br br finally after what seems like an eternity our <UNK> <UNK> a smoke bomb and disappears or so it seems for in actual fact he is merely hiding beneath the <UNK> and upon our decidedly <UNK> officers leaving the scene to search for his body he <UNK> out from hiding and <UNK> away br br we next see the lovely <UNK> <UNK> a truly beautiful actress and in superbly fit physical condition here playing a <UNK> <UNK> worker from her high <UNK> point she happens to spot the dying at last ninja however upon closer investigation the man supposedly on his last legs suddenly leaps upon her and <UNK> her to the ground after a bit of a struggle our <UNK> heroine manages to break free luckily but doesn't count on the ninja <UNK> hypnotic powers and she inevitably <UNK> to them it is at this point that the dying ninja actually projects his soul into our heroine his intention is to use her <UNK> form to <UNK> those officers who killed him the few he didn't actually manage to wipe out initially br br from this point on throughout the film whenever our heroine spots one of the aforementioned officers she is subjected to some <UNK> awful cinematic scenes of flashing lights smoke effects and the sword that the ninja <UNK> <UNK> her <UNK> towards her in a most <UNK> manner br br to make matters more complex a particularly irritating police officer who sports enough back and shoulder hair to put an average <UNK> to shame <UNK> in trying to win her affections in a most bloody annoying manner well of course it doesn't take the gift of <UNK> to work out that in a rather feeble <UNK> less twist towards the end of the film he is revealed to be one of the officers she must <UNK> br br but wait there's some hope yet br br step forward the one and only sho <UNK> br br yes the ninja himself and looking here as cool as ever golf club news obviously travels fast and upon learning of the said events that <UNK> there he flies all the way from japan to sort the situation out <UNK> the worst in a brief sub story that amounts to all of a few seconds <UNK> interest in this particular ninja is demonstrated to be personal after the said villain is shown to have murdered <UNK> father teacher and <UNK> one of <UNK> eyes thus <UNK> sho to wear a really <UNK> looking sword guard eye <UNK> br br after stealing his dead body from the <UNK> and then tracking down our heroine who provides an <UNK> <UNK> for the evil soul matters climax at an oriental temple seemingly in the middle of nowhere where our man sho manages to reunite the two disjointed aspects br br now <UNK> from the dead the evil ninja and sho battle it out in traditional ninja style with swords with the winner being well yes you can probably guess br br really this movie has only two things going for it namely the always excellent <UNK> who looks absolutely fantastic in the role as always and the lovely miss <UNK> what a shame that the material they found themselves in here is such a <UNK> pile of br br oh well to be fair i've seen a lot worse than this in my time although i certainly still can't recommend this other than to those desperate to complete their sho <UNK> ninja movie <UNK>
<START> <UNK> s easier to watch this film if one views it as a scenario created by star fleet lieutenant <UNK> <UNK> during his <UNK> addiction <UNK> is a recurring star trek character played by dwight <UNK> br br dwight <UNK> is miscast as <UNK> character is poorly written so we never see the depth and <UNK> of his knowledge instead we see a shallow two dimensional figure from a soap opera paul newman is also miscast as general leslie but this movie's problems go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles br br the factual errors and great liberties taken with the <UNK> of events in order to advance screenwriter bruce <UNK> political agenda make this movie embarrassing to watch that's probably why this movie has found a home on the so called history channel br br fat man and little boy combine bad science bad history bad <UNK> and mediocre acting to produce a movie that should not be viewed by <UNK> high school or college students who know nothing about the manhattan project
<START> i wish i had read the comments on imdb before i saw this movie the first 1 hour was ok though it did make me wonder why everything was centered at chicago and why no one reported any weather <UNK> from outside us isolated acts of nature of this <UNK> are <UNK> but beyond the first 60 minutes the movie just drags on like a never ending story the screenplay is horrible as for the actors very poor choice only the people hired to run in panic stick to their roles but i do have to agree that this movie has got some good <UNK> <UNK> if you rented it on a dvd and would want to watch the movie despite the reviews then play it on maximum speed your player would allow
<START> <UNK> are <UNK> lately so much that the approach therefore needs an <UNK> of fresh and creative material each time it's used to maintain its <UNK> this film does not deliver anything but worn out <UNK> of similar stories an <UNK> script weak ad <UNK> uninspired acting and unfunny self <UNK> humor br br the premise would seem promising enough the legend of the <UNK> <UNK> monster is made to order for one of these goofy <UNK> <UNK> with a vast array of history and legend waiting to be <UNK> for outrageous satire the film makers totally waste this enormous potential however we get some fool <UNK> a fake into the water gee that's original another scene has one obnoxious idiot threatening another obnoxious idiot with a gun <UNK> some gratuitous shots of a pretty girl in a bikini <UNK> did that 40 years ago and far better by the way throughout the movie somebody always seems to be yelling i suppose this is designed to wake up the audience who have <UNK> off by this point br br worst of all though is the relentless <UNK> of those reality show type interview comments made by the characters not only do they <UNK> you with this tired joke every five seconds but apparently the actors also improvised that's the only explanation for how <UNK> the jokes are if lines like i've never seen anyone write a book about non evidence were actually scripted then the writer should be shot on sight and fed to br br no wonder got violent it obviously saw this movie
<START> i was 9 when i first saw this on tv on a friday night i remember the full page ad in the tv guide with the picture of the rex amazing how some things stick in your mind after 30 years anyway if your a kid who likes monster movies this one is entertaining enough especially with <UNK> and <UNK> raging at each other special effects are no <UNK> but its worth the hour and a half if you find it somewhere on late night tv haven't seen it in a few years for some reason these classics fade from cable tv if you do catch it on late night don't be too critical just grab some <UNK> and enjoy it it might be cheesy but i thought it was a lot better than the kong remake that came out in the theaters a year before
<START> i grabbed la because it reunited jean <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> whose <UNK> le <UNK> is a noir masterpiece i'll give it a few points because <UNK> is in it but the clumsy plot cheap sets and the ludicrous <UNK> making like an arab princess put the film on my to shelf if you watch it you'll find yourself asking why didn't the idiots build the <UNK> around the well instead of a deadly few <UNK> away from it and why use tin <UNK> in the middle of the desert but by then the sheer <UNK> of <UNK> that makes up the script should <UNK> you to any further <UNK>
<START> i will be honest i rented this movie solely on the fact it was part of the child's play series i was expecting a boring dull 4th part too the series but i was surprised this movie was surprisingly good and i found it to be quite funny there was a lot of dark humor and the idea to have two dolls was a good way to spice things up the two dolls worked well together and added a bonnie and clyde type fell to the movie overall it was very good for a 4th movie in the series with some gruesome death scenes just watch the marilyn <UNK> type get killed at the beginning not to mention john ritter getting a face full of nails <UNK> to the writers for <UNK> things up and the ending although i found it a bit strange leaves room for yet another sequel maybe son of <UNK>
<START> following a roughly 7 year rocky road on nbc it was decided to do just one last super installment the series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block buster of a tv hour it had always had a <UNK> hard core of hard <UNK> of followers br br it was almost as if the series with the full title of homicide life on the street 1993 99 was a sort of mr in between of series it was too big to just <UNK> but too small to get a case of <UNK> ratings <UNK> over br br during the <UNK> <UNK> on friday <UNK> they had presented some of the best and most <UNK> artistic of <UNK> dramas there i've said it artistic artistic but please remember we mean artistic but not just phony pretentious <UNK> politically correct preaching br br when at last it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for homicide this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for tv movie br br looking at all the past <UNK> happenings and parade of regular characters the production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off br br our <UNK> as we join the story we find that <UNK> homicide unit commanding officer lt al <UNK> has pulled the pin retired from the job that is but <UNK> isn't ready to really <UNK> <UNK> yet so instead of a <UNK> chair o a fishing rod we find that al is running for mayor of <UNK> city ' br br while out in the city making some campaign stops and speeches the former detective lieutenant takes an <UNK> bullet alive but in a <UNK> state he is taken to the hospital br br news <UNK> quickly and as if officially <UNK> we find all of the detectives of the <UNK> unit we've seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance there is a great meeting of all of these former and present <UNK> as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead br br the producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story they managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to <UNK> ones the whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way but at least for now we'll leave that as classified br br in <UNK> up everything into a neat little package this tv movie surely gets our <UNK> as for <UNK> the homicide movie we must give it an a or a even but no matter the grade here it didn't score as high as a typical weekly episode
<START> this was just an awful movie i've watched it once when i was roughly 12 i am now 19 and i don't think i will ever forget this movie br br i still feel sick whenever i think about it it was just everything horrible that could possibly fit in one movie i really don't understand what kind of person would enjoy this utter rubbish it's not enough to simply turn off your mind to enjoy this movie i can enjoy the dumbest made for tv disney movies as much as the next person but this is something else completely br br usually i don't like to judge a movie until i have seen it myself but believe me i am doing you a favour do not watch this movie
<START> the <UNK> of <UNK> was one of shakespeare's most popular plays during his own lifetime but it has fallen on hard times during the 20th century because of its undeniably anti <UNK> content the play has also been called <UNK> in its <UNK> from comedic scenes to tragic ones leading some to say it is two plays trying to <UNK> as one joseph <UNK> who played william shakespeare in shakespeare in love is in love with <UNK> collins superb but needs to borrow a considerable sum of money to woo her he goes to his sometime gay lover antonio jeremy <UNK> who hasn't the <UNK> on his person but takes out a <UNK> from the jewish <UNK> <UNK> al pacino <UNK> is amused and offended that antonio who insults him for his religion now comes to him for money but he offers it on the condition that the penalty for on the <UNK> will be a pound of <UNK> flesh which is of course what happens and offer <UNK> considerably more then the original <UNK> instead of the pound of flesh but <UNK> <UNK> after his daughter leaves him and marries a christian refuses to take it in a scene where the audience is never quite sure where to place its <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of what should be <UNK> his and then <UNK> him of his wealth and religion <UNK> was originally <UNK> as a cartoonish villain but modern actors and directors have turned him into a tragic figure <UNK> against the <UNK> of <UNK> century <UNK> al pacino does an excellent job as <UNK> and jeremy <UNK> is good as antonio but i think that <UNK> <UNK> work as is the best part of the play is one of the few notable female roles in shakespeare's <UNK> and collins is wonderful in the part joseph <UNK> is more than a bit dull however i've never particularly enjoyed his often overwrought acting style i give the <UNK> of <UNK> an 8 10
<START> i watched this movie about six years ago and i recently did so again if i remember correctly i did not like it at all the first time and i appreciated it slightly more this second time br br this movie is obviously on a big budget the effects are mostly top notch except for one or two <UNK> and the cast is impressive however there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show br br firstly whoever decided that peter <UNK> should act as a crazy russian astronaut should be fired being a <UNK> and a fan of peter i'm pretty sure he can play a russian character well but his performance in this case is plain stupid both with respect the lines <UNK> and the acting so something must be wrong with the script i'd like to see peter as a professional russian astronaut instead br br secondly the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is nearly unbearable to watch it is a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch one's breath in addition to this the events that unfold are simply not credible i'd like to see a much more sensible and stripped down version of this part of the movie br br finally the scenes that involve flying space <UNK> are too action biased the <UNK> are <UNK> like if they were a couple of <UNK> at zero safety distance while <UNK> off car sized ice <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> balls the director should watch apollo 13 to learn the limitations of <UNK> like these br br i like the music score because it is dramatic to a degree making it very touching the overall performance of the actors is great apart from the things mentioned above the story is interesting and quite easy to follow br br with some minor changes this would have been a 8 10 movie i'm sorry it isn't
<START> this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the cast is an international one australian pretending to be british stage american and a character with an english name sporting an <UNK> european accent what passable efforts in acting from this <UNK> crew are totally <UNK> by a plot and script of <UNK> <UNK> so short were the of this film's budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic <UNK> competition in the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and slash thrillers of extraordinary though not necessarily high quality which have been made on no budget at all recent examples include the poorly made but totally scary blair witch project and of course the most recent that low budget winner saw featuring practically unknown leads gary <UNK> is just someone you don't remember even if you have seen him before in <UNK> it is shocking to find a known character actor <UNK> and hollywood has been jeff <UNK> struggling <UNK> to save the film it is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man <UNK> in corny makeup <UNK> <UNK> bad lines i would have rated this film 0 out of 10 had that been possible
<START> <UNK> starts off with a fairly impressive for a <UNK> effect we re also introduced to a scientist who s called <UNK> don t you get it <UNK> hell er <UNK> so i guess someone on the production had some intelligence however it does become more and more obvious as the <UNK> progresses that intelligence has been <UNK> throughout the storyline in order to appeal to an american <UNK> audience br br the story itself is overwhelmed by subplots featuring <UNK> stock <UNK> characters like the tough liberal <UNK> who s trying to save a home boy from a life of crime the doctor who s lost his medical <UNK> etc in fact the story concentrates far more on these characters than the approaching disaster that all the potential tension and drama the scenario might have had soon goes up in a <UNK> of smoke and being a <UNK> we just know that there won t be a downbeat ending br br there is an <UNK> problem i noticed and that is <UNK> there s an explosion there s a massive <UNK> which looks ridiculous not to mention physically impossible look at the scene where the national guard are in a fight with a gang a soldier fires a <UNK> into a tower block and the whole building explodes in a fire ball what a small containing no more than a few <UNK> of high explosive can do that no it can t there s also another scene of army <UNK> blowing up a <UNK> with plastic explosive and the same <UNK> effect is seen can directors please note that high explosive is not the same as <UNK> br br having said that i did find <UNK> highly watchable for a <UNK> and at no time did i find myself wanting to turn it off it did have some potential and let me repeat the special effects are fairly good considering the budget and it s not as bad a <UNK> as some people are making out
<START> this movie was bad and the movies about how some college students stay at a house to get money by <UNK> it and then they find out that the house has a woman <UNK> in it and that there is a <UNK> to hell in this movie there are <UNK> of stupid scenes like at the start of the movie how they are cleaning the house and they start to dancing to a cheesy song and some of the demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad costumes trying to make scary sounds and there are some good gore scenes like when the professor gets his face ripped of i only hired this movie because i am a big fan of horror movies and its only worth watching if u are a fan of horror movies the acting in this movie is really bad the only good actor is roy <UNK> from the great movie jaws and over all this movie has <UNK> of flaws and my rating is 4 out of 10
<START> this is the episode that probably most closely relates to it's partner law <UNK> <UNK> not kill in that it directly brings up the ever controversial issue why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong this issue is presented in two parts within the episode before the killing when the film shows the <UNK> between the idealistic up and coming lawyer and the street thug so caught up in his ways that his life is merely a representation of what he's supposed to do followed by the period after the trial and before the execution when both are made to suffer for the deaths they feel responsible for and thus share br br one of the great things about the way these episodes work are in the both small and big ways the story is fully developed so that we understand both the motivations and <UNK> of characters we're only able to spend slightly less than an hour with for all his criminal intentions and mockery the killer is still very sympathetic revolving the most important part of his actions around a history of accidental death his way of killing is more a desire to control death than it is any desire to actually destroy similarly the <UNK> idealistic <UNK> shows one unwilling to allow death to happen in a world where he can't control it their meeting is indeed important they both have to give in to it while not <UNK> it br br as an aside it's interesting how much this episode affects viewing of <UNK> <UNK> later <UNK> of the <UNK> colours trilogy one of <UNK> biggest influences seems to be the idea of justice and considering that the <UNK> is a <UNK> on something that represents divine justice this one seems almost the most self conscious br br <UNK>
<START> this western was set in <UNK> and had to do with the creation of the first <UNK> lines that were laid by western union while nice guy dean jagger sporting lots of hair did his best to get this done there was a bad guy just waiting to <UNK> this for his own selfish reasons so it's up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the day br br this is certainly one of the better 1940s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an 8 it was that good however for the life of me i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this film after all he knew nothing about westerns his <UNK> was drama and i guess this movie is a drama of sorts just set in the old west strange yes but it seemed to work out okay though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job br br as for the rest of the film it's exceptional with vivid color great location shooting and very good acting as usual randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance i was surprised though with robert young being also cast in the film but it was a good casting decision he was supposed to be a <UNK> educated when i saw barton was also in the film i pretty much assumed he'd be the baddie and my thoughts were well <UNK> since he made a career out of playing <UNK> as for the script it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part but the final showdown between scott and barton was a lot better than i'd hoped making this movie ending on a very high note
<START> nothing great here but a nicely acted story about an abused deaf wife fonda of a small time crook <UNK> who gets involved with one of her husband's plans and his mistress sutherland and <UNK> are cops drawn into what turns out to be a <UNK> murder investigation and the story just flows along
<START> br br as a harold lloyd fan i agree with the other <UNK> comments except that i feel that movie crazy was his best sound film <UNK> <UNK> is a close second but this is just my opinion br br this film is a hoot from beginning to end and in many scenes george the crook that gets him elected mayor almost steals the show especially at the end of the film br br one wishes that <UNK> character would be a bit more sympathetic to harold especially as the film progresses only in the last few minutes of the film do we find out her true feelings for him and even then there is no romance kissing etc br br this is a must see film
<START> my friends and i saw the movie last night in austin at a showing for a film festival this movie was one of the best i've seen this year it was a great comedy very original and heartfelt and funny as hell everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie texas is a big state with lots of small towns and of course plenty of teenagers who grew up as fat girls i know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level ashley <UNK> and robin de jesus were awesome they were so great in these rolls it was like the script was written with them in mind and speaking of the script it was very well written very believable and ash is a great actor his facial expressions alone made me giggle it is an independent film but don't let that fool you it's a good one seeing this caliber of work from someone so young is truly inspiring

<START> what can i say about this such a big <UNK> production but in the end wasted time wasted money br br this work a disaster is historically seen only some examples br br <UNK> often is named his first name but the old <UNK> don't used this name correct would be the <UNK> <UNK> and or the br br <UNK> was shown as wife but this historically wrong br br was shown as nice young woman but she wasn't one adultery and maybe prostitution and arrogant behavior was the cause of her <UNK> br br she wasn't at the dying bed of her father she never was allowed to leave her <UNK> and she was at this time around 50 years old not as young as she was shown in the same year <UNK> died she committed suicide because stopped giving her a <UNK> br br <UNK> was much more then in this movie shown but author and director seems to believe own br br what remains historically extremely <UNK> bad acting bad built and equipment 2 points out of 10 one for peter o'toole
<START> where to begin i like the scary snow monster named jack frost the whole concept works well for me we thought he'd be back and he was changing the local to a <UNK> resort works seeing old friends and meeting new characters scott macdonald does a great job as jack frost you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance <UNK> jack frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first i do have one complaint the little <UNK> or the as i call them they looked like hand puppets i think they could have done a better job with the the mouth could have opened wider but the cgi was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again if you liked jack frost then you will like this sequel no questions or debate 9 big stars
<START> well what do you know i was painting my house today and an <UNK> john song came on the radio which immediately took me back to this movie which i saw in 1971 so long ago and so far away ten years later i <UNK> through the country side of france and i sure would have been keen to see michelle the film is probably not very sophisticated by todays standards <UNK> the pity but it seemed rather <UNK> back then a few years later a sequel was made with michelle living in a high rise in paris and paul coming back to meet her just like life they had moved on the film was very downbeat still the original was <UNK> and if you can get a copy go rent it just remember to give it its' due and treat it gently i note americans can be rather <UNK> so take note contains scenes and themes possibly <UNK> to middle america
<START> you have to see this i could not stop laughing about the <UNK> i saw in this movie even late after the event there is maybe a million of individual mistakes and <UNK> in this movie the acting is bad the story is so predictable and flat the effects are like 50 years old the supposed thriller is nowhere you will not enjoy the movie but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it a long time after it we had a great time after the movie truly me and my friend spent entire <UNK> long bus trip home <UNK> about this movie like we have seen next oscar winner sadly we were talking about all those bad things we had just seen
<START> br br the play has been heavily edited and the order of the scenes has been completely mixed up the acting is appalling especially by helena bonham carter and the cinematography poor br br the result is a slow confused boring film which will put those new to shakespeare off shakespeare instantly br br if you can't see a stage play then at least see the olivier version 1948 instead of this drivel
<START> a very intelligent and exciting thriller that doesn't rely on action but on situation which is all to rare these days i would compare this film to the day of the another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal the acting across the board is <UNK> <UNK> quinn has a <UNK> double role as the vicious terrorist carlos and as the navy man who <UNK> him donald sutherland plays the amoral cia agent who hires him ben kingsley plays the israeli officer who <UNK> in the plan this is a very tense and effective film and it's remarkable considering just how little action there is in it the first half of the film is all set up as the navy man <UNK> to <UNK> carlos the second half is a breathless <UNK> the action coming out of the characters and their situations thus making it all the more gripping a really tight film that shouldn't be overlooked
<START> this horror movie starts out <UNK> enough and there is a moment where i thought to myself this is going to be really good however it gets rather boring rather quick at the end the acting is fairly good as is the location and the story starts out rather well too the problem not enough kills on screen and an ending where you have the monster basically turning tail and running i wanted to see more especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where i thought the movie was picking up and going to be a winner unfortunately after that the movie showed the monster very little and the back of the dvd <UNK> as it told me that the desert beneath the people literally came alive and was capable of <UNK> their flesh now that would have been some movie a nearly <UNK> situation granted that would have made viewers uncomfortable and it might of <UNK> up the tension but that is what horror movies are supposed to do instead we have very few shots of the creature or creatures as it were and when we do see it it is mainly on the <UNK> still it wasn't all bad it just needed more horror less hunting and more <UNK>
<START> this is a pretty simplistic romance girl finds boy girl loves boy girl loses boy girl finds boy <UNK> moore is the outstanding <UNK> in this recipe delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic romantic performance well deserving of an oscar <UNK> equally fine are the <UNK> combat special effects br br moore plays a french girl whose mother has turned over their field to a british <UNK> <UNK> during wwi she is the daughter of the <UNK> loved as a little sister into this mix comes a fill in for a <UNK> <UNK> gary cooper at first they hate each other then they love each other then the entire <UNK> is sent out on a suicide mission cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit <UNK> him moore <UNK> for him is told at a hospital he is dead then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited br br it's a nice little romance but hardly more than that recommended for fans of ms moore and mr cooper
<START> frank sinatra took this role <UNK> it up with the rest of the scenery and <UNK> it out his way is <UNK> the ending is trite some of the scenes need a little more cutting but that's all it's great entertainment from start to finish and while you watch it you realise that sinatra that long dead <UNK> <UNK> had <UNK> gangster card games and the whole us urban <UNK> thing in his blood he didn't learn it from an acting coach there are all sorts of directorial touches to keep you amused and the non dated soundtrack <UNK> all the way the marathon card game beat <UNK> sopranos etc by forty years so it wasn't faithful to the book what movie is and i can't imagine it being remembered if brando had been let loose on it the cold turkey scenes would have been embarrassing instead of edgy convincing and moving with sinatra no one else has mentioned the seedy lazy cynical cops absolutely spot on and <UNK> parker would have driven me to <UNK>
<START> i saw this film via one of the actors' agents and it surely <UNK> with a great deal that comes out of australia in terms of the overall tone which is rightly dark and moody br br i thought the little boy in the film was excellent mostly kid actors are <UNK> up and embarrassing but not in this case he was really very good in terms of the <UNK> <UNK> mentioned by well i just think this film is plain ' it's a real weirdo film with weirdo locations storyline weird stuff going on the whole time but <UNK> weird as opposed to <UNK> br br its hard to think of other movies like it but its not at all like cars ate paris maybe more like a <UNK> but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the 60's its certainly has an interesting mind working behind it br br my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also what did you mean by god <UNK> when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious
<START> <UNK> as the <UNK> old whore is awesome emily grace the young girl is innocent and exciting as she learns whats going down excellent direction and camera story is dark and disturbing supporting cast is good shows what happens and can happen with a run of bad luck great independent film small cast pace is slow at first and then moves good a good movie to show your teen age daughter who has aspirations of leaving home early for the open road and adventure this movie film has a low budget feel to it but it works because of the low <UNK> and areas that these people move in i will never stop a rest stop again with out thinking of this movie and checking my <UNK> before i go
<START> i saw this movie for the first time on nbc friday 11 <UNK> <UNK> it was a pretty good movie but i don't think it would be the kind of muppet movie jim <UNK> would make i mean first of all using the word sexy every now and then and <UNK> saying it would suck and i <UNK> know jim <UNK> wouldn't allow <UNK> yelling i wish i'd never been born thirteen time a minute this movie just isn't like a classic muppet movie sure i can understand <UNK> holiday stealing the baseball diamond from the great muppet caper but a business lady cheating the muppets in a contract for their theater to turn it into a <UNK> nightclub if jim <UNK> was here today he would hate this movie
<START> so then this is what passes as high art for the likes of <UNK> film festival and sundance eh well i suppose i can relate as long as story script dialog acting save for ms cinematography and editing are completely irrelevant br br i remember telling other film making friends some years ago that the biggest problem with digital video was that we were now going to have to <UNK> through a future sea of crap to get to anything worth watching now that anyone and his brother or brothers in the case of the could run out and make a movie the <UNK> chair need i say more br br this feature length video is yet another chapter in the dismal ever <UNK> world of movies young guns armed with a a few thousand dollars a <UNK> written shallow script and some friends they call actors who decide one afternoon to make a movie and <UNK> instant feature video makers don't get me wrong i'm all about independent cinema i e <UNK> sucks but having said that you can't argue with some of the realities of that system br br if the brothers would've had to have gone out and raised a real budget and bring on real producers its clear a script like this would never have been green <UNK> and <UNK> lies the problem there is no longer such a thing as a <UNK> process for getting films sorry videos ready for production just grab a <UNK> camera and off you go and what makes it worse is that high profile festivals like the aforementioned actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense and why precisely because its no budget br br i think its important especially in todays climate of indie films to quit allowing video makers to high jack the language by <UNK> themselves filmmakers there is quite a difference in my book when you have to go out and actually put your script on the line asking friends and family or business people for real money to make a feature film knowing the potentially <UNK> at stake then you will know what it means to be a filmmaker but dropping a few hundred at <UNK> club for some <UNK> tapes some <UNK> and <UNK> doesn't cut it br br oh and by the way i have to mention how utterly annoying it was to listen to a female being addressed as dude throughout the entire movie even mark <UNK> that intensely <UNK> <UNK> for his male friends only where it is at least endearing where his buddy mike is concerned br br i think its high time the indie film community started to call out these shoddy no budget videos for what they are and simultaneously <UNK> <UNK> festivals for giving such casual efforts high praise either that or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy to add a new category to their festival line ups dude films
<START> br br <UNK> warn us of the current campaign to drug users note the nostalgia for <UNK> in italy and remind us of our wont to profile likely terrorists focus reminds us of the <UNK> of rampant fear and <UNK> and the anti <UNK> disguised as pro <UNK> of the wwii era what goes around br br lawrence newman william c macy becomes the unfortunate victim of hate crimes after he is mistaken for a jew and these attacks increase when his bride laura dern highlights the look newman <UNK> against the false <UNK> when they cause him direct harm but he minds his own business we see the rise in anti <UNK> attacks through his <UNK> a condition not completely <UNK> by <UNK> br br <UNK> typical <UNK> role is featured again and the long road to realization that we are all connected nearly costs him his life br br what is it about the character macy portrays to us we can't choose to ignore the violence hate and <UNK> because <UNK> forces us to take sides <UNK> dilemma is that he has no alternative but to side with the <UNK> and goes through hell to see it and our sadness is that most of us need to be beaten up to realize the dangers surrounding us br br let's focus
<START> spoilers spoilers there must have been something in the air in the immediate <UNK> years that made night cities attractive settings for movies a <UNK> of <UNK> urban films were made at that time and not just in america one of the most notable was carol <UNK> odd man out an english picture about a wounded <UNK> <UNK> through the streets of <UNK> in america it was the high <UNK> or more properly high midnight of film noir br br <UNK> isn't really film noir but has the <UNK> of noir though it uses them for its own aims which have to do with <UNK> directed by edward written by john paxton it was adapted from a novel by richard brooks the book concerned the murder of a homosexual in the movie the victim is changed to a jew though filmed like a mystery there is little suspense in the film as it is fairly obvious who the murderer is early on what makes the film so watchable and beautiful is its <UNK> of a city washington d c just after world war ii by some of the most gifted <UNK> working in films at that time unlike many night movies <UNK> is set mostly <UNK> in police stations <UNK> houses and all night movie theaters soldiers are everywhere in the film and most are <UNK> to get back to their <UNK> lives yet one senses from most of the men we meet that their personalities have been so shaped by their military experience it's going to be tough for them to return to their old <UNK> for some maybe even impossible they seem more bound to one another than to anything or anyone else br br yet some men never truly <UNK> with anyone in the military the murderer monty is one such individual one senses that he was never connected in his <UNK> life either he is a lone wolf who also needs people desperately alone he has a sadistic streak a mile wide and always needs someone nearby to be the butt of his jokes the man he kills did him no harm and was in fact a stranger to him but once monty figured out the man's religion that was enough he didn't really mean to kill the guy as it was his intent to <UNK> him and just beat him up but as he was quite drunk at the time <UNK> <UNK> got the better of him it is this act that sets the story the story in motion br br once the movie builds up a head of steam the other characters come rapidly into focus <UNK> opposite number is another soldier who though <UNK> like monty and somewhat detached <UNK> no <UNK> toward anyone and seems a reasonable even <UNK> guy <UNK> the <UNK> smoking homicide detective is <UNK> and a tad <UNK> compared to the men in uniform but proves more than a match for the various and mostly soldiers he deals with the actors who plays these roles roberts ryan mitchum and young give excellent performances each in a different key ryan as monty is tense and paranoid always looking around for someone to pick on and one can feel his anxiety over becoming a victim himself as mitchum is low key almost <UNK> he never raises his voice and he seems to have more to say more to offer than is <UNK> by the script <UNK> performance has often been criticized as being too soft but i find it <UNK> strong and nicely offbeat he cuts against the stereotype of the <UNK> cop and makes the character of <UNK> a bit of a prince of crime <UNK> br br there are few surprises in <UNK> though the script is at times surprisingly well written even brilliant character actor paul kelly gives one of the best short performances in the movies as the of a woman a soldier picks up in a bar kelly may or may not be her husband and he may or may not live with her though he seems relaxed enough in her apartment the beauty of these scenes are that nothing is made clear and this man himself seems more than a little confused over what his role is was or ought to be in a way these few scenes form the <UNK> core of the film which is with the exception of the detective all the men in the film are <UNK> <UNK> and basically lost some more seriously than others in this respect <UNK> is for all the preaching near the end a film about the <UNK> of identity and how easily it can be lost or <UNK> men drift from one bar to another in this film as they engage in a sort of <UNK> <UNK> their personalities <UNK> into a kind of general american male <UNK> then something happens something is nailed down a word is mentioned whether or and things suddenly turn tense and the very notion of <UNK> of an identity outside the group of anyone not like them becomes deeply offensive even <UNK> then after <UNK> <UNK> and whatever <UNK> them up has been resolved or forgotten the men <UNK> to their loose non personal group <UNK> and order is restored
<START> at first i honestly thought it would be a corny movie but after seeing this i was quite surprised amanda <UNK> was convincingly funny along with the supporting cast especially that character played by bullet tooth tony from snatch what a <UNK> role between those two movies now i'm not one to say whether or not an actor is good or not but her act especially was thoroughly enjoyable even though the plot <UNK> into a <UNK> <UNK> love triangle though very funny half way into the movie i feel that this shouldn't <UNK> what i think the movie really is simply entertaining so if you happen to stumble upon it whether by dvd or theater i'm confident that you'll enjoy
<START> well <UNK> well <UNK> teen meg <UNK> must spend the night in a creepy <UNK> as an <UNK> into a high school club problem is a powerful psychic named was just buried there that day but he isn't quite dead and he needs the life force of humans for his powers br br obscure horror film offers plenty of thrills and chills an appealing and likeable cast and most superior special effects br br my rating 7 out of 10 br br one dark night is rated r for violence and adult themes
<START> this is a modest <UNK> traditional western with a formulaic plot about opposition between <UNK> and crop <UNK> around the town of liberal kansas the story is essentially routine and features a number of the classic western conflicts there is the farmer versus the <UNK> there is the clash between <UNK> land and <UNK> <UNK> on the one hand and the wilderness frontier <UNK> on the other and what this represents ultimately is the opposition of two value systems <UNK> and community values as set against rugged <UNK> br br randolph scott plays legendary <UNK> bat <UNK> who rides into liberal at <UNK> of a land agent robert ryan to help him sort out the bad guys who are the hard drinking <UNK> <UNK> the two men <UNK> but reunite to tackle the <UNK> elements in the town br br the script is clichéd but the action is <UNK> along with <UNK> by director ray <UNK> and there are solid performances all round in addition to rugged performances by the male leads there is comic relief <UNK> by george <UNK> hayes an <UNK> villain nicely played by steve <UNK> and attractive <UNK> from maggie meredith as a <UNK> and proper <UNK> by ryan and anne <UNK> as a saloon singer as long as you do not place a <UNK> on originality this is good <UNK> entertainment for western lovers
<START> the chemistry between sally <UNK> and <UNK> cassidy was incredible they were thoroughly convincing and genuinely likable in their roles <UNK> <UNK> played the conniving mrs brilliantly despite the fact that she was a <UNK> <UNK> she somehow managed to have you <UNK> with her in the end rupert evans played the <UNK> ball gentleman with sheer charm and he was a scene <UNK> the story itself was very unique as was the manner in which it was told the victorian england setting featuring two lesbian lead characters was intriguing and delightful there were some fantastic and unexpected twists and turns that really kept the audience engaged in the story a wonderful cast and excellent story made this film superb
<START> i've come to realise through watching this sort of film that i don't like them very much <UNK> women is yet another <UNK> in <UNK> film and like the most of the rest of the genre the plot is completely <UNK> in favour of simply showing nude women now don't get me wrong i love nude women but i also like there to be some sort of plot thread to go with the nudity and since this film has only the basic <UNK> are in <UNK> theme running through it <UNK> as the essential escape of course i got a bit bored before the end the film is good because there's barely a moment in it where the women are wearing clothes but that's about the only positive element director and writer ha ha <UNK> c <UNK> <UNK> in showing close ups of the naked female body but it's never very erotic the director was the producer on a number of trash flicks including some directed by jess franco in my opinion he should stick to producing as his writing talents are non existent and he doesn't seem to know how to film a sex scene this sort of material is rather dry a lot of the time but i <UNK> franco could have made more out of it overall this might suffice for people that are really into this sort of stuff but i can't say i enjoyed it
<START> clint eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993 teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense <UNK> peterson eastwood delivers as only he can also john <UNK> goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin as for <UNK> russo as <UNK> love interest i think kirk douglas said it best when he said referring to his own career i keep getting older and my leading ladies keep getting younger this film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going eastwood and peterson should team together more often top notch movie
<START> crash is overwrought over thought and over baked a great example of how to make a pompous and self important film with a message <UNK> tries too hard to make his point and in just about every category of the film it feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a <UNK> to the skull sure race relations affect everyone and there's a great deal of ambiguity to the issue but the universe of <UNK> to suggest that we are all victims to our own <UNK> on race it's a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad <UNK> and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes i found the <UNK> of the characters <UNK> and forced and the film took forever to <UNK> out and die the fact that this film is in the top 50 movies on imdb is a testament to the <UNK> <UNK> to get <UNK> by hollywood <UNK> br br indeed if you want the real crash go check out the one by david <UNK> dark twisted and original this film plays as preachy tiresome and <UNK>
<START> this line is a good summary of this movie if you have read it and watched 20 minutes of the movie you will know exactly how the rest of the movie is going to behave some <UNK> named <UNK> are searching for hell in the underworld of <UNK> however he seems to have disappeared and his friend <UNK> follows with a team to search after him could they have find a more boring plot some bad actors looking after an old man in the underground the acting is very bad the romance really feels pointless and untrue often there is no good reason for the way the characters are acting nothing is scary and most of all there's not happening anything interesting in the whole entire movie they just walk asking some gang leaders and other guys about the way walk some more complain some finds the old man and then they run and finally finds the way out of the underground br br the only thing that provides me from giving this movie the lowest of all ratings is the atmosphere if you just want to see a movie for that this may be a good choice it's dark and it's mystical and murky however the rest of the movie is really dull you just sit there all the time waiting for the movie to begin or something to happening it's actually happening some things but they are not very well performed for example i didn't really notice when one of the characters disappeared and i swear i wasn't sleeping or something and i don't understand what's dangerous with these children they just run around in the underground together scratching it walls with sticks i suppose it is meant to be scary in some way br br just watch this movie if you are in immediate need of some murky <UNK>
<START> only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be i will state the following without repeating the obvious flaws <UNK> stated by some of the other <UNK> the film is shot on video what type of camera i don't know but the cameraman had it on <UNK> all the time so that any slight movement makes it go in and out of focus in many of the scenes the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes this alone screams amateur br br i also noticed that out in the <UNK> of the you can hear the sound of the <UNK> <UNK> that is <UNK> the lights <UNK> br br also what is with that single lighting source that follows and many times <UNK> the actors when they walk around it looks like a <UNK> with that <UNK> camera <UNK> that follows the people around like a spotlight there was no <UNK> for lighting design <UNK> and i know why the saw no need to have someone who actually knew what they were doing lighting this picture note i didn't say film so be prepared for a single glaring spotlight as the sole source of for most of the movie br br this is probably the most technically inept production i've ever seen <UNK> released i bought this title because i like bad cinema usually it's so bad that you can laugh at it this is just so bad that it's unwatchable plan nine from outer space is citizen kane in comparison to this title
<START> this is a great story although there are some jimmy stewart <UNK> parts for the most part it is a compelling tale about an individual with a compelling drive vision and sense of adventure to say the least the bottom line is it is one of my favorites to watch and i've done so probably dozens to times that is until someone stole it our of a bag i left on a plane on a flight to california br br some have commented about too many flashbacks but i don't know a better way to keep a long flight interesting for those of us who actually fly flight can be hours of boredom <UNK> by moments of terror i wouldn't have wanted to see the flight <UNK> at all the oppressive need for sleep and the <UNK> and surrounding loneliness is part of the story br br there are many parts that i particularly like including the <UNK> from long island and landing at night in paris wow things have really changed with us and the french since then the airplane building scenes and the record breaking flight from san diego are interesting as is the incident over the atlantic in ice which i understand is not completely true but did happen on the san diego flight br br one gets the sense that one of biggest <UNK> are his <UNK> supporters as well as his <UNK> br br some of the lines that ring in my head now and then include pull the on the <UNK> scene and i hope i don't have to use it that way when describing the submarine like <UNK> to the lady who <UNK> him a mirror so he could better see his <UNK> <UNK> br br this movie is not for everybody but it certainly is for me i hope they make it on dvd soon so i can replace my stolen version
<START> this is a pretty pointless remake starting with the opening title shots of the original was a real mistake as it reminds the viewer of what a great little period piece <UNK> that was the new version that follows is an exercise in <UNK> br br brian <UNK> plays a <UNK> <UNK> photographer who returns to a semi abandoned desert town populated by a <UNK> of underdeveloped clichéd stock characters the <UNK> sucking doll <UNK> the old <UNK> <UNK> the crippled vet and his asian wife etc br br character witnesses the crashing of <UNK> into a <UNK> and shortly after strange things start to happen as pieces of weird blue rock are scattered around the <UNK> starts to rise all the water in the area <UNK> people start to act <UNK> things explode character gets in and out of his car more often than is <UNK> possible in one movie the film develops no sense of place no character development no humour no tension everything that made the jack <UNK> original a creepy little cold war paranoia classic has been abandoned it just runs through its minimal <UNK> and then just ends br br the special effects aren't very special the interior of the ship looks like bits of <UNK> film wrapped round some <UNK> which were then <UNK> in front of the camera to frame some of the most uninspired and clumsy wire work ever put onto the screen the script is repetitive everyone says everything at least twice <UNK> gets to say let's get out of here at least three times during the movie twice in one scene loads of things are left unexplained at the end why do the aliens need all the heat and water for example not that anyone watching would care if the film makers didn't care why should we br br the acting is adequate better than the script which at times has an under <UNK> <UNK> quality deserves though often the actors look like they just want to get the thing over with as quickly as possible a notable example of this is when elizabeth <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> token moment of frustrated despair hands to face gesture before following <UNK> son <UNK> outside to watch him do angry <UNK> teenager <UNK> something off a table gesture br br continuity errors include the <UNK> <UNK> on the back of <UNK> appearing and disappearing a double action of the gas in the exploding car a towns person being in two places simultaneously once in the alien <UNK> shot then immediately afterwards in a reaction shot elizabeth <UNK> appearing to shut a car door twice you can tell i was <UNK> can't you the movie commits that greatest of errors it's boring
<START> i first saw the movie a couple of years ago and was totally and utterly impressed but its <UNK> it is one of the most touching films i have ever seen though it might appear a little bit pretentious and artificial too much beautiful if you will anyway one thing is for sure the camera man has done a great job each picture deserves to be cut off the film and displayed as a separate peace of art comparable to the or bernard paintings br br the music forms a perfect background for the story especially <UNK> one played between the first and the second novels at the beach scene as for the casting i cannot be objective since i like sophie and jean very much and cannot add more to the <UNK> comments of others br br however the very fact that many people critics and those sophisticated in cinema criticized the movie made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time no doubt the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous but this is somehow not enough to make a <UNK> and cohesive film the second novel when sophie tells her story to is somehow superficial and does not tell much about the motivations of the people involved was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked or what apparently it does not add anything to the idea of the movie and even the <UNK> voice of is being unable to link it to the main plot br br other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot which <UNK> many of the logic <UNK> within them the scene when jean is <UNK> the city through the huge window of his apartment on the top of the high building is absolutely incredible the feeling of <UNK> air and fine <UNK> which is being spread by the first scene can literally be <UNK> through the screen no doubt antonioni is a great master of shades and semi shades my favorite novel is the last one the most romantic deep and meaningful i guess that it the most antonioni like one in the whole movie almost a <UNK> probably the overall positive impression from the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small italian town with its <UNK> narrow streets and crooked <UNK> <UNK> with the and monumental <UNK> it was <UNK> but really touching br br i hope that my impressions and comments on the movie however chaotic they are would <UNK> somebody to spend an evening watching it it works better with the home theater having somebody caring by your side than in the movie theater enjoy br br i beg your <UNK> for the <UNK> english and any possible <UNK>
<START> i liked the whole set up with palace the roman guards and <UNK> in this event also marked the passing of the torch as far as the voice of the <UNK> goes gorilla <UNK> who had done the play by play for every <UNK> <UNK> up to this point opens up and gives the typical introduction making it look like he's there to <UNK> another <UNK> but then introduces jim ross who is making his <UNK> debut and jr continues to do the <UNK> commentary to this day but outside of that this event is pure garbage good <UNK> scientific wrestling has been thrown out the window and enter the birth of gimmicks this to me was the event that the <UNK> started to go down the toilet and didn't recover until the attitude era of the late 90's here's a review of the event br br <UNK> title match <UNK> <UNK> vs shawn michaels <UNK> an okay opener but given what shawn is capable of it was very disappointing i have no idea why the <UNK> was hell bent on putting <UNK> over they should of realized that shawn was the future and <UNK> was just some hyper wrestler in an indian the ending of the match itself was very lame shawn grabs the <UNK> and pulls him out then gets called for a count out while it was fun watching <UNK> get beat up <UNK> this match just was forgettable shawn had to carry this match and had trouble doing it br br the brothers vs the <UNK> <UNK> get the win via a this match had it's moments but the crowd just didn't seem into it there was no heat behind it i think it was a match just to throw two tag teams in br br crush vs <UNK> the clown terrible terrible terrible this match completely sucked two very lame gimmicks a clown and a <UNK> dressed in bizarre colors the ending caught everybody by surprise in the upcoming months crush turned <UNK> and <UNK> turned face but none of the fans seem to care sadly this was not the worst match on the card br br razor <UNK> vs bob you got a brand new <UNK> that is very over going against a wrestler who was forgotten about 10 years ago the fans <UNK> and laugh when comes out and like hogan rock in and <UNK> owen in the <UNK> wrestler gets <UNK> cheers in the face thankfully this match was short the right guy won but i wish they had razor totally beat the crap out of and <UNK> rather than winning by a small package out of nowhere br br tag team champion match ted <UNK> and irs <UNK> vs hulk hogan <UNK> <UNK> w jimmy hart i still would like to know the full story on what happened to <UNK> eye oh well the crowd was really into this match but it had no flow to it what so ever hogan and <UNK> were clearly suffering ring <UNK> given that both <UNK> had been on the shelf for at least a year <UNK> being the great technical wrestler that he was did help to carry the match from being a complete waste the ending was a surprise with <UNK> and irs getting the win via <UNK> but to please the crowd hogan and <UNK> did their usual playing to the crowd at the end like they had won the match br br lex <UNK> vs mr perfect the best part of this match was the four hot chicks that accompanied lex <UNK> to the ring other than that this was completely forgettable the mr perfect gimmick was born for a <UNK> role and he just lacked the heat as a face and <UNK> is just a waste of time no matter what gimmick he's in <UNK> wins via a despite that feet were in the <UNK> then perfect spends the post match getting his butt kicked first <UNK> knocks him out with the running <UNK> then when perfect <UNK> consciousness he goes back to the dressing room to find <UNK> only to get the crap beaten out of him by shawn michaels setting up an <UNK> perfect <UNK> that had the potential to be a classic but the <UNK> <UNK> br br the undertaker vs giant <UNK> absolute crap what was the <UNK> thinking bringing in such a horrible wrestler as giant <UNK> sure he had size but i'd rather watch the brooklyn in a match than him this isn't even worth commenting on br br <UNK> championship match <UNK> hart <UNK> vs <UNK> <UNK> you have one of the greatest technical <UNK> of all time going against a guy who's only advantage is that he's a gigantic <UNK> ass <UNK> was able to carry the match but a rather predictable ending with mr <UNK> throwing salt in face br br post match <UNK> vs hulk hogan pure crap right here hogan comes down to the ring for no apparent reason and mr <UNK> challenges him to a match after <UNK> just won the title even the die hard <UNK> find this to be total <UNK>
<START> bottom of the barrel stinker is so bad it's beyond funny the plot is about an american <UNK> played by <UNK> brown in the film he's called a military <UNK> but it's not really clear if he's in the american military or not helping the army of a latin american country fight <UNK> who winds up joining the <UNK> when the government turns on him <UNK> and <UNK> him shannon <UNK> is a sports equipment <UNK> he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue that description actually makes the movie sound better than it is because it's really a stinker of almost biblical proportions how bad is it well shannon <UNK> turns in the movie's most professional acting job if that isn't an indication of just what a <UNK> rate piece of junk this turkey is nothing is from <UNK> sound effects to a music score that sounds like it's from a 1940s z grade horror flick and may very well be to the same footage i e <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> going down the same jungle trail <UNK> constantly to some of the most <UNK> staged action scenes in recent memory this laugh a minute has to be seen to be <UNK> looks bored brown looks hung over and by the time this thing is finished if you can last that long i couldn't you'll know just how they feel br br although there are a lot of explosions and <UNK> this can't be considered an action picture by any stretch of the imagination it's boring there's a scene in the back of a truck where everybody just stares at each other for three or four minutes repetitive the same rebels and soldiers being killed over and over illogical when a group of rebels is caught in an open field by a government helicopter <UNK> instead of breaking for cover they just stand there staring up at it inept soldiers and rebels falling dead when no <UNK> are heard a gun battle inside a house where <UNK> standing against walls are machine <UNK> but miraculously the walls escape <UNK> predictable when the <UNK> says to offer a reward for <UNK> capture because someone might turn him in you know exactly who that someone will be and it turns out to be exactly who you thought it was and just downright stupid pretty much everything else in the picture inept brainless and stupid beyond belief don't waste your time
<START> the club scenes in this film are extremely believable tim <UNK> is in his most <UNK> mode and there are enough drugs and violence here for two movies maybe even three what more do you require from an <UNK> entertainment <UNK> up the volume
<START> the entire <UNK> world by now knows that this is where <UNK> <UNK> says his immortal hold hands you <UNK> but <UNK> howard professor of music steals the show watch him <UNK> dee green as she the voices of spring watch <UNK> as he <UNK> by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string watch him as he gets by christine <UNK> watch him and you will laugh and learn moe is no <UNK> either watch him as he attempts to <UNK> a woman to sit on a bear trap larry as usual is the <UNK> master of reaction all in all one of the very best <UNK> shorts you won't find one weak moment
<START> this movie was pretentious <UNK> and just down right not funny the filming technique reminded me of mtv i am a fan of hartley but what was he thinking of so much more thought could have gone into this movie considering the subject matter this could have been a true <UNK> battle over good and evil but hartley it appears used the stand technique of <UNK> out the viewer
<START> this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime the acting atrocious the only bright spot seems to be judging the <UNK> <UNK> of the female after watching this movie it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy <UNK> or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours also a bottle of <UNK> would be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life the plot is nothing original the dialog excruciating and even the weapons seem sub par do yourself a favor and go to your local blockbuster and burn whatever copies they have of this horrid film
<START> excellent episode showed dean has not only good taste by picking cassie for his girlfriend but also shows he does have a heart and can love just one woman and he's not just some guy who loves and leaves em e episode applaud them on this one i only hope that some way they go back to the cassie relationship next season if there is a next season i would like to see her come back into their supernatural lives especially <UNK> also i like the fact the chose an african american woman to be the special lady in his life that got away somehow i hope they don't screw that up and end it as he <UNK> ended the girl who played cassie was truly a <UNK> and it was good to see the wb <UNK> out into what we all see in everyday life the <UNK> <UNK> that has become common and acceptable finally
<START> obviously made on the cheap to capitalize on the notorious <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> hunk of <UNK> <UNK> italian <UNK> junk really <UNK> on the <UNK> stuff with a commendable lack of taste and restraint the evil arrogant white family who own and operate a lavish slave plantation spend a majority of the screen time engaging in <UNK> <UNK> both each other and their various slaves director mario and screenwriter <UNK> this <UNK> filth with a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> sleaze we've got nasty rape <UNK> <UNK> one white lady makes wild love to a muscular black stud while he's tied to a cross <UNK> female nudity brutal vile <UNK> lots of lurid soft core sex and a severely twisted tragic surprise ending that mixes elements of incest murder and <UNK> in a questionable attempt at making a statement about the horrid <UNK> of slavery special kudos are in order for <UNK> brunette actress <UNK> whose <UNK> and <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> and <UNK> wicked bitch <UNK> positively burns up the screen moreover <UNK> <UNK> funky <UNK> <UNK> score hits the <UNK> spot fairly polished cinematography likewise does the trick a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of slimy <UNK>
<START> ok so she doesn't have <UNK> id when you are being stalked you get it and no cell phone when you are being stalked you get one if you are one of the few full time working parents that is the head of the household that doesn't own one already this mom gets a big zero in the <UNK> department so her mom is in the hospital and she decides a shopping trip will help her out just a stupid movie glad i have <UNK> and a <UNK> button on the remote and what is with the 10 line minimum i just don't have that much to say about such a bad movie i guess i can ask why she keeps opening <UNK> that she has no clue who they are from the son really didn't add much to the movie either the cops were a big <UNK> zero too now get to the nearest <UNK> and get the darn cell phone
<START> a terrific fast paced screwball like comic strip drama farce set against <UNK> 1939 <UNK> played with wide eyed straight faced intensity by a talented cast and with action satire social commentary and authentic period details from slick <UNK> and <UNK> to a fleet of <UNK> a <UNK> soundtrack and brief but credible <UNK> of charles de and <UNK> br br it's simply some of the best entertainment recently shown on screen devoid of <UNK> and message if movies were trains and there is a creative recreation of a trip on a steam driven train that works despite there being no steam <UNK> an expensive prop no doubt this would be a
<START> i don't really know why so many persons love this movie maybe it's funny ok but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written as the author himself said this movie has betrayed the book not only the story is violently cut to about 1 3 but all the symbols all the complexity everything is lost in a very 80's fashioned fantasy adventure film for kids today we have effects directors a new attention to books i hope that someone tim burton peter jackson <UNK> miyazaki someday will direct the real <UNK> story a great dead writer a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it
<START> i think the bone <UNK> should go after anyone associated with this movie watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life the plot is boring and stupid there were no scenes that were horrifying even remotely if you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art all the way to the end you're either going to be highly disappointed or die laughing hysterically i bought this movie based on some other reviews i'd read i wish i had my money back what a if you're looking for a horror movie that will hold your interest watch u turn it may be based on a <UNK> plot but it's full of those creepy scenes that keep you jumping from beginning to end
<START> this movie is about a group of people who are infected by a powerful man made virus they are pursued by government men into the desert br br the premise of the film is quite interesting but is <UNK> by the fact that the delivery is extremely boring at no point does the film engage with the viewer on any level granted the <UNK> budget is a problem but is not the reason for the film's failure much more at fault is the very <UNK> faced delivery there is a great deal of narration but unfortunately the narrator has an annoyingly over dramatic voice very little seems to happen to these people and well before the end you will be rooting for the government men the sooner they kill the protagonists the sooner the movie will end a much better title for this film would have been four people run about in the desert with some stock footage of a helicopter overall very tedious
<START> the gun is probably the worst film i've ever saw the comedians direction is very poor the dialogs sounds like they were written by a 13 year old teenager the plot what plot is another suspense in which it is very hard to get into finally nothing in this movie is any good a big thumbs down to everyone involved and particularly to the <UNK> film festival who presented this movie in competition
<START> <UNK> in the closet takes the father teenage son genre to new levels of low this is a movie that serves no purpose the plot is <UNK> out in the first few minutes there is no suspense the characters are cliché and despite plot twists that try to confuse and everything plays out exactly as you think it will halfway through the movie i could no longer stand the <UNK> pace and started fast <UNK> the movie ended exactly as i expected linda hamilton is great as always and the other actors are above average considering there seems to be a complete lack of direction if you really believe you need to see this uninspired lackluster wannabe <UNK> watch it on fast forward
<START> this film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs after a tense chase he is saved by said grandpa with magic whip br br we are then introduced to a string of annoying house mates including one <UNK> who is always half dressed during this stage the film <UNK> tension with strange <UNK> <UNK> background noises that had me on the edge of my seat br br i stopped paying attention for a while but when i looked back on the screen there where weird creature type things going around <UNK> and killing one word of advice if you are ever trapped in your home by some <UNK> get some cardboard boxes and a <UNK> br br although we did skip half the film because it was totally non interesting or memorable we are now at the stunning conclusion the last surviving creature thing fights a whip duel with grandpa and his magic whip i wont say what happens here but i can say the whip battle is full of tension with <UNK> fights split level fights and all manner of drama br br i am now going to <UNK> this film through the door of a <UNK> i don't like
<START> first off i just watched a movie on showtime called survival island it says it was a 2006 movie with billy zane and since i like him and couldn't sleep i thought i would check it out looked interesting watched it and decided to look up on the imdb who was this new face juan <UNK> <UNK> pace and <UNK> i could not believe it this movie has been <UNK> three and will be a new movie it is playing again in 1 <UNK> and 30 mins on showtime channel again and this date is may 28 and or florida time you can check your showtime <UNK> by title and see it i wont get into details so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water taking it all off you see her naked body when she runs back out of the water you see her <UNK> on funny there are a lot of other mess ups too i can't believe by coincidence i decided to look up this movie go figure wonder if the people <UNK> it sold it to some movie studio to put out but it is already playing on showtime ha ha good laugh i give it 1 1 2 stars c d movie
<START> errol flynn at his best as robin hood of the west fighting military red tape <UNK> indians and business crooks to his great and final heroic end not to forget the ever reliable o de <UNK> as lady mary of the west never try to link this story to the facts and the real persons it doesn't work out just enjoy it because nobody ever claimed to make documentaries when <UNK> walsh and errol flynn co worked
<START> when i first viewed the trailer i have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection but after hearing about it i decided to buy it when i bought the entire collection in a box set it was absolutely what i wanted to see it was very funny and the characters were pretty cool favorite characters in the show are marion <UNK> the <UNK> knights big <UNK> and i also liked the opening and ending theme songs the show also has some great voice talents from <UNK> grant jason douglas and others but however this show is one of the greatest so if you want to see something cool then this show is the one
<START> i'd give this film a 1 10 this film is devoid of common cinematic substance and concentrates way too much upon the current skin trend in bollywood movies i'd definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie what really makes me feel <UNK> is how could such an impressive <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> films ever <UNK> to such an awful production they have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than adult audience too which when exposed to these sort of gross movies may wreck their growing mind set and <UNK> to things devoid of sense and recognition br br on the whole films must not only be entertaining but also must <UNK> of some sense as well certainly this film is an immense disappointment to <UNK> <UNK> fans especially me myself i am really disappointed over the plot acting and everything else why can't people put in some substance that can be <UNK> after confronted with in the films at least for once throughout the film the point is clear i'd like to put my opinion in short horrible disappointment lot of adult material lack of sensible substance lack of normal psyche worthless could grab a or a <UNK> chocolate instead
<START> woody allen who i have to confess at the outset i have never been a big fan of directed this quasi documentary about the life of <UNK> ray sean penn a 1930's jazz <UNK> whose star apparently <UNK> for a while then quickly faded penn does a credible job in the role portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man not unlike allen himself which perhaps explains why woody would be attracted to this project who can't maintain relationships and whose twin passions aside from guitar playing were shooting rats at the dump and watching trains br br there isn't a great deal of <UNK> to the story it's narrated in a sense by a series of modern day jazz experts one of whom is allen himself who relate their various theories and interpretations of different events in <UNK> life the end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators who probably should have done a better job with it br br jazz fans and fans of woody allen will probably enjoy this as for me the best i can give it is a 3 10
<START> rabbit <UNK> is one of three cartoons that feature bugs bunny <UNK> duck elmer <UNK> in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season love bugs and <UNK> stirring up <UNK> trouble with <UNK> always the victim of <UNK> shotgun resulting with his <UNK> always getting <UNK> then there's the cross dressing that always gets elmer in his love struck mode chuck jones and michael <UNK> are always favorites of mine in the writer director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons i've laughed at since i was a kid and at least two of them end with <UNK> to bugs you're despicable can't get better that that
<START> a wealthy young man raised as a son of the gods must confront his chinese <UNK> while living in a white world br br although the premise upon which this film is based is almost certainly a <UNK> <UNK> and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie's conclusion makes all which has <UNK> it <UNK> ludicrous the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good acting br br richard has the title role as the sweet natured oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he looks <UNK> keeps the tone of his performance serious throughout <UNK> <UNK> into the middle distance a <UNK> he developed during silent days whenever his character is <UNK> <UNK> he makes no attempt to <UNK> his classic performance in d w <UNK> broken <UNK> <UNK> and this is to his credit beautiful <UNK> bennett is the <UNK> daughter who makes miserable she is gorgeous as always but her behavior does not <UNK> her to the viewer and her terrible illness in the final reel is kept mercifully off screen br br multi talented frank <UNK> has a small role as buddy <UNK> e <UNK> warren and <UNK> <UNK> play the leading <UNK> very different fathers while claude king <UNK> his brief appearance as the english author who befriends br br movie <UNK> will recognize little <UNK> moore uncredited playing as a tiny child br br the original technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded with time to a <UNK> the shot <UNK> to be the south of france instead looks <UNK> like <UNK> on santa <UNK> island off the coast of southern california
<START> i was plagued by nightmares involving <UNK> street and the muppet show during my childhood i loved the programs but when i slept i'd dream about muppets not unlike the ones on tv but not quite the ones on tv br br they would speak <UNK> and laugh and sing while eating each other and killing each other they'd take a bite of their cute felt flesh and it would tear apart followed by <UNK> bleeding nice but that was the past i love this show i saw peter jackson's meet the <UNK> years ago and wondered why there <UNK> t similar work out there well here it is as sick twisted and somehow socially potent the old vision br br if you like this show and you haven't seen meet the <UNK> get it on amazon or some such film source you're in for a treat br br by the way clarence would totally kick dog ass
<START> lol br br the mere fact that i start off my review with says it all i used to watch this movie all the time as a kid and even then i <UNK> the silliness of it all the low budget horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then i watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing it's so bad it's actually good lol like another reviewer said it doesn't take itself seriously there's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so the soundtrack is so funny i laugh every time i hear it the is just a laugh riot it's an all out war zone in new york full of explosions and total chaos so ridiculous you can't help but chuckle at the sight of it br br other hilarious moments br br the scene with and the cop running side by side like 2 <UNK> against the whole wild west was so cheesy it was funny br br it killed me how the bad guys could be shooting at and he could even drop down on one <UNK> taking ever so careful and slow aim and not get hit <UNK> of course with him it was one shot one kill with his elephant <UNK> lol br br another hilarious scene was the end when he finally killed the leader of the gang with a rocket <UNK> lol destroying the whole side of the apartment building with it br br it's apparent that is all but used to losing loved ones when his new girlfriend is quickly <UNK> of after only a few dates the acting is so bad that you can't blame anyone that could only think that is mad at the destruction of the car lol he runs down looks at the carnage and just walks away br br again so bad it's good br br out of stars
<START> i've recently seen an not because it was a hong kong film but because i was looking for a change from the films being produced here in the us in my humble opinion i believe the film could easily compete against the action thrillers being produced here except for the traditional of hong kong film the one that still bothers me was the chief inspector character i still don't understand why there has to be a complete idiot comic relief type character even in the serious films that come out of hong kong but i can live with it when the movie is this good the characters are believable even if the situations they are in are not the story is fast paced and really sucks you in to it the real scenes for me were the two bus rides that the thief character takes overall a really solid film
<START> it is <UNK> to me how anyone could have enjoyed or laughed at this movie i'd say it's the worst movie i've seen in years and i see a lot of them maybe i've forgotten junior high it's also very hard to believe that this is the same jeff daniels to did such a brilliant performance of george washington in the crossing seems like ever since he did dumber he's gone into the tank can you believe he even wrote and directed this junk
<START> my name is earl 2005 br br review for i have seen this br br this is something else first off how is this rated so high i cannot understand that this show is filled to the top with either annoying people stupid people or just plain unlikeable the gags are hideous br br i saw one episode where the wife of <UNK> brother wrapped and washed herself with dead fish not kidding that wasn't funny that's repulsive then she and <UNK> extremely stupid brother and i mean stupid then had sex i nearly threw up br br this has to be one of the most desperate attempts at comedy in a long time jason lee is a talented actor but is trapped in a helpless role in this horrible comedy br br earl is now in jail for this current season let's hope he gets the chair just so this show gets put out of it's misery br br the last word this show would be funny to people who think larry the cable guy is funny to the rest of the world not a chance avoid like the plague
<START> well it's about time van damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that's his best film in recent years the plot isn't too inventive but the whole border <UNK> theme is interesting and the ex marines as drug <UNK> twist is cool but what makes this movie awesome is the fact that van damme is back to doing martial arts again his latest films have been more acting oriented but in the shepard is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape there are some impressive fight scenes and van damme shows he can still pull out the old famous <UNK> spinning <UNK> kick for being a low budget action movie it does have good sets and great stunts van damme says some humorous lines and shows that he's <UNK> as an actor i'm glad he's back to dealing out some van damage i've been let down by the lack of fighting in his recent films scott <UNK> is great in his role and van damme and him have a 1 on 1 showdown at the end overall it's one of van <UNK> better films and it will keep you entertained a must rent for fans i'm just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK>
<START> french cinema sucks down with all these visions with their my god am i <UNK> distinguished attitudes <UNK> to <UNK> symbolic film language and <UNK> i'll no longer have a mind for that <UNK> did you ever think about that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid maybe i'm too common to understand you or had it been your task to confirm all the clichés of a frenchman the world can have <UNK> the to be comes to his home palace <UNK> <UNK> not in the picture plays the <UNK> here am i darling in this moment i knew that she's in the <UNK> and we ll see her lying in there soon don't <UNK> me i'm not <UNK> and the sex scene was the climax of the film but this is in berlin we say what means something like a self satisfied and the worst seen that often in french movies i can tell other example she beautiful and willing is looking at herself in a mirror <UNK> her hair and her wild <UNK> dirty young guru into the room breathless shouting there's no escape there's no escape forty years after and what's new what's exciting about my god there's that woman and she loves and <UNK> you what would be more natural to be happy with your life and when you're not please explain much better why born french means you have to live a life in <UNK> no escape is that the point
<START> the supposed writer and director mr <UNK> has copied almost the whole plot of the blockbuster hollywood movie <UNK> starring will smith many scenes are also exactly the same the plot was just copy <UNK> and some low grade humor probably mr <UNK> own creation and frequent dancing was added to increase the movie time to local standards br br although salman khan and <UNK> acting did give us some smiles however it does not suit legendary artists like them to be a part of <UNK> specially when they themselves keep telling people to stop buying <UNK> <UNK>
<START> what bird is that a <UNK> <UNK> the only thing remotely funny about this movie is michael hair which has more depth and character than the man underneath it br br the <UNK> settings are as dry and as <UNK> as the dialogue <UNK> to raymond chandler and <UNK> bogart and crime fiction etc seem <UNK> and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or the reason this film has no and near forgotten is it's so vacuous an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers this film is what the title suggests
<START> this is classic 80's humor if you were a teen in the 80's this was a summer hit to go see it was a early look at those now super stars this and better off dead just are fun and silly movies to sit back and enjoy everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were a teenager even crazy family and friends like these characters to be introduced to some of these characters was so much fun the uncle who is crazy sitting every waking moment at a radio waiting to win a million dollars the grandmother who only likes the <UNK> and handed a bill to the kids after dinner the twin brothers who look nothing alike and to meet was so much fun this may not of won an award but it is just a fun movie to get lost in one afternoon
<START> seeing that this movie was on the imdb bottom 20 i simply had to rent it br br <UNK> <UNK> i have no regret of seeing this movie at all in fact i really enjoyed it there's a level of camp in this movie that puts cult classics of the 80's to shame is it stupid yes but jim <UNK> proves that stupid is not necessarily bad after all br br rent it for a laugh that seems <UNK> but is actually meant to be funny <UNK> is a genius hope he directs the next ninja <UNK> movie
<START> the film <UNK> gate was a good view although still tedious at over 4 hours but the film took great license as usual with hollywood james chris <UNK> and <UNK> were actually married in real life their main contribution to the johnson county war was to start it by being <UNK> well by starting it i mean it came at the beginning not the end here's the real scenario james and ellen watson were secretly married because one <UNK> could be given to each family by <UNK> as single individuals they could get two <UNK> they chose on crazy woman creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the association he offered to buy them out repeatedly which they refused br br although <UNK> in real life as the owner of a <UNK> cattle kate and a prostitute herself and also in the film there is no real evidence that was true it is known that she bought many head of sick cattle <UNK> them back to life and was later accused by the association of receiving the cattle in trade for <UNK> in the end she was accused of <UNK> an act almost certainly untrue so much for this part of the myth of the american west which is a de <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> a time period of about one hundred years br br in real life she and jim were surprised one day by several members of the association taken in hand and promptly <UNK> those <UNK> the injustice were never brought to trial but that was the first link that led to the murder of <UNK> champion and the start of the johnson county war br br quite different from the hollywood version which shows her shot at the end br br other than that i think the main problem with the film was the editor who could have made the action a faster pace by more <UNK> editing
<START> some spoilers it took some 19 years for bruce campbell to finally put his masterpiece man with the screaming brain on the screen but campbell had to alter his story by having it due to financial problems take place in <UNK> <UNK> not where he initially wanted it to be filmed in los angeles california br br in the film campbell plays us <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cole who travels together with his spoiled rotten wife jackie <UNK> byron to the former communist republic of <UNK> it's there that william wants to help <UNK> almost non existent mass <UNK> system br br it's poor <UNK> misfortune to get involved with both gypsy woman <UNK> and her ex boyfriend an ex <UNK> taxi driver the two william will <UNK> end up their brains inside <UNK> skull because of jealousy and <UNK> br br after murders both william and their bodies are delivered to mad scientist dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by his loyal assistant ted <UNK> to have their brains <UNK> with dr has this theory in that two heads are better then one and now with the material william available to him dr at last is finally going to prove it what dr is going to sadly find out is that by <UNK> the two heads or brains together their brain waves will <UNK> and cause them to not only <UNK> but turn against each other br br william with right <UNK> <UNK> into his damaged brain is out to find and make her pay for the damage she caused both him and for his part is stuck in <UNK> head who's likes and <UNK> in both food and drink are totally opposite to his own this causes a lot of tension and <UNK> between the two brains in them fighting for control of <UNK> body br br things get even more screwed up when jackie finding out that murdered her husband william confront her in the dangerous and high crime section of call gypsy town and ends up being murdered herself brought back to dr by his assistant it's determined with no body available to plant <UNK> brain inside of an experimental robot that been working on the operation is a rousing success but the only <UNK> is that jackie with her brain inside the robot has to have her brain every few hours or like a real brain lacking <UNK> she'll die together with the <UNK> <UNK> br br combination 1930's like screw ball comedy and horror flick with both william turning the <UNK> town of upside down in trying to find and make her pay with her life for the sad state of existence she put them both into br br spoiler alert it's dr who in fact saves the day by discovering how to keep the two brains from fighting and thus <UNK> with each other this is done by him instead of <UNK> the brains together dr keep them independent by <UNK> a cell wall in between the two <UNK> of gray matter
