<START> i kind of like <UNK> it do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it for an <UNK> a non american the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much br br i <UNK> like that and <UNK> goes from being lawyers as they were in the early parts of the tv show to become super <UNK> that stops wars and <UNK> entire <UNK> its almost like watching a <UNK> video from the us army br br i still watch the show so it´s not that bad but i would prefer more episodes when and <UNK> <UNK> military <UNK> and <UNK> save the world in the future
<START> i saw the mst3k version of this film and it is a bad movie but its not nearly as bad as its low imdb rating currently 1 8 out of 10 at least the movie has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the primary problem with this movie is that it had no appealing characters whatsoever the main character <UNK> is so <UNK> <UNK> that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him and he isn't very smart either or he would have figured out to stay away from the conniving girl betty and even more pathetic than <UNK> is his father who is nothing but a drunken loser the highlight of the film is the heist sequence at the end but even that is so <UNK> executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at least this movie made for a very funny mst3k episode as mike and the do a great job making fun of it
<START> 1969 was the year new york city was the place was the second robert downey film to achieve some recognition the first was <UNK> 1966 achieved a much wider release pound 1970 and palace 1972 were even more <UNK> and obnoxious those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually <UNK> the <UNK> feature film career for several years br br the subject at hand is and it is a mad farce satire that has to be seen to be believed i'm not going to go through the plot here what plot people looking for a plot are going to be scratching their heads keep scratching this film is not about plot one could compare this to a mel brooks movie only without the hollywood parody party that mel always threw i also see a little bit of monty python in this by the way this film was shot before monty had <UNK> on the bbc br br i notice that the gags and lines that are drop dead hilarious do not transfer well by word of mouth you have to see them within the context of the film there are some flaws in the film but even the flaws are unique for instance actors often repeat the same line over and over again and somehow it works how many <UNK> mario says the six girl has got to have soul etc br br the b w photography is outstanding the sound score is even better the editing is only so so the acting is above average the script is priceless the jokes are as un pc as you can get mr bad news says sonny williams just got caught in a motel with a 13 year old girl says well at least he's not <UNK> uptight <UNK> beware the anti establishment mindset of this film will drive you straight out of the room nothing is sacred br br there are many things in this film that <UNK> to today no smoking reverse racism with african americans treating <UNK> like trash the manipulation of mass media over the masses madison <UNK> hollywood intentionally <UNK> something that any 8 year old can tell is pure garbage the internet i'm talking about the drum <UNK> dating i could go on and on br br i should also mention that there is about 8 min of this film that was shot in 16 <UNK> color these are the commercials shot by agency the spots work fairly well the first time around they get tiresome though on repeated viewings the real magic here is within the b w sections of the film it's the non lines they stay with you rent yourself a <UNK> i love you i love you i love you did you take your <UNK> anything that i have to say would just be redundant and a host of others i also really like the bit with the <UNK> up on the wall the game warden wanted me to throw it back i put up such a fight i decided to have it <UNK> br br <UNK> in the cast include buddy as bodyguard 1 he should have been a much bigger star antonio <UNK> as the arab he did go on to stardom on tv and in films arnold johnson has the right look as robert downey used his own voice instead because arnold couldn't remember some of his lines also downey realized that he could fill in any additional dialog jokes later on if he dubbed his lead actor br br the film does have some shortcomings the short run time is one i wish the beginning with the white board members would have been extended stan and allen garfield are outstanding the ending <UNK> to have been thrown together as if he just couldn't think of any more gags all in all this is one of the best low budget independent films of it's time a time when very few played outside of new york chicago san francisco and l a anyone who loves satire and comedy should see this at least twice <UNK> is ahead of and beyond it's time
<START> this film stars peter lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who to america unfortunately shortly after his arrival he's in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned because he looks so awful no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation he <UNK> to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his <UNK> where exactly the film goes from there you'll just need to see for yourself br br i scored this movie an 8 because for the money spent to make it it's a heck of a good film with a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting the film could have <UNK> into a simple horror or crime film but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises in addition the excellent acting by lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles this is an excellent film and delivers more than most a pictures of the day
<START> this movie is a real low budget production yet i will not say anything more on that as it already has been covered i give this movie a low rating for the story alone but i met the director the night i saw the film and he gave me an additional reason to dislike the movie he asked me how i enjoyed it and i told him that it was not easy to like my main <UNK> was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters i was never convinced that they were close i also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented as children becoming friends was too late in the film br br he told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script that they were added because he felt like i did that the two main characters did not appear close he went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction as they were out of money i agree that they did not do much for the film br br another fact about the movie that i was not aware of is the actor who had the lead wrote the script based on his own personal experience this is usually a bad move as some writers do not take into consideration the emotional reaction the viewer the story is so close to home that the writer make too many <UNK> as to the audience's reaction to his own tragedy and the story is tragic however it did not work for me as i never cared for any of the characters least of all the lead what was presented were two evil people out to make a buck by any means regardless who gets hurt when ms <UNK> character decides to give up he evil ways it appears that she does so because she is <UNK> not because she knows she is doing wrong if the movie has a message then i suspect that only the writer is aware of it
<START> boring rank <UNK> plot some of the worst direction i've ever come across inane acting and horribly clichéd the movie ends with one of the main characters waking from a dream what's with that even jr from dallas couldn't survive that lame twist br br you have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship developing between a main character and a young girl which is ostensibly meant to be <UNK> but which comes off as perverse you have <UNK> community college movie school special effects with <UNK> the size of the <UNK> hole this is like children of the corn meets passion of the christ <UNK> on an endless loop of government administration training video by the end of it if you aren't <UNK> ending it you have no brain br br don't bother
<START> this is a tv movie based on the murder of martha in <UNK> in the mid 1970's based how much on truth it's hard to tell this much is certain it is based on the book written by mark anyway the movie depicts the crime in flashbacks and its aftermath including the arrest of a suspect some 25 years after who was never considered a suspect at the time in the movie of course is largely responsible for the arrest and closure of the case for <UNK> surviving family in particular her mother the narrative of the film is by the ghost of martha talking in the first person this is a very effective device in this movie to me it adds more impact to the movie and puts a human face on the murder victim if only an actress playing the part maggie grace plays martha and i was really impressed with her there is no way for certain to know mark motive in investigating the crime it could have been out of a sense of justice and maybe he really cared or maybe he just saw dollar signs from a future <UNK> book either way it makes for an interesting movie it's well acted and fairly fast paced i don't think there was a lot of extra unnecessary stuff in the movie just what was needed to tell the story one could argue that they left out things that would have shed a bit more light on the proceedings and one would be right also one may argue that the ending was abrupt and again one would be right but as i said for me i think they told the story with at least most of the <UNK> anything else would have likely required a miniseries as an aside there is a miniseries entitled a season in <UNK> which came out 6 years 1996 which this movie has some parallels to even if only faint however if you like this movie then you may be interested in a season in <UNK> it is my belief that a season in <UNK> is in fact a <UNK> account of the same crime anyway for me murder in <UNK> is an 8 10
<START> man i had my doubts i love kathy bates but i thought how good can this be i had never even heard of this thing you know it was one of those things we gave it 20 minutes and we'll turn it off if it sucks and we were locked in from the get go this is a very <UNK> fun movie it's quirky you know i mean you've got a <UNK> singer a murderer and a believable one you have farce then kathy bates in all her acting <UNK> rupert everett finally acting to his real potential dan <UNK> and a dwarf that will make you laugh out loud i tell ya you'll laugh you'll cry br br maybe i had a weird week but i think this film is on the level of fried green tomatoes if you don't like that movie maybe you won't like this but i think it was a great movie i went out and bought the dvd
<START> four guys <UNK> go into the restaurant business with a fifth guy and lose all common sense they allow themselves to be abused worse than <UNK> workers at the turn of the century without simply leaving the situation this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen i just hope i can <UNK> this item to someone who might like it br br it is true that it holds your attention if you can let the illogical plot developments not bother you too much it is very silly throughout however especially once a stranger enters the restaurant who is he guess br br
<START> the last person who dies before new years is cursed to drive the phantom <UNK> for a whole year picking up the souls of the dead br br i saw a scene from this old silent swedish horror film on youtube and decided to track down the whole movie it was well worth the work finding it because it's an absolutely amazing movie for the time it was made it has a wonderfully eerie atmosphere the old time horror film makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere sadly many of today's film makers don't seem to understand how important setting and atmosphere are and go for the cheap jump scares the visual effects are excellent considering its date of production if you can find a copy of this i highly recommend giving it a watch 9 10
<START> even though it doesn't really matter to the film this is a creation myth god a <UNK> bloody figure in a chair cuts his organs out with a straight razor and dies in his own filth mother earth rises from his corpse and <UNK> herself with his seed giving birth to man it is however highly unlikely for you to figure any of this out without reading a synopsis first and it's not especially important to the film that you do as it's more a <UNK> art house imagery thing all in <UNK> black and white a sick bleak atmosphere is created with the stark photography and minimal sounds mostly water dripping <UNK> <UNK> etc but each scene goes on a bit too long and so does the film as a whole this could've been great as a short film and the god killing himself scene was excellent and extremely creepy especially being the first thing you see but it's hard to be patient when it goes on for so long and you don't even know what you're seeing for much of the time br br still a good film for the original style images atmosphere and content
<START> <UNK> when i heard this movie was a national <UNK> i thought it was going to be awesome but i really got a say it was a rather disappointment i have seen the most movies they've made from christmas vacation to van wilder and this movie is the worst movie in their name really bad actors and a to much intense movie this movie is probably good to watch if you are watching it with a crowd of worked up people and the ability to laugh at it but if you are into good <UNK> like i am i do not suggest this movie i would much rather watch van wilder a second or third time than to watch this movie you have been warned
<START> the film is somewhat entertaining but the greatest feature is <UNK> <UNK> laughable performance it has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully harlow has gone through more training perhaps she should stick to the more <UNK> somewhat characters that she has generated in other performances
<START> i kind of had somewhat high expectations for this movie i've always thought that tom lesser known movies ie runaway and coma where well above the ones he had more press for maybe the producers should have had a little more knowledge about former major league baseball players who became stars overseas the majority were players too good for triple a baseball but not exactly major league i admire the idea of putting character in versus the cliché of having play in the <UNK> sad to say this movie much like the title of the post is stranded at third by a movie that seems to be running on <UNK> i wouldn't mind seeing a sequel and hopefully the producers would learn from the mistakes the premise is just way too unique to be left alone with this uneven flick
<START> i really liked this movie one thing i have noticed is that korean tv <UNK> are way better as far as giving you the whole story i watch movies when i do not have the time or feel like going through 16 30 episodes movies are seem to be rushed and if you do not watch carefully you may miss something br br i do feel this one was rushed and i had to <UNK> a few parts to try and find what i missed especially towards at the end if you like nice love stories i still think this is cute and if <UNK> have the extra time i still think this is worth watching br br it is always nice to go back follow the actors in different movies as we do not get to follow them from when they begin as we do the actors producers and directors in our own countries
<START> the film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex <UNK> but nothing more the agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling so the women are kidnapped and sent to ex <UNK> territory to work as sex slaves because take a deep breath the american military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security <UNK> are selling people abroad you don't need half a brain to see the relevance to iraq war and black water company br br what a load of <UNK> looks like i have been fooled all my life into thinking that this problem and many others were a direct result of grip on this region for 45 years but no it was the american war on iraq which is also responsible for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> i had last week br br the film ignores the fact that 95 of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the western block you also see scenes that are so stupid you want to pull your hair we have someone chasing down a woman in the streets of london in broad daylight beat her up then somehow drags her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her no one sees this or calls the police and the running woman does not care to scream during the chase even better we later see 4 5 women <UNK> up in the centre of london in again broad daylight to be sold one of them has a <UNK> face and people are shopping in the background as if nothing was happening you can't make this stupidity up br br i used to think that such trash was <UNK> to hollywood but apparently i was mistaken
<START> the great war breaks out and daddy is a brave pilot who goes off to carry out some <UNK> business to put jerry in his place mummy is doing her bit as a nurse so the five children are <UNK> to their <UNK> uncle in the country where a secret <UNK> takes them to a mischievous sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure br br based on a book written the best part of a century ago they don't make stories like this anymore and there's a reason the men fly planes and author books the women change <UNK> and clean house the boys lead the way with their <UNK> and <UNK> the girls do what they are told and play <UNK> badly fat kids who wear <UNK> are nasty all the kids speak in those <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> accents that are <UNK> and <UNK> but which a certain economic class of english people <UNK> on top of the <UNK> and yearning for <UNK> there are plot holes a five year old would not tolerate i mean that literally my son was asking why the father disappeared before sunset why the <UNK> didn't just drop from his hand as he disappeared the film at least tries to aim strictly for the kids until a completely inappropriate and unfunny monologue by eddie izzard what a waste of genuine comic talent plays over the final credits br br no doubt the five percent of british <UNK> who go to expensive public schools in the uk will find it all such a jolly for the other 95 percent of british families who no longer live in the 19th century the good news is wall e <UNK> and wallace and <UNK> are all out on dvd
<START> before i speak my piece i would like to make a few things clear 1 i am a chick who's not into chick flicks kate leopold and someone like you are extreme exceptions hugh <UNK> ass 2 i only picked this one up because i am a <UNK> <UNK> who looked forward to see him in a <UNK> 3 i am not a <UNK> fan though i think her performances in immortal and a few good men were sublime and have earned places in my <UNK> library also i think she's a little crazy no way is she not still sleeping w br br if this is a character study of an <UNK> woman living <UNK> lives of independence and happiness then i'd say we have one <UNK> melodrama marty literary agent makes 6 figure <UNK> lives in an <UNK> manhattan <UNK> easy for her to read several hundred <UNK> and fall asleep at her desk for some highly suggested <UNK> <UNK> or perhaps stepping through an <UNK> she has the career the looks a cool car a great pad now where are the man and kids in steps our boy aaron some real <UNK> what are <UNK> they're artists who can do <UNK> <UNK> that make real money aaron gives marty the dream of security and fills a void where she obviously has no self confidence br br on the other side of the <UNK> there's marie still living out her <UNK> fantasies while she <UNK> through <UNK> her children are her career and life but what about marie does she only exist through her children in <UNK> william a <UNK> stranger who helps her focus on the one thing she has lost touch with herself br br a supposed journey of self discovery and late a coming of age thrown in some with angst and some <UNK> to marty <UNK> own mother this gets a 3 10 all i could say is thank god for the <UNK> division i wouldn't waste my 2 99 at blockbuster on this put it toward a <UNK> <UNK> title
<START> this is a movie about a black man buying a <UNK> company and turning the company into a african <UNK> over the top <UNK> they even portray the owner as not only being in control of the <UNK> but also controlling part of the air <UNK> at the airport one day this guy wins 100 million dollars a the next time you see him he is walking all over the airport acting like the owner of the airport everyone calls this movie a parody but nothing about this movie shouts parody this movie is a flop and will forever be in the 4 95 bin at wal mart br br i can't even come to terms to why mgm would waste 16 million dollars on this movie this movie doesn't even warrant straight to video status the writers one black and one white should be <UNK> from hollywood forever not only do they over stereotype blacks they portray them as ignorant human beings i would be ashamed of going to a movie that constantly <UNK> me don't waste your time at the video store wal mart pay per view or on a sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on <UNK>
<START> when i was engaged my <UNK> and i would frequent the adult <UNK> he would look for his favorite <UNK> and on occasion a video that caught the eye as much as i enjoyed the one on one with him that the media caused there was never a video that i really enjoyed i had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called <UNK> it dealt with a private eye <UNK> a case that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable all the others were <UNK> and <UNK> and blowing and <UNK> there's only so many times you can watch a blonde bimbo <UNK> <UNK> br br this movie caught my eye and i <UNK> to it allowing him to wander the shop he noticed how hard was it not too <UNK> i was actually interested in something lol in the video section and came over buying the slightly used copy for me we took it home and i loved it here was a porno with a plot i wasn't sure it even classified as porno but i use the word loosely br br the <UNK> was a character i could identify with alice rejected her <UNK> advances she was not comfortable with her own sexuality and <UNK> in her comments bill went away and she continued to check in books the white rabbit ran through the library one book if you notice closely i believe it's been ten years since i saw the movie was by lewis c and alice for that same reason that <UNK> teenagers to run into the woods when a chainsaw wielding maniac is behind them rather than towards populated areas follows it's the best way to get the plot forward alice finds herself in wonderland br br i barely recall all the details but i do remember clearly the swim in the lake and how she was <UNK> off i liked how they got <UNK> <UNK> up again the mad <UNK> size of member being on his hat to wear it proudly and the brother sister team of <UNK> and dee which did <UNK> me slightly then again they could have been husband wife but i never could tell no matter how many times i watched it the woman on the knight who told alice go away and find your own knight what's a a nice girl like you doing on a knight like this br br the part that really caught my attention when i watched it about a year or so later was one of the cards 3 of hearts i think who <UNK> my <UNK> current wife exactly we couldn't help but <UNK> her about being in the movie the king of hearts was interesting and the queen was even more so due to the <UNK> of the forum i can't go into details just say it was orgy based and we'll leave it at that br br when we split up i was allowed to take the video he knew i liked it but in the time since it's been lost in <UNK> someday i'll find another copy br br btw if anyone could tell me what scene was cut from the amazon version i'd really appreciate it br br i <UNK> recommend this movie for the over 18 crowd it was soft sweet and really 70's but i liked it immensely br br out of 5 d
<START> low budget films like this just give me hope as an aspiring screenwriter in other words if there are people out there who are willing to <UNK> a piece of schlock like this than there's certainly much more than a <UNK> of hope for someone like myself who can actually write stories this film is right up there or should i say down there with the ed <UNK> of the world the story if you can call it that and the dialog not to mention the <UNK> acting is a travesty toward the genre itself someone should have driven a stake through this stinker while it was still just on paper it follows that since literature has pretty much been killed off that film should follow in order to have a good or even just passable movie you must have at the very least decent writing the legendary <UNK> <UNK> springs to mind they used a lot of his stories for low budget films way back when but they still come off today as good serious entertainment i e brain the cast for this work should seriously consider going back to work at their respective <UNK> <UNK> or shoe stores and forget about any future feeble attempts at appearing in front of a camera avoid this one like the plague itself
<START> i'm a big horror film buff particularly of the 1980's name one  i've probably seen it last year a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under mainstream radar called saw was about to hit theaters i was moderately excited having not heard anything about it i thought it looked quite promising judging by the previews and posters well except the back and white ones with the severed hands and feet those just looked terrible i saw the film on opening night it was one of the worst experiences of my life this movie was literally mentally and <UNK> painful to watch because it was scary no because it was one of the most awful movies i had ever had the <UNK> of seeing first off the construction of the screenplay and editing was utterly atrocious even by horror movie standards starting off a sequence in an <UNK> room with a victim smith who recently survived a serial killer's attack then showing a flashback of what she survived not scary it was impossible to feel any type of tension whatsoever knowing that the aforementioned victim was perfectly alright sure that reverse bear trap thing was creepy but why should i feel in the least bit frightened when clearly you just showed me she survived the ordeal unfortunately the entire film was constructed this way it starts with two guys in a <UNK> then they show flashbacks of how they were <UNK> not scary why because we already know what's gonna happen to them seeing as how we just saw the result of the attack they're fine move on with the story even more unfortunately the actual story was <UNK> at best i couldn't have cared less for these annoying pitiful excuses for characters and the acting didn't help cary <UNK> was solid for the most part and then suddenly towards the end he started crying like a lost <UNK> while <UNK> to keep his american accent in <UNK> it didn't work  the audience i saw this with was in <UNK> this drove him to a <UNK> and idiotic decision even the most simple minded wouldn't attempt he had other <UNK> better ones smarter ones even given his intense emotional state horribly <UNK> through horrible acting it was still irrational i didn't buy it bad writing alert furthermore even when certain sequences were played straight through and flashback free they were painfully predictable i constantly found my foot <UNK> <UNK> waiting for the dumb sequence to end this happened for the entire film i saw every single twist coming twenty minutes into the film i had already called the killer's identity not to mention his connection to his <UNK> s as soon as they appeared on screen better acting <UNK> been able to <UNK> the awful script instead the actors might as well have had red <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> across their <UNK> br br by the end of the movie i was utterly <UNK> i had wasted even a <UNK> of my life on this film and the entire theatre was laughing hysterically at the downright horrendous finale seriously you'd think they were watching a monty python movie i would've been laughing too had i not been so <UNK> at the film's total and utter failure to accomplish anything it set out to do when we left there was no joke a line to speak to the manager of the theatre to get their money back didn't happen i was absolutely positive the movie was going to be a box office bomb the following week you couldn't have imagined my shock to find out saw had hit number one at the box office and everyone was talking about it mostly individuals who found <UNK> dynamite to be a thought provoking epic tale and thought satire was some type of rubber i am so utterly <UNK> to hear people praise this film that i often feel as though i'm going to vomit it's entertainment for the most feeble and simple minded of the human race those who find some weird jigsaw clown puppet riding on a threatening it's a doll  knock it over and leave  what's so frightening about that br br don't get me wrong i own every friday the 13th love my splatter movies thought <UNK> dynamite was hilarious can't get enough of freddy michael <UNK> or <UNK> have a <UNK> appreciation for unknown horror gems and rank <UNK> camp ii unhappy <UNK> amongst my top 10 favorite slashers however i realize these films aren't the most sophisticated american cinema has to offer  i appreciate them for what they are  quick easy fun saw is cinematic garbage the film attempts to be a smart and semi sophisticated nasty little thrill ride and <UNK> down to an irritating annoying waste of time money energy and celluloid atrocious on all accounts every single copy should be <UNK> along with its feeble minded fans shame on all of you br br will i see saw ii maybe after i take a double shot of <UNK> before i <UNK> out my own eyes and <UNK> white hot <UNK> into my ears and <UNK> my rating 0 10 avoid at all costs
<START> all i ever heard while being raised was <UNK> of the <UNK> and here we have a film that not only <UNK> <UNK> but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better all the while watching i was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future and there wasn't i'll admit to not finishing the film i had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man adam that it was ok to be a whore and get and i quote more tail than any man in the past time i know not finishing it is a bad review on myself but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to a story that will keep a viewer interested and they failed this film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance instead it <UNK> what america ran by lesbian would be like and i'm not against lesbians thank you mr director someone please give me a redeeming quality wait i have it there's no sequel
<START> one of my favorite movies great cast lead by jonathan silverman and <UNK> <UNK> serious drama situations with brilliant comedic punches an exact mixture of character and story real people with real problems and everyone has a different relationship with each family member <UNK> moves from slightly sad to hilariously funny read the quotes this is the best adaptation of a neil simon play br br if you wanna see more of eugene check blues starring matthew <UNK> who played in both stage versions is ok a bit on a darker side get away from the made for tv broadway bound
<START> i'm originally from brazil the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy they told his life story and he never got one brazilian <UNK> of that movie <UNK> is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in brazil sad but that is the world we live in it's about making money not saving lives question is where is <UNK> today most probably dead we tend to want to live in this disney filled fantasy life when someone comes up to the plate to help along comes the higher power and says what do i get from this where's my cut i wish people's conscience would speak up
<START> just love the interplay between two great characters of stage screen <UNK> barrymore
<START> air bud 2 golden <UNK> is a very bad <UNK> in making a sequel in the course of a single year the first film was cute <UNK> and charming the idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched but he <UNK> pulled off enough stunts to save the concept even the human story had some explanation to it <UNK> father was killed in a plane crash so he is sad and the audience becomes emotionally involved as well br br now for the poorly made sequel it is terrible this is the worst kind of bad sequel the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones the kind that changes the main plot piece in one way this time the k 9 plays football instead of basketball no <UNK> how much time is spent in mind over matter benefit of a doubt walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making br br the sequel stars kevin <UNK> as josh who is in eight grade he lives with his mother and little sister in a seattle <UNK> in the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident which the audience can relate to most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one br br in this movie the emotional plot is a bit more complicated <UNK> mother is dating once again he and buddy his dog who can play basketball don't like this at all why if i were in his shoes i would love to have an extra parent in my life especially one this nice the man's name is patrick sullivan and <UNK> mother jackie met him became he is a local <UNK> for buddy br br the animal story is too simple josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team the <UNK> wolves the team itself looks like something from america's funniest home videos the can even catch a ball without <UNK> or <UNK> into each other so when bud shows up one day he proves he can play as a <UNK> for them and is no doubt the <UNK> best player br br <UNK> extremely cute in his football costume oh he is enough to melt the heart the dog is the best in this movie as well too bad there wasn't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team br br there is a very bad sub plot about russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals of course they try to catch buddy but their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a home alone scenario to them br br air bud 2 golden <UNK> is much more goofy than the first too the russian <UNK> add a bunch of slapstick that i have to admit made me laugh at the stupidity of it all there are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movie to see a dog play football br br the performances were also quite the embarrassment i liked gregory harrison and robert <UNK> but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a d kevin <UNK> and <UNK> stevenson were absolutely pathetic br br there were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football <UNK> but that isn't even worth mentioning will children enjoy this movie perhaps but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep they will most certainly complain that the dog didn't get enough screen time in and <UNK> over the fast changing script and protest against the boring performances and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the <UNK> al air bud as i did br br i suppose that they will think the dog is adorable
<START> sure this flick set in eastern europe is filled with sexy but it absolutely has nothing to do with the nicholas cage flick <UNK> an <UNK> daughter and her fiancée mix it up with a local woman in a <UNK> that ends up being taped the tape is used for blackmail and the stakes get higher and higher as the couple try to work it out themselves instead of going to authorities br br the sex comes and goes and would be the only reason for renting it i suppose if you like this sorta thing and is quite gratuitous towards the middle when we cruise along the porn scene looking for the other woman i definitely question how it got into blockbuster even with a youth <UNK> <UNK> considering how just a hint over the edge of soft core it is oh that's right it's the double standard actual art house flicks like the <UNK> and y <UNK> mama <UNK> get <UNK> r versions but straight to dvd crap like this get the <UNK> <UNK> proudly attached whatever br br the acting is horrible the plot is mind numbingly unoriginal but really the worst offense is the idea that this is a sequel to <UNK> i'd give the flick a d for a grade and be nice but considering they tried to trick me it gets the f it frankly deserves
<START> this is horrible even for a tv movie i can't believe it took three people to write this movie i am not familiar with the novel on which this film was based but it has got to be better than this i'd rather watch a full house marathon than this stupid movie i gave it 2 out of 10 stars only because it was made better by commercials
<START> plot spoilers dr george c scott is the chief of medicine at a major nyc hospital he's left his wife his children have <UNK> him he's <UNK> drinks a lot and <UNK> suicide also there's a killer <UNK> the hospital then he meets very strange barbara diana <UNK> and falls in love she wants him to run away with her but can he completely give up on his old life and start a new one br br very strange movie with an oscar winning script by <UNK> it presents a <UNK> main character and shows us a hospital full of <UNK> <UNK> and doctors that is run <UNK> it manages somehow to actually make this seem pretty funny it's not laugh out loud humor it's very black humor also the acting is right on target scott is just great and oscar nominated here you see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation <UNK> character is more than a little odd but her matter of fact manner works and she's also incredibly beautiful the script is strong and brutal but never too much i think it <UNK> the ball at the end with a situation that goes way too over the top but it's still worth seeing if this had been done totally seriously it probably would be impossible to take also look for <UNK> in a small bit and <UNK> <UNK> and christopher guest in uncredited bits i personally had trouble taking this seriously from what i've heard <UNK> were this bad back in the 1970s but not anymore see it for the acting and script i give it a 7
<START> this was a really nice surprise i was up late last night and couldn't fall asleep not really thinking twice i turned on my tv and hbo was on and this film was just beginning luckily i saw the whole thing and i am very happy i did because this film was very good the actors were well cast and they did a surprisingly good job kris kristofferson delivered a solid performance there was a lot of substance behind his lines this film made me realize he's a good actor brian keith was great as his father as was <UNK> wilson playing the colonel this was <UNK> <UNK> final role before his <UNK> death too bad he was a quality actor and seemed like a nice guy <UNK> williams also did a nice job as <UNK> american wife as far as the direction i had no idea franklin j <UNK> was the director until i read the review in leonard <UNK> movie guide this was the last film he ever made now i understand why this movie was so good <UNK> also directed <UNK> a truly great movie i haven't seen his other great film <UNK> while i was watching welcome home i said to myself this director really knows what he's doing not knowing that <UNK> had directed it there's one really beautiful scene in a <UNK> orphan <UNK> enough to bring tears to my eyes not only was this <UNK> directed but it was also directed in a very <UNK> and taut way there is nothing wasted in <UNK> effort the script was one reason this film is so good the writer doesn't <UNK> the actors down with too many lines it was written very simply but very effectively it just shows you that a lot can be said with few words this film also made me proud to be an american at the same time that it showed you how beautiful all people are
<START> you the living 2007 br br <UNK> i've never written that word before but it comes to mind here let me look it up well it's part of it <UNK> but also funny as heck so funny this is a <UNK> film for sure with so much dry dry dry wit and quirky humor it's impossible not to like it on some level filmed in a very spare style often with a static camera and really balanced stable compositions like theater stages we see a short <UNK> occur br br but that makes it seem ordinary which it is not ordinary life is shown to be <UNK> ironic delightful <UNK> and depressing and impossible we the living must live and since we're alive we may as well take note something like that i think it was ebert who said you find yourself laughing and don't know why exactly and the <UNK> material somewhere said it was a cross between bergman and monty python and what they mean is it has the dry silent <UNK> look of <UNK> famous swedish films but it has the zany somehow touching elements of the british comedians br br i'd say definitely definitely watch at least half an hour of this there is part of me that thought i was through by then the rest continues in a similar <UNK> of little skits and moments and they do gradually <UNK> but there is no great plot to follow or climax of the usual kind there are some great moments later even just the attention to the <UNK> which takes us out of the mundane human events nicely br br the filming is gorgeous in its classical control almost like a series of gregory scenes and <UNK> the photographer actually and the acting with all its very ordinary non <UNK> is right on a startling beautiful odd experience
<START> i have never seen so much talent and money used to produce anything so bad in my entire life as stated in other <UNK> a who's who of talent such as christopher plummer faye <UNK> donald sutherland and many more were thrown together in a film that is not recognizable as an agatha christie story i keep thinking of how it could be with the same cast done the right way br br the film has even less <UNK> than the christopher reeves <UNK> movies the large cast makes the slick production even less effective than in those films because there is not enough time to get to know anyone dave <UNK> jazz soundtrack had me wondering if the wrong video was in the the case from the rental store the music became more and more offensive as the plot progressed it's hard to say whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from earlier scenes was more offensive from someone who has seen most christie films that's what attracted me to this it was one of the few i hadn't seen miss this one it is not an agatha christie movie <UNK> <UNK> are better suited to producing flicks about big time wrestling rather than the <UNK> atmosphere of english mystery
<START> i cannot believe i never added my two cents about this film as yet br br this is one of the best films of all time many critics and movie goers alike talk of john carpenter's halloween for setting <UNK> and being his best work those folks have not seen this version of the thing because it is right up there with halloween br br john carpenter's work shines in this film he took a film that was already made and instead of re making the film he made the book the first film was based on brilliant br br the casting of each man was great the tension between them was real it made me scream made me scared made me guess made me laugh made me question even up to today who goes there in that film this film had no hollywood <UNK> pie or funny type ending and what a bold move not to have one in 1982 another brilliant move br br i was at the screening for this film when i was on vacation in southern california the audience at the screening went wild i carry those memories for years it was so much fun we all thought that there was no way on god's green earth this film was not going to be a hit but by box office <UNK> it was a dud because of et the extra <UNK> and <UNK> two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out br br this film was what i as a horror film adult buff was looking for a horror thriller with an adult script and real adult actors not kids playing adults not little miss big <UNK> scream queen of the day running around screaming for <UNK> but real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear heck being a feminist i didn't even miss women in this film and good for mr carpenter by not putting one in there it really wouldn't have made sense unless the thing was actually feminine something to think about br br i saw special effects of that time i had never seen before i saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights this is what horror thrillers of today are missing today the directors <UNK> out today the studios <UNK> out too much cgi and not enough belief too much cgi and not enough story not enough imagination you leave the theater and in a week or less you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening this one stays with ya that's one of the marks of an excellent film br br on many reviews i've written how now paying 10 for a film is horrid for films like this one you'd pay it and not feel <UNK> this film is not for everyone br br i find it horrific that they this film a cult film i find that the audience is <UNK> than many would lead you to <UNK> and although not a commercial success in 1982 this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad after john carpenter's film many people copied many techniques make up special effects and story lines from this version of the thing br br i am now to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time very much under rated please see it uncut please see it in <UNK> and please hear it <UNK> you'll talk about it for years as well
<START> if pulp fiction and get <UNK> didn't exist this might be an ok film when i say this i mean that nothing from this film is it's own unless it's another bit of terrible dialogue or a cliché full scene all the lines like 'i won't say more than i have to if <UNK> from get <UNK> seem to appear in this rubbish sequel all the cameos like steven <UNK> are acted terribly and are not needed and as for christina man don't get me started sadly some of the coolest actors and actresses like john travolta and uma thurman seem like they are trying to be down with the kids and hip and have nearly ruined there reputation because of this film and frankly i think the best acting is from the rock who plays alongside one of my least favourite actors vince vaughn the man tries to be funny throughout with him taking the mickey of how apparently <UNK> talk cedric the entertainer and andre 3000 play another terrible double act i personally think the background actors were better than cedric and andre and the only funny part of the acting of cedric andre and the rest of there gang do is the way there <UNK> are down to there knees so you can clearly see there <UNK> and the only reason i find this funny is because lots of people actually do that so in conclusion this film tries to be funny and fails miserably it doesn't have any new material comedy or <UNK> throughout as it copies every other film and finally the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare how bad it is to it's brilliant predecessor get <UNK> oh yes i forgot to mention there is a big cliché at the end
<START> in the early 19th century a young woman with a falls foul of her family's ambition and the <UNK> of the local community but she meets a man who may see her differently and just may change life forever br br precious <UNK> is a british <UNK> corporation adaptation of the highly acclaimed novel by mary <UNK> it's a beautifully filmed piece that is acted to an incredibly high standard the story screenplay by maggie is excellent and the period detail and use of <UNK> is second to none it's such a shame that this film has yet to get a dvd release one would have thought that with clive <UNK> great here as <UNK> rise to stardom the bbc would get it out there but sadly no so the only way of catching it is on the very rare occasions that tcm shows it the lead performance from janet <UNK> as is simply brilliant guts and genuine emotion go hand in hand as <UNK> gives it her all has to not only <UNK> with her facial <UNK> but also the constant and hurt from the ignorant villagers this is a time when folk believed that if a <UNK> ran in front of a pregnant woman it <UNK> doom a time of bull <UNK> a time of <UNK> and talk of witches in spite of constant set backs is strong and <UNK> even her own family knock her dreams back without <UNK> it but this road may well be a terribly <UNK> one but hope is <UNK> and has hope in abundance br br 8 5 10
<START> it is the best movie on acting i have ever seen all the artists are old turkish theater actors they are magnificent in this movie it is sometimes said that they do not act they live it you can really see this in this movie the director is also competent you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good but after the acting the most outstanding part is the content of the movie it gives happiness enthusiasm desire to live importance of real friends to people we all started to live <UNK> nowadays in this film you see that there are someone other then us and most importantly you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is love loving your friends loving your darling all people should see this movie
<START> i am testing myself to watch 3 bad movies in a row to find out if watching 3 bad movies in a row could give me <UNK> i have a dubbed to english version of this movie now let me go down the points music score bad quality but at least it suits story it's about a guy who goes to a town and he meets his sheriff brother and they fight for <UNK> land from a major and he allies with <UNK> to drive them out and <UNK> and his brother try to teach them to defend it the final climatic fight scene will confuse anyone about who the are the good guys conclusion better than i thought but i need to continue with this i am next going to watch the dolph <UNK> and jean <UNK> damme movie universal soldier pray for my sanity
<START> i never expected such an old film to be as impressive as this 1930 western turned out to be the scenes of the <UNK> heading west in their covered <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and mud river <UNK> indian attacks and every manner of trial and danger are astonishing in their rugged believability much of the film was shot <UNK> and the movie has a truly epic feel about it the actors must have experienced much the same conditions as the original <UNK> did and the results are astounding the <UNK> the clothing every single detail looks and feels right the characters are simple but believable with a straightforward story that travels like the <UNK> train to its destination br br john wayne is slim and youthful in one of his first roles as the <UNK> leading the <UNK> and he does a fine job as the idealistic young <UNK> he's up against a <UNK> trio of villains including ian keith as a slick <UNK> charles stevens as a mexican sidekick and <UNK> power senior as the bear like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> larger than life portrayal is both comic and menacing i keep <UNK> him with a gold <UNK> <UNK> and black eye <UNK> with a parrot on his shoulder as he <UNK> and <UNK> various <UNK> and insults his character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship with no difficulty at all he nearly steals the whole picture br br <UNK> marshall is delightful as a <UNK> old <UNK> who is wayne's best friend the lovely <UNK> <UNK> makes a spirited heroine whose initial meeting with wayne is a hilarious mix up resulting in a long running <UNK> <UNK> of insults and <UNK> indifference on her part to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on his the results are quite humorous and one is glad to see them finally get together at the end br br the scenery is amazing with the <UNK> crossing real <UNK> and having to be <UNK> by <UNK> down <UNK> indians who are clearly the genuine article and not white actors in makeup appear as both friends and <UNK> and are treated with dignity wayne's character tells an <UNK> group of young boys that the indians are his friends who taught him everything he knows about survival in the wilderness br br the big trail is an <UNK> tale told well by a talented cast and crew it will probably appear naive to many modern viewers but there is a quiet dignity about it that never lets it become corny there is a great deal of intentional humor including a <UNK> <UNK> of a <UNK> who makes loud animal sounds from hiding every time the smooth <UNK> ian keith tries to con the beautiful heroine into marrying him his <UNK> speeches about the plantation he allegedly owns are interrupted by very realistic <UNK> of <UNK> cats and <UNK> <UNK> causing the would be <UNK> to look around in annoyance for the unseen creatures br br highly recommended both for western fans and lovers of old movies in general this is truly a classic film for the ages
<START> after <UNK> american indians <UNK> number one son <UNK> bruce bennett as daniel <UNK> seems at first like he wants to get even but he really wants to make friends with the natives when sad eyed indian chief <UNK> <UNK> jr as also loses number one son it gets more difficult to clear up <UNK> apparently this was republic <UNK> attempt to do for their daniel <UNK> trail <UNK> what disney <UNK> had successfully done with <UNK> <UNK> king of the wild frontier 1955 br br the <UNK> <UNK> song <UNK> and sung by a group of children in a <UNK> did not follow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up the hit parade singer young as doesn't perform the title song perhaps wisely he does sing long green valley and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for <UNK> daughter but spanish actor freddy <UNK> is the film's most valuable player in a cute scene mr <UNK> reminds mr young the name of the character <UNK> he is supposed to be in love with br br daniel <UNK> trail <UNK> 10 5 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bruce bennett <UNK> <UNK> jr young freddy <UNK>
<START> this is about as stupid as it gets br br a classic case of two dimensional characters who always act exactly contrary as to what a sane person would do in the same situation it reminds me of a scene in scary movie where carmen <UNK> <UNK> from the killer there are two signs one marked to safety the other one to sure death i am <UNK> from memory br br and just like in scary movie the characters always run into the direction marked sure death br br why oh why did the girl start the fire in the <UNK> booth and hold the door shut did she prefer to die in the fire instead being killed by the guy why oh why after cutting and <UNK> the driver did they sit him in the seat and have him being watched by the wounded guy instead of plain shooting him or at the very least knocking him out he was running over their friend and killing him a minute before yet they have <UNK> why oh why a hundred things more br br if this movie were a road you could not drive a single yard because of the holes everything is so far fetched it's starting to physically hurt at times br br add mercilessly <UNK> actors and a small budget to that and here's what you get looking at the rating and the comments i get the feeling those people have been watching an entirely different movie br br the one thing missing really is the infamous red <UNK> from while she was out a movie that is about similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters
<START> this movie looked like it was shot with a video phone it had very little plot and unnecessary nudity the movie never really came together or made much sense and for a movie like this of course there were some unnecessary <UNK> shots the director was obviously trying to make the movie <UNK> and different but it just never gave enough information on what was even really going on even in the end i was left with a mixture of anger and confusion confusion from the lack of plot and anger because i wanted my two dollars back from blockbuster and an 1 5 hours of my life back they should have a <UNK> program for people who accidentally rent this movie
<START> i have spent many years studying all the great directors like kurosawa lean fulci <UNK> <UNK> kubrick and admire them greatly my favourite film is once upon a time in america br br i have only recently become a fan of <UNK> and while he was no horror master his films were extreme whether it be soft core hardcore or extreme br br porno holocaust is now one of my favourite films the way its shot is brilliant and the music is catchy br br joe <UNK> wasn't a horror master he's no fulci or <UNK> but however he was a master of <UNK> no other director could shoot erotic films like him he also never tried making any films outside of these <UNK> either br br long live joe master of porn and <UNK>
<START> spending an hour seeing this brilliant dan <UNK> and his dan band perform their special on bravo is the most enjoyable hour i've ever spent watching tv this young man dan is such an incredible talent as a singer performer and even dancer he can go from the <UNK> of <UNK> pop songs all of which have only been sung by women to hip hop rock also songs written for women this guy can do anything i've seen him live at least 11 times so i was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format but all <UNK> went away instantly when the show started because of <UNK> overwhelming star quality do yourself a favor and watch this or better yet buy it
<START> naked deanna <UNK> br br <UNK> brother chuck from happy days with a reverse <UNK> br br death wish 3 has all this and more including one clever scene where chuck <UNK> character sets up a <UNK> like device that brains a punk when he opens the window br br chuck also places a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody <UNK> leading away br br all i can say about death wish 3 is that it is one of most incomprehensible serious movies that i have ever seen loaded to the <UNK> with mayhem and nearly zero police response despite the use of military weapons to <UNK> <UNK> down by the score br br as i understand it bronson <UNK> this film but happily <UNK> the check from <UNK> <UNK> br br if you enjoy quality movies avoid this one but if you're in for a cheap jackass kind of thrill check it out
<START> for those who have enjoyed the <UNK> books and films you'll love this film yes i will admit that it does mix some of the books and films but the characters are brilliant and it's not just people showing off their cgi left right and centre i've already seen it several times and laughed my <UNK> off at it br br of course it contains the main heroes <UNK> and but this time they have someone new to deal with br br with a sense of humour like that the will go on and on and on bless 'em
<START> please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the radio city music hall as an <UNK> re the music hall i know what is and what is not associated with the new york <UNK> the film's theodore is just the music hall no are in the film only wonderful ice <UNK> plus superb actors and fun just thought you would like to know truly a wonderful film you will never guess who the is while watching this film till the very end what a superb plot and beautiful ice <UNK> one never sees that kind of performances any more the <UNK> theater and the center theatres in new york city had ice <UNK> performances on stage
<START> i thought it would be more fantastic a tale but the subject is rather down to earth compared to the story about the death <UNK> i was expecting in fact there is much more of a social drama as usual in the european <UNK> movies br br actors are interesting not overacting as in the average silent movie images are not so good as to be stuck in your mind as in <UNK> br br this is true the comparison between the two movies is the main point here begins with a vision of a death <UNK> <UNK> character can see his own body there are <UNK> without hands he is compelled to look back on what he has done wrong there is a vision of his happy family in the country in wife doesn't cheat on him before his eyes but she wants to flee with the little children because it would never get any better with him eventually confession is some kind of a live judgement br br well i would just add that destroying the door with an axe because his wife locked it and plans to go away with the children reminded me of the shining which was much more of a fantasy tale with death hanging around
<START> is about a somewhat arrogant reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying and finds himself looking after his sister who has <UNK> syndrome he can't be bothered with her and basically just wants to get her off his hands he has better things to do at one point he finds that he has to take her by car she doesn't like flying across the country br br if that all sounds familiar to you it is probably because you have seen <UNK> ' a film far superior to its <UNK> <UNK> ' that it copies the basic premise heck it <UNK> a few characters and even scenes too is not the fundamental problem with the film the fundamental problem is that i did not care about these characters br br the brother kenny kevin <UNK> is a bit of a <UNK> he has a girlfriend who comes and goes in the story and who learns to like the <UNK> syndrome sister again this is taken from he is a journalist trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal when he ends up looking after <UNK> the sister he doesn't have much time for her and sometimes leaves her alone for a little too long when she wanders off he becomes even <UNK> towards her am i spoiling anything by saying that he becomes a <UNK> loving person by the end of the film br br <UNK> is not determined to be <UNK> she is <UNK> ' and wishes people would stop treating her differently she is played by paula <UNK> an actress who does have <UNK> syndrome and her performance is easily the best thing about the film why did the screenwriter not explore her character more well probably because that would mean the characters would get in the way of the story when we surely already know the story anyway didn't the filmmakers see the problem they were creating br br for a film about a dying mother and her handicapped daughter the father is absent i think he is dead but i'm not sure it is surprising how little impact the film has on the emotions of the viewer the scenes are performed in such a standard dull way with such standard predictable dialogue that i found myself rolling my eyes br br i have nothing against sentimentality in films but it only really works if you care about the characters here the characters are so uninteresting and two dimensional that i didn't really think there was much to care about rain man' has an emotional climax but that moved me because i cared about the characters br br talking of <UNK> this film has a stinker there is sequence at the end of the film that starts off as an unbelievable situation and ends up in even worse territory an <UNK> cruel trick is played on the audience the sequence is designed to move the audience but ends up being horribly manipulative and <UNK> the intelligence of the viewer audiences aren't stupid and they know when the film is cheating what a cheap shot br br there is not one scene in this film that has the impact it should there are a few sequences that are funny yes but when the characters talk to each other i can practically see the screenplay in front of me moving predictably and never hitting anything that touches the mind or the heart there are those <UNK> arguments that are reserved especially for the movies where the other character knows exactly what the <UNK> is why don't supposedly <UNK> films not realise that in real life anger can be irrational and sometimes people can't express their emotions and they might say things that don't make sense or not be able to say anything at all all of the actors in this film deserve better material this film is not based on fact but i think a documentary on a family with a <UNK> syndrome member would be much more interesting that way we might have had truth and emotion for some reason the characters in this film think that an emotion only involves saying something <UNK> and making a suitable facial expression br br out of 5
<START> rebecca de can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts she's given to play if you cannot say something nice br br de portrays a woman who had terrible <UNK> as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she's a grown up and has become a of course brilliant shrink she has an affair with <UNK> whom we suspect of being <UNK> how original a serial killer sometimes she recalls <UNK> mother in law <UNK> <UNK> character in <UNK> but i wouldn't count on it hitchcock died twenty four years ago and a lot of <UNK> desperately try to replace him here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end but that ending is so far fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy it the movie includes the obligatory conversations with a serial killer in the silence of the <UNK> tradition murders human beings and cats split personality and open ending in case the crowds should call for more apparently they did not and they were right
<START> when i first saw this movie i said to myself hey what the heck it sounds like a good movie why not rent it so yeah i rented it and went back home to see it when i inserted it in my dvd player i was shocked br br well first of all no one told me it was a mexican movie and was spoken in spanish good thing it had subtitles br br second it was nude nude nude since i have no background whatsoever in mexican movies you could see my shock when i saw it gasp covering virgin eyes <UNK> br br third predictable to say the least but actually being it predictable was no excuse to me in liking movies because i don't seem to care if it's predictable unless it's way over the top br br fourth how <UNK> and were reunited so cheesy br br fifth how the movie ended it was a bad bad ending how mr van der sudden <UNK> to the <UNK> election was because her daughter knew how to throw the party blah blah i was hoping that he wasn't that easy to accept it the director might have just rushed it br br after all of this bashing of the bad stuff the good <UNK> are here to come the movie was actually quite hilarious at some point with being clumsy in the kitchen and all attitude <UNK> being poetic with words what i really also like about it was the song that <UNK> made with her girl friend that's all and for the other <UNK> that i haven't mentioned they were just so so
<START> john <UNK> modern masterpiece a separate peace are one of many subtle and subtly is the watch word themes of love hate <UNK> denial and regret the 1972 version does attempt to address this style and what the book is a love story with war <UNK> in the background br br the 2004 version does not use subtly at all but in the portrayal of the story what is staring you in the face when you read the novel is a love story and yes maybe it is <UNK> a gay love story in the novel and 1972 film version there are sexual undertones everywhere in the <UNK> and dialog in the 2004 showtime film version these tensions were <UNK> and the actors were in there late <UNK> playing teenagers which caused for mature acting taking away from any <UNK> or <UNK> of innocence in youth br br i did not like this remake for more reasons the hair that broke the back was that <UNK> was given a <UNK> on the letters he received from the draft boards is a character that does not have nor needs a last name john <UNK> did that intentionally br br though i accept the 1972 version the acting was at times a little amateurish so what it attempted to be sincere to the novel by shooting on location at phillips <UNK> academy that the <UNK> <UNK> was based on which also the writer john <UNK> attended as a student br br the directors and producers took all teenage <UNK> students with exception of parker stevenson whom attended the brooks school to play in a paramount film class act by <UNK> compared to this canadian college shot played with adult actors politically correct <UNK> version no <UNK> on this <UNK> try again the 1972 film version with john and parker stevenson was the real deal for a separate peace on the screen the showtime 2004 film made for cable version was not
<START> can't say this wasn't made well at a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes and there isn't the slightest indication he didn't get exactly what he wanted but this is an oddly non hispanic film in the same way west side story was many years ago both the leads a brother sister team are excellent and memorable in their parts the setting a sort of underground car <UNK> district in queens is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself but there's something unsatisfying about the key issue in the film namely what the sister feels she has to do to get by i can understand the brother's reaction but it just seems a little too easily come by to me the movie seems to suggest that people like these don't need our help that they'll find a way to survive without the usual support systems i wouldn't encourage anyone to believe that there would be far more resistance to the choices made here than depicted other than that as an entertainment it works well as an accurate depiction of a culture not so well i think
<START> there are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few let's start with the silly and annoying songs like ride little cowboy which just tended to <UNK> the city <UNK> look of the silly kiddie cowboy songs going on in the background during the movie hurt any credibility or momentum that the story had going for it br br i had seen the media hype before this movie was released and i saw interviewed on various tv shows and he had a very soft sweet <UNK> voice his body language was not exactly what people remembered who were fans of <UNK> moore and the lone ranger tv series did not help things by acting like a <UNK> and talking trash about <UNK> moore after the producers got an <UNK> moore from appearing at conventions and other events as the original lone ranger <UNK> moore was not even allowed to sign as <UNK> moore the lone ranger he could only sign as the masked man the incredible amount of negative publicity that this move gave the film was only added to by the <UNK> attitude of who was very quick to tell <UNK> that <UNK> moore would be quickly forgotten once the movie came out br br sadly even after the movie was a total flop the company that owned the lone ranger refused to lift their <UNK> against <UNK> moore and he was never again <UNK> to sign anything except as the masked man and he could not don his black mask at any public appearances between <UNK> personality and the negative publicity the movie got it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public worse yet a few weeks before the movie was finally released the news was <UNK> that voice in the movie had been over dubbed by james because the producers thought that did not sound very convincing as a cowboy the <UNK> and <UNK> that this news brought on the talk shows and comedy shows of that era put the last nail into the coffin br br but then there was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his way through the movie apparently the producers were hoping that the macho image of <UNK> one of the <UNK> of country music would add credibility to as the lone ranger the narration by <UNK> <UNK> was just another annoyance that audiences had to deal with at times <UNK> <UNK> his narration and it sounds like some weird kiddie movie combine the <UNK> narration with the ride little cowboy songs and any credibility that could have <UNK> was destroyed by <UNK> and the soundtrack br br <UNK> was played by michael horse and as others have pointed out horse had a lot more personality than in fact perhaps because of allegedly <UNK> attitude during filming it seems like horse was given a lot more dialogue and screen time than anyone would have expected of <UNK> <UNK> takes charge and often is the leader instead of the lone ranger i was expecting or hoping that billy jack would make a cameo as brother it would have made the movie a lot better horse is not only more interesting than but he says more and has better scenes perhaps it was a case of horse stealing the show from however since the movie was so wretched horse did not get much recognition unlike horse has had a very <UNK> career in the film industry br br perhaps the last negative about this movie is the <UNK> blue outfit of the lone ranger the material that was chosen for was more blue than what <UNK> moore normally wore at appearances that choice of color for the outfit just made look more <UNK> in his role the comic book version had shown the lone ranger also wearing a red shirt and black pants and that alternative outfit would have helped look more convincing as the lone ranger br br the supporting cast mostly <UNK> in their performances they all look as if they were working on a tv episode and nobody seemed very convincing even the villain lost his edge due to the people around him overall i feel sorry for not only did he do a terrible acting job but it is obvious that the production and publicity were horrible and effectively <UNK> any chance the poor guy had even if he had been an excellent replacement for <UNK> moore i doubt that the movie would have done well as a result of the other factors as it stands this film is funny in a sad way
<START> ok i admit that i still associate sophie with la that was the main reason i went to see this film but it was so boring that i nearly felt asleep sorry but her talents as actress are not very convincing furthermore this film was presented as having outstanding special effects and cgi yeah for a b movie it is not that bad after having seen her in <UNK> some years ago also a very crappy film i thought that she would play more convincingly but la and may be the james bond the world is not enough seem to be the only good films with her is it her talent does she have a bad taste when choosing her films or simply bad luck
<START> if <UNK> <UNK> and john lynch weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is the story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting one and well worth exploring however on the negative side the plot becomes increasingly over the top as the story progresses and the music choices more and more bizarre so that by the end i found myself laughing when i know the director intended for me to be crying
<START> after working on 7 movies with director <UNK> the adventures of robin hood are their best achievement errol flynn got tired of his <UNK> direction and decided to work with the great <UNK> walsh this reunion is a happy thing for cinematography the died with their boots on is their first and best film together <UNK> walsh portrays the general george armstrong <UNK> errol flynn from his <UNK> at west point to the civil war and finally at the battle of little big horn it's true the film shows a too heroic portrait of <UNK> but that's not important what is important is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters who can forget california joe the great <UNK> own with his song the touching mrs <UNK> olivia de <UNK> the <UNK> sharp well played by arthur kennedy br br an eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic
<START> ok so <UNK> chilling in my room when mom knocks on the door i open the door and what do i see in her hands sleepy hollow high i thinking it has to be an older horror movie because there's <UNK> anyone could be stupid enough to name a movie that after the blockbuster hit sleepy hollow starring johnny <UNK> but to my surprise the movie is at least two years older then the original that alone should have stopped me from putting it into the v c r but no i had to take a chance i had to believe that this movie could have one small ray of hope little did i know that the <UNK> where no where to be seen br br number one the story line is so ridiculous that it's probably true in some country <UNK> town two the actors seem more like people real life people who just happen to wonder on the set when the director yell cut three just about any movie starring the director is always awful but the funny thing is that this is yet another movie directed by kevin i've become to rely on his movie to bring me to the floor with side splitting laughter br br where to start on this movie i know let's start with the <UNK> in the woods the camera lighting was so bad that i lead to believe that the <UNK> was standing still and the camera man was running i love how the woman's stop to eat a candy bar i mean it's just about dark or just about light who could tell with the camera lighting and she stops running to eat a candy bar i mean a candy bar what the hell so she ends up being the first victim because of stupidity and already <UNK> ready to break the tape find the director burn his little hands br br then out of nowhere some guys like trying to fix a car that probably been broken for some years now then in come the fake mack 10 and a very real prostitute who happen to be part of our main <UNK> cast br br the some of the movie is about a group of kids who all get into trouble and are given the choice to pick up trash in the sleepy hollow park or face suspension forever there sent in the woods with one of the teachers mr e or a k a kevin who suppose to watch over them and make sure that all goes <UNK> the funniest thing is how undeveloped the <UNK> really are i mean what is with the fake mack 10 dude and who's ever heard of <UNK> trying to kill themselves and some how one of the students has had an affair with the teacher mr e before all of this community service crap had even came up yet the school still thought it was a cool idea for them to let him go also there's one student named j who purpose in the movie is to keep annoyingly popping up out of no where trying to make the audience jump when all he really does is add to the <UNK> of the film the sound was so horrible in this movie i mean there was one seen when two guys are fighting and the guy punches the other guy in the stomach and out of the t v comes this sound effect that sounds like someone <UNK> a stale wooden box it began horribly and ended dangerously stupid even my taste i will say this though the music in the back ground made the scenes look some what tolerable but not that much tolerable my conclusion is this if you want to left at yet another movie that kevin took serious buy sleepy hollow high br br p s <UNK> still thinking about shooting myself to remove those images of the fake mack 10
<START> a middle aged man robert jordan set in his ways takes on a boy <UNK> <UNK> after his predecessor leaves under <UNK> jordan takes on the pack mostly to learn what the boys like so he can revive his <UNK> radio program which is losing it's appeal to the younger set he has a rough go at first with the boys especially so with mike an 8 year old who forms an <UNK> for the older man which is anything but <UNK> do things work out for jordan and the <UNK> check out this entertaining and amusing film from the old days
<START> this is the best movie i have ever seen it has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate and a deep friendship that not even war can destroy br br the most splendid casting i have ever seen patrick <UNK> and james read were top grade in this movie br br if you see part 1 you will want to see it all some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie br br i am a civil war buff but this movie got my <UNK> interested in history any movie that can get children to learn history is great i have books i ii iii and when the girls come up from florida each year they want to see north south
<START> is definitely my most favorite movie i've worn more than one tape as it is the make up is awesome the story is lovely it takes a few different twists and isn't quite as deep as the story it's based on <UNK> by clive barker but for a movie adaption it stays very true to source material the only problem with this movie were the <UNK> vain attempts to turn it into a teen slasher movie hence the changed ending to allow for sequels eye rolls apparently someday we're going to be getting a director's cut that will i hope clear up this bit of nonsense until then i'd suggest it to anyone who like dark fantasy type horror as opposed to freddy jason micheal type slashers i really don't know what would be comparable
<START> i was only <UNK> when i first saw the alien movies and i immediately came to like it original terrifying and classic <UNK> weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero character and she would have deserved a <UNK> for her act in 1979 something <UNK> was born than the immortal series continued with a nothing less legendary movie than the first was a different point of view but i think this part was the most <UNK> and unique of all this was my favourite unfortunately the last one was a failure in many ways it was strained illogical with full of meaningless <UNK> i didn't like it at all but i never thought that a worse part would ever be made in the future well as it turned out in 2004 i was wrong alien vs predator was a bad break and it should have been directed by a more talented director or should have never been made at all but when i saw alien vs predator <UNK> i was totally shocked moreover <UNK> when i sat down and decided to watch it with full of doubt even than i had never thought that such a bad movie could be made without a screenplay without a director and without actors i don't understand how can a film be made because this film misses these three terms what you get is a nice massacre show without a story but with a lot of annoying and boring dialogues waste of money and waste of time this movie is rather <UNK> than honor to the fans of the both sides alien predator shame
<START> i saw this movie with an open mind not knowing what to expect i was pleasantly surprised to see that this movie was written directed and acted in such a manner that every minute of it is a delightful watch the people don't seem like they're acting more like they are real people who really train dogs and lead the lives portrayed in this movie there are some wonderful moments where you laugh or chuckle some jokes may be dry but are presented in a very <UNK> fashion highly recommended
<START> i watched this movie to see the direction one of the most promising young talents in movies was going unfortunately with this movie <UNK> <UNK> has chosen a path not only well worn but completely free of any meaningful destination this movie used every hackneyed trick in the book to leave the screen tap you on the shoulder and <UNK> ask if it can have your <UNK> so that it may give them a good <UNK> romance can be done well and when it is the viewer is left feeling the love portrayed on screen during the emotional climax of this movie i laughed <UNK> to save you the time and money i would suggest instead of seeing this movie you have a meal of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it's about the same
<START> this is actually the first movie i ever saw in a theatre where the people didn't leave immediately when the end credits started in <UNK> they remained <UNK> for a few minutes <UNK> with their mouths open staring in the <UNK> trying to understand what they <UNK> just seen br br the only thing i can say try to go watch this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible so did i i gave it a 10
<START> lame b horror that takes itself too damn seriously considering its subject matter concerns an aging old dear who has been turned into a creature of the night by a <UNK> who has come to rent a room from her when said <UNK> is killed off mom has to go out to feed on her own and that causes some family strain and also <UNK> some attention from the authorities br br my main complaint is that this film should have brought the funny it failed to do so although it did have some mild gore and <UNK> creature makeup effects to keep the b movie crowd happy i've seen worse but i wouldn't give this one a <UNK> 4 5 10
<START> he plays straight but with a quiet intensity that makes him one of the top cops in movie history roy <UNK> stars in a poor man's french connection that has a little of the same gritty appeal <UNK> is a better movie but i prefer watching this one because 1 i think <UNK> is great and this is his best movie and 2 this has the best car chase ever one that makes <UNK> look like a cable production thanks again to bill <UNK> who actually plays the driver it doesn't hurt that tony stops by again to play a baddie please enjoy
<START> i hope that matt <UNK> original script for this was much better there are signs of it dialogue that should happen well before big f x scenes to introduce characters that would make sense much earlier is <UNK> in later in the time line perhaps the original script was for a longer running time but maybe not in any case this <UNK> every character is uninteresting and everybody speaks <UNK> <UNK> as if they are speaking the word of god there are characters that are entirely <UNK> <UNK> secretary <UNK> is just awful explaining things to her assistant and incidentally us in endless speeches that no one would say to anyone ever in real life when she isn't explaining things to her assistant that she already knows her assistant explains things to her that she already knows there are characters who are entirely one dimensional the evil power company guy the pilot who will just not shut up about his personal life and concentrate on his job the well meaning power company <UNK> guy who can crash br br everything in chicago including the phones and then gives the oh no what have i done speech but not leave himself a back door the <UNK> reporter who <UNK> her principles at the drop of a hat the power company shift <UNK> who <UNK> his post in the middle of the worst crisis in chicago since the fire with no consequences <UNK> abandoned by the doctors and <UNK> during the crisis i'm not kidding that's in the movie br br oh yeah and it's filled with hollywood morality clichés generally women are good men are evil unless influenced by a woman the ultimate is the punk with the gun <UNK> of a woman's influence he literally goes insane an evil stupid act like what the reporter did with <UNK> <UNK> is all right so long as you <UNK> evil men die <UNK> evil men die as horribly as possible everybody else lives well except randy quaid and did i hear someone say that the nuclear <UNK> power <UNK> stations had to shut down because there wasn't electricity to run the safety systems think about that one br br there is one ray of sunshine if you'll <UNK> the expression randy quaid basically plays his character from independence day you know hello boys i'm this time as a storm <UNK> with an <UNK> range <UNK> and <UNK> for his <UNK> nevertheless they kill him mostly it seems so that the audience will appreciate that <UNK> are pretty dangerous things kinda shallow that br br give this one a pass
<START> i think that pierre <UNK> or his character to be precise is really outlandish but with grace i also remember the chess player and of the girl who seems to be appearing by chance in his home something really curious the woman acting as the lawyer is to me one of the most beautiful actresses ever seen on the screen but i must admit that the plot is too inconsistent to be taken seriously the character who plays as the lead theater actor is really nice especially when he's annoyed by the new actor the one in purple t shirt also the scene where the <UNK> actor who belongs to another company directs the stage is really fascinating and relaxing as it often happens with this movie for example when they drink tea they just make you want to have a cup
<START> some spoilers br br this movie is sometimes subtitled life <UNK> that's often taken as reference to the final scene but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once <UNK> series is after this sloppy and illogical send off br br there's a hey kids let's put on a show air about this <UNK> which can be endearing in spots some fans will feel like <UNK> as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances co writer co producer tom <UNK> and his pals pack the goings on with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real <UNK> <UNK> br br that's on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the <UNK> show varied casts your old favorites as well as later non favorites br br there was always a <UNK> of war <UNK> quality conscious executive producer barry <UNK> <UNK> james <UNK> and the rest of the creative team against budget conscious nbc <UNK> who simply wanted a another moronic police <UNK> like <UNK> bridges which regularly beat homicide in the ratings the pressure told as the show <UNK> between riveting realism that <UNK> its form and sleazy <UNK> that <UNK> it br br unfortunately for this movie <UNK> co writers <UNK> and eric <UNK> and director jean de <UNK> simply threw in the <UNK> they took the most ludicrous story are from the series topped it with an unlikely and artistically <UNK> new plot line and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members br br briefly some time has passed since the last episode of the show the former heart of <UNK> homicide unit <UNK> <UNK> as lt al <UNK> is now a kurt <UNK> like candidate for mayor and <UNK> himself makes a cameo appearance but this promising start immediately and <UNK> takes a tragic turn br br the spotlight shifts to <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> son mike a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere <UNK> was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly <UNK> the tv series but the question for viewers always was is mike that uncomfortable as <UNK> son or is <UNK> that uncomfortable in the role br br to be fair <UNK> doesn't get a chance to play out the main story without <UNK> that's because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that <UNK> on the intelligence of the show's loyal voters br br an apparent snuff <UNK> video was promoted and then seemed to actually take place on the internet after some red herrings the detectives arrested a <UNK> suspect but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time and the suspect was released only to be murdered later br br let's <UNK> he forgot to file the <UNK> because it wasn't the most sensational case of his career because the mayor the attorney general the <UNK> the entire <UNK> <UNK> the u s attorney general nbc court tv the bbc <UNK> <UNK> people the sun the washington post the new york times the la times time magazine the times of london the <UNK> the <UNK> mail and guardian <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> paris match <UNK> and computer world weren't calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case br br nevertheless the old gang of detectives and associates <UNK> back to <UNK> to help out there's quite an array of talent on display unfortunately with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out some of them are merely on display br br two of the strongest actors clark johnson and melissa leo are criminally underused while time wasted on jon <UNK> and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials the writers do seem to <UNK> this presenting jason <UNK> as the latest big deal detective on the other hand they give easy come easy go michelle forbes a very affecting scene br br there's some other sly casting with actual lt gary <UNK> the center of the book that gave rise to the show playing another detective guests drop in from other shows like <UNK> allen doing her deadpan and clueless miss sally from the children's show beloved by the inmates on <UNK> oz <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> tv turns up as herself br br even when entertaining though these guests can be distracting ed <UNK> jr actually advances the story in his brief appearance playing dr victor <UNK> from <UNK> st elsewhere he's still a vivid character and fits in a hospital setting then you remember didn't st <UNK> turn out to be an <UNK> boy's fantasy br br the most useful cameo reflects corporate <UNK> this movie was made when court tv bought re run rights to the series that network contributed legal <UNK> helen <UNK> who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on oz the tv <UNK> does an efficient job <UNK> the news that is plot points for <UNK> br br although she's so thin that she disappears when she turns <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> handles a bit of physical comedy with <UNK> he shows more juice in his scenes with <UNK> than with any of his usual colleagues perhaps those two should have done a spin off br br as the movie winds down the cream of the cast rises to the top although they are <UNK> with a loser script andre <UNK> and kyle <UNK> overcome it their performances remind viewers what made homicide for considerable stretches the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever br br it's fun to watch top pros do their stuff it's just a shame this movie doesn't give them more of a chance die hard fans may want to see this movie anyway but you can live without it
<START> this is a very funny movie there is a self <UNK> <UNK> tone to the movie that is very appealing the characters are interesting the movie flows very well and holds your interest throughout the 1 hour 50 minutes duration of the film the film quality is not of the highest hollywood standards however the original film was supposed to be made in the genre of a gritty punk rock style the documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the film makers is very well detailed and easy to follow the original film makers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the movie the interviews of the film makers and the actors has been assembled in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in making the original film the eventual failure of the original project and the phoenix like rising from the <UNK> that evolved into this documentary film in my mind the documentary a texas tale of <UNK> is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original film vacation would have ever been two thumbs up for a job well done
<START> night of the hunted stars french porn star <UNK> in fact many of the cast members in this slow moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming this film is certainly different than <UNK> usual lesbian vampire flicks but it's not as memorable as for example lips of blood or fascination plays an <UNK> <UNK> who can't remember who she is or where she came from most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex where is being held by some kind of medical group that's treating a number of people with a similar condition anyway she escapes from the <UNK> office tower where the affected people are held on a highway outside of town she meets a young man who stops and picks her up night of the hunted offers plenty of nudity unfortunately the pace is extremely slow the atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between <UNK> and another asylum <UNK> <UNK> is well developed still night of the hunted is too dull to be completely enjoyable give it a look only if you are a fan of jean <UNK> works 7 out of 10 and that's being kind
<START> this film is a mediocre low budget flick i've seen much worse on mst3k let me assure you but this is still a pretty crappy film br br the film is about a top secret government facility in which <UNK> are used to give organs to politicians it's an almost <UNK> society actually almost but not quite effective br br the film starts to roll downhill when the head clone tim <UNK> of fame falls in love with a female clone <UNK> who appeared in this and at most four other films and this was not her first film they begin to suspect something after finding a beer can in the nearby river the plot starts to unravel the clone receives no answers from either the head scientist dick <UNK> from or the a computer which supposedly knows everything so he breaks into the main building and in a scene hilariously destroyed by mike and the <UNK> finds out the truth including a clone video which <UNK> shows the exact same method that was used to clone <UNK> five years ago and this film was made over twenty years ago about he breaks free pursued by two guards he has one hell of a time breaking through the two foot high <UNK> though he has a considerably harder time climbing up some <UNK> from there it continues to slide also appearing are peter graves beginning of the <UNK> it <UNK> the <UNK> as the presidential candidate and <UNK> <UNK> dr once upon a time in the <UNK> and <UNK> ma <UNK> killer <UNK> as the elderly couple who help after he escapes br br the mst3k version was priceless one of the best episodes ever br br four stars for the film 10 for the mst3k version
<START> i had expected a fairly straightforward r rated graphic sexual crude teen comedy when i sat down to see this it turned out to be fairly accurate only it was far more sick and disgusting than i would have thought i don't know if the director writer gregory is sick or deeply messed up sexually but i doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this i could probably have taken it if it was just that if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach but it isn't the film is also horribly mean spirited and disturbing every single character that has more than one full second of time on screen is an extreme sexually mentally or physically i don't know if this is just the director's sense of humor but i just found it to be wrong just wrong even in a comedy there is supposed to be some seriousness the plot is stupid the acting is bad the characters are inconsistent and poorly written all of them there isn't one single likable character in the film the humor is disgusting and goes way too far the film is just so incredibly poorly done that i really don't think it's worth anyone's time if you like r rated crude comedies with plenty of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff watch the <UNK> or better yet american pie or road trip my personal favorite but don't watch this i can't possibly describe to you how bad it is you would have to experience it for yourself however this is one of those times where i'll say that you're better off wondering that way you can just imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom without knowing that it goes through it and far lower than that this movie most of all looks like a group of horny teenage guys got together put together a film crew and every time one of them got an idea they filmed it and later put the entire thing together it lacks structure <UNK> and taste i recommend this only to horny teenage guys who have seen every single other r rated crude teen comedy and who don't care about quality everyone else do the sensible thing avoid this it's not even worth it to see the <UNK> believe me 1 10
<START> written produced and directed by charlie chaplin this is the great actor's anti nazi propaganda piece <UNK> <UNK> hitler br br chaplin plays the dictator of as well as a jewish <UNK> who is spitting image his parody of hitler is brilliant anyone who has ever seen <UNK> of hitler speaking will recognize the eerie resemblance of the caricature br br i thought the movie got off to a slow start with some typical chaplin slap stick <UNK> on the first world war adventures of the jewish <UNK> having never seen it before i must confess that after the first 20 minutes or so i was wondering what all the fuss was about but the movie picks up steam quickly there are some very funny moments and enough emphasis on the anti jewish nature of <UNK> to make the propaganda point the climax of the film is a brilliant anti nazi speech given by chaplin at the end of the movie br br as good as chaplin is in this movie though i thought the whole thing was stolen by jack <UNK> playing the dictator of <UNK> our first look at <UNK> shows how well he had studied his subject he had <UNK> arrogant <UNK> down pat the scenes in which and <UNK> over the fate of had me in <UNK> br br this was a very good movie and well worth watching
<START> i would like to make it very clear that i am not at all religious i am an <UNK> but i could see that richard was <UNK> himself over and over again i would also like to make it known that i am not the sort of person that <UNK> against something with philosophy all the time but i feel that when comparing science and religion we must be philosophical and be willing to question the belief in main stream science as well as questioning religious beliefs br br i wonder if richard ever spends any time to think <UNK> about belief anyone who thinks long and hard enough about science and religion will realise that science is indeed a religion in itself yes there is a fundamental difference between the way that scientific beliefs are held when compared with other <UNK> but at it's roots it's faith in a particular human instinct br br throughout this series richard insists that science methods are the only right way of thinking and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence for it is strong enough if you dig deep enough into how science functions you'll realise that it is just as irrational as religion and that it comes down to faith in the end faith in the evidence faith in our sanity faith in our senses but more than anything else faith in our instinct to follow <UNK> of br br this is not easy to explain but think about how the laws of physics were decided it was because they were and still are the most common <UNK> of that we are aware of i think that human beings have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something remains in a certain state or place of existence the more we just assume out of blind faith that it is more likely to stay like it for example we don't expect that gravity will suddenly work in reverse tomorrow by this i mean pushing matter away as supposed to <UNK> it but the only reason why we don't expect this sudden change is because we have known for so long that it has always attracted as far as we are aware however that doesn't mean that it couldn't do exactly the reverse tomorrow or even right now it doesn't matter how long something may stay in a certain state or change there is no rational reason to make <UNK> about it but we do out of instinct i would ask you to consider what is a long and short amount of time there is no such thing i don't know exactly how long it took for these supposed wise men to decide that everything must be made out of matter sound light etc but lets give them what they would consider to be an edge way lets say far longer than it really was 12 years is that a long period of time years makes 12 years seem like an incredibly short period of time for all we know there could be an extreme amount of change in the so called laws of science within the next <UNK> years it's all about comparison only when we compare things can we say that is long or that is short it's the same with big and small wide and thin heavy and light strong and weak and others br br i doubt that any scientist could tell me why they think that <UNK> this instinct makes sense i certainly don't see why it should but that doesn't mean that we as humanity should necessarily stop using it with this in mind the most <UNK> comment that richard made was when he said that faith is irrational a process of non thinking he said if what we have in this instinct that i've been describing and this instinct that we all possess on some level isn't faith then i don't know what the hell it is other times when he is being <UNK> is when he talks about the <UNK> being <UNK> age <UNK> age <UNK> he says i would like to point out that no matter how much scientific methods have been changed over the years due to experience experiments and <UNK> the pure rules of science are getting older and older all the time they could even be described as the holy bible of science he was going on about how he is sick of the different <UNK> being stubborn i am right he is wrong but looking back on how rude he was to the various <UNK> he seems to be just as stubborn him self to be fair to him at least he doesn't try to bomb religious <UNK> i appreciate his hatred for certain religious beliefs that generate war but i don't respect his arrogance in his own beliefs br br as far as i'm concerned richard has the right to believe in science if that is his way i am <UNK> minded as well but i don't think he has the right to go up to religious leaders having <UNK> arguments trying to force his opinion on to them and virtually describing them as stupid despite all his education experience and <UNK> he seems to fail to have the wisdom to properly question his very own system of belief i have read what he says in <UNK> of this argument that open minded <UNK> such as my self put forward what he states suggests to me that he is totally missing the point br br finally the title of the documentary root of all evil this states that religion is the root of all evil it isn't true there are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion br br all round the documentary series was frustrating narrow minded <UNK> and flat out rubbish
<START> done on a spare change budget of twenty bucks tops this <UNK> thirteen minute short <UNK> parodies george <UNK> legendary <UNK> sci fi blockbuster star wars in the most <UNK> dumb way imaginable writer director ernie delivers a winning and often gut <UNK> blend of ludicrous sound effects <UNK> staged action scenes <UNK> far from special effects you just gotta love the cheesy <UNK> on film <UNK> <UNK> and household <UNK> i mean <UNK> being <UNK> around on obvious <UNK> badly dubbed in dialogue shamelessly hammy acting and richard <UNK> rousing piece of classical music ride of the <UNK> the characters are presented in suitably broad <UNK> my favorites are whiny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jedi knight <UNK> ben <UNK> and hateful arch villain <UNK> who <UNK> nothing but incomprehensible <UNK> moreover 4 q 3 is clearly based on the tin man from the wizard of oz while <UNK> <UNK> is definitely a cheap <UNK> <UNK> this film's true <UNK> is casting legendary voice actor supreme paul <UNK> as the narrator deliciously rich and <UNK> <UNK> tones add immensely to the considerable silly yet <UNK> tongue in cheek <UNK> choice lines you'll laugh you'll cry you'll kiss three bucks goodbye a total hoot
<START> when i went to see this i thought i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also wrong there was no suspense and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs when i was done watching this i had lost all respect for steven spielberg and michael <UNK> but then it turned out that it wasn't directed by spielberg or written by michael <UNK> this movie was going through the motions i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it
<START> in this 4th child's play film <UNK> gets lucky it's very funny and there are some enjoyable parts very good direction not as bad as it could be the best one in the series since the first three stars out of four
<START> flash gordon was a first rate serial i know there were a few goofs however i didn't watch it for the flaws buster <UNK> is flash gordon he was not a trained actor but he gave a very good convincing performance jean rogers is pretty and at 20 <UNK> old did in my opinion a pretty good job charles <UNK> as emperor <UNK> is superb he was in a lot of other movies quite versatile he could sing and dance his portrayal of <UNK> the <UNK> in all 3 flash gordon serials was top notch the rest of the cast also did a very good job well boys and girls get some popcorn settle back and enjoy john r tracy
<START> at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters <UNK> set the plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things or just a lot was edited from the movie the characters' identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of <UNK> meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the movie i suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they had if they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didn't so now there's a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opinion don't waste your time or money
<START> only saw this movie late last night i remember the hype of it's release and to be honest had i viewed it back then i maybe wouldn't have been so generous i hate hype it can ruin a movie i think the movie <UNK> over the characters and put too much emphasis on woody he was good too although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time it never went too deep redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end to me he should have been more <UNK> with <UNK> throwing her out perhaps or telling her that she was paid for after all he would have <UNK> them before he made the <UNK> that's not shown in the movie but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to just anyone he was cruel to the point of breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet <UNK> fell for him the <UNK> giving an insight to <UNK> and <UNK> relationship were the best part of the movie there was a keen <UNK> that <UNK> the <UNK> of john character he really could have been a lot stronger and as other people have <UNK> i think the movies draw card was redford and they didn't want <UNK> his image i say what the hell robert was old in this movie woody and characters were naive in a sense but i think that was very intentional to draw you to their plight and champion their decision but the reality is they were losing their dream home and where did they go las vegas to <UNK> what little they had left and then accept a <UNK> from an insanely rich <UNK> i found their <UNK> when redford was <UNK> them a little too unrealistic the movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference but having said that on late night tv it was enjoyable and i if you don't think too much also <UNK>
<START> goldie <UNK> depiction of a simple young lady caught up in a love triangle with an older man a dentist played with such <UNK> by walter matthau that she won the best supporting actress oscar for 1969 br br the film however is another tribute to ingrid bergman rarely did we ever see her in a comedy and she literally kicks up her heels here as a dedicated dental nurse who is thrust into a scheme for matthau to tell hawn that they're married br br it is such a joy to watch matthau and bergman fall for each other here theirs is an accidental love affair in the making br br as <UNK> friend jack <UNK> is fabulous as his partner in the scheme as well rick <UNK> gives ample support as <UNK> newly found boyfriend as well
<START> i was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews on this movie first many have said that they have taken their 4 year old daughters and <UNK> to see this and they did not enjoy it first i don't believe that this is a kid's movie at least not a movie for very very young children not 4 at least it has very subtle humor but it is not meant to offer quick amusement as seen in tom and jerry or something like this many people have also complained that it goes very very slowly i guess those people are all used to <UNK> over quality while i have a small quality problem myself with this movie and that is that the movie was not as detail oriented as the short movies i still believe that it managed quite well for a full feature film and how can people complain about the jokes the jokes were sensible <UNK> and well thought out never rude insulting or in your face wallace is extremely smart yet <UNK> and is the most adorable smart and cute character that could be this was a beautiful movie and the theme was very appropriate for adults that is especially with the increase of <UNK> and disease in the world there's nothing wrong with promoting <UNK> and <UNK> for once and this was accomplished in a very <UNK> manner in that while people are concerned with the aspect of <UNK> that doesn't necessarily mean that the are <UNK> or that they eat more of them but just that they temper with nature which is in fact what caused the legend of the were rabbit to come true and for those out there that complained about the religious jokes i say came on are you for real many <UNK> <UNK> around the local church and legends <UNK> etc are normal themes no harm done this movie was absolutely amazing yet some people had negative comments on it and i find this absolutely absurd
<START> anyone who rates this movie above a 3 has a very distorted view of movies anyone who rated this piece of sh t 7 or higher i have absolutely no respect for their taste in movies and doubt they have ever seen a good one i am always up for giving any movie a shot and i did with this one i tried to pay attention i tried not to let my money go 2 waste but 15 minutes in my friends were laughing at me cause i was 2 my <UNK> 25 minutes later i couldn't even watch the overacting that was occurring within the film so i up and left i have never ever ever walked out of a movie until this garbage anyone who said they enjoyed it is a liar or they should be banned from this site i get so angry when i see a person rate this an 8 when the <UNK> overall rating is a 9 1 its like saying that that movie was close which it isn't
<START> almost 20 years before frank marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic alive there already was the legendary mexican exploitation director <UNK> <UNK> who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film de los the unforgettable fatal flight of <UNK> <UNK> that crashed in the <UNK> on october 13 1972 this terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers most of them members of a professional <UNK> team but 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow passengers of course you can't claim that this cheaply made and roughly edited film is better than the famous 90's version but i definitely appreciate and respect this film more after all an exploitation film demands a lot more <UNK> from both cast and crew while the big budgeted marshall film although intense feels more like routine money making the sets and special effects naturally can't compete with alive but delivers an equally impressive sentiment of <UNK> and creates an even more nightmarish hell of snow film is ambitious surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most remarkable mexican productions ever i am really <UNK> that take on this story isn't more exploitative and explicit the scenes where the deceased passengers are cut open and consumed are nevertheless hard to <UNK> but they only serve to increase the credibility of the catastrophe and to stress the <UNK> conditions of the survivors rather <UNK> for a vicious director who gained fame with his <UNK> bad films like night of the bloody apes and the <UNK> series the unknown young mexican actors do a great job and the musical score is endearing the story is well known of course so the screenplay doesn't offer any unexpected shocks either by history or previously having seen alive you know which kind of dramas these people still have to endure before being rescued and you can only <UNK> them still this is a good film that shouldn't be <UNK> like too often is the case
<START> its a sin how these things are made but then again we wouldn't get to see the best <UNK> scene ever filmed <UNK> the beauty of low budget bigfoot flicks you lean to see the beauty the more you watch them thats if your brain doesn't melt first as i said before this has the best <UNK> scene ever words cant express it you have to see it for yourself wonderful lines such as <UNK> like flesh human you will know this one when you see it the creature makes a blah blah sound and the scene where the baby gets shot will make you cry with laughter you will be <UNK> it has a car chase chase a bigfoot folk song as well as a disco song it <UNK> end there while watching the credits a friend noticed wardrobe provided by k mart you ask how could you even get as far as the credits and then watch them i could only explain this as a sort of shock to the brain you are so mentally exhausted you cant move and also i guess you have to know who was behind the mess all that being said this is a must see especially if you want to <UNK> yourself mentally its a keeper
<START> rose  does anything actually happen in this episode it introduces our two leads a slow witted <UNK> idiot of a doctor and an utterly un interesting companion there's no plot to speak of childish humour mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music what else is there to say really br br the end of the world  a <UNK> improvement in that we see our first outer space scenario subsequently brought down by poor contemporary humour paper thin logic very poor pacing and tired sf clichés br br the <UNK> dead  best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode write interesting character dialogue and <UNK> an intriguing plot let down solely by the doctor and rose br br aliens of london world war three doctor who <UNK> into farce what more can be said penelope <UNK> brings the proceedings a little gravity trying her best in dire circumstances some poorly written and out of place soap opera elements come to the <UNK> in these two episodes and a return to poor pacing bad plotting and cringe worthy humour satire br br <UNK>  not great however still far above the <UNK> fare to date the pacing and script are all fine though the doctor and rose still <UNK> the effects and menace of the <UNK> are introduced well the finale however took an interesting premise that reduced the doctor's most notorious <UNK> into a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mess and turning a previously un seen menace to a blue rubber <UNK> that looked like a child's toy br br the long game the first <UNK> script to show any plot even if it was in a clichéd 80s style still it was marred somewhat by his usual over <UNK> on juvenile jokes placing it too far in the future to make logical sense and again poor pacing not as bad as his previous efforts but instantly forgettable br br father's day  the initial premise could've been vaguely interesting but common sense and logic abandon this episode from the very beginning also we are treated to a whole episode of soap opera before you start thinking this is all about characterization remember there's a big difference between lame soap opera and characterization on the plus side it does prove <UNK> isn't the worst script writer so far br br the empty child the doctor dances this started off in a mediocre way with some cringe worthy moments and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school <UNK> wouldn't make well lit windows in a <UNK> anyone after this the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn <UNK> truly steals these episodes showing us what an interesting companion could've been like she could also act instead we get the annoying and politically correct captain jack as the new companion the conclusion was a little <UNK> but sufficient the pacing and script improved with a reasonably good storyline making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing br br boom town i have to be honest except for a few examples i had been so <UNK> by the current series that upon seeing the trailer for another episode i gave up and didn't subject myself to the torture br br bad wolf reality tv arguably the worst <UNK> of the modern media is basically used as the premise there's no subtlety whatsoever do we get any interesting social commentary as in the likes of the running man or truman show no of course not this in an <UNK> episode so they're basically here to <UNK> try and pull in the audience of said shows once again logic goes out the window as we're placed 200 000 something years in the future <UNK> tries <UNK> to shoe horn in some <UNK> story here with no relevance other than it's own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end they make empty <UNK> and the doctor <UNK> once more like an idiot for the climax faster paced for the most part than other efforts this has one or two interesting moments otherwise another <UNK> <UNK> br br the <UNK> of the ways the big finale more of a <UNK> <UNK> literally all of the <UNK> menace set up in is brought crashing down as they become rather pathetic so many plot holes <UNK> this episode with typically poor <UNK> <UNK> want to <UNK> humans as <UNK> but then <UNK> entire <UNK> <UNK> can <UNK> said <UNK> but not destroy the <UNK> in space the <UNK> is now <UNK> and can land anywhere even over people so they can be saved in it this ability can't be used to easily destroy the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> can <UNK> entire <UNK> but don't just <UNK> satellite 5 to destroy the doctor and instead let him play around the doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions after <UNK> his whole species to try and eliminate the <UNK> these and many other holes aside we are treated to the <UNK> <UNK> ex <UNK> solution ever conceived joined with a near pointless story arc br br so what can we say about the new series all in all br br would this have gained a second series if it were anything other than doctor who with <UNK> behind it would most of the episodes have been seen as anything other than un original and forgettable if they were anything other than doctor who and had name attached i think not br br some people would have us think we can't say anything against <UNK> since we owe him for bringing doctor who back to our screens however this at the expense of good characters and stories personally i'd rather not have a poorly planned ill conceived product <UNK> out at that price i'd rather wait till someone could come along and make a genuine effort for the most part this is the kind of <UNK> rubbish that gives sf a bad name <UNK> what is otherwise the most creative genre
<START> i i don't know where to begin dragon hunt might just be the worst film in cinematic history even <UNK> was better than this as it was intentionally bad <UNK> no it had <UNK> value and was technically a well made film but dragon hunt takes the cake and eats it then <UNK> it back up and <UNK> it to a homeless man it's that much of a travesty br br the acting if it can even be called that is rough it doesn't have the charm of improvised acting so it must be scripted but it's <UNK> with an almost <UNK> tone of poor quality several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors or basically those people on screen either <UNK> being connected to this film or were thinking of a particularly humorous joke from saturday night live which they had watched prior to getting in front of the camera i could write another three <UNK> on the quality of acting in this film but you and i both don't want to hear it br br the make up and special effects which with most films is the only good thing was laughably bad the antagonist whose name is so ridiculous i can't remember it has a <UNK> glued to the top of his head yeah glued to his head and you can tell it's glued on too if you look at the spot where it meets his skull you can see a plastic strip not unlike the ones on fake <UNK> thankfully he's pretty much the only example of make up no <UNK> in the film br br there's also some terrible character development to put it lightly the women who are strangely rough handled by the supposedly <UNK> <UNK> brothers and i mean they are really pushed around are not only ugly but gasp they don't know what they're doing in one scene they turn on their apparent lovers join up with the even <UNK> bad guy and then <UNK> some coke apparently they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine because they started shaking and laughing even before all of it went up their <UNK> great timing girls plus they wear some truly horrible stuff clothes that belong solely in the late 80s and early 90s br br overall this movie this film this waste of film i should say is also a waste of time watching it will hurt you and will require the suspension of not only your belief but also of your entire brain if you want to get stoned with your friends and have some good laughs see if you can get this film you'll probably have to <UNK> it otherwise don't even think about it hope i was helpful
<START> i am a pretty much a sucker for those ghost hunter shows from the cheesy <UNK> like discovery <UNK> the haunting to scooby doo reality shows like ghost hunters when i saw <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> state i knew i was going to watch especially when <UNK> state was <UNK> against a weak monday night football game br br by the end of the pilot of <UNK> state when the main character in this reality dance macabre gives a creepy kid a bottle of max von <UNK> holy water and <UNK> him by telling this boy that he too had a <UNK> bad experience as a child with things that came out of the closet and the catholic church gave him a holy water to <UNK> off the things coming out of the closet i knew i should have given monday night football another shot br br the <UNK> behind <UNK> state is a group of penn state students all got together and started their own ghost hunting club or society or super adventure club and they run around <UNK> <UNK> the most terrible <UNK> and the lost plot to an m night movie br br the they is kind of a <UNK> really <UNK> state revolves around a lion named ryan who would probably be running penn <UNK> <UNK> anime convention if it wasn't for this show he is often accompanied on <UNK> by hot co <UNK> and some other people seen in the credits but rarely caught on camera hey are they ghosts too br br this is ryan show <UNK> state is his vehicle as we like to say in the <UNK> and oh what a dull ride in a vehicle he can be br br did i mention ryan <UNK> the entire episode of <UNK> state in a star date less director's <UNK> voice over almost immediately that gets annoying because the obvious intention is to give <UNK> ghost hunting some <UNK> but his <UNK> <UNK> does nothing but <UNK> <UNK> and laughs seriously every serious <UNK> sounds like the radio <UNK> from a call of duty video game br br the <UNK> the plot that each episode revolves around are interesting on the surface no haunted or <UNK> to be found in <UNK> state this is a show about <UNK> the unknown like a good catholic boy and by god they give you stuff to fear br br small children are <UNK> things <UNK> in the dark voices encourage the living to kill and the <UNK> in me <UNK> my hands of the two episodes i watched each <UNK> around violent nasty <UNK> tied to violent nasty deaths br br maybe br br maybe not br br everything in <UNK> state is short handed into half hour dog the bounty er ghost hunter <UNK> every time there is an interesting shred of evidence the murder of a family in a <UNK> in the <UNK> the proof is <UNK> in front of the viewer like a con artist trying to convince you a stack of papers currently under your nose is proof of that ten million coming from <UNK> and then <UNK> away before you can get a good <UNK> br br at least with sci fi <UNK> ghost hunters there is a somewhat over <UNK> need to <UNK> out every possible shred of evidence and present it to the viewer that could be a rat <UNK> cold spots in a house and <UNK> that even the ghost hunters themselves <UNK> as dust it is a sort of scooby doo like approach that makes ghost hunters almost believable br br whereas <UNK> state claims to have but gives the viewer a ten second video clip of a wave file in garage band with no audio yep see an <UNK> right people are claiming to see dark figures in the basement well we will just go and see about that while leaving the night vision camera on an enthralling <UNK> shot of the living room ryan the <UNK> leader of this pack of penn state <UNK> is claiming to see visions of a <UNK> name he knows and that might be involved in a <UNK> haunting but he can't tell us the audience or his team of out because he can't you never say a <UNK> name out loud ryan informs the wide eyed co ed who dare <UNK> br br well how very very convenient for you especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind br br <UNK> state is all turn and no <UNK> the audience gets told what is supposedly happening but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing dead people not even grainy video of a chair moving or a black blob running between prison cells nothing you are just told what happened by ryan in yet another mechanical voice over br br if you are going to try and <UNK> me dress it up a little if you are trying to <UNK> me show me a <UNK> or a blob and have the fat chick who works days at hot topic tell me why that black <UNK> is really the spirit of an <UNK> murderer and if you want to make me watch a ghost hunting show give me something besides <UNK> out <UNK> warren by the second episode br br <UNK> state is weak <UNK> not really worth watching unless you are hard up for tv time or just have that thin of a dvd collection or unless you want to know what really happened in that closet with the holy water
<START> this <UNK> drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious african <UNK> who decide to <UNK> leave their families by <UNK> away on an ship they think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in new york to send for their families unfortunately for them the ship that they <UNK> is a <UNK> russian <UNK> which has already been heavily <UNK> at a previous <UNK> for <UNK> the captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line the group of blacks begin their harrowing voyage in the <UNK> hold and are eventually discovered forced out of hiding and murdered by the ruthless mate an outstanding performance by sean pertwee a few convincingly terrified leader omar <UNK> among them manage to <UNK> escape and are mercilessly pursued through the ship with their lives <UNK> if they are caught altogether a riveting film which will have audiences biting their nails and <UNK> their teeth wondering how such dire events could take place in modern civilization
<START> man am i <UNK> i can leave <UNK> for this 10 minutes romp i love it br br after not seeing it in years i happened upon it the other day and watched it over and over br br <UNK> shaking your <UNK> and a rock and roll <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> are freaking classic lines br br the art is delightfully raw the dialog sparse and wonderful just find it and love it cannot recommend this enough br br thank you high school art teacher mrs for showing us this over and over thank you for letting it be made thank you for showing it for free at the moment at least br br i want a big <UNK> t shirt now i'd love an animation cell but at 00 a pop that won't happen br br find this flick and watch it
<START> the last film that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what insanity is probably like was in dreams in that movie you didn't see insanity you were there now the cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer the opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a <UNK> little boy and the things that catherine <UNK> jennifer lopez sees are first fascinating and then terrifying the things that she later sees in the mind of vincent vincent <UNK> are amazingly imaginative and fascinating most of this stuff has never been seen in film before br br the story of the cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking in fact it is basically the same as the story in the silence of the <UNK> you have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life the only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in the silence of the <UNK> you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim while in the cell you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim however despite the unfortunately weak story the cell completely the genre of the psychological thriller none that have ever been made even come close to it br br also the film had good direction and was extremely well acted vince vaughn delivers another of his <UNK> excellent performances he was even good as norman bates in the pathetic 1998 re make of psycho and even jennifer lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career the other being the great out of sight nothing can be said of the cinematography in the cell to give it sufficient credit it was imaginative and <UNK> done and is <UNK> by anything ever seen in cinematic history the cell is an incredibly well made film and it deserves to be recognized
<START> dead man walking is a piece of incredible filmmaking all the acting is top notch and realistic and the script <UNK> the issue of the death penalty from both sides paying equal homage to both above all this is a deeply moving story of redemption of death with dignity and loss of ego any film that deals this <UNK> and <UNK> with such incredibly difficult subject matter deserves a rating of 10 10 thank you tim robbins
<START> i saw this film before two weeks it's <UNK> boring and totally <UNK> for people that haven't read the original book there are many fact mistakes too actors plays rather poor you must laugh even in the sad moments it was a totally waste of time
<START> the portrayal of the marines in this film is spot on the action scenes are some of the best ever produced in accuracy of content the uniforms and <UNK> of both the u s and german troops were perfect the costumes and <UNK> of the were perfectly accurate as well this film could easily be used to teach of the period and has been used by the <UNK> academy for this purpose the scenes depicting <UNK> shooting and the <UNK> he was using was beautiful <UNK> so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for is a genius
<START> oh my bad clothing worse <UNK> music and the worst david <UNK> the 80's are back with vengeance in <UNK> an american italian co production <UNK> by infamous joe <UNK> on the production side and short <UNK> director thank heavens for small <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> directing <UNK> as a kind of sequel to sam <UNK> evil dead series in italy that was dubbed la <UNK> in there <UNK> delivers some modest gore <UNK> and bad acting br br a mix of ghost story <UNK> and witchcraft the film <UNK> clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix ups slow it's progress to <UNK> ending topped with some serious wtf surprise climax i just love the look on her face surprisingly <UNK> manages to gather some suspense and air of <UNK> in few very few scenes <UNK> for him these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively br br the plus sides are experienced when the gore hits the fan this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic <UNK> and red paint style of the 80's <UNK> gore when things were made 100 hand made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow i could only watch with sadistic glee and few <UNK> all the over the top ways that obnoxious characters and actors got <UNK> and <UNK> one by one i only felt sorry for linda blair who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl woman role ever in his career or so it looks like when checking out his filmography br br well folks not much more to tell and even less to tell home about don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror and speaking of hearts every movie that has david <UNK> getting <UNK> by a <UNK> metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors must have it's one on the right place br br this is my truth what is yours
<START> errol <UNK> <UNK> charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting but historically <UNK> biopic of the famous and some would say infamous general <UNK> that follows his career from his first day at west point through the civil war and out west to the battle at the little big horn all the while <UNK> heads with rival arthur kennedy and <UNK> pretty olivia de <UNK> br br some might say that flynn who delivers a great flamboyant performance as the general is basically playing himself playing <UNK> br br a lavish production that should have been in technicolor well directed by <UNK> walsh they died with their boots on features some truly well staged battle sequences also it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse br br the previous year flynn played <UNK> stuart opposite ronald <UNK> george <UNK> in santa <UNK> trail also with de <UNK> another action packed warner brothers production designed to make you fail history class
<START> for a film made in <UNK> based i guess loosely on carmen the book by <UNK> this film doesn't achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films br br ms as the of the title is very good to look at her fiery dancing <UNK> the screen as is the case with her <UNK> love scene at the beginning of the film br br this is a that aims to please to all <UNK> but a real carmen she is not br br we would like to see ms in other films in which her talent is better used than here
<START> spoilers br br as you may know i have been commenting on a lot of silent short films in the past months now i have no idea why i am commenting on <UNK> willie i guess i was just desperate to comment on anything so i watched this and now i am commenting on it this or course is one of the very first cartoons and i believe it is not the first cartoon with sound br br here is the plot mickey mouse is driving a <UNK> when pete throws him off and he drives it when they stop for <UNK> <UNK> mouse tried to get on but failed miserably mickey gets her up by a <UNK> then a goat eats her sheet of paper with turkey in the straw on it they use the goat to make the song when i say that i mean that they used the goat as a <UNK> mickey plays the animals on the <UNK> for <UNK> to the song then an angry pete throws mickey in a <UNK> room and mickey is forced to <UNK> <UNK> for the rest of the day br br overall this is yet another groundbreaking silent short film i mean this is the third mickey mouse cartoon yes the third also this is not the first cartoon with sound i believe there were two more before this one either way this film is really really groundbreaking was also more violent than he is <UNK> i mean he throws a <UNK> at a bird and may have brutally slaughtered it br br 9 10 br br recommended films plane crazy
<START> i must admit when i first began watching this film i had no clue what was going on so the beginning was a bit confusing for me however that did not <UNK> my enjoyment of the movie the characters reveal themselves to be more complex than they may first appear and that is what makes this a memorable film at first i heard this was a real hollywood movie although it obviously lacks the stereotypical guns and <UNK> element the convincing performances of talented actors such as martin sheen and sam <UNK> more than make up for it i'd rather see a film with more substance than shooting any day
<START> because this is yet another dead one lifeless voice acting second rate animation contrived and un funny songs although the bit sung by the devil would have been worthy of tim <UNK> and a weaker plot than land before time 99 <UNK> on parade br br i have to admit i haven't seen the first film i'm not a big fan of movies involving heaven or dogs especially not in combination still i hope to see the first one soon as there had to be a reason someone would create such a god awful sequel br br if i didn't get this movie for free i wouldn't have it at all for a flick the only good thing in this was the devil 2 10
<START> nothing to watch here it's all been done and better before who cares about this woman <UNK> in every way as a mother as a wife and as a friend in one instant when she could have taken the high road she jumped into re addiction with both feet and held her breath for no better a reason than me too if she wasn't the pretty and young person she portrays on screen but looked more like the real human <UNK> that is represented by our family members neighbors and friends who really suffer from <UNK> we'd change channels in a <UNK> br br this movie starts out at the bottom and goes downhill nothing redeeming no lessons taught nothing uplifting in any way none of the main characters even evoke sympathy let alone empathy well maybe the snake i would have had more fun if i'd shut a door on my hand who needs drivel like this
<START> first off i want to say that i lean liberal on the political scale and i found the movie offensive i managed to watch the whole <UNK> disgrace of a film this movie brings a low to original ideas yes it was original thus my 2 stars instead of 1 are our film writers that <UNK> that they can only come up with this acting was horrible and the characters were unlikeable for the most part the lead lady in the story had no good qualities at all they made her <UNK> into some sort of a bad guy and i did not see that at all maybe i missed something i do not know he was the most down to earth relevant character in the movie i did not shell out any money for this garbage i almost wish <UNK> would come to the rescue of this awful offensive movie and form a protest disgusting thats all i have to say anymore
<START> this film is superb wesley snipes plays blade the vampire hunter with pure class he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make bruce lee proud the movie is a fast paced thrill ride of action and superb stunts the first action scene and last are outstanding and wesley looks like a terminator as he runs around <UNK> out all suck heads the script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too wesley should have done more action films than he has i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all only bruce willis stallone and perhaps tom cruise if he counts as an action star come close also <UNK> as wesley being quality steven <UNK> is also very good as the bad guy it was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to snipes should come across as menacing but he does overall the film is sharp stylish and i hope the <UNK> is done with the same sort of pace
<START> there is a fantastic song in <UNK> 2 that goes on about how <UNK> are usually really nice and fun but <UNK> is a killer i don't recall the song in the first movie but when singer <UNK> sings yeah <UNK> <UNK> is sounds like the 2 may have been added in for this dire sequel the film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad this time the cast including the usually excellent debbie <UNK> have given up trying and director <UNK> <UNK> creates no tension and presents merely a dull and steady film full moon pictures produced this during their phase none of which was very good but none so bad as here
<START> this movie is a hidden gem i can't understand why this movie doesn't get more air time errol and <UNK> parker make for a real attractive and dashing couple and their chemistry is impeccable i really liked the touch of his daughters reference to him as being her robin hood i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys errol flynn it's nice to see errol playing a father as well by all accounts from his very own children he was a very <UNK> and loving father in real life also the supporting cast is wonderful as well you can't go wrong with supporting players such as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> watson <UNK> <UNK> makes a movie that much better from the get go this movie has now become a holiday tradition in my home enjoy
<START> making this short and to the point this movie was great i loved it i actually picked this up at a hollywood video for 3 bucks on vhs and watched it about 5 times in the last couple weeks i'm a big bogart fan and i just <UNK> onto this movie i thought the song was funny and now have it as a ring tone on my phone robert <UNK> is great and pulls off a good bogart his nose is a little big his voice is a bogart columbo mix and he does a few things that are awkward but otherwise he was fantastic and this film was wonderful no one can be a perfect bogart but he was great remember sam <UNK> is a fan of bogart and isn't going to do everything he did he mentions a lot of other movies and does some things that were never part of the real <UNK> character's but it's so funny and hilarious and has a great cast including some beautiful women watch it and have fun
<START> <UNK> is among the finest films ever made and possibly the best of the silent era was a <UNK> of film form and his use of montage editing has influenced films to this day the <UNK> steps massacre footage is as powerful today as it was when first seen over 70 years ago do not pass up the chance to see this film
<START> <UNK> blues is an entertaining engrossing emotionally charged hbo tv movie based on the childhood memories of actor <UNK> <UNK> hudson who also appears in a small role this <UNK> motion picture experience is centered around <UNK> <UNK> childhood guardian rachel <UNK> crosby a strong big hearted black woman who ran a <UNK> house in <UNK> new york during the 1950's <UNK> was a one woman social service organization whose <UNK> house was filled with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> drug <UNK> <UNK> and everyone else in town who needed a hand up instead of a hand out the <UNK> of the story revolves around <UNK> relationship with young <UNK> beautifully played by marcus franklin a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so <UNK> took him in s who has been wasted for years in the <UNK> role of lieutenant van on <UNK> law order turns in a <UNK> performance as <UNK> the neighborhood mother figure whose <UNK> house became a symbol for the <UNK> black folks in her town is nothing short of magnificent in a performance that earned her a golden globe and an emmy award is backed by an impressive all star cast that includes <UNK> howard brilliant and heartbreaking as <UNK> husband louis <UNK> jr <UNK> <UNK> jimmy <UNK> <UNK> macy gray michael k williams jeffrey wright henry simmons patricia ernie hudson <UNK> <UNK> and hill <UNK> as the adult <UNK> colorful and exciting beautifully photographed and <UNK> scored this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels but if for no other reason is worth seeing for the <UNK> starring performance by s who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it
<START> this movie is hilarious the laughs never stop every scene is packed to the limit with hilarious comedy chris <UNK> is a comic genius and spade plays his character to a <UNK> <UNK> was one of the best slap stick comics ever and in this movie as with all his movies we see how much time and energy he devoted to portraying his character the way he saw fit tommy boy is an excellent example of a comedy it always makes me laugh no matter how many times i have seen it before
<START> while caricatures and or references to entertainment industry people or things or even <UNK> of products is usually a <UNK> in shorts like this one they aren't used in <UNK> here most of the individual gags are rather generic as i'm going to give examples there will be spoilers below br br there are only three well technically four there's a quick one at the very end of the cartoon caricatures that i spotted which is kind of low for this type of short though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity they are jack benny as jack bunny leopold and the <UNK> ned sparks as a <UNK> on a can chances are very good that if a <UNK> was involved in a warner brothers short in the 1930s 1940s the caricature used would be ned sparks there are also references to billy <UNK> and a riff on a radio show character called henry <UNK> coming mother a play on superman here and the villain is a take off on king kong that's it for that kind of gag br br the products themselves are mostly generic and the gags are more plays on basic items in unusual situations such as <UNK> coming off of <UNK> of soup to attack the villain as tanks <UNK> soup <UNK> doing the can <UNK> men who turn into using <UNK> for and so on the gags are very good and it's an excellent example of a bob <UNK> cartoon <UNK> had hit his <UNK> as a director by this point and while it isn't anywhere near his best work it's nothing to <UNK> at either this short can be found on looney tunes golden collection <UNK> 3 which is an excellent set that i highly recommend this short itself is also recommended
<START> worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is but you have to see it really p s watch the <UNK>
<START> this movie was physically painful to sit through maybe because like many people my age and younger i grew up with dr seuss and loved his books funny clever whimsical and <UNK> at the same time the cat in the hat sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story and mike <UNK> performance as the cat is mostly <UNK> why the <UNK> belt accent the unfunny <UNK> the inappropriate jokes the <UNK> costume i had to go back and re read the books to see the real problem the books are simple this movie is overblown and way way too long br br you don't expect every kids' movie to be toy story or the iron giant but this one set a new low how could mike myers need the money
<START> jack <UNK> and <UNK> swim to the boat and find a completely wasted <UNK> his traumatic past experience before <UNK> to the island is <UNK> through flashbacks <UNK> plots a plan with jack to surprise the others in case michael is double crossing the group john locke convinces <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> which is <UNK> by mr <UNK> and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen br br this episode is one of the best of the second season unfortunately we lovers of lost can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans in the usa the air date of this episode was 24 may 2006 therefore along this period fans have to wait for the third season in a very suspenseful situation with jack and his group surrounded by the others and finding the truth about michael and the death of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> john locked inside the <UNK> without the intention of pushing the button and mr <UNK> in despair outside the <UNK> i hope the fate of lost be better than angel and its very disappointing conclusion or lack of conclusion after five seasons my vote is ten br br title brazil not available
<START> much praise has been <UNK> upon <UNK> but i don't think it's that good it certainly has a distinctive look but it lacks just about everything else story purpose direction excitement you name it i'm a big sci fi fan and i make it a point to watch all the sci fi shows i can i've almost finished the four seasons of <UNK> and at this point i'm not very satisfied the show does have a few good things most notably <UNK> black who's sadly missing from the first few episodes of season four but they are very few and very far between as a whole the show is marred by a lot of very silly stuff such as fantasy elements rather than sf <UNK> and many many episodes <UNK> in season four are <UNK> messy and very poorly structured and one just feels that it isn't going anywhere it's mostly just non <UNK> adventures with thin long running plot lines which develop <UNK> slowly well sometimes it's a little bit <UNK> but it only lasts for a very few episodes at a time br br effects wise there are a few impressive things here and there <UNK> out in space occasionally but the show seems stuck in the same style of effects which frankly gets old fast outlandish and unconvincing puppet aliens <UNK> the show a great deal and i've come to prefer by far the episodes where regular human looking characters are the focus br br i think the <UNK> are by far the most stylish and intriguing and interesting figures on the show they succeed in being a convincingly alien culture despite their all human appearance there are a few really cool episodes with them <UNK> in the first season where <UNK> <UNK> as a captain and <UNK> and eventually destroys one of their secret <UNK> such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10 but i cannot award the show as a whole more than a 4 rating br br aside from the <UNK> which themselves are somewhat too single <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to be really nuanced the show simply doesn't offer anything important or significant that you need to know or want to see <UNK> it does contain a few good ideas and is not a total loss br br this is just my opinion of course but as a seasoned sci fi fan i think it counts for something and may be of help to others there aren't a lot of good sci fi shows out there but star trek any series and especially the new battlestar galactica are definitely better than <UNK> but if you're a huge fan of mediocre sci fi shows you may well like <UNK> too br br my rating 4 out of 10
<START> all in all don't expect much and you won't be disappointed br br and if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983 this will do that for sure the only reason i gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasons br br 1 michael caine br br 2 the people the sights the culture and the music of brazil br br the movie is almost completely carried by caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of <UNK> it into a <UNK> and semi believable story even joe <UNK> and valerie <UNK> fall short br br michael caine is pure class as always besides being a gifted classical and comic actor caine brings a blend of <UNK> <UNK> and sensitivity to every movie he does the focus of his charm as far back as his role in <UNK> and the reason why he won the academy award for hannah and her sisters 2 years later in this farce he is <UNK> <UNK> funny and vulnerable melancholy and sentimental and besides the jewel that is <UNK> de <UNK> the only reason to not seek out a better form of entertainment br br well maybe a glimpse at the 2 lovely young actresses michelle johnson and <UNK> moore would be a reason but look is all you can do at michelle though her look seems sorely dated there couldn't be a more painful movie experience than watching her try to act most of her dialogue seems <UNK> too acting and looks hold up 100 times better and you could easily transplant her as is into any movie today she doesn't really look much different to be honest ms moore is surely underused especially considering she was the bigger star of the 2 br br save the fact that it is a silly farce at the end i actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this <UNK> situation that it doesn't end friendships nor <UNK> and that an affair even with the <UNK> daughter of your best friend could be forgiven and everyone can move on the injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what <UNK> but all works out for the best a bit unrealistic for sure but surprisingly refreshing hope always is
<START> i always thought the batman returns was a great sequel to batman the story was an interesting one and danny <UNK> christopher walken and micheal keaton gave great performances plus lets face it tim burton was a genius and did the comic book character more justice than joel ever did br br plot <UNK> <UNK> also know as the penguin played by danny <UNK> is abandoned by his parents as child for being <UNK> he uses this as an excuse to <UNK> a sinister plot to <UNK> the first born children of <UNK> with the help of his <UNK> red triangle gang and a very shady <UNK> max played by christopher walken max later makes penguin the mayor of <UNK> <UNK> kyle michelle pfeiffer is pushed out of a window by max and is <UNK> by cats later on she develops cat like qualities and seeks to destroy max and batman her reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained br br opinion batman returns is a classic it has a darker feel in terms of atmosphere tim burton always had a knack for making grim backgrounds look appealing micheal keaton is still sharp as batman danny <UNK> steals the show as <UNK> <UNK> the penguin when you think about it he would have made a better <UNK> for the movie <UNK> than john <UNK> michelle pfeiffer gave <UNK> more personality than <UNK> <UNK> ever could max is one of christopher <UNK> best roles the main reason why i like batman returns is that its fun its not only creative but its also fun something a lot of big budget movies these days sorely lack the batman series goes to the dogs after tim burton decided to do no more you don't believe me look at batman forever and batman and robin thank god that christopher nolan <UNK> life back into the series with batman begins
<START> not a terrible film my 10 year old boy loved it and he would be the target <UNK> so i guess they hit the spot pretty dull for an adult though br br hard to relate to animated <UNK> characters even <UNK> high tech ones br br i thought the choice of the three great virtues of the world was a bit odd <UNK> duty and destiny am i the only one who thinks those sound just a bit <UNK> especially destiny what about freedom <UNK> justice etc br br oh well it will sell <UNK> kind of dull for a movie but not bad for a <UNK> minute <UNK> could have been a lot worse
<START> because mr bean almost never speaks i <UNK> recommend using a dvd player with the teacher holding his finger over the pause play button at the end of any age <UNK> lesson simply <UNK> 5 minutes to <UNK> and playing the dvd <UNK> students to shout out the answers to what's this what will happen what's happening what's wrong or any other question that <UNK> <UNK> from that new <UNK> and <UNK> br br because everyone's looking at the tv normally shy students become vocal because the dvd can be started or stopped at any point it's a perfect filler for the awkward between times while students are leaving and arriving br br i tried other dvds notably tom jerry cartoons and red <UNK> dvds but no others were as good as mister bean at holding <UNK> constant attention
<START> her bit part as a <UNK> in the lurid sequel to the original evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a <UNK> in the works of the french soft core <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and casting <UNK> <UNK> in a leading role in this the rather tame first of a series of that became increasingly <UNK> as <UNK> directors took on in name only sequels br br someone and surely not the english language over warner was also <UNK> an 'a star is <UNK> type <UNK> rise out the results judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous <UNK> of the on screen heroine albeit with a couple of sacrificed as insurance against <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> in the series saw her as an photographer allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe <UNK> adventures but whilst she may well have been one the very most beautiful actresses on the screen at that time any <UNK> talent that may have been there to <UNK> becomes <UNK> in the same sort of <UNK> i have to confess that since i've been in africa i find white skin less appealing that was to be found in the french films br br and in this particular entry much to the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> the essence of on screen <UNK> is as much to be found in <UNK> symbolism <UNK> engine as it is in <UNK> <UNK> although naturally these include generous <UNK> of <UNK> of <UNK> are however guaranteed a continuous stream of <UNK> <UNK> what with such <UNK> of wisdom as i do nothing to be a perfect black she does everything to be a perfect white
<START> yes it is your typical direct to video action flick and of course they do their best to change it up a little bit but fail miraculously snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance that he always does proves that you don't need any talent to star in a film but just sex appeal the worst part is that it didn't cover my bad movie <UNK> which are 1  cheap looking villains 2  perfectly timed one liners 3  intense car chases with massive explosions 4  the hero <UNK> up with the hot chick 5  <UNK> of nude or scantily clad women for no reason ok so i <UNK> it covers those but does so horribly
<START> i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was it tells the story of <UNK> played by errol flynn during and after his <UNK> from <UNK> although i've heard that the film isn't very historically accurate hollywood never is i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway br br i thought errol flynn was brilliant as <UNK> and has since become my favourite actor his acting alongside olivia de <UNK> was brilliant and the ending was fantastic it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp arthur kennedy <UNK> to their deaths on little big horn br br i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my <UNK> favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was br br i'll give this film 10 out of 10
<START> bergman is a sublime comedy director and writer this fact becomes apparent in en i where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep yet very emotional scenes this movie is <UNK> the way for <UNK> later comedies and all of them starring <UNK> as well as eva this is an excellent movie with which to start your bergman experience <UNK> portraying emotional troubles of the young as well as the old the cinematography by martin is astounding for instance in the <UNK> scene in short the movie is a perfect example of a successful comedy with a clarity of depth even <UNK> some of <UNK> own comedies
<START> on the outside this film is better because of vincent <UNK> law order criminal intent but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version in some ways the 1999 version is better because it's more up to date a decade as compared to the 27 years the actors in this film were great like terry <UNK> of <UNK> oz as james <UNK> and tony <UNK> <UNK> monk and gary <UNK> <UNK> ny dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences nut much of the writing remained the same there were stuff that wasn't in the 1982 version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy but in the end this film was just as great at the 1982 one character wise vincent <UNK> playing phil <UNK> was excellent better that paul sorvino it's a match up between <UNK> <UNK> and terry in terms of james as for george i would praise <UNK> and between martin sheen as tom i would say <UNK> wins
<START> eaten alive is a little film that opens in new york city and the <UNK> where tribe men shoot snake <UNK> at a few people then a woman enters the police <UNK> who's trying to find her sister that has disappeared after 6 months sheila is from <UNK> but her accent sucks she is teamed up with an <UNK> who seems to just want her money and seems to say it a lot throughout the film they venture through the amazon only to find a community with people and they find the sister they're confronted by a mad man who has probably seen one too many jim jones <UNK> he will bring them to a better place it could be heaven but no mark and sheila find out later its actually a suicide cult br br why do i call eaten alive a little film ill tell you but when i watched it i was <UNK> through all the run ins with the cannibals robert has a different role than his professor in cannibal holocaust he's a bit annoying once we meet him at an arm wrestling match that looked like russian <UNK> we know hes one tough guy plus the strong <UNK> just makes you cringe and it looked like i saw it somewhere oh the scenes of animals killing each other but the whole film revolves on those scenes its like were actually watching a images of nature with parts of a film but after watching this film i realized that most of the films scenes are taken from other cannibal films even the demise of 2 of the characters well most of the film is that's why i call this a little film when i did found out that scenes were borrowed i felt like throwing the disc across the room this isn't a film just a simple montage of sorts
<START> <UNK> what can one say about this bizarre <UNK> mock u about ed <UNK> cross dressing fantasies well one word that comes to mind is incoherent wood uses raw <UNK> of <UNK> incidental stock footage and then builds a story around them and what a story wood himself stars as <UNK> a regular joe who just happens to enjoy <UNK> around in his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i think what wood wanted was a <UNK> for tolerance for all the of this world by showing that <UNK> is just like all of us underneath only in <UNK> <UNK> ok but then we get this very bizarre montage of some horny devil a chick in bondage some rude pointing people some moore stock footage and finally an <UNK> bela playing some kind of twisted <UNK> <UNK> lugosi is a <UNK> <UNK> out such rubbish as the dragon that at your <UNK> he boys <UNK> and <UNK> um ok bela 8 there is a strange twisted type of wood logic going on here <UNK> he does remind us that 7 out of 10 men wear hats and 7 out of 10 men are bald hmmm must be that alien cross dressing <UNK> <UNK> or glenda stars a <UNK> whatever that is of reliable wood schlock actors including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fuller and timothy farrell and wood manages to <UNK> every bit of wretched amateurish non talent out of each one everybody by now knows <UNK> sad story by the time wood used him for this <UNK> he was probably <UNK> for another fix and needed the <UNK> but even for him this is depth <UNK> one of the <UNK> favorite wood comes with the stock footage <UNK> buffalo scene it is <UNK> demented the <UNK> says de and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on a copy of <UNK> or glenda you won't believe it <UNK>
<START> there are so many positive reviews on return to me that my opinion is not necessary to encourage you to watch this movie however i feel the need to express my admiration for this unique movie bonnie hunt has proved that she is not only an exceptional actress but also a marvelous director and script writer this movie has everything and is full of humanity <UNK> sense of humor don't miss it don't wait any longer and regarding the poor reviews don't pay any attention some viewers forget that this type of movies have to be watched with your heart not only with your eyes if some viewers prefer <UNK> hill or you've got mail that's their mistake for me return to me is a true gem an unforgettable movie
<START> this was made in 2004 for gods sake what happened to our state of the art special effects what happened to our rough around the edges but still good actors the actors in this movie were unbelievably horrible there was one or two that weren't bad but the rest thumbs down couldn't stand listening to the badly written dialogue i mean who the heck wrote that script please don't ever write again special effects don't even get me started on the special effects surely they could have come up with better then fully fake looking green balls of light in the eye <UNK> it looks so old and lame frankly even the <UNK> thing to make look real the teeth they looked so fake and stupid i would almost wipe a tear from my eye in annoyance come i cant believe this was even shown to the public
<START> i have never before voted 1 for a movie on the imdb but for this one i am sorry the scale doesn't go down to 10 br br all i can say this movie is that i saw it in a sneak preview and it was my worst movie experience ever i don't mind the stupid jokes i can live with the silly story but when i see those <UNK> <UNK> main characters with their pseudo foreign speech only germans will understand what i talk about i felt i kind of loathing i never thought i was capable of if they had left them out the thing may actually have been acceptable br br there's not much more to be said about this one you may laugh once or twice because it's so ridiculous but that doesn't make it any better it is definitely not funny br br if you live outside of germany be happy and <UNK> that this awful work will most likely never make it to your cinemas br br if you do live in germany avoid this movie at all costs
<START> one of eastwood's best movies after he had separated himself from the westerns which in themselves were good whenever i had a chance to see any of <UNK> earlier work i would sit in front of the set and watch whatever was on
<START> how is <UNK> <UNK> or brain for dinner let tsui <UNK> tell you in this wonderful and lighthearted comedy about the art of cooking the traditional chinese way br br this movie shares the common structure of an american sports movie but instead of focusing on baseball it centers around cooking which makes it all the more interesting i even think leslie character look a lot like charlie sheen in major league br br this movie also contains a bit of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> vs <UNK> fighting love seeing more of that after the blade and a quite funny in joke concerning a leon <UNK> pop song br br perhaps not the ideal movie for the strict <UNK> though
<START> this movie was awful it centered too much around eddie clark <UNK> brother in law eddie works much better when changing good <UNK> such as in christmas vacation and vacation br br i really don't understand how a movie like this would be given the thumbs up now don't get me wrong i like randy quaid but just felt this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general this movie leaves much to be desired and really needed some bigger name actors
<START> i just love this movie and i have my tv <UNK> to record it when it comes on again on <UNK> 2nd it is a really nice love story with a twist the song that is played at the end of the movie is one you would not think would be a big hit but it is a song that stays in your head and i am now trying to find that song so i can hear it and play it i really have no style of the shows i see or the songs i like to hear and there for makes me pretty open to seeing things new with an open mind i would like to say there is some parts in this movie that is not meant for the whole family to watch this movie does show skin it is kinda like a lifetime movie for women about women i say watch the movie and you may just like it as much as i did
<START> this series is vastly underrated like many others i came upon <UNK> after the series had been cancelled bought season 1 and was surprised to find a <UNK> written drama <UNK> with a balanced mix of suspense romance wit and of course sci fi right off the bat it got a 10 for being the first series or movie to satisfy us how our hero and every alien with whom he comes in contact speaks english okay a few others have the issue but <UNK> did it the best the point is the writers pay close attention to detail to make the show as believable as possible br br with so much bad programming out there it's a shame that balanced entertaining series such as <UNK> don't get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production while we enjoy the four seasons and thankfully the four hour miniseries maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show
<START> this is possibly the worst of the worst i am a huge fan of the horror movie industry and i can believe this movie was allowed to be made the acting was juvenile and the story completely idiotic the camera work was also juvenile one scene that comes to mind is outside a store it is <UNK> and you can see the moon yet the characters all have shadows that cast on the wall there was no street light to be seen one character gets <UNK> at one point yet manages to <UNK> later after <UNK> herself from a post come on it felt like i was watching a middle school play i kept expecting the characters to wave to their family members off camera and mouth hi mom i can only give it two positive comments it ended and it was good for a laugh please do not rent this movie
<START> ok is barney the best children's show of all time of course not but in some of the comments left by other members of imdb you would think it was a multi million dollar production with high class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects well guess what it's barney for god's sake he shows children good behavior good and that it's ok to be who you are for those of you who find him annoying that is because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you to the imdb member who wrote the review on the first page i think you may have gone a little too far did you actually describe a <UNK> street character as down to earth grow up everyone this is a great show for and actually does help children learn in a fun and creative way
<START> if you just want gore and nothing but gore and torture you've come to the right movie if you want a at least a <UNK> of good acting logic story or even a good guy ending go elsewhere br br i couldn't help but to think to myself are those people mentally challenged example after being chased around and seeing other people <UNK> the main actress meets a police officer and <UNK> out her story to the cop with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath that drives in a yellow truck the yellow truck pulls up and the officer just walks to it talks to the guy and the truck drives off without any trouble the actress comes out and says why didn't you arrest him and then the truck runs over the police officer after being <UNK> the truck stops on the road about 20 feet way just standing there while the actress tries to drag the cop away but he's too heavy at the time at that time the truck backs up and runs over the cops leg twice the truck then drives off why didn't the actress get the gun is beyond me which later she shoots the cop in the head twice because the psychopath was about to burn him alive once through the mouth which didn't kill him and twice to finish the job roll eyes right after that she turns away to escape the bathroom which was going to explode and when she climbs near the roof she turns around and the cop isn't there anymore ok br br another example the main actress meets a trapped woman in the bathroom she <UNK> out like a <UNK> of blood on the floor covering about 1 of the room probably more after the main actress goes outside to grab a <UNK> she comes back in and everything is gone they don't explain why everyone keeps disappearing either dumb dumb dumb br br i like horror thriller gore movies but this one was just way too dumb i lost brain cells watching this <UNK> and you shouldn't too
<START> this is classic disney at its live action cartoon best bumbling college student <UNK> <UNK> kurt russell develops a mysterious <UNK> <UNK> formula that actually makes objects disappear and helps him to save his cash <UNK> college further <UNK> reveals that it works amazingly well on humans too startling discovery takes some hilarious new twists when a gang of crooks headed by the notorious a j <UNK> romero steal the formula and attempt to use it for their less than legal activities dazzling special effects and a fast paced story make this lively film a <UNK> case of college comedy i love this movie this movie has always filled me with a sense of wonder and joy a pleasant little comedy that the entire family can enjoy not much violence or sex and absolutely no swearing makes this a movie that parents can watch with their children merely one in a series of kurt russell movies set at college a pleasant little series set in a wholesome america before terrorists when people <UNK> integrity more than cash i highly recommend this movie
<START> i first saw the victim aka out of <UNK> well over 25 years ago when i was very young being a passionate fan of <UNK> since i was a child i loved to watch anything that starred elizabeth <UNK> this movie was and still is a real treat whether you are a fan of miss <UNK> work or not elizabeth always shines in her roles such as her portrayal as the rape victim in a case of rape and as the suspected <UNK> in the legend of <UNK> <UNK> her performance in the victim as kate a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm with a killer after her is brilliant if you like exciting suspenseful thrillers than this is one movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end another great performance well worth mentioning is that of <UNK> who plays the eerie and suspicious <UNK> unfortunately like most of miss <UNK> movies the victim is not available on dvd and i believe that although it was released on vhs some years ago it is a <UNK> these days i was lucky to have taped it when it was aired on television some ten years ago and so have a nice copy of this very good movie a must see
<START> and i have seen a lot of films i saw this in the theatre in 1989 and to this day i remember the sickening urge to walk out if you like john belushi respect his talent or even the <UNK> of the cinema this film has nothing to offer you it is mostly a pathetic showcase for the writer of <UNK> biography bob <UNK> as we see the progression of <UNK> life pass on the screen <UNK> actually shows up in the film like a ghost character the most offensive scene occurs when belushi is dying looks up from his <UNK> to see the author standing above him and he <UNK> <UNK> breathe for me <UNK> there are too many terrible things to mention them all the least of which is the opening that has belushi jumping out of his body bag in the <UNK> and getting into a taxi driven by a guy named angel i'll leave it at that
<START> i've rented this gem several times it's a small yet somehow <UNK> masterpiece taking the viewer from manhattan <UNK> to the beauty of the greek islands john cassavetes on screen marriage to his real life wife gena rowlands is on the rocks he finds meaning in a <UNK> with <UNK> susan sarandon whom he finds in <UNK> while their daughter played in her earliest film role by the <UNK> molly <UNK> falls for the son of the greek <UNK> <UNK> who is <UNK> her mother on a <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> waters meanwhile the immensely talented <UNK> julia plays a living in a cave with his <UNK> he has the <UNK> for molly <UNK> character until confronted by john cassavetes all comes together at the end in a classic closing scene where all is <UNK> <UNK> julia the is seen dancing with his goat this film is full of <UNK> beauty young and old love humor <UNK> and more see it
<START> the brilliant chuck jones master of warner bros cartoon comedy brings us the first <UNK> cartoon an alley cat tired of being pushed around paints himself in the colors of a <UNK> and with a healthy dose of <UNK> turns the tables on his <UNK> then along comes <UNK> and you know the rest many of <UNK> famous gags were born here including his chase hop in which he <UNK> casually along while his prey runs himself to <UNK> br br in my opinion warner bros cartoons became less inventive and more ho hum in the 50s this <UNK> is one of the few examples of mel <UNK> putting his absolutely crazy voice into <UNK> mouth but the <UNK> is the ending where <UNK> is revealed to be an american wolf in clothing a must see classic warner bros
<START> i recently saw this film at a 3 d film festival in hollywood it was in <UNK> 3 d gray glasses not red blue it was so much fun to watch this film with an audience the print was excellent and the 3 d perfect the performances were over the top and that added to the fun the surprise ending that we aren't supposed to share with fellow movie at least according to the movie trailer and poster had people howling with laughter by today's standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3 d complete with <UNK> and bats coming out of the screen this film was an entertaining romp into 50's horror
<START> there is a difference between a film and a movie a film regardless of quality is ready for public <UNK> a movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder in my time as a viewer i have seen may examples of both br br on september 19 i attended a screening of writer director jon <UNK> now having read the script and having seen two different cuts a rough cut and the finished product of this piece i can safely say it is a movie and a student movie at that it is for lack of a better word competent which is to say the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images the visuals are for the most part static and unimpressive and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters i understand that this is a <UNK> budgeted film but some visual flair would have been appreciated and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested br br granted there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written engrossing story and some sharp dialog steven <UNK> sex lies and <UNK> comes immediately to mind this movie however has neither the main story is weak and <UNK> if the main plot is trying to <UNK> his relationship with his father then i feel this movie misses the point what i got out of it is that main <UNK> is to change the face of rock <UNK> roll however we see very little activity on his part to show this while there is one dream sequence at the beginning and an <UNK> performance of his at the end all we seem to get are scenes of listening to music or casually <UNK> a guitar we are simply told that has played a lot of <UNK> but we never see him in full rock out mode next time show don't tell the audience anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this also doesn't look like someone that would have been big in the <UNK> rock era of the 1970's he looks like he'd be more comfortable in the early days of rock <UNK> roll posing as james <UNK> less talented brother in the meantime the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather cliché characters and story threads that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story are brought up and abandoned with <UNK> <UNK> i e the subplot involving <UNK> father if i want to see a film with this kind of <UNK> construction i will consider watching <UNK> dynamite again a film i could barely make it through the first time br br as for the above mentioned dialog scenes i guess i should mention that they are few and extremely far between is it too much to ask for characters who do speak i don't think it is when the characters do speak it is in short choppy sentences <UNK> of oh so insightful questions <UNK> <UNK> or wildly over the top <UNK> these characters simply do not behave like normal rational people working with material like this it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film al <UNK> and that's just because he's doing a poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen a good director or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them however with being so close to the material he simply doesn't see them or if he does he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it'll hurt his creative vision being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a <UNK> manner is the mark of a self indulgent misguided fool just ask rob schneider br br in the end we are left with a poor high school set knock off of <UNK> amazing garden state combined with the equally amazing <UNK> <UNK> two films far more worthy of your time br br now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review allow me to offer this the best i can do is compliment mr for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see however the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply <UNK> visions of <UNK> this is a student movie nothing more nothing less if the movie holds any promise and let's face it at this point it isn't going to come from the acting writing or directing it is this if if the people associated with this film are willing then please learn from this movie file it away and use the lessons learned on your next attempt don't attack your critics or have friend or family do it for you if you are able to do this maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution worthy of being called a film br br i am your audience and i am willing to watch
<START> this movie is amazing you will never laugh harder it's a target no i think it's yes it's a <UNK> this movie gets funnier by the second like when jackie chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene this movie is like <UNK> if you buy or rent this you'll never return it in my opinion i didn't and i haven't found it in a store since i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung fu action flicks if you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value good or even mediocre acting and good special effects this is not that movie if you're looking for laughs and timeless <UNK> pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go with friends popcorn and drinks it's the perfect evening
<START> the last dinosaur is a film that is meant to be fun and exciting it succeeds at doing both br br is a big game hunter who <UNK> big game go figure <UNK> a company he is planning on going on an expedition with a group of people including a photographer named frankie a japanese scientist a guy who works for his company named chuck and an african guy who has aided him on many named <UNK> <UNK> the point is to study what is believed to be <UNK> rex dinosaur that killed the last expedition to the area they will be getting to this <UNK> area taking a <UNK> vehicle that travels underwater called the polar after getting to the area they soon find the <UNK> which tries to shoot but his gun gets <UNK> chuck immediately senses that wanted to hunt the dinosaur all along to add it to his collection of stuffed animals while they were away <UNK> <UNK> their camp and takes the polar away from their camp upon returning the group realizes that they may be in the area longer than they expected and states that he will kill the <UNK> br br the story is great for a science fiction film <UNK> to a <UNK> area is something that seems could really happen the scenery is beautiful and it looks like a place where dinosaurs could still <UNK> br br also i liked the characters in this film is the typical big time hunter who wants to get anything that could be a <UNK> kill also great was <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> who really looks and acts like an african <UNK> jackie is the typical female who causes problems for the group and seems to not belong in the wilderness chuck is the former employee of who has his view of his boss change when he is in the wild with him br br the <UNK> in this film is one of the best in a film it stands a little too up right like godzilla does and it drags its tail so it is a guy in a suit but the suit looks good especially the head and the tail and the <UNK> looks good and very scary i have seen plenty of other films where dinosaur suits look way worse <UNK> in this film sometimes <UNK> a <UNK> sounding like <UNK> and other times <UNK> like king kong from king kong escapes and king kong vs godzilla so a great <UNK> br br there is plenty of action in the last dinosaur of particular note is a great fight between <UNK> and <UNK> also a great scene where <UNK> <UNK> tries to <UNK> the <UNK> there are other great parts that i wont give away you have to see for yourself br br i recommend this film to everyone watch it and you will not be disappointed
<START> i saw this movie on a night i couldn't sleep i loved it and searched to find out when it would be on again probably the best movie i have ever seen at the time and even now the cast is full of people i had never seen before but it seems like a real life story based out of nyc this is the kind of movie that <UNK> the viewing pleasure because you see it hear it and feel it from the moment i saw drinking a beer and watching the game i imagined what it must be like to grow up without a father there are so many lines from this movie i use on a daily basis like the personal alone time in the bathroom drinking a 7 11 <UNK> great film
<START> i watched this after seeing death tunnel this being without question the worst movie i've ever seen in my life so you can understand i went in rolling my eyes a little at seeing the directors and producers of that cinematic gem being in charge of this one first of all i thought the director and producer were the same guy they both are kid rock meets <UNK> the bounty hunter i watched the <UNK> investigation and i am not a <UNK> i think <UNK> is the closest one will ever get to a scientific method in the field that was cool and believable i do believe they are haunted br br but this like the reviewer above mentioned like taking a tour okay a tour fine but the <UNK> and group leaders seemed to make a pretty penny and have a financial investment into whether its haunted or not so when they have <UNK> stories i have to take it with a <UNK> of salt br br as someone else mentioned i could make out whatever they wanted me to see in the picture about 50 of the time the rest of the time i couldn't make out anything also without any context to the photos time of day type of camera <UNK> in the room dust <UNK> which 75 are what the <UNK> are weather and a <UNK> other factors i cant accept them i also cant help thinking that some might be <UNK> br br why would that band keep the numbers from the door <UNK> also during the <UNK> investigation they tried to dig up the death <UNK> of those <UNK> and they only found one which was ruled accidental people didn't want to officially <UNK> suicide yet when one of the <UNK> was mentioning this he said yep and its marked suicide it really felt like the <UNK> to the haunted houses here in october br br i did however like the interviews with the patients and staff from the old hospital s that really gave it a lot of perspective and a personal touch i'm also glad that they mentioned that the staff had the best of intentions and weren't some <UNK> <UNK> they weren't the best methods but its all they had they were desperate to stop the disease
<START> i remember this film it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in <UNK> 75 my dad took me my brother sister to cinema in england i recall the <UNK> and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of <UNK> adams actor dan i think one of the <UNK> gets shot and dies if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know the cinema now has been turned in a <UNK> club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it
<START> i really enjoyed this both times i watched it and both times i walked away thinking about it and the morals of the story a great deal i agree with another reviewer in that the movie is not <UNK> around the sci fi aspects you might expect from an alien on earth movie but rather is about the human condition the characters in the <UNK> hospital provide a great insight in to that and how they go from <UNK> to hope this movie has touches of sadness to humour to sympathy to the final is he or isn't he that final question was well handled and even though some might argue you don't know what happens in the end and the question goes unanswered i feel it is done in far more detail than something like say the movie <UNK> with robert de niro where you never find out what's in the box and feel very frustrated because of it i highly recommend k <UNK> 8 10
<START> while traveling by train a woman <UNK> <UNK> gets out in a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night sooner she finds that a weird lonely jim van der that does not speak her language is the only person in that area and that that was the last train in that track the man her in his house and they develop an unusual <UNK> relationship between them br br de is an overrated boredom with a different but uninteresting story that goes nowhere i like movies off hollywood but this story is too absurd and has no message in the end the sexual tension between the two lead characters is funny in a moment but too repetitive i saw this movie in an old vhs and the image is too dark i do not know whether on dvd the image would be of better quality in the end i was absolutely disappointed with this feature my vote is three br br title brazil o <UNK> da the man of the line
<START> in england we often feel very attached to british films that we like as we are so used to the usual american settings and accents being from london where virtual sexuality is set i felt a strong emotional <UNK> to it the characters in virtual sexuality particularly the females are exactly what british teenagers are like i felt like i was almost in the film i immediately related to the character of alex from the film his <UNK> is quite common in most british teenage boys especially around girls virtual sexuality made me feel really good as its one of the only british films that isn't about gangsters or the middle upper class but about the people who are watching the film average teenagers americans wouldn't really feel the emotional <UNK> but every british teenager should watch it anyone from london will <UNK> the parts of the city from the film it's <UNK> got a special place in my video box
<START> this is a movie that will leave you thinking is he or isn't he while many people have complained about the ambiguous ending it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs this is my interpretation and theory and i believe it is very sound br br first here is the plot one day kevin spacey suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station after attempting to help a woman from <UNK> he is arrested and sent to <UNK> and later transferred to dr mark <UNK> jeff bridges hospital <UNK> talks about how he came from the planet k <UNK> and is here to do a report on earth naturally he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward he befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story in fact he tells them he can take one person back with him soon dr powell is beginning to question insanity and as the plot progresses it is harder and harder to prove wrong br br in the end dr powell learns that is robert porter a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in new mexico when his wife and daughter were murdered claims that he plans to leave for k <UNK> at a precise time on the fifth <UNK> of the murders the time comes and goes and powell finds or robert in a <UNK> state one of the patients is missing and is never found again br br on to my theory is not crazy is from the planet k <UNK> robert porter is a friend of on one of previous visits to earth robert was a child learning about the <UNK> from his father and robert became best friends after the death of his family and robert <UNK> the murderer robert decides to commit suicide is on k <UNK> at the time but he rushes back in of light speed to stop robert so takes over the thinking of robert taking over his body so to speak awhile later still <UNK> <UNK> body comes to new york and is locked up when he leaves for k <UNK> on july 27 he takes <UNK> with him but he must leave <UNK> body behind hence we now have the <UNK> robert br br explanations or clues br br knowledge of the planets around <UNK> as says any child knows about their own system only a few people on earth had an <UNK> about the system and added to their knowledge robert porter while smart and knows his <UNK> was no <UNK> <UNK> br br dr powell feels chosen by it's true could've left the <UNK> at any time but chose not too last words to dr powell are now that you've found robert take care of him was probably staying there to ensure a place for robert when he left br br super human abilities it was a <UNK> fact that had a significantly higher sensitivity to <UNK> and could even see <UNK> <UNK> provides his usual k <UNK> reason but there was no <UNK> reason given it was also mentioned that was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect br br helping the patients throughout the movie you see helping the other patients or the patients discussing <UNK> to a better sane world while the psychologist <UNK> at help dr powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading br br the <UNK> scene the <UNK> is associated with <UNK> home in new mexico which is ironically where <UNK> is does porter associate the <UNK> with the death of his family is her trying to protect <UNK> daughter from that horrible fate i have a different point of view it is assumed that porter had committed suicide in a river indeed under <UNK> is greatly concerned about robert i believe that associates the danger with the water not the <UNK> he is trying to protect the girl from <UNK> death like he did robert br br <UNK> dr powell feels that under <UNK> he can <UNK> true identity but while gives plenty of information he never gives up his persona and claimed <UNK> of k <UNK> br br the security camera why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason br br mysterious <UNK> first disappeared for a few days to his trip up north funny the patients are not at all <UNK> indeed they try to <UNK> the doctor sometimes i think they understand better than the staff naturally the most telling disappearance is of <UNK> the winner of the <UNK> contest not only does she disappear at the <UNK> same time but the only remaining clue is her winning <UNK> br br this is only my humble theory you can conclude what you want you can take dr <UNK> theory that was merely a persona taken up by robert porter to mentally defend himself from reality but that would be giving up too many plot holes
<START> three <UNK> <UNK> the tomb of an ancient <UNK> who after <UNK> jack o a less then menacing <UNK> headed figure to <UNK> said <UNK> continues on his <UNK> vengeance to kill every of the family that <UNK> him that includes young sean kelly and his horror loving family of course it's up to sean to find a way to save the day br br such a stupid low budget b movie the <UNK> atrocious and the plot isn't much better throw in a extremely lame killer a possible <UNK> who laughs way too much a couple of stereotypical cardboard <UNK> couple and you have this film in a nutshell not really worth your time save to see how superbly well <UNK> is aging br br eye candy <UNK> <UNK> is always good for some t a and she doesn't disappoint here with a lengthy shower scene rachel carter also gets topless although it could be a body double br br my grade d
<START> a cut above from the usual straight to video <UNK> <UNK> has enough in the tank to keep it going for the full 90 minutes although you can't help but think of how low former <UNK> comedy golden boy steve <UNK> has <UNK> to be in such a cheap production and playing a hard man too the plot is simple the baddies have stolen a deadly virus and <UNK> and the rest of his <UNK> pals are sent to retrieve it not bad of its kind but not in the same league obviously as the films it is compared too on the cover such as air force one and con air the cast is good though with sean bean <UNK> his brit bad guy character which we have had a glimpse of in such box office <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> games
<START> the first question is how many talentless idiots it takes to screw a movie up answer one is more than enough if he writes the screenplay and directs it the second question is did anyone teach the actors to handle guns properly answer hell no i wonder if <UNK> <UNK> got hit across the face with hot <UNK> because it damn seemed so the third question is how many times we did the super secret government agency conspiracy gets <UNK> from inside plot answer a good couple too many the fourth question is are michael madsen and ron <UNK> overrated answer in this movie sadly yes the fifth question is can a pair of boobs save this movie answer even three <UNK> pair and the director writer didn't br br god if i see the most probably assassin getting her guns ready for a hit and then the morons from prop department give her a completely different set the first bloody thing in the <UNK> movie the suck <UNK> hits the peak time from beginning of the movie to me switching the tv off fifteen minutes just a little bit more than it took me in case of alone in the dark
<START> this short subject is a remake of the three <UNK> 1942 film what's the <UNK> about the <UNK> trip to mexico and their <UNK> adventures although the original short was made during the <UNK> peak period it isn't that memorable and i believe it is one of the more mediocre films with curly howard br br having established that i believe that sappy <UNK> is just <UNK> awful like all the other shorts with joe <UNK> moe and larry never should have hired <UNK> because his whiny almost feminine character was completely wrong for the violent comedy of the stooges his 16 films with moe and larry marked the <UNK> for the team and those shorts are embarrassing to watch this short was released in 1959 and was the <UNK> <UNK> song with columbia maybe <UNK> was a nice guy but he was all wrong as the third <UNK> br br i won't review any more <UNK> shorts because i would just be giving the same <UNK> negative review over and over do yourself a big favor and don't watch this instead try to catch in the sweet pie and pie or <UNK>
<START> this film is like a <UNK> until it gets to musical numbers which are like mind f <UNK> but <UNK> like a mind <UNK> mind <UNK> the depressing vibe given from the speed <UNK> of the characters can be pretty kill yourself awesome until you get to the musical numbers it's a great film optimistic weird manic <UNK> <UNK> that's it this movie is <UNK> anyway see it it's a musical with depth if you like the existential <UNK> like the stranger or waiting for <UNK> then your probably get a real kick out of this one i had to get the dvd through amazon com for like 12 oh the songs rock well they rock but they aren't rock there like jazz broadway but by grace <UNK> i can't find the soundtrack nowhere but i wanna the songs are great the dances are so fun
<START> to be fair i couldn't bear to watch this movie all the way thru so i have no idea if it suddenly gets better half way thru the film but the first 30 minutes or so are amongst the worst i have seen in a while children under twelve might get a kick out of the poorly written acted and directed slapstick humor but adults in full control of all their <UNK> should steer clear of this stinker
<START> okay maybe this movie not a revolution but it a very good piece of entertainment and it's <UNK> <UNK> variation of alicia <UNK> clueless or cameron there's something about mary br br <UNK> plays a femme fatale which just wants to have an own house and all kinds of material comfort in it and well she does everything to get just that even crimes many crimes and she drops every boyfriend which doesn't <UNK> to get these things additionally she actually doesn't mind to have some additional lovers beside her current boyfriend br br this movie is even funnier to watch if one knows that <UNK> is actually of zodiac sign cancer and cancer are reported to be very domestic so the character <UNK> played here is actually a parody of a cancer br br i was alone in cinema when i watched this one that was quite comfortable because i could laugh as loud as i wished all the time but it also felt strange as if nobody was actually interested in this movie br br i myself liked it very much the acting was between very good to excellent especially the main actors where brilliant there where enough jokes many of the black kind and good dialogues br br this is a trash movie and it is full of black humor if you like this kind of movies try this one
<START> a friend and i went to see this movie we have opposite opinions about but after watching this movie we agree on the following the <UNK> way to have an inaccurate documentary is to make it about a foreign country in which you were not present when the events happened no matter how talented or how much you <UNK> in the film if you are truly looking to learn about another countries history watch something made by natives of that country otherwise you won't be able step away from your bubble and those who try to force their views and opinions about something to which they don't belong are really <UNK> their power to make it even worse the director chose to not talk about the embarrassing involvement of the cia with regime she decides to <UNK> dealing with the only subject for witch her country has much to explain to <UNK> but this is not surprising because both the director and the cia are <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> by trying to affect the <UNK> <UNK> at very different levels of course br br if the director was really interested in helping <UNK> she would have <UNK> a native to make the documentary in any case there are numerous <UNK> made documentaries films and books about the subject such include <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> las <UNK> de la etc the director of the fall of should spend her time <UNK> the numerous problems in her own country or at least the involvement of her country in the matters of other nations
<START> this is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest in many ways it's like a 50s version of valley of the dolls with much of the <UNK> and <UNK> of valley polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959 like this later film both are about three young ladies who are on the fast track to success though this time it's in the <UNK> world instead of the entertainment industry though one of the ladies in the best of everything does have aspirations of broadway br br the film begins with hope lange coming into the company for her first day of work she's assigned to tough as nails boss joan crawford who is appearing in her first supporting role in decades despite how nasty crawford seems lange is determined not to give in to make it in this job and over time she quickly moves up the ranks from secretary to editor at the same time her two new roommates also try to move up the ranks one through the stage and one through a relationship with a rich playboy like valley of the dolls all of them have their ups and downs mostly downs but by the end of the film there is some hope that at least some of them will make it <UNK> and <UNK> nevertheless br br in this film men are mostly pigs the only guy who seems decent is played by stephen <UNK> so naturally hope lange <UNK> him for a <UNK> do well ex boyfriend as for the guys played by veteran character actor brian and the rest they are sexist <UNK> and eventually you understand how crawford became so bitter and nasty br br this film has it all adultery <UNK> sex abortion etc and is certainly not an artistic triumph however thanks to excellent production values and a <UNK> script this one is a joy to watch just don't expect shakespeare
<START> i suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is br br i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality when shows like search <UNK> and man were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future adventure and technology br br you got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them the only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it they didn't get to take your show and add in their own comments over it br br i did not know what this concept of a pilot was i saw the movie and was hoping thru out that <UNK> would get home did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hours br br back then would i understood what so many people hate about the movie now i doubt it because i don't remember it as such do i understand now not really for to understand the story one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie br br if one is watching as an american it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police state but if one is a subject in that state then <UNK> could be expected and security can be less when things are suppose to be perfect perfect to an extreme degree perfect that one is not suppose to doubt then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of order br br the subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere or that the police state values knowledge to some extent for they are careful about how they control or harm their brain power br br these days one is likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it so much of the suspense surprise is lost but the <UNK> between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the <UNK> biggest fear is that he has crashed in the <UNK> one gets quite a distance into the movie before it becomes apparent that such a possibility is the least of his concerns br br this is the primary difference between the stranger and <UNK> the latter can be considered timeless since any comments it has about the <UNK> are <UNK> minor and lost early on in the movie in the former those <UNK> are through out the movie supposedly directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after <UNK> br br all that said despite my fond memory for the movie it is rather easy to see that it would not have made it as a series each week <UNK> would make friends <UNK> would chase <UNK> would get away eventually society would get rid of him someone else would pick up the chase a <UNK> would develop there might be a <UNK> at something new such as perhaps another crew member from mission showing up but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going br br if one goes in with the knives that others have used to slash the movie odds are they will slash it as well but if one remembers that this was made during the cold war and what fears and <UNK> of the other side were during that time of what the popular environment contained for the viewer then they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it
<START> i can't see how a film of this quality only gets an average of 5 7 from imdb voters it's a classic australian production that resembles recent efforts such as love and other <UNK> the sugar factory occasional coarse language russian doll <UNK> people the secret life of us la <UNK> strange planet fresh air dust off the wings doing time for <UNK> <UNK> etc as a 19 year old <UNK> student <UNK> in perhaps his best role yet on par with at least with a bored over religious mother gets the shock of his life when she decides to <UNK> in the same course as him and before you go thinking another goofy movie it's not there's some real substance here sure it's a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular but then they are rather simplistic under all that philosophical <UNK> <UNK> aren't they and maybe the study of <UNK> character is a little muddled at times but the film is bright funny and has some important messages the principle cast is terrific cusack and <UNK> are wonderful and rose <UNK> see her also in the <UNK> of 1967 is so underrated it's not funny she's a beautiful fresh confident actor who deserves every <UNK> she receives i gave my mother frank 8 10
<START> never i have seen a movie so terrible that i've gone insane it was a huge waste of time seeing this crappy film there are a lot of things i hate about this movie the songs is so terrible yet a little bit catchy i hit my head on the wall especially from the song is gonna sue the pants out of which i hit 10 times <UNK> the character design and that evil greedy and bitchy cousin mel br br i cannot stand her for one second she has got to be one of the most person i've seen even though i kinda like her southern voice br br the only bright side is that austin bucks is played by the person who is the voice of <UNK> snake from metal gear solid br br i would not recommended to people to watch for the holidays as it was a huge disgrace for x <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> to the local sport team involves taking the <UNK> out to the corn fields and guess what there is a scarecrow murdering people there only one of the <UNK> survive but falls into a coma due to <UNK> meanwhile the scarecrow starts to kill all of the involved people one by one whats the scarecrows secret will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all this is a low budget movie and it shows sound is ok but picture is really corny the plot script really sucks and is quite pathetic and non logical the acting is really bad and sometimes just laughable cant really say much about the special effects cause there aren't that many but the few there is <UNK> from bad to ok for a low budget that is there is some nudity and thats probably the only thing worth to watch in the movie that is if your a horny teenager if not skip the movie all together another complete waste of time and money so don't see it goes for fans too
<START> performance is very disappointing it seems she is trying to make up for her lack of emotion by <UNK> <UNK> why the r rating includes is beyond me there is no nudity or steamy love scenes the plot is old and tired
<START> this was very energetic and well played show i saw it back in 98 and my friends and i still joke about it each time i watch it's always as funny as the first i also love the way that everyone can relate to it in their own particular ways i am very much looking forward to seeing more of john's own scripts and productions br br unfortunately i can't find it anywhere for sale and i've done quite a lot of looking if anyone knows a website or store to refer me to i would very much appreciate it as i am looking for his other live performances as well please send me a message if any of you have info on the subject <UNK>
<START> contain spoilers these guys are total <UNK> they did the lost <UNK> of <UNK> saying <UNK> was a huge friend of jesus and now this this is clearly a <UNK> to destroy a religion and should be illegal they have no proof it could be clearly a setup how can we know and trust these people what if they <UNK> the tomb and said so and at the end they seal the tomb forever so no one can go there investigate how stupid they think we are really are we supposed to trust that they are <UNK> people who really found a tomb of jesus and how can you stab all the christians like this i think this documentary should never be made by a non religious man it can only be made by a christian and i mean the direction and script it should be illegal for jews to film a christian related documentary specially if the documentary makes <UNK> about jesus not being a son of god who <UNK> nothing against this they could be <UNK> or <UNK> anything but catholic br br to me this is a total <UNK> a pure documentary <UNK> they sealed the tomb so people wouldn't think about checking things out this documentary is a total failure how stupid they think the christian people are and what about the lost pages of <UNK> that was a total <UNK> as well they seriously said at the end something like we know a few people that could do a fake <UNK> just like these and no one would know it was a fake oh my god they just said it dude we might have done these this kind of documentary should be illegal it is a stabbing on all christians and <UNK> they should be behind bars i am not a fanatic i am an ex jew now but i have and will always respect others people religion the part when israel orders the tomb to be sealed forever was precious precious
<START> despite a great soundtrack and the presence of the ever amazing <UNK> and woods this is another one of those moronic comedies where new york throws itself at the hero in an effort by the writer and or director to show what a zany place it is yeah there's some other stuff in the movie that sucks too but that's what's important the trend for new york independent filmmakers seems to be i don't need to be talented i have new york okay to be fair the movie has its moments the flashback bit about why the one guy is called wacky jack was pretty amusing the script isn't a story or a plot it's a bunch of not good scenes tied to each other by featuring the same character br br one of the worst things is that there's no motive behind what the characters do uncle sam has the kid deliver the drugs why if its so important why didn't sam do it himself then the lead character lies his ass off in scene after scene with absolutely nothing to gain from lying the guy falls in love with a flight attendant with neither of them having any reason to fall in love the characters are a bunch of <UNK> for the writer to move around to see if he can get anything zany to happen br br if you're easily amused or like watching bad indie movies because they make you feel smarter than watching bad mainstream movies watch this if you want to see what a good light hearted crime movie looks like watch <UNK> <UNK> brother kicked in the head is the perfect example of why so many people hate offbeat indie movies a lot of them suck and a note to the director don't be afraid to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or entertain the audience now and then being boring doesn't make you a better filmmaker than the ones who can interest me
<START> how any of you gave this more than 2 stars <UNK> me i made an account on imdb just to comment on this <UNK> p film the acting is <UNK> p and the plot is <UNK> p it would deserve no stars at all if it weren't for the descent soundtrack and yet there are still some outrageously <UNK> tracks in there too most notably the ones featuring the and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the scenes that they haunt and quality cinematography the dialog and plot are about as complex as that of a dr book these actors are horrible i am actually watching this movie right now and with every word am stunned you all <UNK> this the only reason i didn't turn the movie off was because i have gotten wrapped up in creating an account on imdb and <UNK> this review i dig mainstream films i dig silly stupid films i dig retro indie films and nearly any other type genre if carried out well my brother convinced me to rent this because he said he heard it was good and he generally has great taste in movies from the moment he told me the title i looked at him like he was crazy i'm having a tough time ending this rant because there is just so much badness to talk about the only way i can <UNK> the good ratings on here is that you guys were paid to give this movie high ratings it is so poorly done and no where close to dramatic artsy complex well written well <UNK> or even bearable if this was the final product of my hard directorial work i would be to embarrassed to release it to the public so i don't even feel sorry for the director if he reads this what the hell were you thinking guy
<START> our america is multi cultural with so many sub cultures this movie simply tells a story of a <UNK> in time within one of these sub cultures it is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world generally a good movie it entertained <UNK> thought and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise right in our own back yard should be seen by all having lived in the u s all my life i had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens this movie helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state the obvious conclusion if this is really for real then what else is out there that we know nothing of
<START> <UNK> duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree <UNK> that it's rabbit season but you guessed it it's really duck season elmer <UNK> appears he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag br br he's even dumber than that when bugs bunny <UNK> up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet this is more than <UNK> can stand he emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit bugs bunny shoot him now <UNK> screams you be quiet says bugs he doesn't have to shoot you now <UNK> insists that he does br br after <UNK> returns his <UNK> off <UNK> to his head he is doomed to more arguments infected with <UNK> trouble which all have the same result later bugs dresses as a sexy woman and asks elmer for a duck dinner will <UNK> get the last laugh ha ha very funny ha ha ha br br what's funny about this classic cartoon bug in fright as <UNK> screams in his face bugs bunny says yes while dripping with self satisfaction <UNK> duck stands on demanding to be shot elmer <UNK> <UNK> that he can't wait any <UNK> sees bugs in women's clothes and makes that little noise with his tongue carl <UNK> plays you must have been a beautiful baby during drag act <UNK> demands sheer honesty out of bugs <UNK> plays home sweet home at an <UNK> appropriate moment <UNK> tells bugs he's br br in five words every detail of this film br br note this short is available on looney tunes golden collection volume one disc 1
<START> i didn't expect much from this movie it was just one of those movies i thought i'd just watch because it was on television i certainly <UNK> this movie br br it's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and <UNK> to his friends i was very happy with the acting they had the characters played well it was a particularly great scene when dennis hopper and john daniel <UNK> are talking to each other about why john killed jamie it's <UNK> to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why but had loved the girl he had killed felt <UNK> while john felt nothing hell he was proud of what he'd done it really makes you think about people keanu reeves did a great job as matt and <UNK> <UNK> was good it's weird to see her as a <UNK> in <UNK> and her as <UNK> every actor did great at acting it was real nice for a change it was a great movie and i would definitely say i recommend it
<START> all those who criticize the sopranos for its stereotypical portrayals of italians haven't seen anything until they've gotten a good look at this <UNK> gangster film which focuses on a family so irritating you almost want them to be <UNK> out br br the parents in this clan aren't so bad but their two little boys one a total brat one <UNK> <UNK> poo are <UNK> while their older good for nothing son and <UNK> daughter <UNK> compete for audience contempt but the <UNK> of them all is well <UNK> as played by <UNK> sale in full mode he serves as the films moral <UNK> throwing in lots of <UNK> about <UNK> dirty <UNK> for good measure if these are the good guys it's no wonder the actors of that era who played baddies became the big stars br br not that there are any stellar performances to be found among the criminal actors but they at least <UNK> themselves better than the grating family the incompetent police officers aren't even given enough screen time to bring things down any further only walter huston as the district attorney <UNK> the cliché <UNK> material in his <UNK> attempts to breathe some <UNK> into these <UNK> br br the film deserves credit for being an early entry in what would prove to be a very popular <UNK> the witness formula and it doesn't <UNK> in its depiction of the hard bitten underworld lifestyle but there are quite simply better and less <UNK> examples in the genre
<START> good movie acting was terrific especially from and very well directed br br it also shows how was <UNK> by the <UNK> u s a and united nations and how they <UNK> him a to scare people as they did to all the honest true african leaders like and many others it shows how western countries <UNK> democracy while they have something else on the back of their minds it is a story of injustice struggle and brutality br br it shows how couldn't control his people yes they were his people but before we put the blame on him was he getting enough if any from the people he <UNK> in his government like or his colleague had other things in their minds to find out go and see the movie certainly did went on to <UNK> the country for the next 35 <UNK> before he was <UNK> and <UNK> the country died a <UNK> br br some flaws there was too little explanation how the man got to rise in the first place also there should have been more explanation about the country <UNK> after independence now known as <UNK> republic of <UNK> <UNK> known as <UNK> when it was under there should have been an explanation why he couldn't keep the second largest country in africa in one piece and also what was going on with and just heads up if you gonna watch the movie was controlling the region which if i am not mistaken is the number one <UNK> producer in the world br br in all it is a good movie to see you will learn something new about africa it's leaders and it's people and probably will open your eyes why this continent is ridden with wars
<START> i am an <UNK> with little love for certain aspects of christian <UNK> br br that said this movie is <UNK> vile and transparent it only works on the level of the currently <UNK> and tired hatred <UNK> of white american christian <UNK> had this movie been made about a <UNK> jewish or muslim family or even a black christian family the outrage would have been <UNK> and the movie would have been <UNK> <UNK> in all circles as it stands though it's ok and <UNK> because white christian <UNK> remain one of the last acceptable targets for garbage such as this br br and garbage it truly is if you want to see a quality film of a similar bent find and watch or review <UNK> nothing good was done in the king that wasn't done better decades ago in that masterful film br br as other reviewers note the characters are almost completely undeveloped in the king the lines are a <UNK> the cinematography is lackluster we've seen the tale of the <UNK> done better 100 times this movie doesn't cut it for thoughtful viewers
<START> this is a funny movie there's not a lot of those ok the plot is a bit disturbing but very original a teen trying to get even with dad because he hasn't been around and almost sending him to jail because she lie to impress an older boy how could that not be funny plus it not the typical movie featuring teens first remake i've seen that is better than the original the only problem with both gerard depardieu with another actor this would be a perfect 10 because he plays all rolls the same way sucks another problem it's all the women melting over him that's not remotely believable he is not attractive y had a rubber <UNK> that was better looking than him come on
<START> this is awful you just <UNK> believe it the score is annoying the filming is bad for example sometimes you see the shadow of the cameraman appearing on some actors faces the quality of the movie is ultra bad seems like it was made in the it's terrible there is a bit of blood in the beginning and through the movie but always too dark filmed no gore no effects the director made some better one like blood <UNK> but out there there is a following of the man 'cause searching to find this cheap flick isn't that hard but you have to pay hard earned cash for it surely this will get in my top ten of worst <UNK> ever i don't know if i would call it horror there is too much talking you will get <UNK> after watching it
<START> this is an excellent anderson production worth comparing with the best episodes of <UNK> or space 1999 first series of course it isn't some <UNK> <UNK> or star wars pseudo <UNK> tripe fest but a subtle movie that has a slow pace yet it conveys the creepy eerie and uncanny atmosphere of the best anderson productions for lovers of sci fi <UNK> voice is absolutely awful <UNK> are good for this kind of product and acting is good as well two <UNK> visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but crash land home instead or do they ah every now and then <UNK> as the next gadget next <UNK> but still to happen 40 years later the device of <UNK> twin planet on the opposite side of the sun also returns in gamera <UNK> 1969 so who copied whom
<START> well me <UNK> i haven't seen a home movie this bad since the abysmal 13 seconds or half <UNK> someone should take away this guy's <UNK> <UNK> this movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for 20 doesn't necessarily mean you should br br i remember that one of the things that robert rodriguez wrote in his book rebel without a crew was that when you set out to make a no budget feature you have to use whatever <UNK> you have at your <UNK> rodriguez says that you should take an <UNK> of all the locations and props that you can beg steal and borrow from your friends robert <UNK> was friends with the mayor of some town in mexico so the mayor let him shoot all over for free what you got in el <UNK> was a movie that looked like it cost much more than the actual budget br br i'm sure that the director of this movie has a copy of that book and he took that advice to heart in this case he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a <UNK> where they put on a haunted house every year seems like a pretty good location for a scary movie but it's hard to keep a <UNK> interesting for 90 minutes not a single installment of the children of the corn series spent more than a few minutes in the <UNK> hitchcock only spent about ten minutes in one in north by <UNK> take a hint <UNK> <UNK> don't make for riveting cinema it would have been good if the director would have had more friends with more locations because this thing gets pretty tedious after the first 15 minutes this movie looks like it cost about 30 or whatever it cost in admission to the <UNK> <UNK> br br apparently he couldn't even find anyone to act in his movie so he cast himself big mistake here's a thought if you really want to make a movie get an actor so as far as <UNK> go it seems like the <UNK> <UNK> is the only thing the poor guy had maybe he thought that was enough in fact i'm going to go out on a <UNK> and say that i know he thought that was enough because the movie before it captured the <UNK> honor of being the sequel to dark <UNK> was called simply the <UNK> the movie maybe this he's already planning the <UNK> the musical or even the <UNK> the mini series br br our jack of all <UNK> and yes the master of nothing part of that saying is definitely appropriate here plays a psychic dad who can tell when bad things are going to happen think of the character from the dead zone but not anywhere near as good an actor as christopher walken or even anthony michael hall psychic dad has a <UNK> that his two daughters who are at the corn <UNK> with mom are going to be killed he rushes to save them from that point on the whole movie is spent watching dad run around in a <UNK> looking for his two daughters he finds the two little girl ghosts from the shining and he helps solve the mystery of their murder br br shot on a 200 <UNK> the director cast himself edited on <UNK> improvised story if that's not enough to keep you away from this a <UNK> corny catastrophe consider this as a final warning the whole movie takes place in a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> here's <UNK> <UNK> tip on how to save some money and still feel like you've seen this movie next time you see a <UNK> stop the car take a <UNK> and go run around in there for like 90 minutes
<START> the new voices scare me doesn't have to pass some academy to become emperor again it's the same thing over and over isn't it this is a kids' show right turns into something stupid like an animal he learns a lesson everything is the same david spade and john goodman never returned <UNK> nothing changes 'cause disney won't do anything <UNK> it it's probably one of the most retarded shows ever the first movie was so damn better probably the only person i like such a <UNK> is retarded and retarded er if that's even a word what i meant to say is how could you disney why
<START> this movie is not worth a <UNK> review it just made me decide that i am not going to go see the next tarantino film and i used to love <UNK> films br br not artsy not entertaining not witty not funny nothing just dull and stupid if this movie would have been first it would have also been his last br br tarantino has to get a grip on himself otherwise his next movie is going to be 3 hours of meaningless boring and <UNK> dialog it seems like he has fallen in love with his dialog and his love is blind br br after you finish your there's no reason to sit in a theater anymore
<START> h o t s is not for those that want hardcore porn instead this film is a <UNK> to many 80s era cult classic college frat films like revenge of the <UNK> and <UNK> and a post <UNK> to the world <UNK> animal house a good time if you dig a lot of big <UNK> 70s 80s playboy type chicks and <UNK> slap dick comedy but nothing too notable if you wanna use it as <UNK> material br br h o t s is an <UNK> <UNK> of sexy <UNK> doing battle against the popular and trendy <UNK> girls this one has pranks an aunt <UNK> ish house keeper and even an over <UNK> robot that makes it relatively fun viewing if <UNK> are your thing br br well i like tits as much or probably more as the next guy but with all the sleazy sh t that i've seen i couldn't help but wish for a few hardcore scenes to make this one truly worthwhile i knew it wouldn't happen but i still wish that h o t s had a bit more sex and a bit less <UNK> not quite as notable as <UNK> <UNK> or animal house but worth a look for fans of those types of films 7 10 br br p s and i forgot this one has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> danny <UNK> in probably the best role of his career outside of his reality show
<START> i guess if you like snow <UNK> you may get some enjoyment from watching some nice scenery and some nice tricks but that is all the film has to offer the story line is non existent and any jokes that may have been in the film were not funny even on a sympathy level i also disliked the characters the main actor adam tried his best and for a comedy like this that doesn't have to be much but when surrounded by so many other bad actors he had no hope of making this film good but i shouldn't be too harsh on them for all i know they might have great skill but with a script that i could have written in ten minutes what ever skills they had were ran and <UNK> for fear of appearing in this film my advise is don't watch it i wish i never did
<START> so many great actors so little worth watching but with a script that misses so much of what made the book special i don't hold it against anyone on screen though flawed the book was one of <UNK> only that i truly liked especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town a slightly different world to a <UNK> such as myself i also loved the matter of <UNK> <UNK> of what occurs in the book in the movie characters are given a <UNK> of personality that seemed so stilted the villains and <UNK> are flat and 1 dimensional but as with so much of joel <UNK> work <UNK> and authenticity are <UNK> absent and every point must be delivered via <UNK> to the <UNK> so preachy stilted and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy i wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right
<START> i recently went to a free screening of soap girl where the filmmakers were present before the movie they around laughing taking pictures i was excited to see them dressed up in real life and couldn't wait to see the movie on the big screen br br during the movie the audience with laughter it was clear to me then that they weren't laughing with the picture but at the picture this is purely a grade b movie with no logic behind it throw in some nudity some blood and you have a movie br br after the movie i approached a bunch of the filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this movie they all acted so serious like they were serious filmmakers they each told me something different to make a controversial movie a funny movie an uplifting movie a socially responsible movie everybody mentioned something different it was clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of movie they were making and they were now trying to <UNK> their money by this movie any way they could to get people to see it br br let me warn you don't buy into the hype unless you seriously have nothing else to do it might be worth a film <UNK> time to study how a film should not be made otherwise you are better off saving two hours of your life
<START> this movie <UNK> the early eighties as well as fun i remember watching this movie on hbo when i was little and it was my favorite movie since it was a while ago no one i had ever met knew what it was then about the time my roommate had said she had seen it too and that it was her favorite they started to print it again luckily i have a copy now if anyone ever wants to see the greatest cheesy <UNK> hunt that was probably the beginning ideas of <UNK> for <UNK> this movie is it watcher has to have a serious love for cheesy 80's type movies
<START> bronson took the money and ran with this film he must have house <UNK> like me this low budget film made in mexico reminds me of a few of those italians <UNK> from over <UNK> i heard i do not know if this is true but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes i believe this because why else would they make this film it sure wasn't to make money we had a whole lot of these canadian made <UNK> because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry i wonder if it <UNK> off in the other countries like in canada anyway back to topic this film is poorly made in every aspect i believe they grabbed charles bronson in order to sell this stinker that dead body at the end looks very phony 3 10
<START> this is a great horror movie great plot and a person with a fear of <UNK> will <UNK> love the evil midget this is a must see for any horror fan finally a lower budget movie with decent effects and a great cast highly recommended
<START> an <UNK> major league baseball player is forced to continue his career in japan he <UNK> with a culture that is alien to him an apparently <UNK> manager an attractive japanese woman and his own professional and social <UNK> there is a certain subtle charm that flows through tom performances there is humor sometimes <UNK> understated as in this film sometimes slapstick as in folks but always there seems to be some higher purpose involved throw in an individual full of self doubts who struggles to solve his personal difficulties while holding fast to doing the right thing and you end up with a film both funny as well as thought provoking the cast fits together like a championship team and even if neither cast nor film win awards for their efforts they will leave the viewers feeling good and maybe that's the best results after all you'll want to watch this film more than once and each time mr baseball hits a home run
<START> i have to say this is the worst movie that i have ever watched in my life i cannot believe that i wasted 10 at blockbuster this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane d this movie has terrible actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense well the whole movie doesn't make sense also the part where those men come into the diner department of national <UNK> that happened to be the worst part of the film how dare they say frank sinatra's name in vain also what is up with those glasses when the guy and girl are in the car and she drinks water you can totally tell that she isn't even drinking also what is up with the freaky dinner guy and everyone knows that you don't stab <UNK> you slash them
<START> facts i <UNK> relates the well known at least in spain story of <UNK> a who killed himself helped by some friends after 28 years by his condition judges had denied several times his of active <UNK> br br facts ii <UNK> becomes the movie of the year in spain everyone talks about it politicians singers ordinary people everyone likes it even the <UNK> opinions are <UNK> the film wins a lot of <UNK> golden globe oscar <UNK> and <UNK> catholic community and life lovers a star is born br br facts iii the intensity and the quality of the actors in <UNK> are just amazing and this makes <UNK> wonder how come we have to watch the same bad young actors in the most of spanish latest movies i don't know if <UNK> <UNK> is a great actor or a great <UNK> there's quite a difference between one thing or the other anyway his job is just impressive as well as lola <UNK> or the job of all the guest this is the actors selection the strong point in movie br br facts iv <UNK> <UNK> learned his lesson there at the cinema school there's no doubt about it he's got a <UNK> brain he takes good control of each and every one of the technical aspects he knows what the audiences want he knows how to touch the right <UNK> even if that turns him into such a <UNK> just like spielberg is one of <UNK> br br facts and v if you criticize a movie such as <UNK> it will seem like you have any kind of trouble with the moral issue the story tells about there's a trap in this kind of pictures you have to <UNK> between the movie itself and the moral concepts if you don't like <UNK> list that does not mean that you agree with hitler's philosophy or do you so for me it is a good film and an extraordinary story since it is a real story that makes it much more extraordinary self kind and everything but neutral no matter what <UNK> or <UNK> have said about it those characters that are not in favor of <UNK> come to no good at all 50 hard 50 way too sentimental br br <UNK> <UNK> wouldn't be by no mean in my <UNK> of the best 50's spanish movies of all time nobody has special merits in the story but <UNK> himself he is the movie now <UNK> <UNK> is gonna become the more international spanish director ever maybe he'll go to live to hollywood but some of us would like to watch him filming a simple story without bit final twists without living dead nor dying alive the others is still his best movie br br my rate 7 10
<START> gamera vs was made <UNK> and much of it suffers as a result br br space aliens try to take over earth and are stopped by gamera so they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys the aliens then take control of gamera and get him to attack mankind br br first of all i must say that i really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between gamera and looks like a big <UNK> with a <UNK> he has no energy and does not shoot any <UNK> out but he can close the on top of his head to make a sharp <UNK> so overall this is not a bad monster for gamera to fight and is decent really <UNK> gamera badly by stabbing his <UNK> of his shell with his <UNK> head and i am surprised gamera was able to survive this br br unfortunately gamera vs decided to use footage from previous gamera films to fill time for this film they re show the battles between gamera and and gamera and when the aliens look at past battles however when they show <UNK> battles with they show the battle between gamera and in the city first then they show the final battle between the two after they show re used footage of the final battle between gamera and they show the first battle between gamera and talk about showing the battles in non <UNK> order they did not even need to show the first battle they should have just stopped after they showed the final battle between the two br br another issue is that they decide to re show footage of gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack tokyo so they show the scene from gamera vs where he destroys the <UNK> after the show scenes from gamera the <UNK> which is a huge issue for me mainly due to the fact that gamera the <UNK> was in black and white using stock footage from a black and white film in a color film is really lazy and that is not a good thing br br also the dubbing is bad once again the two little kids are not that annoying but it would be nice to see a gamera film that did not involve little kids br br so the over use of footage from other gamera films is a to this film the final fight is awesome so basically i recommend skipping to the final ten minutes and watching this film the rest is something that has already been seen before
<START> a quick funny coming of age <UNK> romp appealing to the underdog in us all it functions in effect as a vehicle for justin long who has subsequently <UNK> onto our screens in the fourth die hard via pc vs mac ads <UNK> and the break up he's funny earnest and young a big career ahead br br a town's worth of college <UNK> find a fake website long has set up to <UNK> his <UNK> parents and <UNK> on the like it were a short notice <UNK> party lewis black the <UNK> philosophy as a stand in dean <UNK> <UNK> friends provide support for the <UNK> and <UNK> appeal to <UNK> traditions of education and friendship adam deserves special mention for his never <UNK> slapstick contribution well executed <UNK> and instantly forgettable 4 10
<START> at the story it is reality mixed with <UNK> and very original br br emily grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum <UNK> job in new england her sleazy boss <UNK> her she <UNK> and takes a little bit of cash from the register driving from new <UNK> to miami florida is not a short trip and her ford <UNK> dies out she then meets a <UNK> older couple portrayed by <UNK> and bill raymond they have an <UNK> and <UNK> offer to help her out it isn't safe for a girl to be alone on the road especially i 95 br br emily grace is very realistic as alice and initially lets the <UNK> character help her buy her decent clothes <UNK> etc at first it is a nice vacation for alice who hopes to hook up with her girlfriend who <UNK> college in miami there is interesting cinematography as the trio drives the <UNK> down to florida the rest stops bland scenery and eventually beautiful mountains of north <UNK> br br eventually there is something awry and the character apparently has <UNK> stories about her daughter as well as her husband who now seems a bit sinister br br i will not spoil the outcome of this film but it ends positively as the audience waits in suspense this film reminded me a bit of spielberg's duel while it was initially not as menacing the moral of the story is you never know what people are thinking especially if you are driving cross country beware you will enjoy this film
<START> though a fan of shock and gore i found this movie disappointing to say the very least the effects and puppet work were impressive yes and the humor was well timed but something was missing see the first act of the film is spent establishing nuances of jack <UNK> character despite the fact that everything we need to know about his <UNK> is delivered within minutes of the first title cards as for the narration and many of the flashbacks needless br br the pacing during the second act was tedious most of it is focused on freddy krueger eating then <UNK> then eating some more then <UNK> his arms and saying something snappy or rude all the while the schlock is <UNK> with brief scenes of jack discussing his rage problems with a <UNK> definitely the entertaining scenes in the film excellent dialog worth plenty of laughs then without warning jack decides to kill a few monsters and then it's over br br all in all as a <UNK> to 1980s horror movies jack brooks monster <UNK> has loads of potential but is <UNK> and <UNK> on without conflict or adequate resolution br br hopefully these issues will be addressed before jack brooks <UNK> jack goes to hell or jack vs ash go into production
<START> this film is so wonderful it captures the <UNK> life i laughed so hard while watching this the movie is about a <UNK> group that have a hard time with a campaign that their <UNK> master came up with the movie switches from the real world and the <UNK> world as they play the campaign it shows them in the <UNK> world as their character and then switches back to the real world when they are not playing the campaign is the basis for a <UNK> that the <UNK> master <UNK> is writing the problem is <UNK> can't finish his <UNK> because the characters can't finish the campaign they are more for killing and <UNK> instead of role playing <UNK> wants them to role play through the campaign something they have never done before they decide to bring in some extra help so they bring a wait for it girl in to play <UNK> also makes a a non player character a who can not witness or do wrong to play the film is how they do all this and more i don't want to spoil any of the film so i won't say any more this movie may not be a big budget film the acting may not be oscar worthy but if you are into <UNK> or into <UNK> and dragons then definitely watch it they had a lot of fun making this film and it shows i am not going to bash on it for any movie problems such as continuity or any thing it was a low budget film that is just fun there is some slap stick comedy which i enjoy and some damn good writing in my opinion so if you want a fun film try it
<START> the great <UNK> <UNK> who won an and who has starred blockbusters such as 'the ten among lots of others ended his remarkable career with cheap <UNK> movies such as this one and such indeed one should take pity on seeing him making his very best to make this idiotic thing stand gone were the days when he was surrounded by steve mcqueen james coburn charles bronson eli <UNK> in 'the magnificent and walked around under the famous elmer <UNK> soundtrack it's difficult to make a living out of being an actor sometimes
<START> spoilers within what a dull predictable non scary <UNK> fest the movie had no character development i felt no empathy towards any of the characters except may be the small boy and did not care what happened to any of them the movie had so many clichéd bits or elements stolen from other horror movies br br the movie was so predictable many times i would be saying to myself let me guess fill in guess happens next <UNK> i was right even in the opening scene i predicted that the attack on the family was by some man probably the father because only the wife and children were attacked sure enough that is what happened of course you have to wait <UNK> minutes to find out for sure and of course another evil man scenario why was he evil and killing his family because he's a man duh br br as someone else stated this movie may be scary for someone under 13 years of age or for a movie from the 1970's but it is far from being a <UNK> movie by todays standards and like so many other crap horror movies a lot of the scares were <UNK> scary music scary music scary music and a crow suddenly flies at the window wow scary br br how did the old bank guy manage a few times to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him i thought for sure that the old man was a ghost nope just a crappy movie br br i rated this movie a 2 out of 10 because it did keep my attention enough to sit through the whole thing
<START> when i first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though i saw it again recently i have not changed my mind about it i think it was robert best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a <UNK> in real life my father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt my mother and brother had to do this when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed
<START> isabelle <UNK> is a wonderful actor the director of la <UNK> understands this providing the viewer with long takes of <UNK> face and these are a pleasure to see <UNK> is not an animated actor she <UNK> emotion with the smallest lift of an <UNK> or <UNK> of a smile br br other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor <UNK> in her profession there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it well if you enjoy self <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and bizarre behavior la <UNK> might work for you other than these attributes i could not find any redeeming value in it br br buried in all this strange material there is a <UNK> of truth people who compete at the very highest level <UNK> <UNK> whatever begin as strange people and are shaped into stranger people by the <UNK> environment br br not worth a trip to a movie theater to <UNK> this life lesson br br
<START> time line of the film laugh laugh laugh <UNK> <UNK> yawn look at watch walk out remember funny parts at the beginning <UNK> br br unfortunately this movie has a good concept that it <UNK> to the ground
<START> before i begin let me get something off my chest i'm a huge fan of john first film project the film a b grade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit <UNK> two sequels a spin off br br judge and jury begins with joseph <UNK> a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so called bloody shootout which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  <UNK> kills three people while trying to rob a <UNK> store being led to the electric chair there is an amusing scene where <UNK> talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  michael <UNK> a washed up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up <UNK> his son's coach but once executed <UNK> returns as a or as kelly calls a <UNK> without the <UNK> whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making life a misery br br let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film it is a supernatural action film with <UNK> chasing <UNK> using his ability to change form which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis <UNK> a french chef with an accent as bad as his <UNK> a drag queen a clown a stand up comedian a shotgun which fires explosive rounds an <UNK> to death although that doesn't stop martin <UNK> from shooting keith with a desert eagle to pay <UNK> back for killing <UNK> wife br br director john does not seem interested in <UNK> instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of but that is the film's main flaw since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting is surprisingly good with keith delivering the best performance supported <UNK> by <UNK> as well as paul <UNK> who plays the washed up cop quite well kelly is annoying as the <UNK> who tries to help but makes the situation worse
<START> i realise it's very hard to live up to the first the 10 <UNK> movie which was <UNK> and personally not a <UNK> heston fan but wow this movie mini series was disappointing even the animated the prince of egypt was better br br the one thing that threw me off was compared to <UNK> version paul version just seemed so weak and un like the acting really wasn't that great for a modern adaptation i was expecting something better it just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one i guess they were running on a tight budget or something there's an occasional voice over narrator which i found strange and unnecessary it also broke up the flow of the story and um god's voice lines were kinda weird
<START> br br i still can't <UNK> louis <UNK> jr agreed to appear in this film everything about this move feels artificial forced and contrived the air sequences are flat the enemy characters seem like puppets this is just a poor excuse of a movie at least top gun had air sequences that looked good the <UNK> shots anyway the songs by queen are cool though rent <UNK> instead
<START> the first child's play was an original and effective little horror movie as expected though the 2 horrible sequels seemed to spell the end for this franchise br br well when i heard they were making a 4th one called bride of <UNK> i just rolled my eyes and <UNK> a when will they ever learn br br but when i heard that they had gotten a great director <UNK> <UNK> and a solid cast including the awe inspiring jennifer <UNK> my interest in it <UNK> up br br this film is extremely well done it has a great sense of humor highly stylized graphic violence great cinematography and the stunningly sexy jennifer <UNK> <UNK> her most impressive stuff during the first half i should add that she is also a fantastic actress as well br br it keeps it's tongue firmly in cheek without <UNK> into campy territory the doll effects are great and the verbal interplay between them is priceless it's more of a horror comedy than straight horror but the humor is welcome and well integrated br br i've already heard that they're planning a son of <UNK> if they can match the quality of this film than maybe this franchise will have made a legitimate comeback br br rating 8 5
<START> on monday earlier this week sometime in july i happened to be under the influence of the sweet <UNK> and me being a horror fan wanted to see something scary i was thinking of the horror 2 but i got something way better i was at my friend's house and he had the vhs evil ed no cover or anything he didn't even see the whole thing himself but he told me it was about a guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people well this movie was very shocking i've never seen the actual brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie it <UNK> ted <UNK> and ed <UNK> both it is pretty funny too with references to the evil dead trilogy and plus the evil dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie the movie is about edward a obsessive <UNK> nice guy who happens to be a film editor he is then <UNK> to another department in the building and he is sent to the posh yet violent world of sam campbell the splatter and gore department sam campbell <UNK> new boss is telling eddy about the big break on his movies the gruesome loose limbs series and he needs eddy to make the movie somewhat less violent so they can be shown all over europe eddy has his regrets soon as the images and scenes that are displayed to him from the lonely suburban house he is sent to work in and then what happens from there is truly nightmarish imagine yourself in his place the acting is great the <UNK> is little funny sam <UNK> voice is often found funny same with the other actors however the <UNK> job was done pretty good i give this movie a 10 10 and it's a good introduction to the gore sub genre to horror very good nightmarish bloody you just have to see it for yourself br br quote from movie where in the f k is my <UNK> rape scene
<START> wow well you know those shock things they use in <UNK> to get your heart <UNK> again i needed one for my brain after watching this movie it literally took me almost 4 <UNK> in total to watch because i had to take a break and <UNK> my brain to semi normal <UNK> every so often i mean this movie goes <UNK> <UNK> its ridiculous to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous they just don't talk and while talking <UNK> everything and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary and the music is great that was probably the best part but then go listen to a <UNK> or something and forget about the movie so many people give this awesome reviews and for its time i'd say the special effects and filmography is quite good but as for the acting or lack thereof it just needed a little something more no <UNK> ups or sex etc profanity <UNK> even required but a little more emotion these guys were like stones just sitting there with long faces all in all if you need something to calm yourself down just play the movie dont even start at the beginning if you've seen it before just start anywhere lay down and relax it'll put you right to sleep
<START> ok i've seen over 100 troma films and some of them are pretty bad <UNK> beach u s a was horrible and i was a teenage tv terrorist was unwatchable but this is the worst film in the troma library br br a bunch of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape br br this is really terrible even as exploitation films go doris <UNK> and gordon lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for an cult film avoid this movie at all costs br br
<START> it's a talking trigger happy alcoholic ass cop i have seen the first and second episodes the artwork and animation fits very well note the facial expressions lol the main character being a gun <UNK> <UNK> wearing pair of butt <UNK> shooting at whoever he thinks to be offensive or guilty so far the episodes have had simple and <UNK> plots that work very well with <UNK> don <UNK> partner <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> to a a antics and random i've got a <UNK> leads lines are very funny and clever here's one for example i've got one bullet and its got your email address on it don't make me hit send bang looks like your in box just got some new mail the think box at <UNK> <UNK> are so far consistent and on cue as for the sound it's perfect the sound effects and voice work are 9 10 sounds like <UNK> stallone all <UNK> up don <UNK> the mayor the chief of police all have voices that fit there <UNK> very well i recommend this to anyone who wants to catch a few laughs before they go to bed as it does air on adult swim on sunday nights very funny imaginative visually different comedy 10 10
<START> this show was crap when it first came on the first actress that played the daughter didn't fit the role the writing was hit or miss and damon wayans clearly wasn't comfortable doing such a <UNK> family friendly show the chemistry between himself and <UNK> they're long time friends as are all of the wayans clan with husband and will smith and <UNK> <UNK> did work so they <UNK> the show once it returned they <UNK> the daughter made the son much dumber a la eric from boy meets world and made the youngest daughter into a genius later they gave her a little genius boyfriend to do comedic guest appearances the show while if often from over the top <UNK> to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see damon wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set especially since the main writers directors and <UNK> were all members of the wayans family and in his character once everyone had been on the show for a while they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the air br br however there is too much <UNK> too many over the top antics and <UNK> too much chaos happening in the life of the kyle family they made junior too stupid they also made the <UNK> daughter an attractive clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter wasn't even <UNK> by the writers i feel they jumped the shark and signed the shows death warrant when junior got his girlfriend pregnant she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced <UNK> wife's father's character makes me <UNK> just thinking about him the show remained funny but it was a <UNK> show on abc if that makes any sense to the reader br br the reruns are funny enough but i'm <UNK> it's over there was nowhere left to go with it when it's bad it's really bad it tends to be <UNK> at times but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom make it to <UNK> on a major network who can say that for themselves now given the <UNK> and the on tv networks lately that is one
<START> nice description of the situation in the us it explains different kinds of islam not just show terrorist and <UNK> islam can be other thing that killing they show why some people become terrorist and how to be muslim without being <UNK> it is a great series that muslims and no muslims should see now we hope that other series or films will be done to change the idea of all muslims are terrorist and all americans want to destroy islam it gave me the interest to discover what islam is exactly and what the us and also european government do to help <UNK> between people of different religion
<START> you might suspect that the plot of this movie was written in the process of filming it begins as a <UNK> versus vigilante movie but in the middle of the film the plot changes abruptly when the vigilante turns to be an honest man with his honest girl and his honest gym and has to fight the corrupt <UNK> who want to turn the gym down at any cost to build a mall or something then the plot changes again and we forget about the corrupt guys the villain now is the friend of the leading man who thinks he is a ninja the guy becomes crazy evil and wants at any cost to win a martial arts contest seeing this movie is like having a nightmare with the television on
<START> it is real easy to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and otherwise burn this film for all of its <UNK> flaws it was made by high school students and <UNK> and a whole community it shows sure i could examine the script which is just ridiculous a monster created from the garbage of a growing <UNK> city starts eating garbage and taking garbage <UNK> all over the city soon this huge beast with wings no less begins to destroy buildings and even plays the beauty and the beast act with a young high school girl fortunately for her there is a gang of guys her former boyfriend <UNK> the penguin and the town drunk out to help her the direction is awful the production values just dreadful the acting non existent and the pace <UNK> the movie is hard to sit through period however that being said it is also a miracle of a film when you consider that this thing was crafted by an entire community you can see all the collective effort from the actors the actual mayor and actual <UNK> and policemen to the area location shots used i also was really amazed at all the local <UNK> credited at the film's end with helping to <UNK> or contribute in some way to the film when you look at the film from that perspective it is indeed quite an achievement i didn't know anything about it before i sat down and watched it now that i have found out something about it i am impressed but make no mistake i have no no desire to sit through it again
<START> sure you get to see some <UNK> but if that's all you're looking for in a film you get more <UNK> from youtube i just paid a dollar from because i saw val <UNK> name bad move plot didn't dialogue was shoddy characters undeveloped at best somebody said cinematography was alright but don't expect too much this movie moved very slow and ended without grace <UNK> i spent much of the movie wondering if some event or color scheme of things was symbolic i never actually <UNK> to figure it out because nothing was ever explained in the end no twists it also left many questions that as it turns out i had no desire to hear answered one of the worst movies i have ever seen
<START> when i was a little girl i absolutely <UNK> the <UNK> princess it was <UNK> the same fairy tales of snow white sleeping beauty and cinderella the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die well hopefully but i figured that i would check out the sequels for the <UNK> princess to see what they were like and unfortunately this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains the only character i found still very amusing was the queen she was very funny in this movie and had the best part but with the voice changes they were noticeable and also bothered me quite a bit i don't mean to be <UNK> just it was too weird for me the story also was just more or less borrowed from the first <UNK> princess just the villain in this movie is following footsteps br br <UNK> and derek are about to celebrate their one year <UNK> but derek has been too <UNK> with fighting for his kingdom to keep it safe with his mother's birthday also coming up he forgets about that since there is a new villain in town who is hoping to go above and beyond where powers went and kidnaps the queen on her birthday but <UNK> must change back into her <UNK> self in order to help derek fight him and save his mother br br the <UNK> princess 2 is of course more than alright for the kids that i never mind it's good clean fun for them the reason why these sequels are disappointing though is because it is usually just for the kids that is the audience they aim for but it's more enjoyable when the jokes and story can be enjoyed by everyone now there are a few laughs and <UNK> here and there but this wasn't as clever in my opinion to the first <UNK> princess i would recommend it for the little one's but if you're looking for a fun cartoon movie i'd recommend staying with the first <UNK> princess br br 4 10
<START> i came across this movie on dvd purely by chance through a blockbuster rental voyage to the planets is an excellent bbc <UNK> documentary drama about a future grand tour of the <UNK> system taking pains to <UNK> to current knowledge about the planets and space flight and plausible from existing technology this movie tells the story of <UNK> on a journey to <UNK> mars <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br the special effects are excellent for a tv show i found the actors believable as <UNK> the situations presented are for the most part plausible and you learn a lot about the science of the planets and <UNK> only two minor complaints i found some of the situations and dialogue somewhat <UNK> at times furthermore i am unsure that a single crew and ship would be sent on a single mission to see all those <UNK> at once time more than likely visits to <UNK> mars <UNK> etc would will be separate missions br br they didn't try to <UNK> on this show with production values the scenes of <UNK> and mars were actually filmed in the northern <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> area on earth and a dead <UNK> for the martian landscape sequences were filmed in a diving russian transport jet the producers could have <UNK> on either of these using studios and cgi but chose the real thing instead br br i would like to especially mention the marvelous music that was composed for this movie don <UNK> thrilling theme is the first thing that grabs you when the movie starts as the magnificent shot of the <UNK> passes the screen and david <UNK> <UNK> it is the destiny of man to explore the stars br br watching this on a small television screen is one regret i have what a thrill to see this in a movie theatre or even better an <UNK> presentation
<START> i had been very curious to see the original six hour miniseries that steven <UNK> latest movie was based on and now that i have i am happy to say that one is not better than the other they are both intelligent involving and extremely entertaining the only real advantage that the miniseries has over the movie is that it is three and a half hours longer so we get to know the characters more in depth br br there isn't a false note to be had in this production one that you should definitely make time for when <UNK> re <UNK> this miniseries sometime in 2001 you won't regret it
<START> terrible action movie in which lead franco <UNK> <UNK> his cowboy hat gun belt and the coffin he dragged around in <UNK> 1966 for an all white ninja outfit with all the <UNK> <UNK> that goes with it despite virtually non stop action the film is utterly clichéd and unintentionally funny with a campy villain to boot in christopher george susan george no relation is the attractive woman with a washed up husband <UNK> wartime companion whom the villains are trying to push off her oil rich land but the latter haven't counted upon <UNK> martial arts and stunt heavy <UNK> the solution to their problems is to hire a similarly skilled ninja for themselves who as it happens turns out to be <UNK> deadly enemy played by sho <UNK> who appeared in two more sequels and is currently engaged in another the climax takes place inside an <UNK> where one man army <UNK> george and what has remained of his gang from previous <UNK> the subtle way in which he his nemesis however is effectively done
<START> saw this at the video store and thought i'd give it a try sounded like a good story and the cover looked good that was it the characters looked good and the actor who played <UNK> was the most convincing though he didn't have any heavy time in the movie i find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating but this is one in a minute number that gets it my book as the movie went along i kept wanting it to get better but to no <UNK> it was good the sound and lighting was good but the acting in this film killed it for me it was like watching a low grade soap opera i just kept saying i can't believe they released this move like this i <UNK> several times out of sheer <UNK> that the acting was that bad there's so much i want to say but i'll just say this everything else for the most part was good it was the acting as a final cut that really did this film in
<START> i seem to notice that a lot of people have never seen this movie and those that have usually dismiss it as garbage that's pretty bad really br br the first time i saw this movie i admittedly was almost one of those people thank god i'm patient otherwise i would have never found such a classic br br as goofy as this movie is it's also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of 80's movies or just happens to have a sense of humor br br i know that there are a lot of people out there that will tell you that this movie is sort of derivative of better off dead so what if it is they were both excellent movies br br i can honestly say that savage steve holland is a genius 10 10
<START> my house mate and i <UNK> purchased the video of 'the roller blade from our local second hand video shop in the hope of finding a bad film to laugh at this film isn't even laughable it's <UNK> poor worse even than jack frost 2 and that's saying something the script acting production stunts sound sets everything is absolutely terrible in some parts the actors haven't even learned their lines and are blatantly ad <UNK> or in one case actually having the lines read to them off set and simply repeating them set in the post apocalyptic <UNK> the film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of film many parts of which are edited badly or repeated ad <UNK> from various different camera angles to make the film longer this gets tedious very quickly the plot makes no sense whatsoever it is apparently an <UNK> of two books written by scott shaw there aren't even seven of them most of them aren't on <UNK> they're wearing roller boots and it seems to me that mostly the film has been completely sold on the fact that there's about 3 minutes of female semi nudity in it the writer and star scott shaw obviously <UNK> himself somewhat of a samurai and throughout the film performs some very poor stunts and made up sword fighting moves that look <UNK> amateurish despite all this his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the boundaries of modern film making my house mate and i were left speechless by the whole ordeal and despite my frequent attempts to burn the <UNK> she has decided it may be some kind of ring esquire video curse that needs to be passed on if you see the video in stores take it from me leave well alone
<START> as a huge fan of the original operation <UNK> force i thought i'd pick this film up i figured it couldn't be too bad however here's a list of things i <UNK> from watching operation <UNK> force 4 deep fault br br the <UNK> force despite being the elite in american armed forces are mostly mildly overweight men in their late 30s and early 40s br br the <UNK> force despite being the elite in american armed forces carry standard police issue <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> on their most important missions br br the <UNK> force despite being the elite in american armed forces haven't <UNK> that during stealth missions wearing bright red <UNK> <UNK> and running around in open spaces aren't exactly going to keep you out of sight br br when you drop a <UNK> cocktail into a tank it explodes <UNK> like a <UNK> br br when you get hit by tank fire you can run away although the smoke caused may present minor difficulties for breathing br br you can die from one standard gun shot but you can also live despite being hit multiple times by a sniper rifle and a few times by an <UNK> <UNK> br br in hand to hand combat members of the <UNK> force despite being the elite in american armed forces are regularly <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> br br if bad guys are approaching you while on a slow moving train there's nothing to worry about between the 4 of them they can't manage to figure out how to get an automatic weapon to fire automatically let alone hit anyone from 5 <UNK> 16 feet with at least 50 attempts between them br br if you're short on actors just <UNK> them the bad guy from operation <UNK> force 1 plays a good guy called mac in operation <UNK> force 4 and the guy who played mac in operation <UNK> force 3 now plays skip lang a different good guy br br it's not ok for the <UNK> force to shoot an <UNK> terrorist even if he's attempting to <UNK> his weapon to kill you br br <UNK> explode on impact with the ground when thrown by members of the <UNK> force when thrown by non <UNK> force <UNK> they explode at exactly the point where the <UNK> force members have thrown the <UNK> back at the bad guys br br tanks can drive faster than standard <UNK> br br and personal <UNK> use the exact same <UNK> that the un used in operation <UNK> force 1 br br when a <UNK> arrives a bad guy in that <UNK> cannot see you if you lie face down br br shooting someone multiple times in the chest will cause minor damage stabbing that person in the <UNK> will kill them inside 5 seconds br br the <UNK> force steal cars from old people to get around when in foreign countries because the us military do not provide them with any means of transport this may also explain why they caught public transport br br as you can see this is not really the finest moment in film making but it's good for a laugh
<START> wow where do i begin i rented this movie because it sounded like something i would be interested in watching with a name like val kilmer starring in this film i thought how bad could it be this has got to be the worst film i have ever seen with such a big name attached to it i was wondering why it slipped through the cracks and i never remember hearing anything about it when it first came out it starts out pretty good and is somewhat reminiscent of the intro sequence in the bourne identity but after the initial 30 minutes or so it goes from bad to worse and then it <UNK> into wtf land if you haven't seen this do yourself a favor and don't rent buy it unless you are a <UNK> or on a quest to see every val kilmer film out there there are many more titles out there that are more deserving your time this film if you can call it that is a <UNK> <UNK> waste of time i want my <UNK> minutes back
<START> this film is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend from then on she has to <UNK> her time for the two boyfriends jack during the day and joseph during the night br br this film feels like as if it was made with minimum budget the majority of the film is set in a flat with minimal furniture there are only three main actors all the other actors listed in the credits make only <UNK> appearances the wardrobe designer doesn't seem to have much to do as the actors wear very down to earth clothes and actually most of the time they are naked anyway br br the film is very dialog heavy which should have made up for the shortcomings described above however the dialogs sound too composed and awkward in the beginning of the film most of the dialog is a person saying a very long sentence and then the person says <UNK> <UNK> after the frenzy of <UNK> the dialog <UNK> into a mess of disjointed and confused word <UNK> br br the only merit of this film i can think of is that it serves as a feminist <UNK> which conveys that it is not just men who can be <UNK> br br this film is a great disappointment
<START> br br i understand that people have different expectations of low budget <UNK> movies i also know that john <UNK> has a sort of glow about him that <UNK> intellectual anti hollywood vibe a la tim robbins the <UNK> brothers and <UNK> <UNK> that makes him a darling with the critics from the get go br br but this is not a good movie i'm sorry it just isn't br br it <UNK> it has too many characters its tone is uneven its point of view is muddled the acting is all over the board from <UNK> to over the top it <UNK> for long moments with minor characters we don't care about and cuts away from tense scenes just when things are getting good br br it misses the mark br br the worst flaw in the movie is that the two closest things to a protagonist edie <UNK> and angela <UNK> are straight <UNK> in characters that have no drive is an <UNK> drunk <UNK> in her life's own <UNK> <UNK> is a woman trapped in her own repressed pain when your two main characters' world views can be summed up with the phrases i don't care and i want to leave here why should the audience give a <UNK> br br i'll be plain <UNK> writes funny dialogue he's very <UNK> at <UNK> a scene the problem is these scenes don't go anywhere there's no spine to the movie no drive the movie doesn't create rooting interest in any of the characters in my opinion he's also too preachy about big bad corporate america <UNK> up the little guy br br if you want to see a quality small movie see david lynch's straight story pass this one up
<START> i went into a screening of sister helen at the sundance film festival and did not know what to expect br br i was <UNK> by the people in this documentary sister helen is an incredible character the filmmakers captured the essence of sister <UNK> amazing soul and took me into a world unknown i was thoroughly satisfied by the journey and was completely caught off guard by this film's ending br br this film speaks to those who desire a second chance at life
<START> ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs people etc this may be an admirable characteristic because ants carry the film phase iv this is not because they want to but because they have to br br the movie opens with a narrator <UNK> explaining that some <UNK> event has come over the earth and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect this <UNK> has on the <UNK> population the movie is broken up in segments the first part after the <UNK> event is phase i and so on until the end of the movie which is phase iv br br what is phase iv who knows we don't get to see that part presumably it has something to do with the bonding of one of the scientists studying the ants and a girl who lived in the area the girl who looks like a cross between alicia <UNK> and <UNK> tyler is mad at the ants because they killed her horse but except for one angry <UNK> goes around the with a blank clueless look br br these ants are pretty smart or the scientists are rather dumb i'll give credit to the ants why anything that usually ruins my <UNK> that can then build <UNK> towers blow up <UNK> and <UNK> to poison with the greatest of ease gets my vote for being the smarter species at least in this movie br br <UNK> says <UNK> on this br br
<START> overall i give this film a decent 7 6 to start i'll say i love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen if you read comics occasionally or simply watch dvd extras you'll see the blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film among the changes blade is now most importantly half vampire therefore <UNK> all of their strengths but none of their weaknesses the credit for this goes obviously to david a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books thanks to him blade has become a much more interesting character and i find him one of my favorite anti heroes really wesley snipes is born to play this role although some would've probably washington or will smith lol his acting here doesn't need to be exactly oscar winning per say considering the character but i'm glad he to play the in the two sequels also starring is stephen <UNK> as our main villain and kris kristofferson as <UNK> alfred so to speak the acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure the opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts i've got to say as much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film <UNK> with something like spider man or x men stephen had the villains portrayed in a way i didn't like so much honestly their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didn't really feel like a comic book film to me plus la a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it i guess not to mention a sense of extra non realism a black man in a leather coat with a sword the out of a cop in broad day light some how going <UNK> by the crowds walking by seemed kinda well dumb moving away from a few of its flaws the music by mark <UNK> was great and <UNK> the film nicely luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel blade 2
<START> i'm amazed that the hospital has been so well received by the critics and the public i found it dreary visually ugly and generally meaningless after the first virtually unwatchable 40 minutes the film does improve relatively but it remains way too far fetched not to mention unfunny to be successful as a satire and has too little substance to succeed as a drama the film's uncertain tone is its biggest fault <UNK> even scott's terrific as usual performance
<START> i don't know if i'd go as far as to say that this movie belongs to the <UNK> pile but it's fair to say that there are no academy award <UNK> here what must be considered is that most of the actors in this film weren't actually actors as such just kids with nothing better to do at the time there were many others that were offered roles in the film but turned them down to go surfing up the coast all things taken into account it really wasn't a bad movie for its time in some respects it's really not unlike today's times where <UNK> pressure is still alive and kicking just without the mobile phones computers and other similar <UNK> that kids lived without unlike this generation anyway i have to rate this flick as an old <UNK> that i watch once in a blue moon and never take too seriously
<START> at 20 years old francis <UNK> <UNK> as his whole life ahead of him in a way the son of an immigrant family living in the late 19th to early 20th century era united states class was a very <UNK> fact of life if one is born poor one stays poor if one is born into the <UNK> one has a tiny bit of opportunity if one is born into the wealthy class they essentially have it made in the <UNK> british gold champion harry and <UNK> golf idol played by the criminally underrated stephen is the exception that proves the rule born and raised in a poor british family his accomplished skill at golf allowed him to rise from the dirty mess of the <UNK> <UNK> to the lush <UNK> of the english country <UNK> he has not forgotten this life lesson francis wishes to follow in footsteps and similarly uses his great skill at golf to get into the <UNK> us open at age 20 but a tough course and <UNK> opponents including <UNK> idol harry are not all that francis must deal with as a less than understanding father and cruel societal <UNK> stand in his way of living his own dream br br i know what you are thinking i thought it too a walt disney produced film about the <UNK> us open starring the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> holds the possibility of being entertaining but it cannot possibly be a great film well i am here to encourage you to think again despite what it may look to some on paper the greatest game ever played is one of the best sport films in creation br br as with every great sport film the greatest game ever played includes many exciting sport scenes but it is not a film about golf it is a character centered film about using one's talents following one's dreams and breaking out of class <UNK> where the greatest game ever played works excellently as a themed sport film it also works just as well as a period film the film's featured costumes and sets being the next best thing to actual time travel the film also simply looks great and virtually unknown music composer brian tyler set the film to a wonderful piece of music the cast is great as well with a subtle but powerful stephen as british <UNK> champion harry a hilarious stephen marcus as man's man <UNK> ted ray a hammy josh <UNK> as <UNK> pre <UNK> <UNK> eddie and a surprisingly good <UNK> <UNK> in the lead role as francis actor bill paxton apollo 13 titanic turns director here for the second time directing a full length feature in the greatest game ever played he produces a fine product <UNK> plenty of heart <UNK> and an attention to detail in the making of the film
<START> this is a film that i love above all others i try to <UNK> the main film locations in and whenever i can which help to re establish those magical qualities that this film seems to <UNK> so uniquely <UNK> a <UNK> and more mannered age with its <UNK> <UNK> that people really do matter that family life is not just another <UNK> and that life really is worth living though sometimes we may doubt that in short a film that soon brings tears to my eyes helped perhaps by the deeply <UNK> music some tunes are <UNK> like the tune played on a <UNK> sometimes with <UNK> the stirring melody when the family first set off for <UNK> not knowing what lies ahead and the haunting little tune played on a solo <UNK> or is it an that <UNK> sudden child felt changes in fortune br br this is as much a film for adults as for children appealing to the eternal child in us all a key that effortlessly those deep and apparently long lost values and feelings buried inside us which are normally swept aside by the demands of modern everyday life this is a film about basic human goodness and decency in which we the viewers are left to make of it what we will and there are welcome touches of humour sometimes added for good measure such as the arrival of the aunt or on a more <UNK> level the bedroom scene on birthday all right bert as it's your birthday i must know every scene every line of this film and yet so great is the magic that each time i watch it is like i am opening a box of <UNK> for the first time each moment sometimes humorous sometimes well very different as peter says in the film it's perfect more perfect than you know and so it is
<START> it's 2005 my friends a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology so why can't we see a movie that's a little more thought out than this cheesy low budget film i've seen a lot of low budget movies that rock my <UNK> off but this one it's almost as if it's trying to be horrible just don't watch it i can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good i feel like a small child produced this entire movie there's not even an original plot line vampire <UNK> in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself can someone tell me if perhaps this was designed as a comedy movie and i just didn't know it it makes me wonder what does the sequel have in store for us who so loved the first installment
<START> a tedious gangster film that leaves you wishing someone had edited it farce more <UNK> i would have thought that the story of the creation of las vegas would prove interesting but it fails at almost every turn warren <UNK> performance as the stupid and unlikeable <UNK> <UNK> leaves you wishing you were watching someone else once or twice he flashes through the fog of his performance to deliver an interesting scene but most of the time you just can't care about him <UNK> <UNK> gives a skilled turn as his <UNK> lover but even she's only <UNK> more than he is br br i really wouldn't bother with this turgid drama unless you're a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this love story between an american journalist and an <UNK> lady doctor does not contain much conflict since she is largely <UNK> having studied in london nor any fireworks since she behaves rather restrained what little interest the story manages to raise is knocked down further by their wooden dialogs they are supposed to be two <UNK> <UNK> but talk as if the words are put in their mouths by a hollywood hack who is not much of one himself the movie also suffers from an amazing lack of realism a completely deserted beach in crowded little <UNK> <UNK> by a million chinese <UNK> and a presumably accomplished american journalist in his 40s who doesn't know what a is hollywood ideas finally the song after hearing it an <UNK> twenty times throughout the movie starting right with the credits it tends to loose some of its emotional impact sorry to say
<START> how anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous <UNK> bridge with <UNK> leigh and robert taylor is beyond <UNK> br br mae <UNK> myra is a far cry from the role as played by <UNK> leigh in the remake she plays a common american girl with a brooklyn accent and the yeah <UNK> are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character <UNK> <UNK> billed in final credits as kent <UNK> is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down bette davis has a nothing role in a bit part br br their melodramatic <UNK> during the last twenty minutes of the film are beyond belief <UNK> bits of overacting even given the fact that this is a <UNK> version of the story when sound was only a few years old and silent acting was still the rage br br just awful and it ends abruptly with clarke losing her life during a bombing on the bridge the end br br it has none of the beautifully <UNK> performances in the mgm remake of 1940 including a sterling supporting cast instead this one is <UNK> with low budget production values and i mean a shoe string budget with no subtlety at all and there's no pre code <UNK> in the scene where myra tells the <UNK> lady why she must not marry her son roy she simply says i picked him up on <UNK> bridge explanation over nothing bold there br br <UNK> up for once the original is not the best version by any means <UNK> leigh and robert taylor have never been <UNK> as myra and roy in the tender <UNK> acted 1940 film classic
<START> originally filmed in 1999 as a tv pilot <UNK> dr was rejected the next year david lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters he did so and created one of the greatest most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made br br the film really doesn't have main characters but if there were main characters they would be betty <UNK> <UNK> and rita laura <UNK> betty is a <UNK> blonde who's staying in her <UNK> apartment while she <UNK> for parts in movies she finds rita in her <UNK> apartment and decides to help her you see <UNK> lost her memory she has no clue who she is she takes her name rita from a <UNK> poster in the bathroom so the two set out to discover who rita really is br br david lynch has been known for making some weird movies but this film is the definition of weird it's bizarre nightmarish and absolute <UNK> it's like a dream captured on film by the 100 minute point the film has become extremely confusing but if you've been watching closely it will make perfect sense having watched the movie and then read an article on the internet pointing out things in the film i now understand the movie completely br br the acting is very good <UNK> is terrific justin <UNK> is very good as a hollywood director facing problems with the local mob the music is excellent <UNK> <UNK> delivers one of his finest scores and the directing <UNK> david lynch is as masterful a filmmaker as ever there was br br is this your type of film well that depends you should probably view more of lynch's work before watching this movie you'll need to be patient with the film and probably watch it a second time to pick up the many clues lynch has left throughout the movie for lynch fans this is a dream come true br br <UNK> dr is a masterpiece it's brilliant enigmatic and masterfully filmed i love it
<START> music videos are often completely <UNK> in any discussion about film with most people considering them to be a lesser art form while a great majority are merely flashy clips to <UNK> a popular <UNK> latest hit single a precious few really do rise above the rest becoming works of art in their own right anything directed by spike or michel <UNK> is always worth watching while art isn't precisely the word i'd use to describe michael jackson's <UNK> 1983 ' it is an intensely likable hybrid of schlock horror and music and an outrageously campy short film that remains remarkably endearing nearly 25 years later the thirteen minute music video both the longest and most expensive ever at the time of its release was directed by john <UNK> a filmmaker i'm not terribly familiar with though 'the blues brothers 1980 ' is a classic and i hear that <UNK> american werewolf in london 1981 ' is a <UNK> entertaining horror comedy br br whether or not <UNK> actually qualifies as a music video is certainly up for debate taking into account its extensive length though jackson <UNK> this effort with <UNK> <UNK> ' at <UNK> minutes and the fact that the title song <UNK> less than half of the total running time the video opens with a brief film within a film as michael on a quiet and <UNK> lit night reveals to his girlfriend <UNK> ray that he is different from other guys <UNK> into a hideous werewolf as the <UNK> clouds part to reveal a full moon as he presumably <UNK> the unfortunate heroine we come across michael and his girl in the movie theatre actually watching this drama unfold in a horror picture when the girl becomes frightened they both leave cinema and begin to walk home at which point michael begins to sing the opening lines of his latest song thriller however when a <UNK> of blood <UNK> zombies emerge from the local graveyard their entrance <UNK> narrated by vincent price the situation begins to get interesting br br it's difficult to quite put my finger on why <UNK> is considered one of the greatest of all music videos it can't simply be that the song itself is a lot of fun and michael jackson  though he has since become the butt of all <UNK> jokes for his peculiar personality and <UNK>  there's no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer perhaps a decent explanation for the film's popularity is the incredible amount of work that must have gone into it nothing like it had ever been seen before and it still remains something of an <UNK> in the world of music videos the gruesome monster make up effects were <UNK> by rick baker and are surprisingly graphic for a music clip though it's all carried out with a good sense of fun several moments make for some genuinely exciting suspense successfully capturing the atmosphere of the films which it is <UNK> though always with a cheesy twist on the usual formula simply put you'll never look at a zombie movie in the same way again
<START> <UNK> stupidity that the cartoon <UNK> made fun of a quarter century beforehand no dead heroes proves that you can rip off a good movie the <UNK> candidate without <UNK> a single <UNK> of quality from the object of your <UNK> the acting barely <UNK> on the cable access tv scale the plot is less nuanced than an old sgt rock comic and only boris j style bad guy <UNK> are missing from the <UNK> this movie achieves the unusual feat of being too bad too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with thumbs
<START> there are many mysteries in life for example why did any of the people other than <UNK> top agree to appear in this movie why did anyone <UNK> this movie why did anyone pay money to see it i guess none of these questions will ever be answered but one thing i know for sure this movie is one of the worst ever made with a budget this big it would already be bad but the addition of <UNK> humor makes it even worse the only entertainment one could possibly get from this movie is to burn it smash it or otherwise destroy it in an amusing fashion if you were to rank it against every movie ever made it would be right between problem child and <UNK> said
<START> for once a <UNK> movie that is good i'm 18 and a embarrassed to say this but i'm hooked on these movies i hated <UNK> when i was younger but the movies i love <UNK> is so cute and i've fallen in love with him he's so cute as the polar bear and totally in love with <UNK> oh man i'm in love with <UNK> i love determination not to give up on hope and it works i love this movie and hopefully they will be other good ones <UNK> <UNK> lake is other brilliant movie i would recommend this movie to children of all ages even boys because the movie is that good and i'm hard to please <UNK> and the magic of <UNK> is a movie that is enchanting and exciting
<START> i remember catching this film on a <UNK> screening a year ago and i was completely blown away by the whole thing i thought the film managed to represent such a diversity of genres the supernatural a love story the intrigue of crime and so many more br br i was hooked on the whole thing after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters it made me feel terrified at one second for jimmy and then had me laughing away at the gangsters in the next and all the time i had my fingers crossed that things would work out for <UNK> br br heath ledger and rose are superb bryan brown is absolute quality and had me up along with david field who was funny as well as being an evil <UNK> br br since i saw this film i managed to order it on dvd and as a result every person i show it to has been hooked in much the same way br br this film is perfect for a sunday afternoon or a lazy evening and it's one that you can really appreciate with your mates around
<START> this is a magnificent and in many ways impressive film i saw it on tv as a little boy with my throat almost <UNK> with tears and again today on the <UNK> restored <UNK> dvd br br <UNK> is the very essence of the war <UNK> imagine <UNK> of <UNK> with no music and no color or <UNK> bridge with no class consciousness br br <UNK> a cross between <UNK> leigh and <UNK> is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancé <UNK> and doesn't write or come back br br the fiancé boris dies on the front and his death scene is <UNK> romantic very daring too because so close to over the top but that scene will stay with you br br although the <UNK> were so defined by wwii the movie is quite <UNK> and more powerful for it the pre war and post war scenes have a very 1957 feel there is no attempt at period detail the whole film becomes more and more stylized until the <UNK> scenes which feel like a modern opera set that is a compliment the <UNK> final scene is <UNK> to its last drop there again comparable to <UNK> the production feels like a big budget those <UNK> scenes must have cost a pretty br br go for it don't expect a bitter <UNK> <UNK> although it is of course very sad the <UNK> are flying is an impressive slice of world cinema quite advanced considering where and when it was made
<START> just listen to the broadway cast album and to the voices of barbara harris and john <UNK> who do wonders for the wonderful <UNK> and lane score then with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind watch the movie with streisand as streisand and <UNK> <UNK> reading his lines with such a heavy french accent that a chain saw couldn't cut through it the best part for those who need something to look forward to is what <UNK> does to the <UNK> part of the title song listen as he sings says could anyone among us have an <UNK> or a clue what magic <UNK> of <UNK> and voodoo you can do that one part sums up the problem that results from casting name stars in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles i can just see rex harrison entering that scene and suggesting <UNK> too could learn to do justice to the beauty of the english language br br
<START> i think that this film is one of the funniest films i have ever seen i think debbie reynolds is hilarious and the chemistry between her and glenn ford is perfect there is not a dull moment in the film and debbie looks beautiful as always br br the story is about a <UNK> maggie debbie reynolds who meets a <UNK> soldier joe glenn ford she takes an instant dislike to him but after he accidentally tears her dress he returns it to her on the condition that she goes on one date with him they end up getting married the night they have their date after just one kiss joe and maggie move to spain and find they have nothing in common but physical attraction so maggie <UNK> that for one month they live but not as man and wife which means that joe is not allowed to kiss or sleep with maggie much to <UNK> frustration a hilarious plot and a wonderful film not to be missed
<START> okay i had reasonably high expectations for this the controversial subject matter was a good concept as a horror fan i admit i was fascinated and very excited about this br br it turns out they had a great idea but it was terribly executed let's see this movie seems to run in 3 <UNK> happy sex and dark the problem is that the movie never decides what it wants to be the happy parts i believe were meant to contrast with the dark parts but it doesn't work the soundtrack is one of the reasons br br the movie transitions between these 3 <UNK> very badly i can't even begin to say how much the directing and editing suck there's sex in the most unappealing and <UNK> way i'm not complaining but even for horror standards they were unnecessary and filler br br the characters are all unlikeable with the exception of paula <UNK> her friend from <UNK> is a slut and possibly one of the most annoying characters in movies i've come across recently br br there's a bit of plot which i won't go into detail it's not stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie there's even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy going on don't try to understand everything because there are giant plot holes here br br it's all so <UNK> done that you don't care for the victims the <UNK> anyone and to think this could have been great i can say one good thing about it which is the movie shed some light on today's <UNK> medical <UNK> with <UNK> and controversial <UNK> <UNK> this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and <UNK> these questions but you won't find that here just a series of scenes loosely <UNK> together with people and things that you don't care about br br skip this and go watch instead you're welcome br br 3 10
<START> this was the worst <UNK> in history the only good matches were ricky <UNK> vs <UNK> <UNK> and the tag title match between the british and the dream team this one <UNK> on classic everything else was either poor or awful the idea of having three host cities was unnecessary confusing and messed up the <UNK> of the show the celebrity guests were terrible on commentary especially susan saint james br br if you're interested in the mid 80's <UNK> you're better renting or buying <UNK> 3 or just about any other <UNK> for that matter
<START> what can be said of this independent effort beyond the fact that it was shot with television cameras and whether that was by <UNK> or budget constraints doesn't make the watching of this variation on a theme by romero any easier i was constantly reminded that i was watching <UNK> school project at best derivative at worst cheap br br writer director <UNK> who also appears in the film does some interesting things with stock footage but that says more about his editing style than his directing style which consists of in your face close ups with tv cameras which made me think i was watching public access television instead of an actual honest to goodness film br br the story copies and bits and pieces from various sources including the aforementioned romero's dead trilogy the road warrior dig that stock footage of a future that looks like the past and the blair witch project br br what results is an hour and <UNK> worth of zombies tracking down and eating humans okay the humans in this case are <UNK> but that doesn't change anything it's the same menu br br the year is <UNK> and the first <UNK> of people who were <UNK> <UNK> years before have started to <UNK> particularly in the area of course when <UNK> go bad the first thing they have a taste for is human flesh or in this case <UNK> human flesh it's not safe to be <UNK> it's not safe to be <UNK> it's just a matter of time before the flesh eating <UNK> <UNK> our heroes have you seen this before br br i don't mind people ripping off romero if it's done well but no new territory is covered in this film it's night of the living dead meets the blair witch project shot with television cameras what is particularly disappointing is that the dvd cover makes it look like it was shot at the very least with <UNK> film this wouldn't have been a problem with me if the story had not been equally cheap the film offers a bleak vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the point where human <UNK> is possible must we continue to clone our favourite movies
<START> ok now at first i thought this was going to be another cheesy romantic comedy which held back on the comedy but this wasn't i mean how could it have been with the fabulous amanda <UNK> staring in it she was amazing really funny is still stunning the boys in it were also extremely fit one major reason for going girls the plot is strongly based upon the shakespeare play <UNK> as it was extremely similar there was even a spider called which <UNK> to the like character the script was really well written and pulled together and it was very witty the football skills in it were also amazing it even made me think of playing football myself anyway to sum it up this is a light hearted film about young romance which gets very confusing go and see it
<START> the auteur of prince manages to take an excellent cast a decent story a mediocre script and carefully <UNK> them into one boring monotonous amateurish mess in spite of a strong central performance by frank the prince this disjointed film wanders <UNK> from scene to scene painfully <UNK> into <UNK> the result brings a sigh of relief at the end where the tears of joy should be a sad waste of time and talent and a good example of how not to direct a film br br
<START> i'm just throwing in this review to show that i'm not crazy i like a lot of work deathstalker 2 <UNK> mall against the law are fast paced and highly enjoyable just to prove i'm not blind i have to mention this along with some shannon <UNK> body chemistry 3 or 4 or something are the lousy ones i've got nothing against drawn out sex sequences but julie <UNK> breasts are so unnatural looking you can't help but stare at them which may be the desired effect but i didn't enjoy staring at them and several members of this cast seem depressed or <UNK> the erotic thriller was the worst thing to happen to low budget flicks ever and thank god that their day has more or less done
<START> this <UNK> exploitation flick is some genuinely insipid stuff courtesy of spaghetti land director <UNK> <UNK> who wisely left his name off this junk br br the basic <UNK> of this outing concerns the discovery of some brutally <UNK> individuals being washed up on shore in the <UNK> authorities initially believe them to be victims of shark attacks but as the investigation <UNK> turns out to be something much more sinister br br all of this ultimately amounts to very little however we have here poor dubbing <UNK> by similarly weak script which often consists of nonsensical <UNK> and is really of little consequence for the most part acting can only be described as sub par which is par for the course in this instance truly <UNK> direction doesn't help things either br br special effect mainly is for numerous close ups of various gory bodies missing limbs and so forth of course there is the obligatory creature which <UNK> emerges at feeding time which looks something like a big monster <UNK> thing where its animation only consists of its pointed teeth <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> overall the end result is none too convincing sure but admittedly is almost entertaining in a cheesy kind of fashion br br it seems what the film makers were going for was a sort of low rent hybrid of jaws and <UNK> but the final product is just a bloody <UNK> much like the corpses <UNK> shown throughout this picture i find it difficult to think of any redeeming attributes to warrant viewing this so moreover strictly for <UNK> monster movie <UNK>
<START> it's incredible how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being <UNK> for those of you who appreciate <UNK> special effects and <UNK> detail in every shot you will watch this film in awe simply because predator island contains none of this it is a redundant remake of every horror monster movie in the last two decades now i appreciate bad horror films they have a certain <UNK> for humor in the most dramatic of circumstances however if your goal is to create a memorable work that will thus be <UNK> in the cult hall of fame then my first suggestion is to find some imagination creativity plus get some talent oh and a few extra bucks to put into your picture br br one horror film tradition has been to shock the audience with violent deaths and gore however shock doesn't deliver for more than a few seconds to really evoke a satisfying reaction from paying crowd there should b development of characters some <UNK> traits i know you're probably saying this guy is not providing anything intelligent to the filmmakers he's just stating an amateur remark well that goes to show you how amateur these filmmakers are br br despite having to go through the horror of watching this movie there was a silver <UNK> the performance by dan gordon as chris is splendid he is given nothing to work with in a script and yet he is able to come out of that film looking like a star out of all of the actors he is the only who believes in what he is <UNK> he not only provides the audience with someone we can identify with but we also have someone we look forward to watching so we can get through the rest of the film gordon shows genuine talent and the ability to pull off quality work and <UNK> a huge <UNK> that being the rest of the cast dan gordon is going to be a star hopefully sooner than later that is to say if he can get away films like this that will hold him back
<START> any of law <UNK> take your choice of city and homicide life on the <UNK> weakest episodes is superior to the strongest episode of bones br br david <UNK> is stuck in crappy angel mode and emily <UNK> portrays bones too <UNK> the actors as a whole have terrible scenes together be it with forced acting or just awful lines br br the murders become predictable after a while as the <UNK> and clues are just too obvious br br music is okay though really unnecessary at times br br all in all bones is hardly the show i'd recommend watching during the <UNK> as it is a <UNK> copy of better shows with unreal characters and ever <UNK> stories br br skip this if you can
<START> the person who wrote the summary and rave review for this film is either an idiot or an avid fan of <UNK> movies from the beginning this just spoke of cheap ass ripoff of the descent a far superior film that definitely does not start off slow br br from the very first moments of the <UNK> i was amazed at how bad it was how uninspired and unoriginal it was how badly written badly acted and badly directed it was this is without a doubt one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life and that's saying a lot considering i recently suffered through pulse i can't believe this piece of garbage actually won awards which just goes to show the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs is much better in australia and other countries than in the u s br br the scenes where the group is running from the creature are badly directed especially the retarded upside down camera intended to show <UNK> but only coming off as a cheap effect which a first year film student would be suitably <UNK> for by their teacher br br sadly this director will probably go on to make other movies more than likely of the same low quality as this film since i'm sure he hasn't learned from his mistakes which on this picture were excessive br br if i had my way the entire cast and crew would be sent up the river for life without <UNK> this film is a crime against humanity
<START> subtle delicate touching br br a young man in a summer dress on a bike like incarnation of perfect joy history of a coming out and <UNK> of relationship br br soft ambiguous gestures <UNK> of desire and a day like space of innocent miracle expression br br two men a girl a afternoon on beach some words and a gift religious <UNK> and a vision of light and expression <UNK> of an ordinary day and hot evening br br a erotic <UNK> film in which the gay identity or the first sexual relation are only <UNK> for good definition of a universe with values br br <UNK> for self discover universe of beauty exploration the sign of <UNK> and same nostalgic air of every creation <UNK> is a splendid occasion to understand the moment like projection of dream to look with emotion and child soul the essence of the essence beyond the images or people
<START> spoilers this movie has it's problems but in the end it gets the message across i liked it because it ends the way things really do the nice guy tries and tries gets his heart broken several times but in the end there is no typical hollywood ending it ends the way such things always end or at least always have in my own and <UNK> experiences anyone who thinks that the ending to this isn't how it really happens as the first comment seemed to believing that the girl would come around realize she's dating an <UNK> who treats her bad because he doesn't care about her at all is either naive or lives in a more perfect world than i i give it 7 10 extra points simply because it wasn't afraid to end on a down note give no real resolution just the main character left <UNK> confused and alone as so many men of countless generations have been before
<START> there are a number of movies that my high school friends and i used to joke about they are mostly the campy works of the 50's that showed up on television on the late show this was one of our favorites the soul of a fallen native being brought to life in a tree <UNK> with a <UNK> on its face now my friends claimed that if you looked carefully you could see the thing had shoes i never saw this what is most striking to me is that the natives seemed to be white men with black grease paint on their faces some looked sort of italian they also spoke with the strangest <UNK> that didn't seem to fit their situation like the mummy movies the <UNK> of the thing didn't seem to offer much of a threat in a confrontation one should only have to walk fast i guess it's the old element of surprise if you see this don't take it too seriously be happy that we have a <UNK> of old horror movies that gave us such joy
<START> why is it that every time i mention this movie to somebody i have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it i have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist upon a twist is deemed genius by anyone who watches it is that really what film has become or is it that any time someone says wow that is so cool everybody has to agree with them and has no opinion of their own how this movie has a 7 5 rating is a disgrace to the film industry in general it has also become yet another movie that needs two sequels for it so i am going to have to hear about this horrible franchise for quite a while longer br br now to the film and why it is so bad the original concept of it is actually not that bad as there has not been a good serial killer movie in a while the writing for this film is horrible as well as the execution ok so its a low budget movie but that should not change the story or writing the actors could not be worse in their attempt to make us scared of this killer or just scared of this movie so they go out and get a big name in danny glover but his talents whatever those are are wasted because his character is worthless why was he even in this movie what was his whole fight at the end turned out to be useless and misleading for what the audience believes is happening this is of course the filmmakers intent but couldn't there have been a better way to do this without making us watch all that garbage and then the big twist comes was this the third or fourth and the whole audience is shocked and walks out of the theater like this is some kind of masterpiece sure the movie gets people talking about the storyline and what not but that was not the only flaw in this film the direction was trying to be way too creative with what it was working with and the flashback sequences were used merely as a shock effect br br after watching this movie even if you enjoyed it go back and review the film and you will soon understand why it is not worthy of the praise it is receiving for an amazing serial killer film check out <UNK> if you have not done so that is what this film wanted to be i have gotten into more arguments about this film than probably any others and will continue to argue against it please do not support this franchise for not only your sake but mine and everybody else's sake as well hollywood needs to find a good horror movie to make rather than 1 000 remakes sequels and shock factor films such as this oh yeah the saw 2 tag line sounds real promising oh yes there will be blood sweet blood that must mean its good right give me a break sorry everybody who love this movie but poor writing flashy direction and bad acting does not make a good movie
<START> there is no need for me to repeat the synopsis rendered by glenn the black and white rendition is even more powerful in portraying the <UNK> of country village life at that time the deep measure of friendship shown by <UNK> toward the two elderly sisters touches the heart strings the supporting cast is excellent and their performances superb it would not be fair to single out any one character since the entire story depends on the cast as a whole i cannot put my finger exactly on why i rate this movie so highly since i am not a professional critic individual viewers may or may not agree with my rating since enjoyment of this type of movie is always in the eye of the <UNK>
<START> well where do i start br br as one of the other reviewers said you know you're in for a real treat when you see the opening shot minutes and minutes of film time spent on a guy standing on a br br i won't repeat <UNK> excellent summary of the story what i would like to say though is that this film <UNK> me more than any film i can remember i sat open mouthed and on the edge of my seat all the way through the camera work sound track and fantastic performances particularly that of tony draw you to the screen and won't let you look away br br it's italian so of course everyone looks fantastic but it is by no means merely an exercise in cool style this is a film with lots to say about luck loss and love br br go and see it
<START> this is a piece of celluloid crap you can tell when you are watching a wanna be mafia film and this is it this made no sense at all didnt start at the beginning of his life were all over the place and the term godfather didnt even exist until <UNK> wrote the book then the real mafia borrowed the phrase and made it their own after the movie this piece of <UNK> would have one thinking that the phrase representing the mafia don was used back in the <UNK> when these people were only called don outside of the original godfather movie if you want to see another decent mob flick check out <UNK> the last don part 1 part 2 sucked
<START> after high school track field laura dies of natural causes during a race an event that is shown multiple times in slow motion none the less an unknown killer is murdering all the people who were on that same aforementioned team close to <UNK> day hence the name in this laughably inept slasher flick it brings absolutely nothing new or even good to the slasher table instead <UNK> to merely <UNK> the most god awful song i've heard in quite some time with ' gangster <UNK> being played in a roller disco party that went on far too long br br eye candy denise <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> get topless br br my grade d
<START> i got seriously ripped off with this purchase the other posters pretty well cover the <UNK> of this poor poor film my dvd that i purchased actually had the 1978 <UNK> poster art on the cover with the credits for that film on the front by joe etc i was really disappointed to find the wrong film on the disc i am actually a fan of lots of bad movies there is always something funny or at least amusing on most of them somewhere not this film i am actually going to spend the three dollars in gas money to return this two dollar dvd just for the principle of the thing blatant false <UNK> here easily the worst movie of all time no redeeming factors at all boring not even worth checking out just to see how bad it is seriously
<START> i just saw this movie for the first time last night wow what a movie this is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to see because its just so cool and so interesting br br i do not want to give a single word about the plot because i think it would be better for people to go in cold do not read the plot summary before you see the movie all i'm going to say is that eastwood <UNK> peterson and the screenplay by jeff maguire are top notch i wish all thrillers were more like this one
<START> i really wish hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re make this movie is awful from the demille version all the way through this movie i was saying to myself huh what i don't remember that part the only exciting thing in this movie so far was the <UNK> of the red sea and in <UNK> version it was a heck of a lot better than this version did anyone else see an atomic or nuclear bomb cloud fade in and out when the red sea was being <UNK> i think i did anyway i might might watch the last part tonight br br i wish hollywood would tackle different ideas and subject matters when they are making new movies instead of re <UNK> old films br br they should of left well enough alone br br update br br well i watched the last part did <UNK> make up the second copy of the ten <UNK> with his own hand or was i seeing things please someone email me and let me know horrible
<START> this epic brings together a superbly gifted cast and crew a narrative depth superior to most novels wonderful music philosophy and a connection to life that i find difficult to explain to <UNK> <UNK> in die is for me akin to a spiritual experience similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky the language and use of both colour and <UNK> segments adds to the dramatic impact the film inspired me to go to <UNK> and visit some of the locations including the edgar office from then on i <UNK> to improve my german skills after die i feel almost german as if i am in the head of the characters i also try to match the piano playing of henry arnold <UNK> but this is the one thing that will always <UNK> me this drama is <UNK> and i have been fortunate to see it on <UNK> in the uk and <UNK> in australia the sequel 3 is currently being filmed in germany
<START> this is one of my favourite books and i remember watching this series and loving it immensely sadly i have never seen it repeated or been able to get on dvd but it made such an impact i have never forgotten it br br the lead characters were perfect for the roles especially the lovely bryan brown and although the scenes in australia were not entirely in keeping with the book at least they were there unlike the film version with virginia <UNK> which missed that part out altogether br br i agree that gordon jackson's character of is entirely different from the book but he is still excellent for your information is the <UNK> <UNK> of
<START> for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series starring kenneth <UNK> people interviewed by the police are hardy and often as bitter as the weather the lead investigator has huge family problems <UNK> <UNK> lead to <UNK> of the distant past and the plotting is <UNK> with strange <UNK> and subplots making sense only at the end both have excellent cinematography br br the plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequel br br really the script couldn't be more obviously from the cookie cutter you get even the most familiar of <UNK> such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview br br i'm absolutely convinced that this is <UNK> and jam for many folk but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television what i felt a keen lack of was message the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in <UNK> in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their <UNK> lots of information concerning the <UNK> of the population has been kept and many genetic <UNK> unique to <UNK> can be <UNK> effectively in a population that has <UNK> from and is remarkably <UNK> <UNK> it's like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies a company called <UNK> <UNK> attempted to set up a <UNK> carrying all the genetic and <UNK> information for the entire population of <UNK> due to <UNK> concerns this project was <UNK> and at the end of last year <UNK> <UNK> went <UNK> in <UNK> the episode is a rich topic for debate br br but in this movie <UNK> and medical science are not there for sake they're there for weird atmosphere br br it's a grisly movie if you are interested in that and there's often a morbid focus on food to <UNK> events like a <UNK> who eats lunch in between <UNK> the most <UNK> for me was when the lead inspector <UNK> a <UNK> head unfortunately for me this occasionally became <UNK> the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end this is the equivalent in cinematic terms of attempting to prepare if you're not well <UNK> <UNK> of hand and sharp of eye you poison the client this rather <UNK> director should have <UNK> the on his performance br br i walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general
<START> i caught this movie on tv yesterday i had a certain curiosity about it being that it was directed by <UNK> <UNK> and starring him and his real life dad martin sheen i love to see a movie about a father son relationship that involves a real life father and son naturally there's an instant chemistry between sheen and <UNK> and their scenes of conflict are even more intense knowing that they're actually related of course it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors i've seen martin sheen in intense roles before but i think this is most intense role being that i mostly recall him from the mighty <UNK> series and i was very impressed talent really does run in that family and kathy bates steals the movie in an oscar worthy performance she <UNK> at my <UNK> with every word of dialogue <UNK> williams the beautiful actress from the father of the bride movies is also very good holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors br br the movie is a bit <UNK> with dialogue that's obviously <UNK> for the stage but that didn't bother me this is not meant to be an action movie this is a character study and for a film that's based on a play it never gets too claustrophobic when character jeremy <UNK> to his days in vietnam we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life br br the film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental at the end i expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunky <UNK> but that's not how it turned out the ending made me cry without <UNK> to standard hollywood melodrama that proves reality is much more gripping than anything hollywood can <UNK> up br br if you're in the mood for a beautiful powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your <UNK> off please check out this underrated gem hopefully one day martin and <UNK> will <UNK> with charlie and they will all make a great film together br br my score 9 out of 10
<START> how can a name not even a real name break your heart here's how there have been few film versions of a celebrated novel that have done better justice to their source material than anthony movie of charles cold mountain if you've read the book you will be able to feel most of the major scenes soul <UNK> <UNK> i personally cried numerous times while reading the novel and spent much of the evening watching the film through tears br br astounding scope beautiful words great acting and great music in the interview on the dvd accompanying the film talks about the multiple layers of the story all of them work one of the best films i've seen and an <UNK> to one of the greatest novels of the last ten years
<START> the somewhat <UNK> brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother <UNK> in much the same way by acting out but that dad is <UNK> and <UNK> himself writer director dan harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the <UNK> characters with question marks hanging over them and then lays all the story points out in the most obvious terms suicide secrets gay shame family sickness ultimately aiming to wrap things up with a <UNK> bow harris wants to make sure we don't miss a trick initially giving us thoughtful material to <UNK> but then spelling everything out in an <UNK> sentimental fashion <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> performance as the family <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and she's a joy that is until harris gives her a make over complete with sensible new <UNK> it's the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head from
<START> <UNK> tries hard to be another <UNK> <UNK> poker for horse racing as the means by which to bring down an enemy but it fails miserably br br i watched the whole thing and still never could quite understand why the young kid wanted to double cross his partner was it because his partner stole his girl is there a woman in the world who is worth going to that much trouble over if there is it certainly wasn't this <UNK> she had no redeeming qualities whatsoever and really now did she actually have a special room set up so that a surgeon could remove the <UNK> from whoever tried to pick her up in a bar <UNK> <UNK> makes a short appearance as a rich woman who <UNK> of all things pay the rent poker parties at her <UNK> home and then the players say things like i'll see your thousand and raise you another five thousand give me a break you can't call see and raise you do one or the other any kid playing for <UNK> and <UNK> at the kitchen table knows this you'd think grown men playing for stakes this high or at least the <UNK> who wrote the script would know it too br br one of the other posters mentioned how no high limit poker game would allow players to actually deal their own cards and i agree you don't allow two of the best known car <UNK> into a game where the buy in is 250 000 and then let them deal to each other that's not poker that's just seeing which one can cheat better and i'd like to know what person in his right mind would buy in to a game in which two of the best known card <UNK> are playing and expect that he might have a chance at winning and most of all what mafia boss would run such a game every time <UNK> griffith came on the screen i was so <UNK> by those gigantic <UNK> red lips of hers that i completely lost the storyline and seeing her and stallone together was more like a public service <UNK> for plastic surgery gone wrong than a love connection stallone mentions that she used to be a <UNK> before she bought the restaurant she now runs but we don't know what kind of <UNK> she was and we never see her working with stallone in their younger days so we are left to wonder if we even care that much br br jamie foxx is the best character in the whole movie but he gets killed off right off the bat and we're left with cardboard cut outs who all sound like they're reading their lines off a <UNK> just off camera br br the ending makes no sense either the kid gets his cut from the game and just walks down the street with a <UNK> full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen the mafia isn't watching every move he makes everyone else just <UNK> their shoulders and quietly accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to <UNK> any of it i don't think so br br most of all this movie does a great injustice to professional poker players all over the world <UNK> that the only way to win is by cards and playing with <UNK> and why is it they're always kings and <UNK> sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a straight or full house br br the best parts of the whole film are the of hand tricks during the beginning and ending credits everything in between is ridiculous
<START> imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle ages and a <UNK> vampire and his <UNK> sidekick are chasing you where is the absolute last place you want to hide i'd say inside the uncanny virgin of <UNK> torture device because there's a good risk you'll get brutally <UNK> to death and yet the elderly lady in this film <UNK> runs into her <UNK> coffin the <UNK> coffin is a rather disappointing sequel as director <UNK> doesn't re create the gothic atmosphere of the 1957 original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs no more ominous <UNK> with eerie <UNK> and dark <UNK> but confused doctors and clumsy <UNK> that <UNK> laughs instead of <UNK> the story opens inside count de final <UNK> place where an <UNK> doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin in order to examine the corpse at a private clinic naturally the wooden stake gets removed from his heart and the vampire count comes to live again immediately <UNK> the petty thief to do his dirty work the vampire has his eye on a beautiful female patient at the clinic and it's up to dr <UNK> to rescue her soul and to destroy the <UNK> the <UNK> coffin uses a limited amount of locations and there's very little action the whole film would actually be pretty boring if it weren't for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances the photography is amazing though with the sublime use of shadows and darkness this is most notably during the scene in which count de stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night it's the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film the rest is fairly mediocre and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the last american virgin 1982 was one of the few teenage comedies that i really enjoyed the subject matter and the acting was well above the usual tripe that hollywood was and still is <UNK> out these days but for awhile the smaller studios were producing movies about teenagers that wasn't toned <UNK> or <UNK> for the <UNK> the men pulling the strings behind this production were from your friends from cannon br br three teenage buddies are trying to lose their virginity whilst still in high school they'll do anyone or anything to achieve their dream goal the sensitive one of the group andrew <UNK> what's to find the right girl while his two best friends will take whatever they can get one day the kid finds his perfect girl diane franklin but fate would play one of their foul tricks his best friend moves on in and <UNK> her off of her feet after knocking her up the sensitive kid helps the girl get back on her feet and pays for her abortion he still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart meanwhile his best friend has a very violent falling out over getting her dream girl <UNK> still he tries his best to get her to love him the night comes when he pops the question to her but his heart is <UNK> when he sees her dancing with his former best friend in tears the kid leaves the party br br what i enjoyed about this movie was that it pulled no punches instead of being filled with phony situations it was very realistic honest and brutal the movie's filled with it's share of funny moments and <UNK> i have to recommend this film for fans of teenage comedies br br highly recommended
<START> beware my lovely came on tv on <UNK> recently during the early hours so i set the video to record it and was pleased i did br br a man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he don't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a <UNK> at a <UNK> house but she does not know what she is taking on here it turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer he starts <UNK> her and locks her in the <UNK> he then cuts the phones line so she can't get help from the outside a young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isn't quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off eventually the man leaves acting as if nothing has happened br br i can see why beware my lovely was given an x <UNK> when released in the cinemas some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time i also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy too br br the cast features an excellent performance from robert ryan as the psychopath <UNK> <UNK> as the widow and are joined by barbara <UNK> and dee <UNK> as the boy br br this is certainly robert <UNK> most chilling performance i've seen a must see br br rating 4 stars out of 5
<START> the best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again n still not be content of watching it i have watched this movie least 10 times over the past 12 years and still it makes me laugh as if i was watching it for the first time i have great liking for good comics like the <UNK> cheech n chong monty python series and many others but this one in hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies some of them recently in hindi are <UNK> <UNK> series and series so all i can say is <UNK> comedy is finally <UNK> but <UNK> is pretty different from the movies i have said above its what i call the hindi stoned comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in hindi cinema cheers to <UNK> <UNK> for the brilliant movie
<START> i finally got a chance to settle in and compare the two versions of this film currently going around first the good old <UNK> sleazy <UNK> vhs print called and then a new fully restored italian dvd by everyone's new favorite media company no shame of italy br br the american <UNK> about men turned inside out is as everyone says totally misleading and <UNK> of a roger take on what otherwise would be a superior fantasy adventure thriller for grown ups the complete italian version is a somewhat <UNK> well designed and deliberately paced take on island of dr <UNK> and there's nothing wrong with that it's a <UNK> handsome euro horror outing with a brain good plotting character development location shooting period <UNK> and sets etc br br but i must admit that the 14 year old <UNK> <UNK> still lurking somewhere inside of me got a bigger kick out of the more lurid sleazy and <UNK> roger corman version which has some nice over the top gore a flashy but preposterous opening segment and then the bulk of <UNK> original film albeit somewhat <UNK> to make room for <UNK> idea of entertainment the pacing was somewhat <UNK> the shock sequences closer together and you see just as much of ms <UNK> fantastic form as you do in the extended italian version br br i still don't have much of an idea about what the specific story concerns though there are a number of plot twists and incidental characters that were somewhat hard to keep track of a local voodoo subplot didn't help much and it's funny how everything <UNK> in just another <UNK> between the noble <UNK> prisoner and the mad scientist perhaps a few more viewings are in order i will say this fans of the movie should <UNK> themselves of one of these pal <UNK> and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than just another murky old home video the widescreen shot compositions once again reveal that martino had an eye for filling his screen with interesting stuff nobody gets their heads ripped off like in the print but it's still interesting stuff and once again proof that while his standards may have been pretty much confined to the area around the <UNK> roger corman new good trashy fun when he had it made for him and side by side these are actually better movies than they had to be br br 7 10
<START> here's another of these modern day ultra sleaze comedies in which dysfunctional families are supposedly hilarious know wonder people once asked what ever happened to <UNK> shore well shore didn't disappear but his career took a nose dive that's for sure movies like this one didn't help br br in son in law shore plays an incredibly obnoxious character called crawl and yet he's the most likable of the family his father is a <UNK> idiot his mother is totally incompetent his young brother is a sex maniac and his college age sister is a real <UNK> br br watching an hour and a half of totally unlikeable people was tough to do i certainly wouldn't watch this again or recommend it to anyone but die hard shore fans adam sandler took <UNK> and went a lot further with it br br the following is an <UNK> from the imdb title page here under biography and it explains why i am not the only one who was disgusted with this movie br br but his <UNK> was <UNK> as crude dumb and for the most part unfunny his film career quickly <UNK> this downhill spiral was not helped by the failure of his failed fox sitcom <UNK> 1997 in 1997 <UNK> by both critics and media alike he was soon becoming a running joke and forced to lie low and ride out the storm
<START> there are places for political commentary in film but masters of horror is not one of them i get enough of this stuff from <UNK> and every other <UNK> in the newspaper now i've got to watch this in horror movies c'mon all i wanted was a good zombie schlock film not another bush is bad rant if joe <UNK> wants to express his politics let him go on air america and if you must insist on making a message film be a little more sly about it this had all the <UNK> of being slapped in the face with a dead fish br br by the way joe do you really want the left wing voting block to be associated with brain dead zombies might want to think about that before making another political horror movie god help us
<START> a must for any die hard <UNK> fans br br <UNK> does the role of <UNK> a amount of justice and although the <UNK> isn't 100 factual is still a good insight into the lives of both richard and karen and worth a watch just for the soundtrack br br makes me cry <UNK> br br
<START> i have read a lot of books in my short lifetime but this is by far the worst i just got done reading this worthless piece of trash and when i finished it i threw it across the room i hated it and let me state the reasons 1 the soldier dies why would the author make the soldier die why couldn't she have kept him alive like a good love story author would do i deeply applaud patty for trying to claw that fbi <UNK> eyes out br br 2 ruth <UNK> fired ruth the black <UNK> <UNK> fired and for no apparent reason too she tried to comfort patty and then <UNK> <UNK> dad fires her for no good reason ruth and anton and patty were the only bright spots in the book oh and the grandparents too 3 the <UNK> yes the <UNK> now you people might think why would the <UNK> upset you well here's why <UNK> mom asks the girl if she wants her hair done patty says no but the mom calls mrs reeves the horrible <UNK> and tells her to give patty a <UNK> why on god's green earth would she do that why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a <UNK> only to have her get a <UNK> anyway the mom always pretends that patty has a say when she <UNK> have a say at all she should be given the worst mother of the year award for the stuff she dose to patty thank god ruth cut her <UNK> off 4 <UNK> and i hate the <UNK> in this book they use the word <UNK> too much yes i know that in those days blacks were free but had basically no rights but come on why teach todays children that word it just teaches them how to <UNK> people not only were blacks <UNK> but the chinese too in the book people refer to mr lee a chinese man as the <UNK> that is really despicable and last but not least jews and i hate the town for spitting on a little girl what was so wrong for her liking anton she is a 12 year old girl it was just a crush like a 12 year old can really love a 22 year old come on this isn't <UNK> and <UNK> is a good book not a piece of filth i'm surprised that this movie isn't considered dirty like <UNK> is br br 5 patty going to a <UNK> patty should not have gone to that <UNK> are for thieves and murders not innocent 12 year olds the teacher or whatever she was called patty an <UNK> spoiled brat <UNK> spoiled brat my butt patty was not a spoiled brat because her father and mother never gave a rip about her patty should of got community service or something she did nothing wrong she just helped a friend br br 6 the parents played <UNK> with their children patty their daughter is clearly the least <UNK> while sharon the five year old brat is their favorite daughter the dad says that he wanted to take sharon to hollywood but clearly forgets his other daughter br br 7 the dad i hated him he was so mean patty might as well had hitler himself as her father her dad beats her for no apparent reason and the way he talks to her in the end will make you so mad you'll be caught thinking patty would get better treatment in a concentration camp br br well there you have it folks 7 reasons i hate this book instead of reading this book read the <UNK> of anne frank or anything else because i warn you it is very depressing and it will leave you really mad the only reason it gets 4 stars is because of anton patty ruth and the grandparents
<START> spoilers i sometimes wonder what makes sequel makers think that they have to explain and therefore destroy the mysteries behind iconic horror films the original <UNK> of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made the 1988 sequel <UNK> was also a fantastic horror film though i personally didn't like how the viewer got background information on the some of the all time <UNK> horror villains in the original the third part hell on earth 1992 was already quite a mess whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the <UNK> <UNK> creepy lead <UNK> a typical 90s stupidity and therefore destroyed most of his <UNK> this fourth part <UNK> <UNK> 1996 is slightly more atmospheric than the third one but it <UNK> this quality by <UNK> even more silly and completely unnecessary about the and the opening of the gates to hell br br seriously did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made i think not and that is not the only mystery about the that is <UNK> destroyed in this film the setting of <UNK> goes back and forth in three different periods the film begins in a <UNK> century space station when scientist dr <UNK> bruce <UNK> attempts to close the gates to hell forever when government soldiers <UNK> his mission he has to explain his reasons in 18th century paris <UNK> was a <UNK> assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult an <UNK> demon the princess of hell took over the body of the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> vargas since the only person capable of destroying the <UNK> to hell is the one who built it the <UNK> of the <UNK> would be cursed and his <UNK> <UNK> by throughout the ages the film which takes place in the 18th century the present and the <UNK> century really is quite a mess i admit that the part set in the 18th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film but its also its smallest part the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak and filled with stupid and <UNK> elements the film's undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make up and gore effects the absolutely ravishing <UNK> as the she demon and <UNK> doug <UNK> who in spite of having lost some of his creepiness still is a menacing villain it is an almost offensive idea for <UNK> fans however that <UNK> is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light show overall <UNK> is not a complete disaster but it sure is an <UNK> sequel to a series that began so brilliantly even director kevin was obviously embarrassed about it as he preferred to be credited as alan <UNK> overall this is only <UNK> to hardcore <UNK> fanatics and most of them are probably going to be <UNK> by another <UNK> of their favorite <UNK> creepiness all others are well advised to stick with the brilliant first and excellent second part of the <UNK> franchise and skip all the others the makeup effects in <UNK> are creepy as hell but almost everything else is disappointing my rating 3 5 10
<START> imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid now think what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your younger self or even change him you would you try to influence or try to change your younger beliefs in light of your future experience or perhaps the encounter would change your older perception of life and reality br br walt disney's the kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting older self bruce willis in a <UNK> course with younger self <UNK> <UNK> from the santa <UNK> 2 and the cat in the hat fame the result is a sometimes funny sometimes touching encounter which makes you <UNK> about your own past present and future  and truly believe it is never too late to change your course
<START> on the bright side it ended that's the only thing this movie has going for it of course br br this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen some bad ones this movie is actually so horrible i went and changed my rating for children of the living dead to a 2 just for not being <UNK> br br official one liner rating come with me to another movie if you want to live
<START> i went to see this by myself first to make sure it was suitable for my little boy to see br br thank goodness i did because i certainly would not allow any young child to see this why the violence death the funeral if you are not ready to explain these concepts to your kids then keep them away br br why on earth are these topics covered in a kids movie especially one that has a tag line of the original party animals might as well put a <UNK> execution in a hello kitty cartoon br br as for laughs there were very few and far between speaking for myself there were none the <UNK> looked remarkably similar to the <UNK> in the the far side comics i guess there isn't anything original about this movie apart from the addition of ridiculous violence and <UNK> activities for all the young kids to enjoy
<START> well first of all i am a big fanatic of horror movies but however i am pretty sick of all those damn american horror movies they are all about the same thing blood and violence it's not even creepy well it's wrong with the blood and all that doesn't even bother me but that's not what makes a movie creepy that's why i find this movie entertaining it's fun to see a satire which is making fun of the main horror usa american splatter gore movies they are not suppose to be creepy only funny that's ok but when they're suppose to be creepy it mostly gets pathetic however there are a few great american horror movies <UNK> psycho birds but in the end it's all the same thing that's why this movie came as a relief evil ed is not just a cult movie it's a classic i can't wait <UNK> master director <UNK> makes another <UNK> splatter movie <UNK> than i have to watch evil ed again and again and again but i don't care it is such an outstanding movie
<START> i just called my brother paulie on the phone and he said he was watching <UNK> and it was funny so like i said never go against the family the demand for more lines is ok since i like to express my own opinions quite frequently if something is <UNK> it's most likely my <UNK> and not my brain this gives me yet another chance to take my shots at the <UNK> when one knows exactly what is going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge that usually means it wasn't all that suspenseful all you need is a good <UNK> the same guy i believe who did my favorite mob movie <UNK> but in a completely different way and then just throw in jack the great and you got yourself an oscar easy as pie i have to see <UNK> to make sure it wasn't better than the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> great movie the sound track is awesome very relaxing sound <UNK> was ahead of his own time even back in 1971 lewis gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film the movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air the sound tracks written by sir <UNK> <UNK> the movie to a t rex morris does a great job with the <UNK> <UNK> on the song honey roll and poem i meant to do my work today by richard le was incredible kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film it was no surprise that a lot of the people involved with this movie went on to become the best in their field
<START> this movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths well written by <UNK> black the film is executed <UNK> by the cast under the <UNK> eye of director jack clearly is a director that we should look out for in the future his strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the <UNK> br br this thought provoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action drama suspense and mystery as with all good films the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie the mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and adds to the suspense you find your self looking for the answers along with <UNK> audiences have liked the movie on the festival circuit with many awards received they must have agreed that a w o l 2006 is well worth watching br br i'd love to own a copy how do i go about getting one
<START> so lets say you are a producer you have some money and you somehow got richard gear and bruce willis so now all you need is a script but why bother see this movie is really terrible the acting is pretty good but the casting is awful gear and willis did their best to play these characters they simply cant play now this movie has no plot or rather there's something that tries to pass off as a plot there's a mean hit man willis who is cool dangerous and sophisticated actually he's none of those things but from some dialog between the other characters you are supposed to get this impression so this hit man is on a mission to kill someone now there's an ex ira prisoner who is kind and nice and very likable gear who the fbi release from prison so he will help them so now the fbi is investigating to find this hit man the investigation consists of a series of unlikely information like some random person lost his <UNK> and someone used his name to buy a car which is always right on the money since there's no real plot and the script is so crappy you cant expect any real character development or tension so instead of creating them through the story they simply add some <UNK> dramatic music which <UNK> you that something very dramatic is going on instead of actually creating something dramatic br br the bottom line is that this is a very bad movie and a complete waste of time which somehow got an incredibly high score for its level probably because of the cast and this is exactly what the producers where counting on
<START> this show is absolutely ridiculous yes of course its fake but it is <UNK> to watch i personally know more creative film influenced minds that could make this seem real the young lead male couldn't be more unconvincing he line reads everything he says are we really suppose to believe he knows what he is talking about there is a <UNK> of ways to blair witch this show up fear does not breed from what seems cool and computer generated nor does it generate from such proverbial lines as what was that did you hear that also there are real convincing <UNK> out there that don't just want to be on screen another duh factor is how do these producers think we are actually going to buy that <UNK> activity will just magically happen within the 2 possibly 3 days if we are lucky they film i don't think so a 2 week at one site would be more convincing it is also <UNK> that they think including <UNK> radar <UNK> and that show fancy <UNK> really make us scared and ie <UNK> should not be staged like the film the exorcist when are they going to get it right possession of the devil or other evil spirits influence people differently they don't just <UNK> and lower their voice like linda blair or around like <UNK> love on a drug <UNK> as stated better on psychic ability would aid this show greatly we want to see and hear everything that flashes before them not cut away to other story <UNK> on a final note shooting stars do not generate interest when you showed fake pictures of <UNK> ahead of time might i stress again the young dark haired man that <UNK> this show is absolutely down right awful avoid this show for fright watch old <UNK> mystery episodes not the new ones the recreation got it oh so wrong but that is for a different <UNK>
<START> i gave this film my rare 10 stars br br when i first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line i almost turned it off i am very glad i didn't br br this is a character driven film a true story which revolves mainly around the life of rachel <UNK> crosby a strong beautiful inside and out black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of <UNK> br br highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of <UNK> and the people who lived at her <UNK> but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for african americans in the 1950's prior to <UNK> and the good and bad sides of <UNK> and how it ultimately affected and changed the black community br br in addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast there is some fine singing and dancing from that era
<START> i saw this movie when i was very young living in <UNK> texas i really enjoyed this movie and i wrote to jean peters in hollywood and i told her how much i enjoyed seeing her in this movie she sent me an <UNK> photo this movie was directed by jacques <UNK> and besides jean peters in the starring role it also stars louis debra <UNK> and herbert marshall it was released in 1951 in color and is <UNK> minutes long jean peters was married to howard hughes she also starred in <UNK> <UNK> with marlon brando anthony quinn who won an oscar for playing the role brother marlon brando starred as <UNK> <UNK> and she also starred in captain from <UNK> with <UNK> power since then i've been trying to find a place where it is available but so far i have not been successful does anybody have any <UNK> about where i can find and purchase this movie it this comment contains spoilers i am unaware of it
<START> i went to the cinema in 1973 when the film was released i was 11 at the time i remember how much i enjoyed it and wanted to live in <UNK> la that's how naive and young i was i recently came across a video of the film i had recorded off television some years ago i watched it again and am not ashamed to admit i still enjoy it as much now as i did <UNK> years ago i also enjoy listening to the words of the songs because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of guns don't pound in our ears and if we look at our reflection we should be happy with what we see this is what i call a feel good film because i feel happy after watching it maybe i am still naive but it makes me happy and i'm sure it will make you happy if you watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is a good family film i must be one of the few people who has this film on vhs pal video and dvd self made i recorded it on dvd as the <UNK> recording from tv was starting to wear thin i still watch it from time to time
<START> a teen age boy who is not in the military and has not trained to be a jet pilot takes off for a foreign country to rescue his dad if this is not ridiculous enough he talks a colonel in the air force into helping him get his hands on a jet wow to make the picture even more absurd the colonel risks his career and life by giving the <UNK> <UNK> some hands on aid they not only don't make like this anymore but they never did this sappy corny film should be tossed into the air and blown away by a
<START> even before this film it is clear to see that ali g has become the exact character he set out to parody i am not a fan of <UNK> baron <UNK> character anyway but was curious to see how a man of so little talent was able to convince universal studios to <UNK> a near 1 and a half hour feature film out of a 3 minute joke br br a paper thin plot is just a <UNK> of penis and marijuana jokes and i must admit i did cringe when i saw such respected <UNK> as charles dance and michael <UNK> so low for <UNK> saying that i must admit even if i am quite ashamed to that i did raise a <UNK> on more than one occasion and however bad this film was it was never boring and never once did i consider switching it off mainly due to the gorgeous saying that only watch this film if you are a teenage <UNK> aged between 14 to 17 and you find dick jokes hilarious
<START> oh man talk about the effect of advertising apparently all that you have to do to enjoy box office <UNK> is title your movie after a <UNK> 19th century novel horrendous acting directing and cinematography in this <UNK> of an effort
<START> king <UNK> <UNK> of romania is a vampire but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with mankind but his son <UNK> is a cruel creature to his very heart which is pretty obvious as soon as you see him three female students have come to study local <UNK> but find themselves drawn into the vampires legends at just the wrong time has been killed br br who can say anything bad about a film featuring a cameo from <UNK> <UNK> i can't i mean i had some low expectations after seeing other full moon pictures puppet master in particular and demonic toys but despite the really bad animated effects of the demons this film was actually really well done and very fun to watch plenty of blood a good plot and <UNK> the story was surprisingly refreshing and even some new angles on the vampire <UNK> which you'd think would be dead by now maybe i'm wrong but this is probably the first film to feature <UNK> <UNK> being fired from a gun aside from vampires and blood you get a share of nudity gratuitous but welcome and i had to notice the excellent score from the <UNK> not sure who deserves credit but those involved include stuart richard william <UNK> michael and john this is horror 101 all the way heck you even get two sequels which is the sign of a true horror film of course some bad films get sequels too did i mention puppet master the romanian theme was well done and the film even seems to have been made by <UNK> if i am guessing their name origins correctly and the score the music really stood out for me as a nice change of pace very mood setting i like richard band but i'm glad another composer was given a shot because he nailed the atmosphere on the head if you like vampire films and want a slight variation one of the eastern european variety this is worth seeing
<START> some critics have compared chop shop with the theatrical releases of city of god and <UNK> i've seen both of those as well as chop shop and like in many instances i don't feel the comparison is <UNK> city of god and <UNK> surely had a much higher budget chop shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope disappointment and continuing with life one of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the us open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the us open footage was added i say that because i live in the area where this movie was filmed and security is insane while the <UNK> matches are in progress it's also noteworthy that the actors actual names were their character's names in the movie back to the movie it's an enjoyable story about survival however it ended up getting a 7 because at times the actors acted extremely well at other times they appeared to be just <UNK> their lines if the actors were less competent as they were in the low budget the big <UNK> for example i would have been more <UNK> but in several scenes each and every one of these actors gave <UNK> performances at other times they appeared bored the director might be at fault here i also had problems with the ending this is one of those movies that just ends maybe there will be a part 2 definitely worth getting on dvd i wont bother <UNK> up the story because that info is already available on imdb
<START> as an english teacher i appreciate films that do more than tell a story good films like good literature cause one to think reflect and predict this film made me do all three mr <UNK> takes risks and uses <UNK> symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters i also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film their choices do not seem as adolescent or as other films i have seen the acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other excellent soundtrack with songs you don't hear on the radio it is a <UNK> with life spontaneous road trip film that deserves more than just a second glance
<START> i went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a comeback for robin williams but when i saw it i realized i had <UNK> <UNK> to by <UNK> as this is more drama than comedy although it has a few really good laughs in it it felt like i was watching two movies one was a funny romp with robin williams that should have been the whole <UNK> for the movie anyway but you also get a <UNK> thriller movie with political angst in the middle i really don't know how to <UNK> this film but i can tell you it was good and i did laugh not as much as i had hoped but at least williams is back in the right direction see this but know before going it is not all comedy and is a little intense
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was born into a <UNK> family in the <UNK> although the have been well known for their <UNK> over the decades the business has fallen on hard times meanwhile grace carpenter lauren holly is a most talented <UNK> maker in manhattan but she can not seem to land a prime position because of the glass ceiling an accidental meeting between <UNK> and grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for them both there is a high profile <UNK> off the golden <UNK> taking place in the near future and <UNK> wants grace to partner with him there is a <UNK> amount of <UNK> haha at stake for the winners enough to set grace up in her own business and save the <UNK> too reluctantly grace agrees but there are complications some of the judges and fellow contestants may have past issues with both grace and <UNK> then too although <UNK> and grace both feel some sort of attraction for the other grace has a long standing very rich boyfriend can <UNK> and grace win the contest this is a lovely film for the romantic at heart first there is the nice cast holly has always been a lovely actress with a notable <UNK> voice that <UNK> her <UNK> in this film she is perfectly cast as the determined but beautiful grace <UNK> a newcomer <UNK> too as the good looking rival baker the rest of the actors including the wonderful brenda <UNK> as mother is quite nice as a hallmark movie the costumes sets and production <UNK> are beyond <UNK> and the script still manages to seem fresh and funny despite some familiar themes treat yourself <UNK> lovers to a most sweet <UNK> by <UNK> a viewing of this film it is definitely the movie equivalent of a big box of quality <UNK>
<START> i was surprised once more my darling had not generated enough votes at this writing for a user rating it's a <UNK> comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years robert <UNK> mission places him in some very improbable situations and he's just the man for the job he maintains his trademark <UNK> look throughout the film and hysterically too ann <UNK> plays his <UNK> eccentric <UNK> who assumes a relationship that does not exist her character is <UNK> enough to warrant the <UNK> <UNK> killer but remains cute and <UNK> br br among the <UNK> of b movies from the late 1940's and 1950's once more my darling is a standout this one is worth looking for
<START> i was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when i first saw it i was only mildly amused i must say however that i am still very disappointed that donald <UNK> wasn't given a bigger and better role he was an enormous talent br br there is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and matthau has never been funnier br br i am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see lemmon and matthau team up for the very last time in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use brent <UNK> proves that data from star trek the next is not the only good character he can play br br the storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and i laughed <UNK> throughout this movie and i highly recommend it
<START> many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying men standing in close groups and speaking in <UNK> up tone a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today soon u will know someone in the house has died the dead person's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people her friend sitting beside her gives an idea of making the matters easy by preparing simple one of the dead person's son is speaking with someone over the mobile daughter is busy with her makeup her mother suggests her to wear but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will be visiting their house and hence prefers <UNK> and t shirt over another son asks her mom to finish all the and also <UNK> to her that he should not be expected to come early from the office then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person the white cloth covering the face is <UNK> slightly due to the wind revealing the face its <UNK> <UNK> suddenly alarm rings and he gets up from the bed is it his dream or a flash back u won't get an answer until the end of the movie well this is <UNK> comedy is for the director later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream is this a film comedy well it is supposed to belong to that category but it actually does not there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie more over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from police so everyone must cheat the <UNK> or forget about justice music by is ok nothing much to tell about other <UNK> bad script destroys everything not even <UNK> performance succeeds in making it at least a
<START> mr bean is just a bunch of unfunny slapstick humour it is the most shallow humour tv series ever made in history the scenes are often disgusting and the horrible <UNK> laughter sends chills through the spine mr bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only <UNK> how pathetic he is it is incredible that such a tv series of low quality can be <UNK> for 5 years it is a complete waste of time to watch even 1 episode and one can't help but to express disgust and pity why <UNK> had portrayed himself as such a 2 dimensional unfunny and ridiculous character or pity yourself why you had even bother to watch an episode watching this is an <UNK> experience
<START> sorry sorry but sorry nice very nice production very nice actors also funny but this type of the movies with a dog rex german jerry american with a private detectives with a pretty rich woman hello producer how many movies we have out there with the same plot what do u have on your minds when you make the scenes like dog having a or any king of that dog activities <UNK> <UNK> who can make you rich <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> a fortune there is three master <UNK> wow and the creator of the <UNK> can't make the same <UNK> again hello wake up can give us something smarter than that best d
<START> and now i'm up to episode 7 i really was hoping it'd be over by now not to mention canceled once everything connected with the show including the actors had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere never to be seen again because this series really is dire br br to have this program listed under the genre of <UNK> is at best misleading it's so hard to believe ben <UNK> could write something this bad maybe this points to a lot of <UNK> from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before in some episodes i haven't even laughed once br br oh and i can't believe <UNK> actually stopped doing <UNK> <UNK> started doing this instead his decision making skills were obviously <UNK> that day perhaps he simply can't read and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for were don't get me wrong <UNK> <UNK> is not masterpiece but it's a million times better than this piece of junk br br and just to annoy me even more i bet this gets a dvd release as well when there are so many great tv <UNK> that aren't getting released
<START> this film grabbed me right from its start where a sweet looking teen aged girl is shown visiting a grave alone then <UNK> john's powerful song friends starts playing while she's shown walking alone through the streets of paris carrying a <UNK> <UNK> unaware of the car <UNK> and prostitution going on around her the entire film is a beautiful dreamy romantic collection of scenes of young love holding hands living in the country wild horses running around <UNK> fields of <UNK> <UNK> of wine <UNK> by the <UNK> having fun and general innocence all set to romantic music by <UNK> john it's magical br br somehow i missed seeing this film when i was growing up i'm sure it would have left a strong impression on me if i had seen it then i remember the radio <UNK> for the movie in 1971 talking about how it was a special movie with music by <UNK> john and with the chorus of the theme song friends playing in the ad friends for the world to see but i never heard anything else about it in those days and never got to see it until i rented it 35 years later from a video store by then it had been edited <UNK> and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political <UNK> were using all kinds of ugly words to describe the film what can i say the world has gone insane since then br br the story is that a 14 year old girl is forced to move in with her cousin in paris after both her parents die it was their grave she was visiting in the opening scene one day while visiting the <UNK> alone she meets a 15 year old boy they hit it off and agree to meet the next day the next day while riding together the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a <UNK> solo car accident it was his father's car he can't bear to go back home to face his father's wrath so the two teenagers begin living in the french countryside together with the mutual background that they both hated their lives at home they settle into an <UNK> <UNK> the boy takes odd jobs to support themselves their supposed friendship turns into romance the girl becomes pregnant and they successfully have a baby at home all the while the boy's father has the police attempting to locate his missing son on the 1 year <UNK> of the <UNK> flight together the police finally locate the boy's <UNK> by an in person <UNK> and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work the next morning the boy is shown leaving his <UNK> to go to work saying a sweet farewell to his girlfriend wife and happily doing <UNK> as the scene <UNK> on his girlfriend waving goodbye at least that's how the video version i saw ends it's an unexpected though well timed ending presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents' home and his happy life with his wife and baby is <UNK> br br as beautiful as the story and images are the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived i think it's better just to enjoy the movie as a young person's dream come true fantasy and to go no further in analysis because all logic and believability quickly fall apart when the story is examined in more depth why would a fully <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> be left <UNK> with the door <UNK> and for a full year what did they plan to do when the owners returned why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant from him didn't they think it was <UNK> to use other people's homes and food how could they ever hope to get needed dental care or other <UNK> medical attention while living outside of society how could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no <UNK> and no other cars around where are there places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run free how is it that a teenage male would not have sex as the primary thing on his mind when he picks up a girl at a <UNK> the <UNK> john song lyrics just don't fit why would they take off clothes when sleeping outside at night when it's about to get cold and so on the scenes of wild horses are contrived to appeal to girls as is the unrealistic theme of friendship before romance and all the back <UNK> and <UNK> scenes with their predictable <UNK> the running through flower fields towards each other the <UNK> <UNK> the scenes shot through in the <UNK> the baby <UNK> and so on it works but it's definitely contrived br br still this is a movie about youth and freedom and that ideal hasn't changed since the 1970s young people today are still treated as <UNK> or as lost pets to be <UNK> by the police instead of treated as mature human beings who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as does the adult world and the ability to be responsible when given that freedom therefore the message is universal it's clear why a sequel wouldn't work this story is about a magical year long <UNK> from the real world such a situation could never have been extended <UNK> assuming that it could even happen in the first place and a story about real life afterward would lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence i really hope that no teenagers took the film seriously enough to try such a foolish stunt but i hope equally well that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the '70s learned something from it and have since then made attempts to make such a magical world a more <UNK> reality for others instead of <UNK> <UNK> various <UNK> and <UNK> especially on their own children
<START> the stooges are back and funnier than ever <UNK> <UNK> in my opinion was probably the best <UNK> flick br br <UNK> has the opportunity to <UNK> 500 000 which was probably more than a million dollars compared to today from his dead uncle but there is a catch he has to marry someone that day by 6 <UNK> <UNK> is a bachelor with not too many <UNK> except for one high pitched aggressive annoying singing student of his but he doesn't want her he wants someone a little more on the victoria's secret model type of women but obviously he has no choice since he's no <UNK> <UNK> himself but when it is <UNK> in the papers that he is to <UNK> all that money if married his ex girlfriends are on the i want my man back attack br br what a great <UNK> flick this is up there with of all <UNK> flicks br br 9 10
<START> loosely based on novels by earl 20th century <UNK> charlie chan series proved an audience favorite but when japan attacked pearl harbor the studio feared audiences would turn against its asian hero this was a <UNK> actor sidney <UNK> took the role to poverty row <UNK> studios where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in <UNK> br br 20th century fox had regarded the chan films as <UNK> b movies but even so the studio took considerable care with them the plots were often silly but the pace was sharp the dialogue witty and the casts which featured the likes of bela lugosi and ray <UNK> always expert the result was a kindly charm which has stood the test of time <UNK> was a different matter chan films were b movies plain and simple little care was taken with scripts or cast and resulting films were flat mediocre at best virtually unwatchable at worst br br thanks to an adequate cast and a few interesting plot devices the shanghai <UNK> is among the best of the <UNK> made chan films but even so it barely manages to achieve a consistent mediocrity in this particularly entry chan sidney <UNK> is called upon to investigate a murderer who kills with what appears to be a <UNK> like bite at the same time he decides to make certain that a government supply of <UNK> <UNK> away in a bank vault of all places remains secure do these two seemingly unrelated plot lines come together well could be sidney <UNK> is always enjoyable as chan but most of his <UNK> performances seemed <UNK> in and that is as true of <UNK> as it is of any <UNK> chan film as usual the really enjoyable performer is <UNK> changing times have led us to look upon brand of comedy as <UNK> to african americans but he was an expert actor and comic and taken within the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s his work has tremendous charm and innocence br br fans of the 20th century fox series are likely to find chan a significant disappointment and <UNK> who like the <UNK> films will probably consider them third rate after <UNK> the fox films like other <UNK> chan films the shanghai <UNK> is best left to determined <UNK> four stars and that's being generous br br <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie i've seen in a very long time granted i spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once i had accepted that i would never understand everything from the subtitles i was able to enjoy the film br br can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that <UNK> over the enemy what does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the <UNK> why does <UNK> wear seriously diamond <UNK> does any of this matter when faced with the sheer <UNK> of the visuals and the sly humour of the characters any battle for my heart was won once i saw the main protagonist dressed as spider man awesome many people will complain about a lack of story <UNK> but for a fun movie to laugh about with a bunch of mates you can't do better especially if you do an alcoholic shot every time someone says i will love you 10 000 years
<START> 1st watched 4 30 2009 4 out of 10 <UNK> john waters corny waters like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn't make a whole worthwhile experience john waters directed this music filled spoof of the fifties scene with johnny <UNK> playing the title role this movie is very similar with what he did with the 60's spoof entitled <UNK> but this one is not as effective some of the tunes are catchy some of the characters are interesting in their quirky waters like way and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone the storyline is similar to the movie grease where there is a good group and a bad group the guy from the bad group cry baby a girl from the good group the good girl then joins the bad group but once cry baby hurts her she falls back to the good group this just sets up the ending where cry baby tries to win her back now one difference that is expected in <UNK> movies is that the bad group doesn't appear all that bad all the time and the good group acts like they have a pole up their you know what i definitely saw this in <UNK> as well the wacky and <UNK> isn't really all that much fun in this movie though and it just leaves us with a feeling like the movie could have been much better the prime appeal of the johnny <UNK> character is that he's able to make one tear roll down his cheek thus his <UNK> at various times and makes the women fall all over the place for him this is <UNK> and the basic bottom line is that the movie is ok but not that great
<START> the city story is a brutal hard hitting <UNK> about what was once dubbed the town in america the film documents the events that led up to the murder by the city crime <UNK> of albert <UNK> an <UNK> attorney who made a <UNK> for the state attorney <UNK> office as a way to clean up the vice and corruption <UNK> his hometown his son john <UNK> picked up his father's <UNK> after his death and won the post making clean up of city a primary item on his agenda br br director phil created a film that has the ability to shock even today the <UNK> is so relentless that the film is actually difficult to watch we see the crime <UNK> beat and kill in order to get what they want the <UNK> and killings include women and children and one scene in particular revolving around the death of a little black girl is especially disturbing it's not exactly an enjoyable film because there's very little payoff at the end to reward the viewer for sitting through the <UNK> events leading up to it but it's a well made film full of an intense and angry energy br br a 15 minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the actual inhabitants of city some of who are then portrayed by actors in the fictional portion of the film it lends the film a quality of urgency that carries over into the narrative so that we feel like we're watching a documentary the entire time a feeling that's helped by choice to film on actual locations br br i'm glad i saw this movie but it's one of those films that fills you with a sense of righteous <UNK> and then makes you feel helpless because you can't do anything about it br br grade a
<START> this movie is stunningly free from storytelling it's a pure experience where the music <UNK> the visual impression words cannot of course enough express what should be expressed but it is the <UNK> of the <UNK> classes that <UNK> is put forward entered into production lines of mediocrity and therefore a necessity in order to express any sensible thought or opinion about something which should not need to be <UNK> by <UNK> therefore these elaborate opinions are put forward to satisfy those empty minds which need to be filled by noise that you will not find however hard you try in this movie
<START> was certainly not the best movie i have seen however i cannot describe the way the movie made me feel while watching it and how i felt as it ended and also how i feel about it now very few movies have such an effect on me i like them or i do not i look at as a work of art we all see something in it and it may remind us of something or it may <UNK> fear or fun etc this movie had me in not the best mood in fact it left me feeling empty somehow i guess because the lives these two persons led were so empty in so many ways they had no direction their only direction was to have no direction they had many problems to deal with and i guess needed to get away from what could not have been a happy life but on the way things really only got worse a steady decline from where it started it was sad as it was so well acted and i guess we have all most likely seen someone in some situation that may in some way resemble the situation these folks were in they might have had a good life if they had any idea how but it wes clear they did not know what to do so they kind of <UNK> to <UNK> they had heard about no real goal they had no idea how to have a goal they had no idea how to overcome the life that was set before them i felt bad but could not stop watching the movie only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that i would not like if just anyone played the parts these two did a great job to the point you just did not see the acting i am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it is available on dvd you know it left me feeling a little like leaving los vegas did but again it is in a class of its own not a great movie but well worth an hour or two on the right day if you are a person who has problems i would not suggest you watch it it could <UNK> you it depressed me and i have not the conditions these folks had
<START> this movie was an all around uninspiring film it was a non moving story that definitely does not get you thinking anything other then where is all the strong moving material the other critics say about the film the 3 main actors are good and there is a few laughs but once again it becomes another movie that you keep watching in hopes of it getting better and it just doesn't i watched this movie last night and wished that we hadn't wasted our precious time while baby is sleeping watching this film br br i plan not to recommend this to my family and friends as well as obviously anyone looking to rent it i was pretty much non impressed with everything about this film
<START> originally i was a <UNK> d fan of their first album and naturally listened to a few tracks off the p o d and was rather disappointed after watching the movie my view was changed the movie is pretty funny from beginning to the end and found my self engaged in it even though it was really was a stupid storyline because of the attitudes that and portray in the movie br br much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies i have seen in the theaters lately ex saw iii dull and dragging casino <UNK> way to <UNK> erotic which in prior <UNK> i have really enjoyed br br if you enjoyed <UNK> you will enjoy the tale of the greatest band on earth
<START> i do not like <UNK> i do not like his singing too but his songs are a <UNK> in india especially among <UNK> now when he <UNK> to become an actor  that was a big joke what guts he has to <UNK> as much as he can in his prime time i did never want to see this movie but one thing changed it the movie becoming a super <UNK> hit after 2 weeks <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> box office collection of 14 <UNK>  compared to that has <UNK> 7 <UNK> in the same 2 weeks if i can sit through and absurd <UNK>  i should give this movie also a try to understand what stuff this movie has got that made it such a big hit the story is about the real life singer <UNK> <UNK> who has gone to germany for a concert and falls in love with a german lawyer ruby <UNK> loves <UNK> now <UNK> is arrested for a murder the mission of <UNK> in last 40 minutes after he runs away from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murderer br br let me say that <UNK> has nothing in him to become a hero he tries hard but fails miserably he is pathetic i was thinking what could have made the movie click so much let me find something positive br br first the saving grace of the movie is the script till the point <UNK> runs away from the jail but after that the movie nose <UNK> into unbearable stupid limits second the songs of the movie are good catchy crowd numbers third <UNK>  she looks gorgeous and acts well too as the second lady i can imagine fans of <UNK> coming to see the movie just for her fourth the cinematography of the movie is pleasing  especially the german locales are a treat to watch for the eye fifth the major portion of the story is a love story between <UNK> and  with clichéd dialogues that would probably connect to young crowd sixth the director <UNK> <UNK> has done a decent job in covering the pathetic acting skills of <UNK> as much as possible with shots that don't need <UNK> to act much br br the heroine looks like a small budget film heroine raj is wasted in a small role overall the movie is a below average br br i was thinking throughout the movie  what if the same movie script was done with <UNK> as the main lead i think it would have had been a much better affair may be then i would have given the movie 6 out of 10 but stars 4 5 out of 10
<START> this early film from future <UNK> lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub genre set in rural italy there is a serial killer of children at large add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a <UNK> a newspaper reporter <UNK> police a sexy <UNK> a priest a mute girl a mentally retarded loner etc this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's br br unusually for a giallo the victims in this case are young boys which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle the fact that it is kids who are the target of the maniac only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable fulci is pushing the <UNK> a bit here and he goes even further in a <UNK> outrageous scene where a young boy is subjected to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a sexy naked young woman barbara <UNK> who he is <UNK> with delivering a drink to she displays herself openly and <UNK> invites the <UNK> to <UNK> her ultimately asking him if he wants to go to bed with her although she is clearly playing around with him it's still quite an unusual scene admittedly there are one or two unintentionally funny bits of dialogue here but it's very nicely photographed and barbara <UNK> exudes high levels of confident sex appeal a standout scene even if you might feel slightly wrong watching it br br along with barbara <UNK> the other standout performance is from <UNK> <UNK> who plays a <UNK> who is accused of murdering the children she is not directly responsible but it is left to the viewer to decide whether her black magic may or may not have kicked off the subsequent killing spree <UNK> she is hunted down by a lynch mob and chain whipped while a car radio <UNK> out rock music this scene is very strong and unpleasant its <UNK> <UNK> the path <UNK> career would subsequently go br br despite the visceral impact of the above murder it's maybe a little surprising that the other killings are either <UNK> or committed off screen the only other death scene comparable with the lynch mob is the demise of the killer at the end of the movie although this sequence is kind of silly the plot is convoluted and <UNK> with red herrings although personally i found the identity of the killer a little predictable this weakness is less <UNK> on subsequent viewings though  like most <UNK> don't torture a <UNK> is <UNK> re watchable br br technically the film is well made with impressive camera work solid acting and effective music from <UNK> <UNK>  particularly good is a recurring <UNK> female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill fulci obviously went on to make more <UNK> violent horror movies but here he shows a talent for slightly more restrained material it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema

<START> i am ashamed to admit in public that i even held the cover of this movie once this is an absolute reason why one should research on the movie before seeing it the of this movie have called us all fools and <UNK> losers with too much time on our hands br br based on the mythical indian shape shifting powerful <UNK> and <UNK> the story takes us for a painful ride college going 40 actors now really are the target of their former friend who was in her former life a <UNK> but is now a ghost and her pathetic eternal powerful boyfriend <UNK> killing machine boyfriend who thankfully hasn't been seen since now do you need to know more br br i vote for studying for the upcoming test in school rather than this movie give it a pass if you are sane if not then you'll probably enjoy it
<START> this story is about a <UNK> in africa that meets some guy named <UNK> who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babes naturally they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men the rest is pretty predictable br br this movie has everything you'd expect in a bargain basement movie about africa the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage film of animals that are not native to the continent such as <UNK> <UNK> and ground <UNK> a white actor in dark makeup playing a native bad acting particularly from <UNK> a handsome man with the personality of <UNK> wood comic relief sounding like <UNK> marx a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikini clad white women with <UNK> who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors like a tribe of angry female <UNK> by the look of it my <UNK> is that the movie was made for under <UNK> 95 including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit but what i didn't expect was an imdb score of 4 9 this is poor but not that poor considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense and there is no <UNK> reason why the film is rated that high now i am not saying the film isn't worth seeing it's campy and stupid enough to make enjoyable viewing particularly with friends just don't expect anything resembling a <UNK> made or competent film br br finally here's a <UNK> of the dialog from this jungle classic br br like strong white man want strong white man br br br br me <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> man
<START> not many people outside <UNK> have had an opportunity to become familiar with brilliant <UNK> he's very popular in <UNK> for his fantasy short stories i believe none of them has ever been translated english alas to make a long story short the main character of books is a traveling monster <UNK> a man of extraordinary <UNK> and skill he's pretty much your favourite <UNK> style cool guy unfortunately no one would figure this out after watching the film the movie is nothing but a collection of random scenes featuring and other characters from <UNK> but not remotely resembling the plot and dramatic pace of the original event the fact that some of the shots in the film show attractive naked women does not add any quality to it the movie gets worse and worse with every minute and does not even meet the <UNK> of <UNK> bad it's actually <UNK> category if you really are into and want to learn something about read the books instead
<START> this digital horror film brings us into the <UNK> budget film genre where the more blood and chicks in distress the better the story is weak the acting is respectable and the special effects well they're special alright a quality horror film for the fans that already know what to expect
<START> flashes of lightning a <UNK> cemetery the name of adam <UNK> west all pop up on screen before the opening credits are even over and yet despite these rather <UNK> elements one dark night isn't as cheesy as it might first seem br br meg <UNK> <UNK> sister plays pretty student julie who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a <UNK> as part of her <UNK> into <UNK> high school <UNK> the sisters what julie doesn't realise is that the other plan to freak her out with some <UNK> that the most recent body to be <UNK> in the <UNK> is that of <UNK> who <UNK> off the life force of scared young women br br admittedly this isn't the most original of set ups but thankfully there are enough inventive touches to help set this film apart from the competition my favourites being the macabre sight of everyday objects <UNK> in the walls of apartment and the creepy manner in which <UNK> corpses <UNK> through the cold <UNK> corridors of the <UNK> during the excellent finale hal impressive <UNK> cinematography and tom wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the chilling atmosphere
<START> this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small <UNK> and <UNK> it's certainly all been done before and since but the violent men is something special br br what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of <UNK> as she often did in her later films she's married to the crippled edward g robinson who's the cattle baron here but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his <UNK> may have left him <UNK> no matter to barbara whose needs are being met by her brother in law brian keith that doesn't sit well with either <UNK> foster who is robinson and <UNK> daughter nor with <UNK> <UNK> who is <UNK> mexican girl friend br br the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film but glenn ford as the <UNK> small <UNK> who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here he's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of ford's mouth i'm a man would have been very <UNK> in the men br br the fifties was the age of the adult western themes were entering into horse operas that hadn't been explored before the following year glenn ford would do another western one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot <UNK> br br there's enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well
<START> yes i really found this film <UNK> br br i didn't like the sandra oh character she really annoyed me it is unlikely she would be accepted into rural italian life due to the fact she is non white this was a bit of pc nonsense br br the film is also offensive to italian men for instance the one man she diane lane has an affair is turns out to be a cheat but guess what at the end your typically <UNK> american brick head turns up all cheesy white smile and <UNK> and she finally finds what she wants all along a real american man and now she has <UNK> another part of the world br br in fact this film is quite racist in its depiction of italians and the way it <UNK> them as either smarmy <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> br br the photography was good but the film and its attitude were trash
<START> new guy at an <UNK> car company gets talked into becoming involved in an <UNK> car heist by his fellow drivers in order to score some quick cash the problem is that they really don't have much of a plan and when complications <UNK> things turn deadly br br fast moving popcorn action film has a great deal going with it first off the film is under 90 minutes so the film doesn't really have the time to <UNK> down in plot it <UNK> everything up and just goes next the film has some great action sequences so one moves towards the edge of ones seat lastly the film has a stellar cast that include matt dillon jean reno and lawrence fishburne its a first rate cast that sells and covers over the stories short <UNK> br br this isn't brain surgery its a popcorn movie and on that level it scores highly worth a look
<START> this film was produced by producers releasing <UNK> <UNK> among the so called poverty row film studios of the 1930s and 40s so you can imagine how little money was spent making it br br the music is forgettable cast member young does exhibit an operatic quality voice but is sort of a <UNK> deanna durbin the imdb <UNK> doesn't show any other film appearances for her so let's hope she was able to move on to some kind of position in grand opera br br the opening credits for the print recently broadcast by turner classic movies <UNK> this film has been <UNK> by the national film museum this immediately begs the br br are their resources so <UNK> that they can afford to <UNK> junk some low budget or b musicals of that era have redeeming features which make them worthwhile this film has none br br in my opinion skip this movie it really wastes an hour of your time
<START> this movies had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my entire life i laughed so hard i almost <UNK> after the movie was done i laughed for about an hour just thinking about the very last seen in the movie its is definitely 100 times better than the first jackass movie i loved seeing all of them back together again if you are <UNK> or don't like raunchy childish humour you will not like this movie if you can go in with an open mind and not take it so seriously then you will laugh your ass off its amazing no one was killed in this movie every seen in this movie is so original and so different from the next you will not know what to expect br br mike <UNK>
<START> i had to rent a couple of movies for my little cousin for new year's and she picked out the <UNK> princess the mystery of the enchanted kingdom and the little mermaid 2 and we just watched both films while she's sleeping i figured i could get a couple comments in while this is a very cheesy cartoon it really wasn't that bad you have to admit that for children these plots are new to them and it could be a great introduction of these stories to them br br <UNK> finds out that derek has been secretly keeping the magic secrets of and she tells derek to destroy them immediately but him being a guy typically he does not do so and tells her that no on could achieve the without his help when a witch named <UNK> gets her hands on them she finds out that derek <UNK> off the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything and she kidnaps <UNK> in order to retrieve this information br br the <UNK> princess the mystery of the enchanted kingdom is silly and predictable but for the kids i would honestly say it's a go it's so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days so i'm going to cut the film some slack it was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden i grew up with the first one so i guess it was just stuck in my head br br 4 10
<START> hey i know angel isn't the kind of show that gives people a happy ending and i know they couldn't just make everything perfect but i couldn't believe the ending to angel i absolutely love the show it's possibly the best show ever however i really hated this ending as well as the whole way the 2nd half of angel season 5 went similar to buffy season 7 my favorite characters deaths were pretty much pointless and did nothing for the plot was one of the best characters on the show and once she and angel were finally going to get together she turned all evil and into a demon i wanted so badly to have her back don't get me wrong the episode where comes back is fantastic but i was still really mad she was gone then on earth was up with fred dying right after she finally got with wesley there was no sacrifice it was pointless it did nothing whatsoever for the plot and blue haired demon girl is an awful useless character they spent way too much of the end centered around her another big problem is they didn't connect the elements well enough i know those <UNK> in that black thorn wanted to bring about the apocalypse but there wasn't even a date set for when it was supposed to happen the apocalypse should have been carried out and discovered throughout the entire season rather than just mentioning there are some evil <UNK> an hour before the season ends one of the biggest problems is every character who the audience cares about is either dead or has nothing to live for my three favorite characters died and angel spike and <UNK> who i'm not sure even survives have no office aren't even back to their helping the helpless are in the middle of a huge battle and have lost everyone they care about angel and spike are never redeemed they lose the girl they care about and just about everyone's dead and they still have to fight this weird evil army i get the whole you never stop fighting but it was stupid to end it right in the middle couldn't there have been some redemption with knowledge that there would always be many more battles to come i don't get why this episode is so highly rated because i think the buffy ending was 10 times better and i wasn't even a giant fan of that one why did they have to slip at the end season 3 and 4 and 1st half of five were so amazing then they went and messed up the show
<START> i came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non holiday films as you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it br br stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts dennis <UNK> acting is strong also he goes <UNK> in most films but was a very capable actor check out kitty in this film he plays the visiting sailor that <UNK> stanwyck away from her husband to be br br this is a christmas classic the settings and the story make for a great christmas romance
<START> sit in your basement with the light out for an hour and a half that's about the same as watching this <UNK> search for the devil's door an american <UNK> owen vincent <UNK> travels to <UNK> and <UNK> a rescue team to search for his friend <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> who has disappeared in the <UNK> beneath <UNK> capital city they will be shocked to discover <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> and dark complex system of <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> will come upon the <UNK> of hell val kilmer and will strike a deal to continue their venture only to succeed in being scared almost witless when realizing they are among walking dead also in the cast <UNK> de <UNK> stallone <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> the only interesting part of this movie was it's jazz and <UNK> new orleans back drop it tries to be one of those movies that has two struggles the heroine has to overcome one from the past and one from the present which she fails to do convincingly the <UNK> bad and the direction is even worse i'm not surprised at all that this went straight to video the end result of this film leaves no one satisfied or convinced including the actors themselves
<START> am i the only person who thinks that the entire <UNK> and scenes of crime community in the usa must <UNK> this almighty slap in their faces a rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a <UNK> camera by the time he returns still no senior cops or other assistance for the lovely jolie this is new york isn't it it has started <UNK> and she gets to work <UNK> the evidence only after she'd stood in front of an to stop it disturbing the scene br br i want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of <UNK> in distorted the images the horror continues not in the film itself pretty ordinary i'm afraid but in the lincoln rhyme character as played by mr washington this man is a highly dedicated <UNK> crime scene <UNK> with years of experience who instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene <UNK> the work to an <UNK> cop a rookie cop who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before <UNK> them thus <UNK> every item and making <UNK> <UNK> well <UNK> impossible now that was a bright idea eh i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely <UNK> their ability to think in order to find this film believable br br i have given this film 4 10 for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss <UNK> lips which are the only items <UNK> my disbelief to be suspended
<START> this movie starts with interesting set design and a promising premise but fails to provide the cult movie goods set in a gritty parallel universe where everything is owned by the corporation it concerns a horrible stand up comic who finds success when he grows a third arm out of his back br br all the potential for great cheese is here washed up 80's star judd nelson wayne <UNK> offbeat visuals and strange plot <UNK> <UNK> women in skimpy <UNK> <UNK> but it never pays off br br the pacing is the main problem each scene is slow <UNK> stand up routines are supposed to be funny because they're <UNK> not funny but each performance drags on until it's not even <UNK> funny just boring br br imagine someone telling you the longest <UNK> joke imaginable full of <UNK> self <UNK> for how funny and weird he thinks it is imagine after a <UNK> two hours of this you never got a punch line you've just saved yourself the trouble of watching the dark <UNK>
<START> i have to admit that when first saw madonna performing holiday on top of the pops many years ago i said to my wife another american one hit wonder getting the whole thing wrong well she was wearing a fright wig and was <UNK> dressed i have never grown to love her the way my daughter does but i have to eat my words i do like some of her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed <UNK> this <UNK> tour film is great even if the music is not and its not i was impressed by the staging and concepts <UNK> own performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers she chose to support her my daughter was at the london <UNK> and was crazy about it the lady <UNK> has proved my initial <UNK> of her so very wrong
<START> i had only written one review on imdb prior to this as i consider most games as <UNK> of the time and effort curse of monkey island is different br br having played and been impressed by monkey 1 and 2 i had great expectations for the third release and was not disappointed the first thing that hit me was the <UNK> improved graphics don't get me wrong for games made in 1990 and 1991 respectively monkey 1 and 2 were ground breaking and provided the goods well but steps up and delivers a superb cartoon style game play which is both fun and satisfying all scenes and settings have been carefully crafted and well thought out and suit this type of game perfectly the animation cgi is a mixture of realism and exaggeration a fantastic combination in this case br br for me the script has been crucial in the success of the previous two games the script is clever appropriate and above all absolutely hilarious added to this the script is now audio unlike the previous two where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen dominic voice is perfect for witty clear and slightly naive all other voice talents fit their characters perfectly especially earl <UNK> who is the voice behind i loved every single character throughout the game not just their personalities and wit but the way each character is animated superbly and <UNK> whilst on the subject of audio effects the soundtrack is worth a mention the <UNK> for monkey 1 and 2 were both <UNK> and despite this were very effective at giving atmosphere and representing a change in mood soundtrack is once again a step up each scene is <UNK> by a catchy subtle playful and if that's a word tune with a change in setting or mood the music also <UNK> adding to the entertainment and amusement that the game offers br br the whole idea behind monkey island is to solve <UNK> and problems in order to progress this might sound easy but is actually <UNK> <UNK> in many places some may be put off by the level of logic and amount of thinking that goes into monkey island but in reality this makes the game even more entertaining and fun and also adds to the replay value the option of the curse of monkey island or the curse of monkey island mega monkey which involves <UNK> and more <UNK> <UNK> suits players of all abilities and also gives good cause to play the game at least twice whatever difficulty level you choose you are guaranteed a different game each time you replay with numerous speech <UNK> and other <UNK> to solve that don't affect the outcome of the game but are just there for fun the most entertaining section of the game is ship combat and the sword fights that follow these were particularly well thought out and make the game completely worthwhile add to this a <UNK> story that is non violent and suitable for all ages which will keep you hooked and wanting more until the very end br br finally in conclusion a uniquely special mention must go to the <UNK> of this game the way each complex puzzle and problem is thought out is simply astonishing whilst gathering up items and objects during game play you can't see how each one is going to help you progress but with a little thought and <UNK> <UNK> present themselves and for that the <UNK> of must be highly <UNK> br br 10 10 for the best game i have ever played not an exaggeration
<START> lights of new york originally started out as an experimental two reel <UNK> short that eventually into the first all <UNK> feature film was supposedly one of the most beautiful actresses in hollywood and sister to in my opinion the real beauty <UNK> <UNK> who seemed to get all the breaks poor is best known for appearing in this pretty dreary film that bought a revolution to hollywood br br two <UNK> on the <UNK> in main street convince a couple of small town <UNK> to try their luck on broadway the <UNK> eddie <UNK> <UNK> and gene eugene palette don't realise that their <UNK> shop is soon a cover for illegal <UNK> activities they soon do realise it and regret the day they left their small town the only thing keeping them going is the <UNK> that <UNK> mother gave them and that they desperately want to pay back eddie becomes re <UNK> with kitty lewis <UNK> a girl from his home town who has made good on broadway kitty is worried about <UNK> miller <UNK> who is always hanging around her but eddie <UNK> thinks she is <UNK> as <UNK> already has a girlfriend molly <UNK> but to <UNK> her he gives her a little <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> away <UNK> who has killed a police officer and has the <UNK> closing in decides to frame eddie meanwhile molly is getting pretty fed up with <UNK> treatment of her and after a showdown where he tells her he is after a chicken and not an old <UNK> the stage is set for murder br br the fact is it isn't completely awful apart from gangsters and <UNK> alike speaking in their best <UNK> voices and that was still happening in films in 1930 <UNK> if a <UNK> melodramatic and eugene palette quite natural were okay and were the most seasoned actors in the cast there was no john or <UNK> barrymore to be seen <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> soon returned to the obscurity from which they had come i also didn't notice much of the hidden mike where people had to be <UNK> around different objects ie a <UNK> or sitting on a couch before they could engage in conversation people who saw it at the cinema probably started to think that all policeman talked in that flat <UNK> as that trend continued in many early <UNK> ie little <UNK> 1930 in any case they were probably intrigued by the novelty of a completely all <UNK> with some singing and dancing film in <UNK> br br recommended
<START> after watching this film i thought to myself they really <UNK> up errol <UNK> life the movie is really nice eye candy they really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of hollywood just right the costumes were great all the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and <UNK> br br is this a serious film about errol <UNK> life <UNK> it's a fun movie based on all the <UNK> stuff he did in his life br br why am i <UNK> this film this is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver <UNK> was really good as errol flynn he was not as good looking as the original but he made you believe that flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously but as a man who although gifted with great talent was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside <UNK> love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed <UNK> he also lost a lot of good friends during his life he also suffered from <UNK> love for the elegant olivia <UNK> the last scene of the film showed errol kind of begging for olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away he is shown in his <UNK> looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he <UNK> his drink into the pool it was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his <UNK> lifestyle br br this film could've had much more depth could've been better well written sure they showed all the <UNK> but they never showed errol <UNK> human center surprisingly <UNK> was able to put some emotional depth into the character of errol flynn even though the film writing didn't put any depth there br br i'll probably never see this film again but i can still remember after viewing this film gosh this could've been so much more i give this film a d
<START> after seeing meredith in beyond the <UNK> i had to buy another film with her staring i cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick it's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on meredith as she moves across the screen save your money until the tv network comes out with a dvd on beyond the <UNK> it's worth it at any price this one needs to pay you to see br br this pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman perhaps some of her latest might fit but i haven't seen them she has the smile of a <UNK> bell and eyes of dana <UNK> with a much younger body br br
<START> pretty lousy made for tv sequel to the roman polanski classic rosemary's son adrian has grown up and is <UNK> by creepy stephen <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> here played by patty duke a <UNK> of witches again led by <UNK> roman <UNK> <UNK> son for world <UNK> it's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor instead writer anthony wilson and director sam <UNK> <UNK> for a satan <UNK> thriller full of a lot of <UNK> plenty of <UNK> and ruth gordon trying to act <UNK> and nasty at the same time <UNK> the sole from the original george <UNK> john cassavetes as guy and a very hammy ray <UNK> plays roman <UNK> for the late sidney newcomer <UNK> is the film's only real saving grace he's very off <UNK> and looks really sinister without even doing anything the music by charles <UNK> is suitably creepy but so over used it's ends up being <UNK> rather than effective <UNK> who edited the earlier polanski masterpiece shows no flair or subtlety whatsoever
<START> <UNK> innocent finds herself at a house of prostitution run by ruthless <UNK> <UNK> winds up <UNK> in private prison after she refuses to make love to him of course and <UNK> top con <UNK> join forces and plan to escape <UNK> blah uninspired direction and dull talky script thoroughly <UNK> any trashy <UNK> this flick needs in order to qualify as a pleasing piece of babes behind bars exploitation junk the <UNK> pace painfully drags throughout there's no gratuitous female nudity whatsoever the girls don't even show any skin during the obligatory group shower scene the expected torture and <UNK> are both extremely tame and tepid the <UNK> crummy gore likewise fails to impress and even a ridiculous <UNK> sequence ain't nothing to get excited about thomas pedestrian cinematography the laughably lousy dubbing the excruciatingly overlong <UNK> minute running time the sappy theme song and <UNK> score add further <UNK> insult to already appalling injury only some decent last reel break out action offers a little relief from the otherwise overly <UNK> <UNK> tedium a complete yawn inducing dud
<START> this is an example of a movie that can have great potential and is executed very poorly i am a fan of kids and thumb sucker and many other so called teen angst films but this one <UNK> me br br why is every white kid made into a thug who loves rap its getting to be one dimensional the acting was awful but simple since it mainly consisted of just dropping f bomb after f bomb just a bad bad movie if you'd like to see better movies like this thumb sucker kids bully all br br those i think are better so i recommend one of those is you'd like to see a good teen movie i hope my comment you found useful and hope you hear future comments from me
<START> return to <UNK> a k a convicted is almost <UNK> the one good thing about this particular film was that i was never bored that being said the reviews that <UNK> this movie as a low budget success may not have watched the same movie that i saw br br rather than write a review and tell you what happens and what works and doesn't work i will simply comment that nothing works there are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi through the acting in the film is not very good although that may be a result of a script so poorly <UNK> that it could have been ghost written by george lucas there was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate did i mention that there were some plot holes by the end of the movie you are wondering how a blind guy can be such a good shot with a shotgun why kelly preston <UNK> <UNK> quinn why she would fall asleep the night before her client is supposed to be killed how <UNK> quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that keeps breaking down during the rest of the movie why <UNK> quinn didn't by a fifth instead of a bunch of <UNK> etc br br with all that being said this is certainly a b movie and a terrible one at that the unfortunate thing is that it just isn't bad enough to be good if you value your time please let this serve as a public service message to stay away from this one
<START> anyone who has seen the trailer for this film would be forgiven for thinking this film is an out and out comedy in actual fact it's a light hearted though not overly funny romp about a couple of br br there are numerous faults in the film the script and plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely dull yet despite all this it is quite enjoyable thanks largely to the two leads robert <UNK> and <UNK> lee miller these two fine actors <UNK> in particular are always good to watch and here there exists a good chemistry between them br br director jake scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers <UNK> and tony have given us films such as alien blade runner true romance and more recently g i jane and enemy of the state his debut is directed with energy and enthusiasm which keeps the film <UNK> along although without the strong cast he assembled the results might not have worked as well br br in short if you're looking for an easy enjoyable film to pass an hour and a half then you could do a lot worse than and if on the other hand you fancy something subtle historically accurate and thought provoking go elsewhere 7 10
<START> this film is terrible and don't blame jesus franco because its not his fault br br this film was shot silent over many years by welles as he got the money to bring a crew and the actors together to do some shooting how much film welles actually shot is not clear although not all of the film or all of the sequences are here since several key sequences such as <UNK> in a movie theater are in the hands of <UNK> or <UNK> who wouldn't give them up the film here is just under two hours and i would be hard pressed to imagine it ever really working at any length i'm of the opinion based on several comments that welles made before his death that he never really intended to release the film but was putting it together as a personal toy br br what exists here is for the most part is beautifully shot but dramatically dead very little happens for the first hour other than <UNK> and <UNK> wandering around the country side dull would be a kind description of the material in the second hour <UNK> ends up in modern spain and in a series of not very good sequences deals with everyday life this isn't to say that there isn't a few nice moments the <UNK> and the chicken sequences are quite good but mostly this is a vast waste of film and time br br completed by jesus franco who was welles' assistant director on the vastly superior <UNK> at midnight we have a bunch of film <UNK> that have been put together as best as possible many people have <UNK> franco as having been the reason the film stinks but frankly one can not make a good movie from crap material one critic has gone on record as having seen a different cut of the film in the 1970's which meant that franco made this version up on his own and ruined it while that maybe true i've run across stories of welles cutting and re cutting the film many many times over the years since he could never get it right br br this film is terrible no matter how you slice it br br ultimately i'm left wondering just how good a film maker welles was aside from citizen kane almost all of his films have been plagued by lack of budget or <UNK> with so we are left with the excuse that many of his films would have been better if only how do we know how can we know perhaps welles was a man of less talent than we thought and many of his borderline films just aren't that good and never would have been while this is no place to argue the place of welles in film history the surviving material of don <UNK> assuming it <UNK> what welles intended i think it does is a good case for <UNK> how we view the man and his work br br 4 out of 10 for the good sequences though 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality
<START> here is a fantastic concept for a film a series of <UNK> crash into a small town and the resulting alien <UNK> is caught on a <UNK> single camera dash <UNK> as the town slowly taken over leave it to albert <UNK> to screw that up don't get within 100 feet of this flick holy crap what a bomb it might be <UNK> worst yet the crazy thing is there is the <UNK> of a creative idea in here an entire of an <UNK> told from the <UNK> of a when i heard that a while back i imagined the car <UNK> into stuff people getting run over and infected types breaking the <UNK> and surrounding the car in chaos that would be cool right instead we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a <UNK> area occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there the last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera just noises are heard <UNK> stay away on a somewhat <UNK> note i think i am officially calling an end to my <UNK> watching only took me 20 crappy movies to realize i have better things to do
<START> in the wake of my personal research into the <UNK> end cycle time of <UNK> presented by the <UNK> <UNK> system i believe this movie should be seen every bit as much as what the <UNK> do we know while some may believe that matters of top level science should only be <UNK> in <UNK> level speak the elegant universe breaks such <UNK> the visuals and the <UNK> dialog make it easy to comprehend this walk through the history of physics there are numerous messages in this movie the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to <UNK> what's being taught true pure discovery science is beautiful because there's always something additional and exciting to bring to the <UNK> if we have the courage to seek it out in the face of established science
<START> many more <UNK> reviews than this have described the quite spectacular acting casting and <UNK> of this film it appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived <UNK> in the film's handling of the core moral question <UNK> br br this film is bar the final scenes <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> belief that he's not making some grand point but merely that for him a life devoid of dignity is a life not worth living we as viewers see an enormous amount of dignity in his life we see family and friends and culture and but for its physical limitations a life fully lived central to the tragedy of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks that <UNK> life is not worth living and that is him br br to watch this film and say that the only counter argument comes from the visit of a bumbling priest is a nonsense the <UNK> visit is pure farce a direct assault on the simplicity of the spanish catholic <UNK> response to the issue of <UNK> however the sister's <UNK> words to the priest <UNK> expose the powerful <UNK> <UNK> sentiments quietly <UNK> the entire film we are constantly encouraged to see the hope and the beauty of a life lived with love as the film progresses we may gradually be encouraged to understand <UNK> reasoning but we are never <UNK> to his decision br br i do not remember a film which moved me and <UNK> me as much as this
<START> scott's collection of 80's icons cannot save this teen disaster but then i suppose that's why it was only a tv movie and not a major motion picture william a <UNK> writer comes up with something closer to <UNK> school except this movie is more boring this movie isn't really stupid just boring and completely <UNK> the only reason to see this might be to see tina in an actual role after family ties after this movie and equally dumb class cruise i guess mr scott <UNK> up and went back to directing sit <UNK> which was his best move yet 4 out of 10
<START> although i was hoping that i'd like it a little more this was still certainly an impressive film there were great performances by all the leads and the story while not what i'd call chilling was still effective and it kept me interested for me the best part of this film was the look of the picture for it always looked cold and <UNK> and it just really seemed to suit the film well i also thought that the low budget suited this movie for i don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim all things considered it fell a little short of my expectations but i'm still very glad that i finally sat down to watch this movie
<START> michael sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrayal of a comic genius if you are familiar with kenneth <UNK> mannerisms and <UNK> then this drama captures the essence of them perfectly when i read about kenneth in his swimming <UNK> i laughed and then it was brought to life on the screen but this time i didn't laugh as it was put into perspective as the actions of a repressed and tortured man it must have been such a lonely existence being in skin <UNK> attention but <UNK> it when it truly <UNK> the last 20 minutes are heart breaking as you see kenneth gradually sink to the depths of despair and consider suicide as the only alternative i have seen it a dozen times and still cry <UNK> at the point where he <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> i cannot recommend this drama enough sexually explicit but it drives home the fact that kenneth couldn't let anyone <UNK> his world and this is where the sadness of the man lies for a genius who brought happiness to so many it's such a shame that his private life was filled with such despair and sadness <UNK>
<START> strangers on a train was one of those film classics i had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing i finally watched it a few weeks ago and as always with any hitchcock movie it not only stood up to the test of time it far <UNK> most thrillers being made today you can see the inspiration for future action movies here the climactic ending with the out of control merry go round and the two villains <UNK> each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of jan de <UNK> speed of course strangers is over forty years older than speed and contains no modern special effects but the visceral thrill is there hitchcock was a true genius br br the not so subtle gay side of bruno robert walker in an amazing performance has taken form in many other psycho stalker figures in future movies consider him a male version of jennifer jason leigh in single white female he knows about guy before he even meets him on the train we almost get the feeling their contact isn't incidental and is soon entirely obsessed with him br br hitchcock loved the elements in his movies also see psycho for more blatant undertones and there's a lot of that here bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother his <UNK> ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951 when gays were not allowed to be portrayed on the screen yet hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see bruno in the <UNK> on the <UNK> wearing a very non <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with guy and <UNK> to his mother br br the deep layers of this movie make it a fast paced thriller than you can return to again and again unfortunately it's being remade as a big budget hollywood production but after seeing the original i honestly can't imagine anything <UNK> the sheer white <UNK> thrills of this movie
<START> ed wood perhaps the worst film maker of all time left us gems that are so bad they delight being unintentionally funny and therefore charming and innocent br br james lay and his financial <UNK> mom and dad it seems from the credits have created in a film just as poorly made as any ed wood film but lacking any charm or innocence <UNK> simply stinks and about the only good thing about this 90 minute waste of time is the certain knowledge that james lay and his fellow <UNK> will never make another picture again br br i must mention some of the dramatic <UNK> some of the crew took to avoid being associated with this horrible picture i'm sure the production <UNK> once seeing the completed film <UNK> to have his or her name changed in the credits to and the <UNK> done by one can imagine with his roll of 5 dollar bills paying the crew at the end of a shooting day br br i wont mention the many technical problems with this pathetic little <UNK> but i must mention a few <UNK> that compare this <UNK> to the work of david lynch you know you have turned out a real stinker when you have your mom <UNK> into imdb and post such astonishing <UNK> no one save violent mental patients could ever mistake with anything produced by lynch what a horrific slight against mr lynch and his work br br go back to film school mr lay
<START> this is an extraordinary <UNK> thriller fonda and douglas are good but lemmon blows them away he plays a man who must go against everything he thought was right bridges <UNK> the film very well with a lot of tension the last of the seventies expose films
<START> at first sight i must say already watch the <UNK> 2007 with wesley snipes too a better action movie and with a more dramatic plot br br the <UNK> has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb set in romania and with awful directing for an action movie there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom br br really what you expect wesley snipes to do when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him don't blame him he needs the money br br this was the first impression when i saw the movie 3 years ago but i won't see it again no way screw it it sucks there i said it br br ps i don't think i ever said this movie sucks on a imdb review thank you <UNK>
<START> in sweet water the ambitious <UNK> dick <UNK> jim storm is <UNK> a resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the when three workers find some indian <UNK> and bones in a <UNK> in the site they accidentally release the giant <UNK> like creature known as bone eater and their bones are <UNK> by the monster the half breed sheriff steve evans bruce a k a running wolf is in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of the workers being pressed by <UNK> to arrest the <UNK> but the bone eater attacks and kills other locals while chief storm cloud michael horse seeks an ancient capable of destroying the evil creature br br bone eater is a lame and silly movie with one of the most ridiculous screenplay i have ever seen the characters and situation are not well developed and things happen without any further consequences the conclusion is probably the worse part in this flick with the typical white north american bruce dressed like an indian in the story his grandfather was an indian cutting his own <UNK> why and where is the blood later and clumsily throwing the axe in the chest of the bone eater destroying the monster and my last hope of any improvement in the story my last question if the bone eater eats bones what happens to the flesh and clothes of his victims my vote is three br br title brazil o de the bone eater
<START> i came across this film on the net by <UNK> and i was horrified by its content of vivid abuse violence and torture scenes it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose goes beyond belief i was even more shocked to see people the film in the comments section of this site this is a extremely disturbing film indeed which could change your life forever the people behind this should be bought to justice <UNK> today they shown a girl getting raped and butchered on screen tomorrow it could be a child even its fake or not its very very <UNK> disturbing nauseating indeed
<START> this is one creepy underrated gem with chilling performances and a fantastic finale all the characters are great and the story was awesome plus i thought the ending was really cool the plot was great and it never bored me plus while the child actors were bad they gave me the creeps this happened to be on the space channel a while ago so i decided to check it out and tape it i read some good reviews from fellow horror fans i must say i agree with them it's very creepy and suspenseful plus martin was fantastic in his role as the satan <UNK> it has tons of creepy atmosphere and it keeps you guessing throughout plus all the characters were very likable and you really start to root for ben and his family it has plenty of disturbing moments and the film really shocked me at times plus it's extremely well made on a low budget this is one creepy underrated gem with chilling performances and a fantastic finale i highly recommend this one the direction is very good bernard does a very good job here with great camera work creating a lot of creepy atmosphere and keeping the film at a very fast pace <UNK> is a little bit of blood and gore we get a severed leg lots of bloody corpses bloody <UNK> throat <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and an <UNK> the acting is excellent martin is fantastic here as the satan <UNK> he is extremely creepy very convincing was quite chilling was extremely intense seemed to be enjoying himself and just did a fantastic job overall charles <UNK> is great as the dad he was very caring very likable and gave a good show i liked him lots l q jones is awesome as the sheriff he was funny on top of things looked very young had a cool character and just did an awesome job overall <UNK> is good as the girlfriend and did what she had to do pretty well charles robinson <UNK> to the extreme as the priest and didn't convince me one bit and that laugh of his was especially bad is actually decent as the daughter she was somewhat likable and only got on my nerves a couple times i rather liked her moore was goofy but very likable in his role as <UNK> i <UNK> him rest of the cast do good overall i highly recommend it 1 2 out of 5
<START> <UNK> masterpiece i admit that i am unfamiliar with much of his work but i cannot imagine his other work <UNK> this fabulous film last night i watched death in <UNK> after an absence of about 25 years and was totally captivated by all that i saw this was a <UNK> composed of many elements the extraordinary shots directed by primarily his love of long <UNK> shots of people <UNK> swimming walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people the <UNK> brilliant interpretation of <UNK> shot selection the acting by the principles without over riding dialog and conveying the scenes complexity through facial features alone br br it is true young people watching this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a unique film a film that could not be made in 2006 a film whose time rests in those brief handful of years in the sixties and early seventies of the last century when artistic license was passed to film directors and money men took secondary roles as many of the recent imdb <UNK> have written this film in their judgment is long boring too little action and pretentious i suppose by the standards of hollywood <UNK> these comments contain merit unfortunately they <UNK> <UNK> the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years br br please if you have not seen death in <UNK> rent a copy and <UNK> yourself in a film and story from another time you will be rewarded
<START> first i should say that i've seen the <UNK> version at least 100 times know all the dialog and have read the play which is different from the <UNK> and contains <UNK> of gold of its own this version is as flat as a lifetime movie on adultery there's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of tv ads for it according to entertainment weekly <UNK> hated the <UNK> tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other guess what that was <UNK> intent it was a slick theatrical take on <UNK> adultery and back biting among a set of well <UNK> manhattan <UNK> the crowd that made this new version had no intention of <UNK> the original source material they pick at it <UNK> putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version bette midler who is in just a few scenes and acts the old <UNK> part in a broad <UNK> style doesn't have any context in this version she mentions going after buck which is a key element in the original then he's never mentioned again this movie is so dull that i'm not going to over analyze it but here are a few things that i found unbelievable mary haines <UNK> to her domestic staff i can suck the nails out of a board right great writing norma <UNK> could've done a line reading on that gotten an oscar <UNK> right a compassionate sylvia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> got what she wanted and the movie just sort of <UNK> away claire booth used sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play as portrayed <UNK> by <UNK> russell she was an ignorant <UNK> woman who <UNK> off <UNK> of petty ridiculous irresistible dialog that is still classic and <UNK> she wasn't above biting <UNK> <UNK> the 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die in killing her off they killed the movie
<START> if i could have given this film 0 10 i would and this is the first film i have wanted to rate so low its worse than awful if i went to see it in the cinema i would want the cinema to pay me for watching it at least minimum <UNK> some of the camera shots were quite effective but a lot were rubbish <UNK> villains reflection in a mirror that <UNK> his head and shoulders side ways from his body seeing is believing several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actions facial expressions when they were shot i only watched it to the end fast <UNK> about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue hoping to see seagal in some decent hand to hand combat but there was almost none of that should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music end of <UNK> scene in one scene we see seagal hand chop <UNK> neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact the chief villain keeps coming back to life he gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions the 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd 3rd floor onto the street to sum up this film is a total waste of time and a total joke it looks very low budget even for seagal the colour is dull and grey i could go on and on just like this film but i wont watch this film if you've got insomnia its guaranteed to put you to sleep
<START> laughable br br clichéd br br <UNK> on style to compensate for poor writing br br remember when mtv actually used to air music videos and other shows besides reality shows <UNK> <UNK> 2005 is based upon one such show  a cartoon from the mid 90s  featuring a <UNK> female protagonist in black <UNK> clothing <UNK> played by the lovely <UNK> <UNK> in this adaptation is a cold detached rebel who is as <UNK> as a line dancer and as deadly as a <UNK> snake she needs to be if she expects to kick the <UNK> of the <UNK> government br br i love science fiction but hate the sudden <UNK> of half <UNK> futuristic <UNK> technology <UNK> films like the island 2005 and <UNK> 2002 bottom of the pile <UNK> <UNK> has all the problems that are present in these films but <UNK> that is there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the <UNK> style that matrix 1999 <UNK> the special effects are therefore sensational in <UNK> <UNK> which earns it a few points but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there br br to make matters worse all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> with the most cheesy tough chick <UNK> and it seems as though the director <UNK> <UNK> cannot quite decide where to go with her next  should she make her more detached or more emotional she doesn't know let's go both ways imagine you take a shotgun load it chock full of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess this is the character of <UNK> <UNK> br br the film <UNK> <UNK> puts forward all the ideas in a <UNK> society individual vs society nature vs science emotion vs cold reason etc you've seen all of this before and better done at that go read <UNK> <UNK> or or even watch <UNK> run 1976 or blade runner 1982 anything avoid this <UNK> <UNK> cheese fest for as long as you can br br 3 10
<START> anyone who has ever <UNK> ingrid <UNK> ability to play comedy need only look to the <UNK> of st <UNK> ok so she's a nun with <UNK> who's probably in love with <UNK> think what luis <UNK> could have done with that but she also displayed a wonderfully sly sense of fun that made you wish directors had cast her in comedies more often in <UNK> flower she's a <UNK> <UNK> nurse walter matthau is the dentist in love with her boss but keeping it up when she's forced to act as his <UNK> in order to <UNK> his mistress don't ask she lets loose and the buttons pop and she's a joy to behold br br the movie itself is a than usual translation to the screen of a broadway hit you can see it's three acts it's a french farce it was originally it's taken from the play de by pierre and jean pierre and it hits all the right spots matthau uses his great hang expression to wonderful effect and a <UNK> blonde newcomer as she was then called goldie hawn almost steals the film as the <UNK> mistress who decides to give up her meal ticket because she feels sorry for 'the <UNK> even though 'the <UNK> is having a ball hawn made such an impression in the role that what she did steal was the academy award for best supporting actress
<START> if this movie is coming to a theater near you consider it a threat i was unfortunate enough to see this movie here in tokyo since i'm dutch i was surprised to find a dutch movie playing in a <UNK> like tokyo is i figured it had to be of special if a dutch movie makes it all the way to japan so i went there with some friends and we were happily telling the <UNK> staff that we were dutch and that we were so curious about the movie as it turned out this was one of the most <UNK> silly dumb worst acted with worst spoken english movie i've seen in maybe 10 years and i left the theater trying to avoid the staff because feeling almost responsible for this disaster movie sometimes you get the feeling you know what the director was aiming for lola <UNK> <UNK> kind of like movie instead it was more like <UNK> on drugs with outdated music as a score but if i wasn't feeling too annoyed the movie was unintentionally quite hilarious once in a while as it showed holland at its smallest
<START> there is so much not to like about this show it's hard to know where to start unlikeable characters horrible plot lines terrible writing and terrible acting don't even get me started on the obnoxious theme music br br on top of all that the show is out of touch with u s audiences due to the heavy canadian references all throughout it oh say derek will you be going to queens college in the fall how have you bean we should go br br granted other shows are filmed in canada for financial reasons like stargate atlantis but while those shows may have suffered from some <UNK> like rodney calling a z p m a <UNK> p m the show didn't focus on life in canada br br mtv is running <UNK> another show based on the experiences of the canadian teenager during daytime hours when no one is watching to fill time most teens are at school when it <UNK> i'd <UNK> it's for the same reason shows that focus on teenage life in canada don't translate well to a u s audience br br this show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in a <UNK>
<START> personally i didn't really gain a whole lot from the act of seeing with one's own eyes i've noticed a lot of really highly rated reviews on here for the film and i'm kinda surprised maybe i missed something that other reviewers felt moved by but i found the film pretty tedious and basically pointless br br the action of the film is a bunch of <UNK> footage that is filmed in an art house style lots of extreme close ups weird editing etc and with no sound or dialogue br br i guess the act of seeing with one's own eyes could be considered a study of human <UNK> or maybe if you really wanna dig a little some sort of comment on the <UNK> of humanity or whatever but i personally found it to be a bunch of semi interesting but ultimately dull <UNK> footage if that's your thing then this will be a winner for you as for me i've seen more interesting er footage not a bad film as it isn't really a film in any traditional sense i just found nothing really notable about it 4 10
<START> note i saw i sell the dead at the <UNK> international film festival on 20th january 2009 i sell the dead is a jet black horror comedy set in late medieval times and stars dominic <UNK> lost lord of the rings ron <UNK> <UNK> larry <UNK> session 9 and <UNK> <UNK> phantasm br br the movie opens with grave <UNK> willie <UNK> still <UNK> and being dragged to the <UNK> and executed his apprentice and partner in crime arthur blake <UNK> is locked in the tower awaiting his turn when father <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> priest with an <UNK> interest in the occult pays him a visit with the apparent intention of recording <UNK> final confession it soon becomes apparent however that <UNK> main interest lies in the more <UNK> side of <UNK> exploits most of the plot from here is told in flashback form as <UNK> <UNK> with tales of his macabre career br br initially and blake start out as simple wise cracking body <UNK> working in the employ of the <UNK> dr <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> corrupt who uses blackmail as <UNK> over our two anti heroes and takes a rather <UNK> <UNK> in his work the pair have their first run in with the undead when one evening <UNK> sends them on a mission to a bleak <UNK> <UNK> to retrieve a corpse that has been mysteriously <UNK> at a <UNK> apparently according to some ancient <UNK> but there's something different about this corpse this one has been wrapped in of <UNK> and buried with a stake through it's heart br br following a terrifying encounter not only do they <UNK> a plan to rid themselves of the scheming doctor's <UNK> but they also <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> who will pay good money for corpses and even better money for living <UNK> of the undead this leads our <UNK> duo into the hidden underworld of the <UNK> hunting trade where they find themselves going head to head not only with vampires monsters and zombies and one other <UNK> <UNK> for which i will not spoil the surprise but also rival <UNK> hunters in the form of the <UNK> and murderous murphy clan br br i went into i sell the dead expecting a low key mildly distracting low budget <UNK> i was not prepared for the incredible imagination <UNK> humour quality acting great dialogue thick atmosphere and sheer personality that makes i sell the dead a strong early <UNK> for my horror film of the year br br with the exception of a couple of rough edges the production values are truly fantastic for such a low budget flick it looks like it was made for about 20 million and i was surprised when the director told the audience it was made for significantly less than half of that although he was unwilling to give exact figures as the film was still being sold to <UNK> the look and tone of the film is a visual comic book somewhere between tim burton and hammer horror with smart little <UNK> esquire artwork <UNK> the plot is wonderfully surreal but the idea of a hidden underworld running parallel to everyday life but which the general <UNK> is either unable or unwilling to believe in is one that actually makes quite good sense within the context of the film br br the acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly and blake and all the actors deliver their <UNK> scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic <UNK> <UNK> also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing <UNK> playing doctor quinn br br conclusion i loved it it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie i struggle to find anything bad to say about it mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line
<START> i'm so glad he wasn't alive to see this this movie is a <UNK> of his work i agree with the other <UNK> this movie was a terrible disappointment i'd give it a zero but am forced to give it a 1 br br the story was weak and it reminded me of the days when i was a young teenager trying to write a movie then looking back on it and realizing how horrible it was bad actors family and friends and someone stupid enough to <UNK> it was how it was made it's really amazing how strings can be pulled to get anything done if this movie was able to make it out to the general public it puts high hopes on other indie film makers who have talent worth a damn <UNK> struggling this movie made me laugh but for all the wrong reasons by all accounts this was seriously not meant to be a comedy scary movie is a better play on a horror genre this movie just sucks
<START> i went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the second coming boy was i ever wrong bbc are <UNK> at pacing a movie total idiots at creating suspense fools at building intensity and this movie is no exception to the rule of how much bbc sucks br br ugh the pacing and time wasting <UNK> dialogue was just painful to sit through the first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours i kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless monotonous drivel would end they wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead role because the material is so lazy and <UNK> written everything that happens is just to kill time br br out of <UNK> minutes only 15 minutes are interesting the controversial ending what a shame reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie the preaching the am i god endless blah blah blah ing the dumb as boring <UNK> ugh br br do not watch this crap
<START> this movie was really interesting it also is quite shocking as the similar events of the movie occurred only 10 months after the movie premiered br br it was interesting seeing the problems that could be encountered and realistic enough to show that no matter how prepared you think you are you aren't if this was made for an american audience it would be different because they would have used this as a full propaganda film and not as a wake call which the bbc did it still is propaganda in some <UNK> no film today with these themes can not be but it dealt with the issue successfully br br a film that should be shown in all terrorism counter terrorism <UNK> but will not because it shows faults which is not allowed to be acknowledged a great film in which the bbc took a few risks and unfortunately london does not need a fictional tale any more due to the reality of july 7 2005
<START> i love dogs and the most interesting character in this movie is a golden <UNK> he is smarter better looking and more interesting than any of the human characters like many other <UNK> i have not read the book but i doubt that having done so would change my opinion of the movie it is predictable from the first five minutes on no surprises mad scientists create a monster that gets loose and a teen age boy and his wonder dog <UNK> to destroy it all in all the movie is a dog but as i said i love dogs and will therefore give this movie a 7 10 rating watch it if it comes on tv rent it if you are bored and nothing else catches your eye but don't buy it unless it is on special
<START> when i first watched this show on cartoon network i found it uninteresting then i read a lot of good messages about this show and i decided to watch it the show was so boring each episode was predictable more this show has no logic girls who are going to school and sometimes do such stupid things 99 of episodes start with a monster attacking then mayor he is a real fool he is not funny he is so stupid that i can't imagine how he became a mayor professor yes supposed to be the <UNK> person in this show but actually he even found no difference between monster and his brother <UNK> comments also make this show boring because they also have similar lines in the beginning of each episode and in the ending also the animation is very strange everything except main heroes is shown in an ugly way also in every this show is giving you some life lessons and it means that it is oriented on little children but if you look closer you will see that there is a lot of violence and even blood during their battles
<START> is the kind of formulaic hopeless comedy to be enjoyed by the sort of sheep that stop and listen when they come across a band playing in a shopping mall br br i remember murray promoting on larry king's crappy <UNK> show where he said something like if this movie doesn't become a hit i'll stop making movies or comedies he wasn't being nearly as <UNK> as one might think he must have felt that was a sure fire hit and that its failure would mean his status as a star had <UNK> fallen hence a sort of ultimatum live on air to his fans to spend their hard earned money on a dumb elephant comedy the comedy being dumb not the elephant or maybe he simply realized during the shooting or when he saw the final cut what a turkey this was so he tried desperately to convince everyone how much optimism he had regarding quality go see it it really is good actors are prostitutes inter <UNK> with car <UNK> br br is the sort of lousy project that comes from the friends school of comedy their <UNK> if you ever run out of ideas or if you never had any in the first place then stick an animal into the plot and that will at least <UNK> an element of <UNK> <UNK> a sad substitute for lack of funny gags the other <UNK> friends had was always include pointless dull sentimentality which this movie so predictably ends with when murray rather <UNK> says what they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant maybe not an elephant but i certainly managed to easily forget this turkey which i saw many years ago i was suddenly reminded of it when i saw a scene from it on tv today hence this equally pointless review br br murray wastes his talent on this turkey disguised as an elephant but he isn't nearly as uninteresting bad as <UNK> or however that man's name is <UNK> one would think that m m would have an easy time playing himself i e a <UNK> but he is so painfully unfunny and unconvincing that i could barely stand to watch him make such a jackass out of himself it was cringe worthy to round off this nonsense we have that generation x <UNK> <UNK> in a rather useless role then again everything about is useless br br after which bombed as far as i know murray went on to become more of a serious actor what is it with these comedians and their <UNK> complex is it all just about getting awards i e recognition from their peers read votes from their moron colleagues this piece of crap marked the end of a string of good and great movies murray made in the early and mid 90s such as <UNK> day quick change mad dog glory <UNK> what about bob and ed wood recently we've had the <UNK> pleasure of seeing him in garbage <UNK> such as hamlet lost in translation you just can't get away from these ultra talented and broken flowers compare those two br br one guy described funny as heck now that's the kind of audience this movie was hoping for shopping <UNK> and trailer parks
<START> may 2nd someone <UNK> 11 <UNK> and then <UNK> to do 15 more on my previous 15 comments almost as funny as this turkey br br may 1st br br as i write this i'm still very much under the impression of what must be the funniest thriller i've ever seen i've got a major case of the <UNK> but i'll try and calm down it's kind of hard to write when your nose <UNK> <UNK> and the mouth <UNK> <UNK> onto the keyboard br br a pair of young women who just returned from a vacation take a ride on a <UNK> bus a couple of young guys join them but the bus isn't really a taxi service it's a kidnapping vehicle don't <UNK> its driver has been part of an organized white slavery gang who snatch young women from <UNK> and they've been doing it for five years don't laugh five years on the same airport without the police or even the fbi ever getting any wind of it no <UNK> please apparently dozens of women go missing on in the same exact place for years and years and yet no one notices a trend is the fbi that incompetent the world of <UNK> seems to consist of three types of people easily <UNK> dumb <UNK> invisible fbi agents and <UNK> psychotic gangsters who hate sexy <UNK> with <UNK> br br the driver has barely stayed alive on this one mission and yet he's done this for i repeat five years without being killed or losing one of his limbs stop laughing did i mention that the driver is immortal need i mention it we all know that movie <UNK> have immortal <UNK> you can stab them <UNK> them against the walls of a bus repeatedly <UNK> them <UNK> with a hammer <UNK> nine inch nails into their ears hell you could stick a hand <UNK> into the average hollywood <UNK> mouth and he'd still escape with only minor <UNK> no the driver is not satan or even a minor demon but just a regular hollywood psycho with better survival abilities than the biggest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the basic plot outline a guy loses all the fingers on one hand in a silly scene a magical bus that reads and <UNK> minds the passengers try to escape they fail they get hurt they <UNK> they argue they try to escape they fail they get injured they argue they try to escape they fail they get injured they try to escape they fail they try to escape the manage to snatch the gun from the driver alas they do not kill him because the golden hollywood rule of gandhi like <UNK> <UNK> them from doing it no <UNK> one of the other passengers turns out to be part of the gang stop laughing he is played by an actor who studied in the rob zombie john travolta school of over acting silly <UNK> he threatens rape later on one of the <UNK> hits him with a <UNK> over the head about a dozen times very hard only seconds later does he regain consciousness yep he survives immortal remember he gets killed a little later no idea how though he is not supposed to be the argue they try to escape one of them escapes alas the <UNK> are just far too god like in their powers not to re capture their prey the game starts all over again the passengers try to escape they fail they <UNK> they stare into the void they get hurt they try to escape they fail they get hurt br br you get the picture br br frankly i believe that a drugged heavily <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would have escaped these <UNK> with ease there were so many opportunities at one point these bumbling <UNK> remember five years even send one of the into a <UNK> store she leaves a message to the police however yeah you guessed it this fictional fairy tale u s city has no police br br and just as you thought the movie couldn't get any dumber not even if luc and brian de palma joined forces to lend a hand with the script it does the girls are kidnapped in order to be sent to some remote island and this is achieved by <UNK> them as <UNK> apparently this fictional america has no fbi no police and no border customs either it does however have immortal criminals with more luck than twenty <UNK> winners one blond had her chance to kill the driver and yet she failed how is it that victims in these dumb thrillers never try to finish off their immortal <UNK> once they have them down on the floor and injured i guess i answered that one myself they're immortal so why bother trying she must have thought br br so why was one blond <UNK> to death and the other one <UNK> and <UNK> alive complete with a kitty <UNK> box and the funniest photograph since <UNK> moore's primary school pictures could it be the <UNK> i think they killed the <UNK> one but that's just me was her <UNK> that ugly br br could it be that i don't care why should i search for logic in a movie made by <UNK> for <UNK> besides how can i even think straight when i'm laughing so hard half the time br br naturally this being a 21st century horror thriller the mobile phone doesn't work perhaps this <UNK> gang control not only the fbi the police and the customs but <UNK> in space too br br do i have to spell it out there are far easier ways to kidnap people and far more intelligent people who should be making movies give an idiot a camera and he'll lay an egg every single time that sort of answers the eternal <UNK> of which came first the egg or the bird <UNK> director
<START> the first film i saw from these people was children of the grave and when i heard that this one was coming on i thought it would be good to watch mostly because <UNK> is a real place that is <UNK> to be haunted this documentary film was awful there was too much fake commentary from the producers directors camera men they needed to keep their faces out of this film <UNK> has been <UNK> to be haunted for a long time yet if anyone in doubt about it watches this film they will no doubt start to believe that every story about the place is as fake as this documentary the <UNK> proof was horrible and almost non existent i have heard better from high school students with tape <UNK> in a bathroom they tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary not the stories not the <UNK> too dark to see anything videos not the pictures not the tape <UNK> children of the grave was bad as well but at least it had some substance and a little bit of a creep factor the only reason i am giving this a 3 is because the history portion of the show was very good and informative learning about how the hospital came about the daily life there and how it ended was the only thing worth while in this <UNK> piece of crap
<START> this movie is pathetic in every way possible bad acting horrible script was there one terrible editing lousy cinematography cheap humor just plain horrible br br i had seen 'the a couple weeks before this movie and i thought it was a dead <UNK> for worst movie of the year then i saw 'the and suddenly 'the didn't seem so bad at all br br bad bad bad excruciatingly bad
<START> well i have to disagree with leonard <UNK> on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didn't see any humor he doesn't even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalo but i didn't think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the <UNK> area disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les <UNK> however that doesn't make the story funny br br back in the 1950s everyone in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new <UNK> it has the toronto <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on it so the kid doesn't want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local <UNK> he gets <UNK> from the rest of his hockey buddies what's so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox die hard and his mom gets him <UNK> shirt horrors you couldn't wear it and vice versa br br maybe to someone who doesn't follow sports at all like <UNK> this situation seems odd and humorous to him but it's a fact of life or any bit time sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laugh br br the art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of <UNK> paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard <UNK> animation favorites from the national film board of canada
<START> this film broke a lot of ground and receives on the whole a lot less credit than it's due it touches on a topic that is ever present in our daily lives but which is seen as a phenomenon so common that it does not merit discussion this phenomenon is that of be they doctors or as in broken promise a senior social worker who abuse their position in order to harm those they have been charged to protect br br in broken promise patty and her family are abandoned by their parents but are soon picked up by local law <UNK> faced with the certain <UNK> of foster care patty begs a young social worker to keep her and her brothers and sisters together this social worker approaches a senior member of another department but his request is denied br br the children are off to <UNK> homes thereby following the <UNK> opinions of the day and <UNK> a clean break but it is this event the broken promise which gives the film it's name which causes the dramatic tension that is to continue throughout the film <UNK> by the young social <UNK> apparent betrayal patty runs away from the foster home she has been sent to br br faced with the <UNK> task of finding her family in a climate where the ideal is seen to be a complete <UNK> from the past she does the only the thing she can to <UNK> their <UNK> and breaks into the senior social <UNK> office to steal the br br <UNK> soon after she finds she has made a dangerous enemy furious at the embarrassment this little girl has caused him and his department the senior social worker decides to use his power and authority to destroy her something that <UNK> he is quite capable of doing br br br br this topic of the harm of to <UNK> is relatively taboo it certainly has been touched on very little in films as few directors wish to <UNK> the path that would imply that cause harm br br i think that this film plays a very important role in making the public more aware of this sort of thing the case portrayed is not only plausible but has probably happened many times before to many other children all over the world this film is critical to changing public opinion in order to get rid of the laws that protect <UNK> people like the senior social worker in broken promise br br i strongly recommend broken promise it is especially appropriate viewing for <UNK> social workers <UNK> <UNK> doctors and other <UNK> it is a lesson in <UNK> that should be taken to heart br br br br in terms of the acting in broken promise melissa plays a superb part as patty especially in films such as this believability is critical if the viewer did not identify with the character of patty the whole message of the film would be in <UNK> it's unfortunate that melissa doesn't still act in films today as her performance in broken promise shows her to have had exceptional talent
<START> the <UNK> most engaging movie of its genre those lips those eyes made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work it takes to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment <UNK> and <UNK> are superb and the story seems to write itself a brilliant screenplay by david one of my favorites see the warriors and for more and beautiful sets filmed on location i think at the actual summer theater in which the story takes place you can't see this movie and not want to drop everything and get into the theater please check this video out if you can find it
<START> i have been watching king of queens from the beginning and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows this show has the best humor you can identify with the characters we talk about it at work a lot because i work at a company a lot like <UNK> <UNK> and we just love the <UNK> carrie is my hero she is the best she just puts it out there no matter what the subject is arthur well what can you say he just cracks you up and really puts a spin on things doug well he is just so lovable and funny the three characters plus all the friends just make the show complete this is the best comedy on tv i would say up there with seinfeld and hey there's nothing wrong with that <UNK> as doug would say
<START> i was lucky enough for this film to come on tcm so i had the opportunity to see it it's rather hard to find despite it being a hitchcock classic unfortunately it also has its shortcomings some of which hitchcock has repeated later first off the ending is a little too neat and perfect in the last few scenes until the last five minutes there is an astounding amount of tension then the five minutes just <UNK> everything perfectly up very unsatisfying the ending is also overly dramatic for a hitchcock film he is was and always will be the master of suspense why would he <UNK> to something as low as a cheap action sequence for the ending apart from the few shortcomings the film is great the plot is excellent one of the best and most universal ever the theme simple you meet a stranger a perfect stranger he offers to kill someone for you you know you have someone you want if nothing else <UNK> dead the catch he asks you to do the same for him will you accept this bizarre yet ingenious <UNK> you're clear of suspicion and so is he after all neither of you knew the victim and you don't know each other either you're just on a <UNK> brilliant concept and one that just about every single person can relate to the pacing is good you never lose interest or patience the cinematography is good but not nearly as good as it is in other better hitchcock films the acting is flawless the characters are well written credible and realistic hitchcock uses some of the same elements that he often uses the <UNK> mother the mothers boy etc the film is very good but it just feels a little watered down it didn't go that famous extra mile that would have made it great it stopped before crossing the line between what's common and what's daring that is the primary reason for the film failing to be great but mainly remains good with potential to be more than that the end leaves you <UNK> and disappointed however everything leading up to the end is very good so the film still gets a deserving 8 10 good but not great any fan of hitchcock should see it as it is among his best somewhat far down on the list but still there i recommend it to any fan of hitchcock 8 10
<START> after a string of successful 'a man and his monkey <UNK> which included the <UNK> every which way but loose every which way you can and <UNK> friends the genre fell on hard times in an effort to <UNK> this once celebrated area director frank marshall brought michael <UNK> acclaimed novel to the big screen br br think in the meets minus the box office <UNK> of bruce this is one mans doomed love affair for his talking monkey not helped by bad accents tim <UNK> struggles with a romanian a <UNK> of a screenplay hungry <UNK> <UNK> and bruce campbell ape sh t
<START> wow i haven't seen a movie this bad since fire down below wait that's a seagal movie too like on deadly ground and fire down below seagal centers the movie around his <UNK> awareness message and how the military fbi and cia are incompetent idiots problem is that both reality and a sensible plot are secondary to whatever social commentary seagal is trying to get across
<START> growing up as of child of the movies one of the <UNK> i shall not soon forget is that of the karate kid you can put down ralph daniel all you want but its the message behind the movies that are important that its important to be <UNK> to all creatures great and small but stand up for yourself when the time calls for it getting back to the movie at hand its rather funny because i saw boys don't cry and was really impressed with the performance of <UNK> <UNK> and in flipping through the sea of channels the other night i came across the showing of this film and i hadn't realized at the time of my first viewing of this movie that she was in it the story centers around julie just like daniel not knowing where to fit in or if she even wants to fit in and the master teacher is brought in to help <UNK> her out and guide her i really liked this addition to the series as it gave a good feminine side to the story and yes even some outfits that <UNK> were in kept me shall we say <UNK> br br overall 3 5 out of 5
<START> riders of destiny was the first of several westerns wayne made for the lone star arm of <UNK> pictures between 1933 and <UNK> in this entry the producers try to make the duke into a singing cowboy called <UNK> sandy <UNK> with hilarious results any wayne fan knows that the duke couldn't have carried a tune if his life had <UNK> on it his voice was apparently dubbed by smith whose deep <UNK> sounds nothing like wayne wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in performing the musical numbers thank heavens the singing cowboy experiment soon ended br br as for the movie itself it contains a standard b western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain forrest taylor and the local <UNK> duke of course plays the hero he had not yet developed his on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy br br also cast in the film were george pre <UNK> hayes as the <UNK> father <UNK> parker as the heroine and <UNK> <UNK> as one of the boys who performs his falling from the racing horses under the <UNK> stunt while <UNK> wayne both <UNK> and hayes would go on to appear with wayne in most of the other entries in the series <UNK> in particular would have a profound effect on wayne's future development teaching him among other things how to move fight and look comfortable on a horse br br as b westerns go this one isn't too bad however i have to give it a failing grade because of the singing
<START> i <UNK> with what b has said the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of <UNK> on the original content emotions aren't conveyed properly i guess a couple of not so good performances also contributed to its mediocrity in my view <UNK> would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of <UNK> <UNK> in some of her scenes she looks a bit <UNK> which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed i also noticed a bit of over acting in some of her scenes i'm a bitter critic of <UNK> <UNK> can't help it sorry for that was a good movie by and i saw <UNK> <UNK> after seeing <UNK> i was not at all impressed
<START> in a word magical and so incredibly real <UNK> is so incredibly raw so incredibly vulnerable that you just want his characters to succeed in whatever he does and he plays <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from his absolutely perfect bollywood e to his awkward shy manner with a first kiss he is a truly gifted actor and i wouldn't hesitate to see him in anything because he brings it all to life and gives it a soul <UNK> is absolutely gorgeous it took some time for me to warm up to her possibly because she plays the role of an ignorant but fascinated tourist so well her transition really became her and she <UNK> into her role very well even the man you love to hate her boyfriend benoit was wonderful though you never really like him for the <UNK> that he plays jean marie <UNK> <UNK> a perfect <UNK> the script so real i found myself turning to my friend repeatedly throughout the film to say that's exactly what happens in india they nailed it very real very raw very bittersweet but you certainly leave the theater feeling <UNK> music by is wonderful and goes perfectly with the constantly changing <UNK> but <UNK> i find myself constantly coming back to him because he is what makes this movie he is the hero the most charming <UNK> <UNK> driver you will ever encounter he's magical a lovely real sweet incredibly talented actor who i cannot wait to see shine and succeed in bollywood hollywood or anywhere
<START> as you know the greatest game ever played is about golf i used to <UNK> at the over dramatic title but through great visual display credited to director bill paxton better known for his acting in <UNK> and hilarious supporting roles in aliens and true lies we find out that this has much more meaning than a game br br though the movie is about golf it seems as though the sport is just the <UNK> for what is really going on what is really going on is a story of individuals being told they can't fulfill their dreams be it age or social status a conflict between a son's wishes and a father's demands an english golf legend looking to bring the title home with the country breathing down his neck br br <UNK> <UNK> even stevens plays francis a <UNK> with a god given talent who was never <UNK> to play golf in the first place despite the <UNK> of the upper class gentlemen it was <UNK> that francis had a gift what <UNK> a greater threat was the <UNK> of his father played by <UNK> <UNK> teenage mutant ninja <UNK> who felt that playing a mere game will never improve their poor living conditions with the continued support of his mother francis eventually comes face to face with his idol the golf legend harry stephen br br more impressive than the game itself was the movie's cinematic achievement this proved that storytelling is successful through pure cinema the entire movie could've been told without dialog there are scenes in the movie that build strong suspense and powerful emotion with only pictures in one particular scene francis <UNK> and the entire crowd turn their heads to watch the ball fly into the distance all but the face of harry looking intensely at without a <UNK> the ways in which the <UNK> <UNK> the course offer more aesthetic enjoyment br br a pleasant supporting cast <UNK> the whole <UNK> list plays the love interest and looks worth playing for and josh <UNK> plays a lovable <UNK> that keeps focused as the pressure <UNK> him down golf fan or not you'll appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that cinema can be a great medium to tell any story
<START> this was so bad i want god to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through it br br first off the acting was uniformly bad there was barely a plot unless shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain <UNK> and <UNK> mask instead of a dog counts br br the editing was was all over the place and the slow mo shots of the gore red corn <UNK> flying through the air <UNK> <UNK> using a <UNK> got irritating after the <UNK> time and <UNK> after the <UNK> time br br i like michael <UNK> he's done some good work this was not good this was less than good and by that i mean that it sucked hard br br for god's sake don't watch this movie
<START> the casting of robert <UNK> is probably the only decent move the production team made with this film falk and <UNK> were marvellous but as <UNK> was not nemesis this time chemistry was lacking columbo is only as strong as his opposite number and this time he didn't have one
<START> a team varied between <UNK> and <UNK> two other scientists a pilot and the guy who plays <UNK> on seinfeld go up to an <UNK> research post where all members have died off by either killing each other or killing themselves they discover there's a worm a virus that is <UNK> to the point of madness and death the problem is after a certain dog <UNK> out anyone could be infected but who this is not just my favorite episode of season 1 but also one of my favorites from the show the <UNK> environment the characters and of course like carpenter's the thing it's a lot of fun watching these even <UNK> characters suddenly start to flip out in dramatic scenes and the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cheesy i didn't mind them at all the drama between the characters ends up working more than it would usually because of the tension and because all of the actors including the <UNK> guy understand what's going on in the story and as usual i loved the ambiguity of the ending highly recommended
<START> i don't understand why everyone hates this movie aside from the fact that they're just jealous their music careers never took off like mega <UNK> aaron carter like it or not aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having so it only seemed natural for him to do a movie lou <UNK> and company have been known for over <UNK> their pop you remember justin <UNK> <UNK> into tv movie model behavior granted this movie isn't big scale and impressive but it's not supposed to be it's not trying to impress people or be an emmy award winner it was released straight to dvd it's just a cute little movie about an awkward teen who gets her dream of being with her favorite <UNK> i know a lot of you out there have had that dream at some point or another about you favorite singer don't deny it it's sweet and gentle and i applaud it for not stepping into the realm of sex violence and vulgar language that seem to be <UNK> into more and more of our movies today where's the decency where's the line teen dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for companies at least this one is more tolerable to me than aka with all the fake little girls running around going oh <UNK> <UNK> in tank tops and mini <UNK> and is <UNK> better than those gore fest movies like saw i feel for the main character girl because i was nerdy <UNK> girl in high school who loved aaron carter and <UNK> and the <UNK> boys and other pop music and still do and like <UNK> character would get <UNK> especially in <UNK> if you judge this movie solely based on the fact that you don't like or are jealous of aaron carter and his fame then of course you're going to hate it and trash talk it in reviews the only reason britney <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> got a higher score is because she has boobs accept this movie for what it is not what you want it to be i think this happy formulaic teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing
<START> let me see i've seen every film lou <UNK> has made i've seen batman robin twice i've <UNK> the dances in <UNK> 2 electric <UNK> i've watched unfinished blade runner rip off student films yet this film is the most painful thing i've ever seen br br this was the first movie for the straight to video market so you can thank blood cult for all of those mysterious michael <UNK> films at your local blockbuster you should know that this isn't even high quality video this is <UNK> grade this is you father's video camera he never uses this is what you have to look at for 90 minutes br br i won't bore you with plot details since i'm getting sleepy just thinking about it but i will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture i only watch this movie when i am angry at myself so i recommend this film if you are <UNK> or if you are up for a mighty challenge br br if you happen to rent this film god have mercy you will know what you are in for from the first 10 minutes this is when you are hit by the usual horror film intro you know the <UNK> there's a lot of suspense and build up before some girl dies yes you've seen it before but not like this this is the most boring intro i've ever seen i honestly believe that you could get a camera off ebay for ten dollars grab the bum that most <UNK> like <UNK> and candy and tell him to film your mom cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro it bored me to tears i cried like a baby br br another one of the things that makes this film so unbelievably painful is its actors yes i've seen bad acting trust me i've seen 4th grade productions of oliver twist with more realistic dialog the lead actor makes me ill the supporting actress is a train wreck of a human br br i will not even comment on the boyfriend true horror br br so rent this movie if you can find it you'll never be more depressed that you spent 3 dollars on anything else
<START> i watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it on so many people's favourite episodes list i'm not <UNK> in any way but from the start i realised they were in some sort of can with the huge eye looking down on them to the type of characters in there even though throughout the episode the questions of who are we where are we what's outside carry the suspense of the episode which i unfortunately already figured out i must say that different types of characters and the interaction between them did make the episode interesting enough although the twist of the story may have been harder to guess if all of them were toy soldiers
<START> black water has to be one of the best australian movies i've seen in many years my girlfriend and i sat gripping each others hands jumping in all the right spots this is as much a crocodile film as open water was a shark film in other words the creatures are merely part of the dilemma the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances how director's andrew and david <UNK> as much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is amazing to watch unfold and when i say terror its not overblown <UNK> constructed <UNK> moments but more little touches that when you ask yourself how would i feel in that situation lead you to conclude scared witless performances were great the pacing and gorgeous <UNK> to other life in the were excellent and the ending moments of the film felt very right this is a fitting feature debut for two directors who should rightfully by very proud go and watch this very beautifully shot and acted suspenseful film
<START> this film is so bad it's almost good trash at its best <UNK> <UNK> vs <UNK> come on i'd say that you'd actually have to see this it's so bad my sides hurt when i laughed i can't understand why this isn't in the worst 100
<START> yeah i bought camp blood and it wasted about <UNK> minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money on this crap i mean i didn't expect an amazing movie judging by the front cover i wasn't really expecting anything great but at least not <UNK> in the first 3 seconds i'm not complaining about the <UNK> i'm complaining about what the hell that has to do with anything this film should have been kept on there hand <UNK> at home as a joke they suck why was the blood more brown and turd like that real blood cheap i tells ya i mean everyone wasn't in colour they were just <UNK> yellow and another thing that made me die laughing at this sad excuse for a film was the fact that they tried to pretend the clown was a woman all the time although its clearly a flat <UNK> black short haired man did anyone else notice that the only special effect in this film was a <UNK> down jump that was also poor oh and the <UNK> effect that you can find on many basic p c programs such as this film blows
<START> i did have a good time the first 45 min or so but then suddenly it was all down hill the suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over what kept it going were the good actors br br but the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny like tarantino and god is that outdated stuff tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes this movie comes ten years too late at best it is for teenagers and i am sure many of them find the character of funny which he is for the first 30 min the other problem i have with it is that the story fades away towards the end more and more <UNK> i tried to find a <UNK> point maybe it didn't recover because the lack of passion comes with the effort of trying to be cleverly funny also like in many movies sure good actors who can afford it don't seem to demand a better dialogue or just turn down the script
<START> this is a clever and entertaining film about the <UNK> battling that went on to choose a <UNK> to johnny carson on the tonight show however the movie's ultimate <UNK> that david <UNK> superior comedic talents were overlooked because of his controversial nature and the show <UNK> by the of an inferior jay leno in the leading comedy program on television is simply untrue as anyone who has watched both leno and <UNK> perform can see for themselves the hard and simple truth is exactly as one nbc <UNK> stated in the film jay leno is the funniest man in america and david <UNK> is not once you realize this then much of the <UNK> in the film become irrelevant ultimately the whole film amounts to little more than sour <UNK> by <UNK> fans who just cannot accept that the better comic was chosen by people whose business it is to know these kind of things the final proof is that despite <UNK> early lead possibly because of the hype that emerged from the battle for tonight show succession <UNK> show has consistently proved to be the more popular thus in my mind at least <UNK> <UNK> claims to be unfairly robbed of his <UNK> inheritance
<START> the muppet movie is an instant classic i remember the opening scene with the <UNK> eye view of the swamp and <UNK> starting into in my opinion the most loved song in the history of songs at this point my mom would always sing along with <UNK> br br watching this title as a young adult it makes me smile i can still sing along to my <UNK> desire like many muppet films there are in jokes for adults that are in my opinion still funny today my favorite line of all time is actually from this film it's the last line spoken by my green <UNK> eyed hero <UNK> life's like a movie write your own ending that's what i intend to do thank you jim <UNK>
<START> young fake accent was difficult to accept at times br br the show was billed as mystery <UNK> but should have been listed as a romance br br don't rent this one if you are sleepy it will knock you out
<START> though for most of us <UNK> is a <UNK> quality i cannot recall a movie that did for me what this one does it transported me into an awfully familiar realm of longing and desire all the <UNK> attraction <UNK> over the outcome the <UNK> fear and excitement so attendant to that state of <UNK> were brought to fever pitch by this flick so french and what i consider daring no matter what your <UNK> i think that the danger of chasing your desire is brought full front and center here much more so say than with kubrick's eyes wide shut
<START> i hope the writer director editor and composer and let's not forget producer read this because their work was truly incredible on this movie let me start by saying that i am in no way <UNK> with this movie i am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times br br every second of this movie is touching every scene is classic the acting is real the movie is honest you can relate to these characters as people not actors br br this tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives the story is carefully thought out and every sub plot is <UNK> and woven together culminating in a message that leaves us <UNK> the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside br br <UNK> glover daniel <UNK> dennis hopper and joshua john miller as a 12 year old boy give absolutely amazing real performances i've seen this movie about 8 or more times and i still get so absorbed in their performances that i forget i am watching a movie it's that good great job everyone who worked on this great job br br the music is also wonderfully matched and haunting with the chosen cast the carefully timed editing and pacing the mood and tone and even the subject matter the director made some of the best decisions for a movie i've ever seen br br this movie is real it's honest it's a true movie experience which i will never forget you may not be into the subject matter but it is something you cannot ignore ultimately it's about people being people and everyone can relate to that i recommend this movie to fans of drama suspense and horror above almost every other film
<START> um a serious film about troubled teens in <UNK> a country i have not much knowledge on but have the previous wrong impression that all the kids there are highly <UNK> and controlled by their family and government well i guess i am wrong just like other cities countries they also have their troubled teens who also lead the not so surprising rebellious way of life of drugs fights bad language and many other obvious signs of being a bad boy the surprising part of this film isn't really about how these kids running around causing themselves and others trouble but rather the subtle <UNK> hidden behind their so call loyalty between them the bond between these brothers may very well <UNK> from an unconscious gay tendency inside these boys though it isn't <UNK> for guys to have very close friendship with each other but watch this film closely it should be entering all sorts of gay film festivals and i would not be surprised that it may win itself a lot more awards toward this direction
<START> i don't know what the critics were viewing when this movie was released but it slipped by them <UNK> it is well written witty satirical and thoroughly enjoyable it's like a video game brought to life you never know who's behind the door or what will happen next the violence is not gratuitous nor overdone for splatter effect br br one last word for you mickey rourke fans the is back and at his coolest in the cameo performance at the end
<START> i loved this film and recommend it to anyone who like a good spy spoof and who thought johnny english was an embarrassment this is the film je should have been but it's based on an old french films series so it's not really bond related br br the production is brilliant you'll almost believe the film was shot back in the 60's it even has that same <UNK> kind of <UNK> films had in those days jean plays his part with just the right amount of <UNK> and <UNK> not with ham <UNK> <UNK> silliness like <UNK> <UNK> and even if you don't like the film you will want to see it for <UNK> la la she is the <UNK>
<START> it is impossible to avoid comparing zhang <UNK> <UNK> to ang lee's <UNK> tiger hidden dragon ' they were both big budget chinese kung fu films with breathtaking cinematography of chinese landscape and a cast of super stars but aside from the obvious there is in fact nothing else to compare <UNK> fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters proving that big name stars beautiful scenery and action effects are no replacement for a director's artistry and vision br br all the marketing hype <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one much anticipated <UNK> drew movie goers in <UNK> when it first opened at theaters in <UNK> china and hong kong making it an instant box office success however though the script pleased government censors chinese audiences went to <UNK> heights of <UNK> criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain on line critics both professional and amateur <UNK> the film <UNK> disturbing ' from the viewpoint of deep <UNK> ' written either by an amateur <UNK> or someone with <UNK> motives ' one article was simply titled hero you make me sick ' br br the deepest failing of the film is in its plot which is not only morally <UNK> and based on unforgivable historic <UNK> but worst of all for a film is boring all blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history but <UNK> goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to <UNK> an emperor that was as brutal as <UNK> or hitler <UNK> does not make up for this lack of moral <UNK> by being entertaining or fun instead it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being <UNK> and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy br br though historians agree that the first emperor of china was <UNK> violent <UNK> was known to have admired this <UNK> no surprise given own <UNK> rule likewise the communist government in <UNK> sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the first emperor and its own iron fist methods so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by zhang <UNK> tony <UNK> one of the stars of <UNK> <UNK> during an interview to promote the film that the <UNK> government had done the right thing in 1989 by <UNK> the student <UNK> because it was needed to maintain in china for these remarks tony <UNK> received shocked criticisms in his home city of hong kong but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie br br director zhang <UNK> has stated that his goal was to <UNK> the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung fu novels and movies to reveal a higher wisdom unfortunately his version of turns out to be the is right in china where thousands of years of historical reality have <UNK> this message through art was the last <UNK> where the individual could actually find freedom from such <UNK> the great popularity of the kung fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world one where kung fu warriors <UNK> the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice free from fear and winning against all odds with their super human skills only in the novel did the individual ever win over <UNK> power in china and only in the novel did the <UNK> find their <UNK> going against this tradition of the kung fu hero zhang <UNK> has not gone <UNK> towards a higher truth as he had hoped but <UNK> to the level of government propaganda it's no wonder the government was so pleased br br some film lovers may secretly wonder all <UNK> <UNK> aside is it at least entertaining ' fortunately the answer is a <UNK> no ' because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations it becomes tedious to watch moreover the three <UNK> versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the <UNK> version emerges br br the film is not without its beautiful images however all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline the use of different colors to <UNK> the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived and the cinematography appears self <UNK> rather than truly beautiful great for a trailer but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film br br for those in china who showed disdain for <UNK> unrealistic kung fu much was expected from hero ' jet li who plays the title role is a real kung fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor his previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities but many hoped that zhang <UNK> could use <UNK> <UNK> body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities but it was not to be <UNK> attempts to go beyond the kung fu genre so there are not many fighting scenes and jet li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self sacrifice as the casting director ought to have expected li fails miserably meanwhile the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung fu skill is the first one of the film between li and and <UNK> <UNK> all the scenes that follow are a disappointment so <UNK> fails to satisfy even on that level br br though most audiences outside china are unlikely to be aware of the historical <UNK> of the story of the cruel first emperor it seems even more unlikely that they would accept <UNK> version of chinese wisdom ' which is anything but perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of <UNK> was seen smiling instead of <UNK> or <UNK> was at the special screening for chinese government officials br br
<START> this was an abysmal show in short it was about this kid called doug who guilt <UNK> a lot seriously he could feel guilty over killing a fly then feeling guilty over feeling guilty for killing the fly and so forth the animation was grating and unpleasant and the jokes cheap br br it aired here in sweden as a part of the disney time show and i remember liking it some what but then i turned 13 br br i never got why some of the characters were green and purple too what was up with that br br truly a horrible show it <UNK> a movie which i've never seen but i don't have any great expectations for that one either
<START> this great film never showed up in my town so actually i didn't have any opportunity to watch it until the late when i caught it on german television i was expecting something of a disaster and found instead a well acted grand western with superb location work the tiny tube couldn't really damage it and there's almost not a dull moment in this 4 hour film so i hope to see it once again on the big screen what a spectacle that would be don't miss it if you ever have the chance unfortunately the harsh treatment of <UNK> gate at its opening ruined michael <UNK> career and he moved from the passable year of the dragon to the <UNK> ludicrous the <UNK> and the dumb desperate hours
<START> the <UNK> conflict is between a couple of fine actors <UNK> and and the horrible script evidently the actors lost since the director screenwriter claude <UNK> eventually forced the leading couple to follow this worthless piece of sick imagination to the letter fortunately the powerful performances by <UNK> and dramatically improve the overall quality of the movie which miraculously <UNK> the depth and humor as for <UNK> <UNK> in keeping the film bland and illogical it reaches the climax in the final scene which is so incredibly poor that you will wonder which <UNK> he was taking himself while directing it
<START> set in the <UNK> the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis <UNK> this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders gerard depardieu at his finest and <UNK> a commanding performance by the polish actor the <UNK> revolutionary has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being <UNK> as leader of the <UNK> of public safety in the previous year by <UNK> he is opposed to the reign of terror which has resulted in the <UNK> of thousands of citizens mainly by <UNK> who are thought to be opposed to the revolution is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> but <UNK> and the <UNK> are afraid that the popularity of will lead to them being <UNK> and put and his supporters on trial for being <UNK> this was the first french language film made by after he had arrived in france from <UNK> his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the <UNK> trade union which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties his previous film man of iron 1981 had dealt with the <UNK> union and its leader and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of and the polish leader general and that between and <UNK> are the voice of reason opposed to <UNK> who continue <UNK> rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent the film is based on the polish play the affair written by in the 1930s and on its release the film was <UNK> by some for being static and theatrical but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind the scenes <UNK> of the <UNK> and the scenes in the national <UNK> and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris
<START> so dark the night poses a tough challenge it's very hard to write about it in any detail without ruining it for those who haven't yet seen it since it remains quite obscure that includes just about everybody the movie will strike those familiar with its director joseph h <UNK> better known titles in the noir cycle  gun crazy the big <UNK> even my name is julia ross which in its <UNK> it resembles  as an odd choice br br for starters the <UNK> french countryside serves as its setting steven a middle aged detective with the in paris sets out for a vacation in the village of <UNK> <UNK> or maybe <UNK> quite unexpectedly he finds himself falling in love with the daughter even though she's <UNK> to a rough <UNK> local farmer but the <UNK> song of life in paris is hard to resist so she agrees to marry him despite the <UNK> in their ages which inevitably becomes the talk of the town br br but on the night of their engagement party she fails to return to the <UNK> soon a <UNK> finds her body by the river her jealous <UNK> lover is the logical suspect but he too is found dead then anonymous notes <UNK> more deaths which come to pass for the first time in his career the <UNK> finds himself <UNK> br br a particularly weak script all but does the movie in it plays like bad <UNK> <UNK> crossed with the murder of roger <UNK> but lewis does this <UNK> vehicle proud he takes his time near the beginning but then the story  and the storytelling  gain momentum alas just about the time the script breaks an <UNK> <UNK> and photographed the film with an intriguing <UNK> of <UNK> out of and <UNK> into windows there's also an effective score by hugo who <UNK> <UNK> menace to many <UNK> a good deal of talent has been <UNK> on so dark the night but at the end it <UNK> down to not much more than a gimmick  and not a very good gimmick at that it's a one trick <UNK> of a movie br br
<START> it's difficult to decide whether this movie suffers from crap dialogue or if it's just made to appear so by crap actors in any case it suffers from <UNK> which is mediocre at best br br although made in the late <UNK> the first part of the movie plays like a 60's teenage screwball comedy <UNK> the absence of any actual humour especially the part of the <UNK> <UNK> which is as annoying a doris day figure as you could hope fear for including the slightly whiny opposition to anything <UNK> her friends want to do the net effect is after a while you start to hope she'll bite it so you don't have to listen to her voice anymore br br some profanity and gratuitous nudity plus some really 80's style clothing is your only clue that this movie was made in the 80's oh and some pretty passable music too br br <UNK> it's pretty formulaic stuff a bunch of horny apart obviously from <UNK> nice <UNK> teenagers decide to celebrate halloween night by throwing a party in a haunted house <UNK> and <UNK> ensues along with an ill advised which kicks off the demonic possession spree which is the subject of the movie after this the only suspenseful part will be trying to guess in which order the characters will <UNK> you're sure not to care whether or not they will the actors are so bad that becoming demons zombies dinner actually <UNK> their performance somewhat and the ridiculously cliché dialogue is so annoying that you <UNK> in your seat br br this flick ain't <UNK> special unless you think cheesy is kind of <UNK> for example the demon head which occasionally appears is so <UNK> fake that you wonder if it's a 5 year old trick or treating br br this is not to say there's nothing enjoyable in the flick some of the music isn't half bad and the first of our insipid scooby gang to get possessed performs a marvelous and really sexy dance routine at one point before she turns nasty br br also and i don't know why towards the very end of the flick i actually managed to get somewhat involved the suspense lacking in most of the movie made a late appearance and i started to <UNK> out of <UNK> instead of annoyance which is what a horror movie is supposed to do br br i cannot bring myself to give this movie a rock bottom rating since by some inexplicable miracle i don't rule out being possessed by demons i was actually a little <UNK> br br don't pay money to see it though it's hardly worth your time yet alone hard cash watch it on youtube while it's there
<START> well i have to agree with the critics on this one who all said leave it alone why they had to make this re make of the 1960 psycho i don't know my guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern day actors were the answer since those were the main changes the dialog was the same and the story the same br br on one hand i applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film yet if they were going to keep everything the same why bother when you weren't going to improve on tony <UNK> janet leigh and the original cast br br did they honestly think vince vaughn was going to be as good or better than <UNK> are you kidding ann <UNK> with her short <UNK> is going to be better than leigh i don't think so br br yes the colors were pretty in here but it's the black and white photography that helped make the 1960 version so creepy to begin with it's perfect for the story not a bunch of <UNK> and <UNK> once again i guess the filmmakers were <UNK> on an audience that never saw the original br br this was just a stupid project that never should have gotten off the ground
<START> i believe that this is one of elizabeth <UNK> best performances in a movie and i have seen most of her movies i saw this for the first time on television when i was around <UNK> and i was so scared i watch this movie every now and then and i still enjoy it very much i know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much that just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so i love movies that do not show the graphic details you let your imagination do the work for you the cast in this movie was top notch jess <UNK> who played the sister in the story was very good even though her part was rather small she also played in a terrific made for television thriller around the same time called you'll never see me again with david <UNK> i got the biggest kick out of <UNK> performance as the <UNK> <UNK> was so good as a lady with a very bad <UNK> george who played the husband was quite effective this story obviously had a lot of so called mistakes in the plot but i love the movie anyway i highly recommend this movie to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence i gave this movie a vote of seven
<START> when a movie's claim to fame is that martin <UNK> younger less known brother stars in it you know it's not <UNK> be a real good one is a low budget silly film about a group of 20 something year olds being pursued by an angel of death it's a stupid movie but it is pretty entertaining and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity br br the plot in the film is very small and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be joe <UNK> isn't much of an actor so luckily for the audience he has very few lines and his role in mostly just him walking this movie really feels like it was trying to be a horror fantasy franchise considering it has the same plot <UNK> as a slasher 4 characters each dies one at a time will any live who really cares though it sounds like i hated this i didn't i just didn't like it very well but i was interested through most of it so i guess that counts for something br br my rating 1 2 out of 90 mins pg 13 for language violence and nudity
<START> sixth and last movie in the <UNK> well looks like i've saved the best one for last <UNK> iv i originally did a review for this back in like <UNK> but i decided to do a new one the <UNK> series is pretty awesome i know there are some people who don't like them and that's fine this happens to be my favorite one in the series yeah i know the actual <UNK> don't appear and are replaced by 2 guys in costumes one of them being tony cox from bad santa now onto the movie br br the movie centers around jonathan graves the main character from the first movie being played once again by peter who is now a cop for the <UNK> and has put his past of the occult behind him during the first part of the movie we encounter alexandra played by the very hot <UNK> randall <UNK> with a demon from beyond named <UNK> who is the dark side of jonathan <UNK> asks alexandra for a red jewel and something goes awry therefore <UNK> the <UNK> from the beyond br br i think jim <UNK> did a good job with the directing and the music by chuck is funny as well spoiler ahead at the end of this movie the <UNK> say that there will be a <UNK> iv part 2 or <UNK> v i still hope that sequel gets made and i especially hope jim <UNK> returns to direct i agree with on that
<START> in the wake of the matrix this travesty of a film with loose connections to <UNK> has been <UNK> with the tag line the matrix just got in a box with a very matrix inspired cover still called expect to die though due to the choice of <UNK> however the tag line looks to all the world like it says anyway br br to complete the transformation to matrix wannabe they have <UNK> up a <UNK> fight scene with a <UNK> a like on the back of the box it may be important to know that this character does not feature in the film br br overall this film is a travesty on every level <UNK> is an awful actor and does not impress with his martial arts however his partner stone is played by <UNK> <UNK> who in this film is simply the worst actor i have ever seen clearly he was chosen to make <UNK> look good in comparison worst film i have seen for a long long time
<START> i've been a classic horror fan my entire life many nights stretched until the early hours of the morning watching the universal films on horror <UNK> and creature feature night sadly i viewed this film in the early evening and yet it still almost put me to sleep br br i don't think i've ever seen a horror picture where everything was so matter of fact dr doesn't seem to believe in the supernatural yet before long he's <UNK> treating dracula and watching larry <UNK> change into the <UNK> while hardly <UNK> an eye he and <UNK> discover the frankenstein monster like it's an everyday <UNK> is all fired up to bring the monster back to life but after <UNK> and nina protest he's like <UNK> you're right no big deal after realizing <UNK> <UNK> he opens the <UNK> coffin to <UNK> and <UNK> he's gone just like that br br the only person who didn't appear to just be <UNK> in her lines was jane adams as nina her reward is getting <UNK> off the <UNK> in her back into a pit by the frankenstein monster at the end of the film and no one even tries to rescue her she dr and the monster all <UNK> while <UNK> and casually leave the castle br br definitely the low point for universal during it's classic horror years
<START> i have no idea what these people were thinking when they made this film no plot very limited action and what is with the 3rd person commentary throughout the film instead of running around the planet to shoot on all of these locations they should have spent some money on script writing and actors what acting there was was lousy this was 90 minutes of my life i will never be able to get back i should bill the director for the cost of renting this film to the director and the writers of this film please quit now this film should have a tag on the front of it saying beware of boredom the only good thing i can say about this film is the computer generation it's ok as generation is this movie should never have a sequel ever
<START> teen is a great film a very <UNK> entertainer and a very modern film for its time in the 1960s the music and songs are terrific though the lyrics of are meaningless at places <UNK> <UNK> is a tremendous star and as usual does great justice to his role is sexy and is ok <UNK> too is just about ok the film has terrific dialogue by who wrote most of <UNK> <UNK> films like <UNK> warrant note <UNK> etc etc br br it is a story of <UNK> getting attracted to three females the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> he eventually <UNK> for the story is about ok but its been narrated in a gripping way and the dialogue and songs and the great <UNK> <UNK> are the highlight of the film a must watch film for all <UNK> <UNK> fans
<START> i just rented this movie from the video store last night it being new and not released long ago here the rent was only overnight me my little <UNK> and my older brother who usually hates watching these kind of movies sat down and watched once the movie started and after sitting there watching it for a while we were all laughing historically even my brother this movie is hilarious i actually laughed no matter how funny some movies are even if i think its funny i sometimes can't seem to laugh but this movie i laughed my brother ended up thinking it was the best that type of movie he had seen i ended up watching the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later
<START> is by far my second favorite comedy of all time first being <UNK> <UNK> even though that was technically a drama story is nothing groundbreaking but the complications that are added to it make it awesome <UNK> khan is a total cartoon just watch his expressions in the song <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he is amazingly good at comedy i never knew salman khan was also good as the somewhat of the two characters the noises he makes are almost as funny as faces <UNK> and <UNK> serve their purpose but are nothing amazing the real pick of the lot is <UNK> <UNK> as usual br br the plot is rather simple <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> salman are useless sons of poor fathers they don't believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way so both their brains come across an idea to woo a rich man's <UNK> <UNK> daughter <UNK> <UNK> who comes to india to look for a husband so <UNK> and <UNK> meet on the trip and join hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl when they succeed they now have to get rid of each other somehow both of them get into house <UNK> as an injured guy and <UNK> as his doctor from here on they try to <UNK> each other but things are complicated as friend <UNK> kapoor falls for <UNK> and <UNK> him and rich man's evil twin brother <UNK> also tries to get rid of the <UNK> and her father so he will <UNK> the money and sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work br br this is a movie you do not want to miss watch it it will be worth it i even own the dvd its that good and if you like this movie i'd also recommend <UNK> if you haven't already watched it other good comedies are <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> new
<START> this film biography of early rock and roll star buddy holly 1936 1959 is a tour de force for gary busey the movie's highlights are <UNK> stage performances where he plays guitar and sings holly songs he brings such energy to the performances that <UNK> own filmed performances almost pale in comparison <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> grin lights up the screen he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved br br the film follows <UNK> career from growing up in texas to stardom and new york and his <UNK> death in a plane crash one thing i found interesting if true was <UNK> driving ambition he had great plans to go beyond recording and performance to producing as young as he was he was already establishing himself as a <UNK> businessman and definitely wanted to take things to a higher level we will never know if he would have ultimately <UNK> his early success into a business brand like the rolling stones br br the lyrics of many of <UNK> songs are pretty adolescent read the lyrics for peggy sue or oh boy and you will see what i mean maybe to a great extent this explains his popularity with adolescent audiences but his <UNK> and stage performances surely account for his influence on groups to follow both the rolling stones and the beatles have acknowledged his importance br br clearly some liberties were taken for dramatic effect for example i doubt that holly ever <UNK> out a producer in <UNK> or that the audience at new <UNK> apollo theater was so immediately <UNK> as to be wildly dancing in the <UNK> if you are interested in getting closer to the truth see the documentary the real buddy holly story 1985 that is produced and <UNK> by a very relaxed and engaging paul <UNK> this contains interviews with <UNK> family friends and band mates <UNK> musical brothers are not even mentioned in the buddy holly story members of other bands like keith richards and don <UNK> also offer opinions and stories and there is footage of old holly performances the <UNK> production can stand on its own but it makes an excellent companion piece to the buddy holly story and perhaps should be required viewing for anyone who watches the <UNK> story
<START> could possibly be the worst film ever made at least plan 9 from outer space was funny i can't believe they talked someone into actually putting up money to make this thing complete waste of celluloid before i saw this crap i had some respect for i guess somebody needed a tax write off please in the name of all that which does not suck stop whoever made this before they suck again this movie should be avoided by all people who are not on <UNK> or my crazy cousin that insists we're part native american if you are in the woods and an owl starts talking to you see a psychiatrist it is not necessary to make a movie about it
<START> to call this film a disaster will be an understatement i don't even know where to begin i have questions though and lots of them i would like to know who conceived of this script who gave them money to make this film who was in charge of casting and <UNK> they should all be <UNK> i saw this film in my local <UNK> <UNK> and i thought hey great i had just seen the two fog movies that hollywood had produced and then realised that bollywood had a version <UNK> to me that it would turn out to be a total and utter crap fest br br the fog is a film about four friends actually just one of them but you should know that there are four friends one of them is a beauty queen played by <UNK> 1st mrs world and the director <UNK> no expense at letting you know this the script even claims that she the character's name is has <UNK> <UNK> eyes kareena kapoor lips and <UNK> <UNK> hair feel free to <UNK> if you want to at least at this point you haven't seen the film unlike poor me br br anyway receives a death threat one day from one of the uncle who tells her to drop out of the contest so that his niece would have a better chance of winning but boyfriend doesn't allow her to do this and thus she <UNK> in the <UNK> and wins this causes the crack cocaine <UNK> uncle of her former college <UNK> <UNK> to come after her but with the help of her cousin <UNK> the <UNK> and they <UNK> both their boyfriends in the task of getting rid of the body it's tough but they eventually get around to doing it br br in a scene that borrows from hollywood's film <UNK> the pool where the dead body is hidden is <UNK> only to reveal that the body is missing and this begins a <UNK> of <UNK> and where is it by the time the film is over the film successful steals scenes from 'i know what you did last summer i still know scream 1 scream 2 scream 3 murder she wrote episodes and not to mention columbo and scooby <UNK> shameless i tell ya br br inconsistencies and problems within the film include but are not limited to br br 1 a scantily clad answers phone calls three times from her would be killer the camera shows her drop the phone off the hook yet the phone is able to ring again each time and she picks it up to answer br br 2 <UNK> tries to kill herself because she doesn't win the beauty contest wtf even <UNK> <UNK> who is ten time more beautiful did not attempt suicide when she didn't win miss india br br 3 in the pool scene the kids who come to retrieve the ball that has fallen into the pool conveniently disappear as soon as the police arrive and the ball disappears too br br 4 the cliché blue contacts <UNK> of the killer change from blue to brown in the drowning scene yet when his corpse <UNK> again his eyes are blue br br 5 nobody who dies in the film is <UNK> strange especially for indian society br br 6 when jumps into the dirty murky pool an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously the pool is transformed to olympic size and is clean and clear as day br br 7 sexy belly dancer performs a pseudo <UNK> <UNK> song and dance number about coming of age that would have been cool for some bachelor party but they were celebrating <UNK> win hello br br 8 <UNK> <UNK> and can neither dance nor lip <UNK> properly but don't blame them just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers br br 9 nothing within the film was choreographed it was like they just told the actors to show up and do whatever the want br br 10 the film played out like there was no script either that or the director was high and drunk when filming this junk br br 11 when picture was published without her <UNK> in a magazine she flew to the police <UNK> to have the <UNK> arrested yet she receives death <UNK> and never bothers to alert the police br br just to mention a few of course this film was a painful experience for me and i advise everyone to skip it by all means necessary and possible bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of film making
<START> my <UNK> for <UNK> a movie's watch ability is if i get <UNK> if i start shifting positions and <UNK> my butt is sore the film is too long this movie did not even come close to being boring predictable in some parts sure but never boring br br all of the other military <UNK> have had love notes written about them and seen their <UNK> levels go up why not the coast guard too they are definitely under appreciated until the day your boat sinks that is br br the movie was very enjoyable and fun kevin <UNK> is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit however i was most impressed by <UNK> performance i have never liked him never watched any of his tv shows and always considered him an immature well punk in this film he does a great job he is well on his way to having leading man status i think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something because about 2 3 of the way in the film stock turned very grainy the sound level dropped and <UNK> were seen dropping down all over the place also at the viewing were <UNK> from the movie looking for audience <UNK> particularly on the parts of the film we didn't like br br possible spoiler the <UNK> i gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning kevin <UNK> comes home to see his wife ward <UNK> her stuff up and moving out he says maybe i should be the one to move out and she replies no you don't know where anything is in this house i should be the one to go this doesn't make sense if she knows the <UNK> so well <UNK> is right he should be the one to leave
<START> alex <UNK> john cassavetes is an orchestra conductor having an secret affair with his <UNK> when she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he doesn't leave his wife he sees he has no choice but to murder her and make it look as if she had committed suicide too bad for him our <UNK> detective lt columbo peter falk is on the case br br stephen <UNK> has written another razor sharp episode for the series following marvelous detail with marvelous detail we watch the villain commit his murder and set up his <UNK> for about twenty five minutes and we're completely <UNK> then when columbo appears on the scene it gets even better br br we first see columbo after the murder as per usual this time he's at the vet with his new dog scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest ones in the show think <UNK> <UNK> over the nude model in suitable for framing columbo is hilarious when he's <UNK> or bumbling deliberately in order to trip up his <UNK> but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he's with non suspects <UNK> by contrast shows columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of low key scenes that are funny and <UNK> integrated into the story and i'm grateful he didn't strain for a punchline to <UNK> quest to give the dog a name as far as we learn the dog remains <UNK> <UNK> gives columbo some of his best moments in this episode and peter falk makes the most of them he's particularly good in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill herself much less this brilliant and beautiful young <UNK> and he's even better in his scenes playing cat and mouse with cassavetes that these two long time friends and <UNK> would play off each other brilliantly is to be expected and that's what we get notice how alex <UNK> can't help but admire the <UNK> <UNK> columbo even as the brilliant detective is <UNK> the <UNK> around his neck br br <UNK> makes the most of every situation in his script when columbo goes to question <UNK> mechanic of course  of course  he asks the man to look at his own beat up heap and when <UNK> finds columbo at the hollywood bowl before rehearsal of course  of course  he's on the piano playing <UNK> and what should our <UNK> lieutenant bring with him but the <UNK> <UNK> with the phony suicide note still in the roller br br columbo also has good scenes with a <UNK> little girl dawn frame and the lovely <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> wife it's nice to see myrna loy show up as mother though she does little with her minor role br br the director nicholas who also acted most notably as coach in cheers does a perfectly <UNK> job though he follows the lead of nearly every other columbo director by adding one or two silly <UNK> scenes end by going out of focus and begin by coming into focus then there's that bit where cassavetes sees the he dropped at the scene of the crime  and we see a zoom in shot of it reflected in his <UNK> there's also one scene with myrna loy and group of old <UNK> that is <UNK> performed by everyone except cassavetes br br these are <UNK> though this is a <UNK> entertaining episode the kind that made me a columbo fan
<START> in many ways the <UNK> career of independent film making legend john cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like alfred hitchcock the <UNK> studio director where hitchcock <UNK> treated his actors as cattle cassavetes sought to work with them <UNK> where every element in a hitchcock shot is composed <UNK> cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was <UNK> composed than in how it felt or what it conveyed emotionally hitchcock's tales were always plot first <UNK> with the human element put in the background cassavetes put the human experience <UNK> in every one of his films if some things did not make much sense <UNK> so be it br br one can see this even from his very first film <UNK> shadows filmed with a <UNK> hand held camera on a shoe string budget of about 40 000 in manhattan with <UNK> acting <UNK> <UNK> company and <UNK> as an <UNK> film the story is rather simple as it follows the lives of three black sibling <UNK> benny ben <UNK> a <UNK> and no account hugh hugh <UNK> a washed up singer and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the younger sister of both the film's three main <UNK> deal with <UNK> failures as a nightclub <UNK> and his friendship with his manager rupert rupert <UNK> in an about manhattan with his two no account pals and <UNK> first with a white boy tony anthony ray who does not realize light skinned race even after <UNK> her then with stiff and proper jones who may be a <UNK> br br in the first arc nothing much happens except dark skinned hugh gets to <UNK> on how <UNK> he feels to be singing in low class <UNK> and opening shows for <UNK> acts he dreams of making it big in new york or even paris but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue <UNK> himself of his <UNK> skill for the one time we actually get to hear him sing he shows he's a <UNK> talent at best that rupert keeps <UNK> him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work but this is the least important of the three while this film is better overall than say martin <UNK> first film a decade later who's that knocking at my door another tale of failed romance and frustrated new <UNK> it has none of the brilliant moments acting wise nor <UNK> that that film has it also is not <UNK> for <UNK> in art is a very difficult thing to achieve especially in film although the 1950s era manhattan <UNK> at ground level is a gem to <UNK> while shadows may indeed be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit it certainly is nowhere near a great film parts of it are preachy poorly acted scenes end willy <UNK> almost like <UNK> sketches and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle all in all it's a very sloppy job especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of <UNK> with the rest of the film as cassavetes proved that as a director at least in his first film he was a good actor the only reason for anyone to see shadows is because cassavetes ultimately got better with later films and this gives a clue as to his later working style br br the national film <UNK> has rightly <UNK> this film worthy of <UNK> as this is all in keeping with the <UNK> of art cassavetes long <UNK> as <UNK> by this quote <UNK> never seen an exploding helicopter i've never seen anybody go and blow <UNK> head off so why should i make films about them but i have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way i've seen people <UNK> i've seen people hide behind political ideas behind <UNK> behind the sexual revolution behind <UNK> behind <UNK> and i've myself done all these things so i can understand them what we are saying is so gentle it's <UNK> we have problems terrible problems but our problems are human problems ' that this film is is true but that truth is not <UNK> with its being it is in the difference between these two <UNK> where great art truly <UNK>
<START> if you are a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> for the <UNK> of the spanish republic this movie may be for you two brothers real life ones one of them being marc himself re <UNK> a fictional version of a real life journey they had made through the spectacular <UNK> countryside and history is <UNK> pans of bullet <UNK> walls <UNK> <UNK> on the soundtrack but not shown there is very little dialog and most of it is incidental the story is told in a third person voice over the voice being that of an actress <UNK> the real life sister of the real life brothers the images have little to do with what story line there is which isn't much many are stunning brooding pans across stark semi <UNK> mountains and rivers think <UNK> <UNK> or gus van <UNK> there's not a little of both <UNK> and last days here interspersed with some stunning still images and <UNK> frames these are best enjoyed within the film's superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music some quite good some rather odd but all gratuitous the best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences with their occasional comment less inclusion of power stations and br br the relationship between the brothers is left <UNK> and generic a major character is a man biting <UNK> never shown the more the <UNK> <UNK> of the director are suggested the more the film's <UNK> <UNK> message is <UNK> and the more <UNK> <UNK> the experience becomes though the director said at the screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with its third person narrative i'd like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and <UNK> dialog the result might be more moving and would in any case not be that much less <UNK> br br meantime this is most likely the only film you will see this year in which a guy <UNK> into the frame with a cloth object the bathing suit he had been wearing <UNK> from his penis this is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest is sorry <UNK> by something that's actually happening on screen what is that <UNK> it hanging there but as usual no answers are provided very <UNK> very sixties and a not a little tiresome
<START> i was so excited to see the cast in this movie that i was completely surprised at how completely wrong this movie was i love john voight but i have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this travesty the biblical accuracy was completely non existent and i honestly could not stomach watching the movie with my children my kids stood <UNK> because even they know that lot was not even thought of when <UNK> was building the <UNK> i think that nbc should be ashamed of themselves for allowing producers to make a mockery of the word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is please do not buy this movie i have considered burning my copy but i have every intentions on writing the producers and sending them the <UNK> references that they should have read before making this movie
<START> this movie has been advertised for over three months in <UNK> as the biggest greek production ever well it could be but when you hear of a big production you expect to see something new something different what you get to watch here is a movie with no reason of existence george looks like he didn't really enjoy making this movie his acting is so simplistic that looks almost amateur the sound especially when some of the turkish actors speak english dubbed is full of <UNK> the thankfully few special effects showing <UNK> and <UNK> in the late 50's and early 70's are more like digital paintings than computer graphics finally we see the same boy from 1959 age 5 up to 1968 age 14 but in a <UNK> way he becomes a teenager five years later br br so much for the biggest greek production at least one would think that there would be some kind of interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production and all one gets is a love story between 7 year olds who meet again 40 years later oh there is a political side too a couple of ironic remarks about the greek <UNK> of <UNK> so childish that seem almost forced br br there are of course a couple of good things in the movie most of the actors are great mainly the very good scenery and the magnificent music by but they are so few for such an expensive production br br bottom line is it so bad a movie to tell the truth i don't know i just know that in no point does it justify its huge for greek standards budget
<START> viewing both of these films <UNK> is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles i give the nod to garbo but not by much in regard to her <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> but his performance is aimed for a large <UNK> theater something else that struck me was the movies themes of <UNK> for women and <UNK> there hadn't been any films coming out of hollywood yet that allowed the voices of <UNK> characters like anna and <UNK> to take the <UNK> these were very <UNK> films for their time it's quite <UNK> that o'neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of america
<START> this world war ii film set in <UNK> tries so hard to work on so many levels it is a shame it fails on all of them br br nick nolte is an escaping american who witnesses the <UNK> of his <UNK> by the japanese he wanders deep into the <UNK> of <UNK> lost cue <UNK> who finds <UNK> adopted tribe nolte now looking like robert plant has become his <UNK> new king he defeated a <UNK> warrior in a bloody battle and had a telling <UNK> on his chest a dragon now before you go out and get a painful <UNK> and a one way ticket to <UNK> things are not going well in wants the <UNK> help in fighting the japanese who are <UNK> the island he teaches the natives how to use machine guns and a whole lot o shooting begins as the tribe becomes more successful they run up against a new <UNK> of japanese who are not like the others this squad the <UNK> they <UNK> in order to keep their strength up talk about your <UNK> and they move through the <UNK> even <UNK> than the tribe since we know the outcome of the war we know eventually the tribe <UNK> but with heavy <UNK> here come the spoilers is injured and returned to civilization he gives the location of the kingdom and nolte is captured then goes through the trouble of releasing nolte and the end credits roll br br direction is certainly adequate but the screenplay here is rather vague in its motivations it presents story ideas then <UNK> them in order to get to the next story idea nolte is awful as the soldier turned king desperately trying to channel the spirit of marlon <UNK> colonel <UNK> he talks about freedom and the beauty of the jungle and the <UNK> of his people and you will not believe for one second the words he <UNK> he is often unintentionally funny especially his initial bug out in the jungle and he spends the rest of the film sounding like a hippie <UNK> spends the movie looking at nolte like he was <UNK> welch the vague homosexual <UNK> between the two goes beyond friendship not quite to sex and <UNK> into an <UNK> relationship that must have had the natives talking br br often stands around and has an internal conflict <UNK> at the <UNK> but <UNK> in <UNK> attention his fellow straight laced british <UNK> go native faster than the bounty landing party in <UNK> but all i saw concerning <UNK> is that it is very <UNK> and has lots of green br br the climactic betrayal where gives away <UNK> location is completely devoid of any reason there is not one thought given as to why does this except to keep the film going i was angry when by chance and nolte end up on the same ship going to the <UNK> the ship happens to run and runs to the hold to free the <UNK> <UNK> nolte no goodbye kiss but says farewell to the king explaining the title br br if you were fighting a war and an enemy <UNK> was eating your allies would that not freak you out this elite japanese squad is not shown enough although their eating <UNK> are so horrific i would become a <UNK> right away the same type of ghostly enemy was handled much better in the 13th warrior br br other types of interesting ideas are dropped what about the fact that then modern technology brings about the deaths of so many <UNK> people why did king nolte let the brits use his subjects without too much <UNK> why can't hollywood find a decent actor to play general douglas macarthur br br in the end farewell to the king is a letdown not <UNK> by a strong lead and trying to be too many things without thinking and exploring its <UNK> i cannot recommend this one br br this film is rated <UNK> for strong physical violence strong gun violence some gore some profanity some sexual references and adult situations
<START> i must confess that i've been a huge fan of the almighty david the <UNK> <UNK> ever since he starred in the hit 80's tv series knight rider whether it's his extraordinary debut as a <UNK> high school basketball player in the hilariously raunchy revenge of the <UNK> or his brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the <UNK> sci fi gem the <UNK> has proved time and time again that he's a simply terrific and <UNK> underrated actor supreme the <UNK> excels here as gary a cynical and skeptical photographer who along with his repressed <UNK> writer girlfriend leslie attractive brunette leslie <UNK> <UNK> a seedy <UNK> haunted hotel located on a remote island off the coast of they're doing research on witchcraft throughout the ages and the <UNK> last owner was an actress who allegedly <UNK> the black arts a <UNK> family also shows up on the premises to check out the hotel pretty soon various folks begin to get <UNK> off in <UNK> gruesome ways by the mysterious lady in black an effectively eerie <UNK> <UNK> br br granted the rest of the cast gives the <UNK> a run for his money the ever <UNK> linda blair projects her <UNK> charming flair as a <UNK> pregnant woman who winds up becoming possessed <UNK> legendary jazz singer annie ross <UNK> it up with <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> old bat poor annie winds up being <UNK> alive after she has her lips <UNK> shut and she's hung upside down in a <UNK> and gorgeous blonde catherine <UNK> <UNK> considerable sex appeal from every <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> slut <UNK> competent direction a suitably creepy atmosphere slick glossy cinematography the fluid <UNK> <UNK> tracking shots are especially nice the <UNK> special effects <UNK> maria and randy <UNK> spirited score and the gory sadistic violence are all up to par but ultimately it's the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only the <UNK> which makes this choice tasty <UNK> of tacky italian horror cheese such a winner he takes his shirt off once <UNK> <UNK> gets <UNK> with blood and warning major spoiler ahead even meets a <UNK> grisly <UNK> end produced by none other than joe <UNK> this picture overall rates as good sleazy fun
<START> the story is <UNK> from the beginning until the latter third of this movie then the story gets more and more outrageous the main character portrayed by <UNK> is fantastic and had a difficult role this could have been a super great movie had the ending been more realistic
<START> one of the first things i noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at place an <UNK> shot is used to show sole being <UNK> with kisses by a sea of women i believed this was a commentary on the <UNK> that women had for each other of this who stuck together across the generations and <UNK> and still being able to bond and rely on each other also the film seemed to <UNK> women as almost flawless individuals what i mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no <UNK> an example of this is shortly after paula accidentally killed her father her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while paula seems to suffer almost no <UNK> for what she has done again another example of this is when each daughter or <UNK> has had an opportunity to reunite with their supposed dead mother grandmother knowing the <UNK> that this has most likely caused in their family each one of them still <UNK> the mother without care for what she has is killing her husband and his lover in this light women are portrayed as ones who not only love each other independent of character acts but also ones who don't seem bothered in the least by the acts in which their friends family members perform br br another idea that i thought was intriguing of this culture was in regards to their idea of the supernatural with the death of and mother and her inexplicable return the director builds the audience's emotions to believe that this film is going to <UNK> the supernatural the people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural that is to say very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave their aunt long time friend the prostitute and other people living in the city of la <UNK> all believe the rumors of the dead coming back to family members to finish the unfinished business i believed this was a mixed reflection of the <UNK> religious faith <UNK> catholic as well as their need to make <UNK> with those who had no chance to be forgiven during <UNK> the belief they held in regards to the dead being alive was also to give hope to the <UNK> circumstances they suffered in <UNK> when the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film isn't supernatural at all it's interesting to observe the role the mother continues to play she's treated as if she still is a ghost i e hiding in small <UNK> underneath the bed or inside a car <UNK> i believe the director portrayed the mother this way to <UNK> the already existent supernatural beliefs the city had adopted the mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long held belief in life after death
<START> only if you are crazy about <UNK> smith should you see this besides her body there is pretty much nothing in terms of cinematic value she even has a lesbian scene in this one my guess is she is trying to into those late night scream queens ala shannon <UNK> and julie strain
<START> i don't know whether this film hits my heart the way it does because of the feelings of friendship love <UNK> to others or the warmth of that transformation <UNK> cooking creates but when the feast starts and for the rest of the movie i choke up often br br yes this is a feel good movie but without a <UNK> of or <UNK> sentimentality please note that elements of the plot are discussed <UNK> feast tells its story with restraint and care and it lets us discover for ourselves the values of grace and love all we need to know is that <UNK> <UNK> was a french <UNK> who was given shelter by two aging sisters in a tiny community on the coast of <UNK> the sisters lead what remains of their father's flock he was a <UNK> of conviction who taught that salvation comes through self denial the sisters made their sacrifices to duty and faith those who still remain honor the now long dead <UNK> <UNK> and his spiritual <UNK> still as they have grown older the tiny community has become <UNK> and <UNK> the sisters do what they can for the <UNK> <UNK> birthday <UNK> wishes to cook the dinner for the small group the sisters will invite the sisters reluctantly agree but when they see the supplies <UNK> has ordered they and their guests become uneasy they are used to the <UNK> usual fare of <UNK> <UNK> boiled and a soup made of bread water and a little <UNK> even though <UNK> over time has made <UNK> what they are seeing now seems close to at the dinner also will be a visitor general <UNK> who years earlier had chosen ambition over his love for one of the sisters br br what do we experience there is the <UNK> of the aging <UNK> faith and the stone wind swept <UNK> they live in there is the warmth by <UNK> of the <UNK> small crowded <UNK> room and then there is the <UNK> power of <UNK> artistry as we watch her cook watch <UNK> a young boy helping her serve and pour and watch the old <UNK> with the help of fine wine and exquisite cooking gradually <UNK> their community and love and friendship the general serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary <UNK> they are eating the general tells a story to his <UNK> dinner companions a story about a famed woman who was the <UNK> chef at the famed <UNK> in paris this woman this head chef had the ability to <UNK> a dinner into a kind of love affair a love affair that made no distinction between <UNK> <UNK> and spiritual <UNK> he too is being transformed into a man who will accept what he has become and yet will always know the value and the love of what long ago he chose not to accept an old couple kiss two old men remember past friendships and <UNK> who spent all that she had won in a <UNK> on this dinner has had an opportunity to be the artist she once was in france an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship br br <UNK> now as poor as she was when she arrived <UNK> years earlier will continue with the sisters the general in a <UNK> with his aunt returns to her estate and the elderly guests leave the <UNK> home to return to their own <UNK> they pause and look at the clear night sky and the stars <UNK> they <UNK> hold hands in a circle and dance and sing this <UNK> br br the clock strikes and time goes by eternity is <UNK> let us use this time to try to serve the lord with heart and mind so that our true home we shall find so that our true home we shall find br br they smile at each other all has been <UNK> br br <UNK> feast is a wonderful movie full of restrained emotion <UNK> <UNK> wisdom and of course a meal that will leave you with a <UNK> stomach as you exit the theater if you win a <UNK> so you could afford what <UNK> created and have her skill and artistry here's what she served br br a la a rich turtle soup served with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> small <UNK> <UNK> with sour cream and <UNK> served with <UNK> en with <UNK> <UNK> stuffed with <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> served with de a fine <UNK> cheese and fresh fruit <UNK> <UNK> with fruit and fresh coffee and a fine <UNK>
<START> in retrospect the 1970s was a golden era for the american cinema as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by ted <UNK> and richard <UNK> this <UNK> effort serves to illustrate and <UNK> the main idea of what that time meant for the careers of these <UNK> people seen in the documentary br br the amazing body of work that remains is a legacy to all the people involved in the art of making movies in that period the decade was marked by the end of the <UNK> <UNK> war and the <UNK> finale of those years of jimmy <UNK> <UNK> br br one thing comes out clear films today don't measure against the movies that came out during that creative decade because the industry as a whole has changed dramatically the big studios nowadays want to go to tame pictures that will be instant hits without any consideration to content or integrity as long as the bottom line shows millions of dollars in <UNK> br br the other thing that emerges after hearing some of america's best creative minds speak is the importance of the independent film spirit because it is about the only thing that afford its creators great moral and artistic <UNK> br br this documentary is a must see for all movie fans
<START> this movie is not the scariest of all time but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick low budget no stars lots of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats the premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well a nice starting point for just say julie brown exposing her talents early in her career this film won't be seen by many but for fans of 80's horror it's a must
<START> it is a very great film documentary about <UNK> and their people and it's music of every kind editing and the success of the director is very impressive i've been interested with faith akin since i saw the <UNK> die <UNK> head on <UNK> and i admired his work very much but this one has been the most touching one for me so i'm here writing this it is not just about <UNK> or something like that it is a very good biography of a city and how music stay alive in it we can say there are views of many people and so very <UNK> ideas about even life and love i liked it very much and i thing anyone and everyone should see it not only but especially the ones anyhow related with turkey
<START> possible spoilers br br no one is likely to pick up a dvd of red dust without knowing that it is about south <UNK> truth and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stars as a south african <UNK> who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing alex a member of the south african <UNK> who was tortured by a prison guard pete <UNK> ian roberts who is seeking to escape prison by <UNK> before the truth and <UNK> <UNK> they could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a south african accent ms <UNK> makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her <UNK> american accent nevertheless she is the only well known actor in the movie and it would probably not have been made without her or someone equally well known she does a passable job however and <UNK> <UNK> in the german way with an over the u are outstanding as is jamie as the chief of police responsible for murdering <UNK> and fellow prisoner the torture scenes are shown in brief flashes but they are vivid and believable what is not believable is the truth and <UNK> process except that it actually happened red dust should be seen for that reason alone because it was and is unbelievable that the <UNK> prisoners could actually forgive the <UNK> and this is as close as we are likely to get to seeing the process in action
<START> i agree with vince this movie <UNK> the way for <UNK> the scene where <UNK> was throwing <UNK> at the piano player reminded me of his how am i funny routine in <UNK> this is a highly underrated film and deserves some attention as with many other mob films the theme of the death collector rings true always respect the don
<START> i'm from phoenix city and the first time i saw this movie and read the book it only confirmed the stories i had heard all of my life i asked my grandfather about the mob and he told me that when he got back from fighting in the pacific theatre he started up a firm that is know the largest in the <UNK> area when he was just starting out he was asked by the mob to do financial work for them but he said that he gently <UNK> even when the fbi and army came through phoenix city and <UNK> it up my grandfather wouldn't take it lightly when my mom aunt or uncle went across the river but i assure you all of that is over now the downtown area of phoenix city is in need of <UNK> and it has <UNK> by the <UNK> where all of the shooting still occasionally takes place over angry <UNK> low <UNK> economic people and the <UNK> street phoenix eagle bridge has been shut down for a solid 15 years and replaced by a newer 13th street bridge but on the more fair side of phoenix city on <UNK> <UNK> it is very quaint and the scenery depressing br br another incident was told to me by my best friend's family from high school that lives in a nothing spot on <UNK> <UNK> called holy <UNK> <UNK> which is about 28 minutes outside of <UNK> <UNK> my best friend in high <UNK> uncle was a man that went by the name of old man davis regardless of how the movie goes that fact is that there were 3 bosses and old man davis was one of them you can even read about him in the original book legend has it that he was so cold blooded that he went to downtown phoenix city to make a deal with a man but apparently the man backed out on the deal right in front of old man davis so the old man davis <UNK> to take a <UNK> off shotgun out of his coat and shoot the man in the chest in the middle of town by the <UNK> they say he even walked off <UNK> because the mob had paid off every law <UNK> official in town so he had nothing to worry about br br another incident is about a bridge that another one of my friends owns a rental house next to in downtown phoenix city it is the same bridge that the mob killed and threw a black man off of and you can even read that part in the book i also would like to as that in many <UNK> and phoenix city civilians were asked to be extras in the movie when the friend is murdered and brought to trial and proved guilty in front of the judge but still set free well the judge is my fathers partner in his law firm in <UNK> who is deceased
<START> this is the first american film i have seen at this year and i think it will be the greatest one because of the feeling as a teenage singer in america aaron is not as pop as before most americans i met said his song is fake and that he even didn't know how to rap but attention everyone he is a kid how many people can understand him being a pop fan is difficult and being a pop star is more difficult i think this time aaron <UNK> has shows something real to us and i think people should learn to understand each other at another hand i like the music in the film very much i remember the first song appeared in the film is saturday night and it also include some <UNK> real live show and the second one is one better so i think if you enjoy this film maybe you'll be a pop fan too at last i hope you will have a great time a voice from a chinese boy
<START> this film is the most <UNK> and painful horror film i have ever seen in my life to know that this film is based on a true story and watching jeffrey dahmer carl crew brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye i admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue however it explained why jeffrey dahmer was a maniac as he was so <UNK> <UNK> emotional his emotions and <UNK> went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer every person that he <UNK> back to his apartment he was attracted to and had feelings for and the reasons why he murdered them wasn't only for the thrill of killing them but because he couldn't cope with the fact of them leaving him in the scene when he killed his first victim by bashing an object at the back of the guys head from what i noticed wasn't because he wanted to kill him but because he was <UNK> with the idea of the guy leaving him it was from thereafter that he got use to the homicidal behaviour and made killing his <UNK> for both evil and emotional reasons br br the scene when he was talking while crying on the phone with his mother and telling her how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he didn't want to move out of her house did show that he did have love in his heart one scene that i found quite spooky and strange was when a priest <UNK> jeffrey in a pub <UNK> a guy back to his apartment and then <UNK> jeffrey up in a phone booth within the pub so that the guy would lose patience and change his mind on going home with jeffrey when the guy left the pub the priest then hung up the phone and was was laughing at jeffrey i also found that carl crew played a remarkable acting performance as the role of jeffrey dahmer his evil and cold blooded facial expressions before he <UNK> his victims were so real i was <UNK> in my seat his facial expressions reminded me of the way vincent <UNK> private <UNK> leonard in the film <UNK> metal <UNK> looked just before he <UNK> down the general in the toilet <UNK> br br if your an emotional person i wouldn't recommend you to watch this film but if your not than go ahead and watch it
<START> what a movie it has undeniably entertaining subject matter unless you're a <UNK> and a mature funny and complex script from paul thomas anderson <UNK> hard eight <UNK> anderson will <UNK> be around for some time the evidence is here in this epic and ambitious masterpiece every character is expertly played and touching and fully shaped from burt reynolds as jack <UNK> the director to <UNK> moore his movie star and mark <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> they all are fabulous and the story wow honest look at business and failure and consequences and family one of the best movies of all time i give it a a
<START> the best batman movie of the 90's no doubt about it this movie takes place in a city filled with <UNK> and nightmares br br although the villains are somewhat cheesy they fit perfect for the movie's tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography br br the performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations br br don't get fooled by the cheesy outfits this is a movie in the pure style of burton that can't be described burton is a <UNK> <UNK> director that took the batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about it's comic style past br br recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all if it deals with super heroes
<START> <UNK> i just love this movie to bits me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and i am just such a huge fan i hope they bring the tv series out on dvd soon come to mention it i have not see the tv show in a long time such times where i come from australia the <UNK> adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adult years which is kinda sad because the young kids don't know what there missing br br the songs in this film are ace the ones i love the most boys girls of rock <UNK> diamond dolls and the song that <UNK> sure to make you want to cry my mother br br this film is sure to <UNK> both young and old get the <UNK> adventure today 10 out of 10 such an excellent movie
<START> it's the single <UNK> thing i ever watched it's sad how he tries so hard to come up with a good joke and all he does is curse and thinks his disgusting <UNK> is funny he is the most bitter person i ever saw his whole act he is trying to show how much he doesn't care and by that only showing how much he's angry at the critics and the people with any taste and sense of humor who'd rather go through immense torture than go watch his show there are good comedians there are bad ones and there are horrible ones but this guy is in a league of his own i feel sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny
<START> i initially tuned in to <UNK> state because i more or less find the <UNK> search genre to be interesting tv if nothing else br br i really enjoy ghost hunters because well over half of their <UNK> result in total <UNK> and find most haunted to be hilarious with its use of <UNK> and <UNK> british women with paris hilton day <UNK> eyes <UNK> from fear demonic <UNK> all shot in lovely night vision green br br <UNK> state has none of this appeal it feels like it was <UNK> together from leads that ghost hunters rejected the episodes <UNK> from trailer trash families and single mothers with <UNK> <UNK> sitting around and <UNK> themselves to an interview with a 5 year old about the monster who lives in his room the monster goes we are told all of these people calling upon a college club to solve their problems the whole show is about ryan and his partner his enormous ego he leads his <UNK> of <UNK> eyed <UNK> around except when a case is deemed too extreme and orders them to remain at the hotel <UNK> better leave it to the pros ie himself br br the <UNK> comedy of this show is all in how <UNK> the participants are ryan <UNK> his tales of being hunted followed etc by a demon that he first encountered when the catholic church <UNK> him to assist on a case sorry but the catholic church has people who can do that they don't need the day shift manager at to chip in his 2 cents br br this show is awful shame on a e for <UNK> this silliness trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better <UNK> themed shows it's almost unintentionally funny except that ryan is so arrogant and devoid of charisma that watching the show long enough to mock it isn't worth the trouble
<START> in hoot a new kid arrives to florida from montana he first faces the usual problems of <UNK> in and dealing with the local bully soon though he becomes aware of a bigger problem a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town right where a number of <UNK> <UNK> live this movie has the look of a family film but it is pretty more radical than it seems as it shows <UNK> how roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from including <UNK> of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of <UNK> in the name of <UNK> to save <UNK> no less now one might agree or not with those actions but at least the movie has the courage from not <UNK> away from its <UNK> a good solid film all in all
<START> this show was rushed and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials when it came back from commercial the noise or surprise was something simple like a mouse this is a pure rip off of ghost hunters and it attempts to go beyond them and fails miserably also what is with the directors <UNK> thing is this star trek it just ruins the novelty of this show which wore off quick the only reason it's been watched is that people want to laugh at the pure anti climatic nature of it they never find anything and most likely never will <UNK> enough they always point out something that is the thing they are hunting and guess what it's the local radio <UNK> tower light that is <UNK> red
<START> it would be a shame if one has yet to watch speed <UNK> be it dubbed or <UNK> i prefer the dubbed version which is rare because it was funny in a good way what's great about speed <UNK> is that you're never too old to watch it go red and yellow i first saw this when i was around seven and enjoyed hearing the catchy opening it disappeared for some time then i saw it again a couple of months ago i'm 19 imagine the feeling of nostalgia <UNK> in singing here he comes here comes speed <UNK> he's a demon on <UNK> over and over again anyway the concept of the <UNK> 5 <UNK> so many multi function special but none were able to <UNK> its genius in construction the other cars just seemed too much and it wasn't just the races or battling different bosses that made it interesting for me it was <UNK> <UNK> mystery persona and how the world of speed <UNK> pretty much to <UNK> around it they did some <UNK> to some story lines from the manga but it all turned out pretty well though i can't remember if the show actually revealed how <UNK> x looked like in the manga they did
<START> <UNK> ray appeals to viewers of all ages and backgrounds <UNK> <UNK> or seasoned veterans you'll be <UNK> with a <UNK> presentation of <UNK> yet time efficient <UNK> <UNK> up with her unique brand of <UNK> and <UNK> most importantly this hip <UNK> keeps her audience drawn in by stimulating all five senses let me explain her program provides enlightenment to your visual sense <UNK> sense and sense of feeling through a rich <UNK> <UNK> backdrop light hearted casual yet engaging topics eye pleasing <UNK> wrenching <UNK> and her <UNK> smile and laugh which will <UNK> down anyone's nerves sense of smell and taste are rewarded when you test out the <UNK> in your own kitchen and among your own family and friends check out her show guys
<START> i have just seen a couple of nights ago at the <UNK> <UNK> film festival held here in dallas and i must express my <UNK> the opening <UNK> tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of south american countries <UNK> in this particular case by north american oil companies and the negative effects both economic and <UNK> of this invasion the main characters are a married couple who live a simple pleasant life maintaining a banana farm right away a woman arrives and <UNK> that she is the wife's half sister i'm not going to go into <UNK> about this and to be honest i don't feel that i'm spoiling anything with this review yet another key point is that the company to whom they <UNK> their <UNK> drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy so the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place trying to <UNK> his <UNK> on one hand the reynolds oil company has basically offered him <UNK> and financial <UNK> basically a <UNK> to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin <UNK> in their town <UNK> his standing with the community and the community itself on the other hand he is faced with being dead broke but on the side of his community <UNK> the <UNK> given the length of this film it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described but it just doesn't happen and i'll tell you why you will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far one for direction and an audience award i'm not going to pick apart <UNK> direction it wasn't bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything the audience award was at a film festival in spain and for it to gain an audience award i'd have to imagine that spanish people just dig soap operas in fact central and south america dig soap operas as well i know that much i assume that <UNK> was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself <UNK> soap operas because that is what unfolds over the course of this film so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely <UNK> to make room for more sex and crying scenes the only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is it's almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely from time to time they toy with the oil against community plot but these are <UNK> at best what we see a lot more of are scenes of passion jealousy betrayal adultery etc these themes <UNK> the story to such a degree that the oil company becomes unnecessary it's almost as if this was a stunt to <UNK> a romantic drama soap opera by throwing in a little political relevance nevertheless the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesn't know what to do with itself resulting in an ending so tacked on that you're left wondering what it is that you've been waiting around for or if there was ever anything to begin with here are two things that i think could have saved this movie either cut out the half sister or cut out the oil company it's obvious which one of the two they were more interested in or perhaps if had been an hour longer they could have worked this all out regardless i'd have been fine with a straight up soap opera and i think that the subject of oil companies <UNK> foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community is both and neither these two angles could have worked together had they been balanced <UNK> but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot that's barely been established to begin with both sides suffer best of all the romance plot is never even resolved i'd like to say i'd watch this movie again to see what i've missed but i have a strong feeling that i already know what it is as far as i'm concerned it wouldn't matter if i saw ten more times i've missed it because it is simply not there
<START> this film was a wonderful romp intelligent playful mysterious full of surprises with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy the famous film director the protagonist and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become <UNK> in fascinating ways as he is nearly out <UNK> by a prince who has never heard of him there are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director the ending is so much the better for being <UNK> realism and logic are not what you should be looking for here if we are going to turn our <UNK> and our imaginative lives over to film directors we should be prepared for a wild ride this film seems to suggest
<START> i really wanted to like this film especially after all the buzz i'd heard revolving around it but sadly it just didn't work for me paranoid park suffers from the same <UNK> lost in translation did if you use very little dialogue be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful br br much of the plot line if you can find a plot of this film is contrived i wasn't impressed with the it all <UNK> <UNK> being the way the protagonist deals with the accident so what are we supposed to believe he grew up happily ever after and wrote a book about his experiences thus was <UNK> for that horrific incident br br what is i suspect supposed to be a film that evokes empathy for a young man who is <UNK> and faced with an impossible moral <UNK> instead creates a portrait of a future <UNK> personality he has no connection to anyone around him and by the end of the film has no real sense of what is right or wrong he has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends what we have is a portrait of a non person a spirit that merely <UNK> through life as he weaves his way along on his <UNK> i don't feel for him at all and honestly i wish he'd been caught the entire film <UNK> not necessarily on his feelings of guilt but on how he is going to avoid punishment and or <UNK> for a bad decision he not only gets away with it he finds a way to subtly it quite a frightening negative message the suggestion being that so many of our youth are so <UNK> from right and that they simply make up the rules as they go along serving themselves for good or ill i find it an insulting on today's youth and the pretentious arrogance of the film maker <UNK> thick with every plodding step and shifting eye br br he did murder the guard but if you blink your eyes you miss it whether it was an act of mercy or not is hard to say it could be he was so <UNK> he <UNK> out with his <UNK> when he runs to the security <UNK> car one of the <UNK> of his <UNK> is <UNK> with blood
<START> obviously this is not the <UNK> directed by joe <UNK> and produced by roger corman it wasn't so obvious when i bought the dvd for only 2 95 as the dvd cover art matched that of the corman produced comedy horror <UNK> even the dvd menu no features of course matched the cover half way through watching this odd movie my girlfriend and i started thinking where are the <UNK> once the movie reached the climax we realised that we must have been watching the wrong movie as we had seen the trailer which had completely different footage the <UNK> on the back of the dvd did not match the story we were watching and the credits actors producer director were also completely different instead we got some jungle melodrama about a a girl and two guys who go searching for <UNK> and end up confronting a vicious animal hunter this tame exploitation thriller is boring and pointless and is only mildly amusing for old school camp value strange that a dvd can be <UNK> with the wrong film in <UNK> but i suppose it is an easy mistake to make seeing as though they are both b grade movies of the same name made in the 70's reading other <UNK> made on this film i noticed that i'm not the only one with the wrong movie on the dvd how could this be an international error is there perhaps some sort of dvd <UNK> where <UNK> films try to get recognition by being put on the wrong dvds what is going on
<START> i was a marine at camp <UNK> when the d i came out 1st marine division <UNK> marine <UNK> 3rd <UNK> i <UNK> i still remember standing in line with a bunch of other marines to see the movie at the star theater in california br br we did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was the idea of using real marines in the movie was a great idea i believe they were all real <UNK> <UNK> too as good an actor as jack <UNK> was he just couldn't call <UNK> like a real marine <UNK> <UNK> br br all of us got a laugh when the problem mother came to boot camp to talk to the captain never in a million years would this have happened but that's hollywood and we didn't let that episode keep us from enjoying the movie br br i went through boot camp at in san diego during the summer of 1956 and at that time there was virtually no limits as to what the d i 's could do to you the <UNK> creek event at <UNK> island had not yet affected boot camp at least not at san diego br br i agree with what a lot of the other reviewers have commented on concerning sgt moore's <UNK> around his girl friend i believe this was just <UNK> acting style and although they could have deleted this part of the movie it didn't really hurt the production that much br br one minor note the character uncredited of <UNK> rodriguez was played by one of my <UNK> <UNK> sgt peter j o'neill sgt o'neill used to tell us that some day he wanted to be an actor we secretly laughed at this but he surprised us all he was a great <UNK> <UNK> and i thought he did well in his bit part also he really did enjoy throwing knives he often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp i have often wondered if he is still alive
<START> this is one of the more poorly made movies i've ever seen one has to take anything by <UNK> seriously it's not just some b movie <UNK> out by <UNK> br br evidently <UNK> couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick and neither could <UNK> whose dozen character flip <UNK> are simply unbelievable not even badly acted just not acted at all among other things how a woman as beautiful as <UNK> could be a person such as julie marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful <UNK> acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as <UNK> the cliché ending which i won't describe is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake
<START> i enjoyed two of the three movies in the sarah plain tall trilogy this the final of the three was definitely one of the good ones it is an excellent family film with wonderful acting by the three adult stars christopher walken glenn close and jack palance br br the storyline is simple but well told the only sub par performance was by one of the kids it was interesting to see how the kids had grown since that first movie br br of the three that initial sarah was the best filmed with some beautiful cinematography this movie didn't have that but it had the best story it had some genuinely <UNK> sentimental moments and a very nice ending br br highly recommended
<START> isabelle <UNK> must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation la <UNK> truly <UNK> it as if that wasn't enough annie <UNK> plays her mother and annie <UNK> is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation so as you may well imagine those pieces of casting are worth the horror we're put through isabelle and annie play characters we've never seen before on the screen a mother and daughter yes but with such <UNK> <UNK> that sometimes i was unable even to blink or to breath personally i don't believe in the director's intentions i don't believe they the intentions that is go beyond the shocking <UNK> and the ending made me scream with frustration but i was <UNK> by the story written in the face of the sensational <UNK> and the <UNK> of strength i highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the <UNK> of great performances like me you can't afford to miss la <UNK>
<START> well after the hype surrounding the film and after <UNK> <UNK> the film as path breaking i went into the theatre expecting something big boy was i disappointed br br first of all the characterizations in the film are so weird which wife would do what <UNK> did an idiotic <UNK> <UNK> one and what was the point of her standing in the rain with her child baby after she and her husband had a fight what was the purpose of that scene anyway to start a <UNK> shot not only was the song not <UNK> <UNK> it was just not needed in the screenplay not needed at all secondly the first half of the had practically no story the entire first half was a freaking drag every scene in the first half of the film had no significance what so ever to the real story of the film and also how did <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> change so <UNK> all of a sudden and how did <UNK> <UNK> and lead a happy live together after six years even though they were so unhappy about marrying each other and if <UNK> did love <UNK> like he claimed he did why did he even marry even if it was his <UNK> death wish why that's the question you keep asking whilst watching the film and how fair is the ending to <UNK> after all she was <UNK> first wife <UNK> the director of the film claimed he worked on the script of this film for two years but his script is filled with flaws and leaves the audience utterly irritated <UNK> <UNK> un imaginative <UNK> of awesome is just disappointing surprisingly <UNK> editing usually superb for the new york song just sucks the whole song looked like it was a slide show made on <UNK> power point chorus was wasted showing <UNK> playing football who wants to see the freaking dude playing football during such a beautiful chorus whats more the whole movie only needed two songs and <UNK> the rest of the songs <UNK> of new york and <UNK> are just not needed fine efforts are simply wasted on a stupid film directed by an amateur director fans of <UNK> you ask why <UNK> keeps moving to bollywood after looking at the way his songs are <UNK> in why would he want to stay here what's more irritating is that after <UNK> decided to include into the film the song was cut by half which truly truly br br <UNK> looks handsome in his new get ups save the ones during the college scenes and packs in a so and so performance his expressions during all the songs he was featured in really do not fit the way the singer sings the songs was <UNK> even acting in the film all she did was cry would you call all that crying acting one of her worst performances ever what's more her new <UNK> does not suit her she looked way better in her costumes during the new york song are way off <UNK> <UNK> is just gorgeous during the film and does justice to her role comedy is annoying when one is watching him one wishes they could slap him on the face it is who is the show <UNK> during the comedy scenes and why the heck did even agree to do such a <UNK> role which could have done by just anyone and why is her make up so heavy when she has perfect music by a r <UNK> is just awesome new york and <UNK> deserve special mention r d cinematography is ok and isn't as good as his previous films though the scenery during the <UNK> song deserve special mention <UNK> editing is really really disappointing the film is just so freaking <UNK> and could be <UNK> severely br br <UNK> direction just sucks dialogues a c and <UNK> are just too corny to <UNK> especially the part where <UNK> <UNK> her love for <UNK> the screenplay and script <UNK> are <UNK> the film moves in the more un interesting pace ever and <UNK> script is just filled with unexplained sub plots br br and for goodness <UNK> why was there so much advertising in the film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you name it was the producer of the film k e low on budget or was he just desperate overall <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> with a title like that one would expect a heart warming and <UNK> love story but what you end up is a painfully <UNK> up love story really really disappointing
<START> <UNK> dreadful <UNK> of the probably most notorious of all roman who went insane leaving infamous party <UNK> and ruthless killings in his path i know there are several versions of this and this is based on the <UNK> one that i watched but i can't <UNK> how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the <UNK> br br i'd heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sex nudity which honestly there isn't much of here at all and boring when there is and blood but beware it's the technical production <UNK> that well and truly shocks here everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school <UNK> project camera work is hopelessly inept full of strange <UNK> failed framing and confusing pans to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage complete with a grainy photo quality lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven is it day or night are they in or outside have they changed scenes who is or is meant to be in the shot editing is the final sin here making a confusing mess of everything with randomly <UNK> <UNK> continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum story progression and involvement there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story but these faults distract so much it's tragic br br a story with so many possibilities to be great is just one <UNK> burnt and fellini like turkey that's only good for a few <UNK> laughs and peter o'toole who makes a most memorable oh yes which brings us to the big name actors i'd like to line them all up one by one and just ask who did you get free access to <UNK> in the <UNK> to be a part of this there i've wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time period br br 1 out of 10 from <UNK>
<START> if you like his show you might be a little disappointed this movie has some very funny moments and the laughs are pretty constant but none are very memorable or as funny as the things on the show the beginning sequence is really really silly and funny and a great start yes <UNK> does make a cameo appearance br br if you are a fan then watch it if you don't know him or don't like him then don't bother 6 5 10
<START> firstly i loved the book more so than the more popular da <UNK> code and although the film was not well received i liked it and bought the dvd however there is no chance that i will ever want to watch angles and demons ever again br br the film barely resembles the book in fact only the general premise of the story is there br br from the very start of the film i was disappointed in the book robert <UNK> receives a call and <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> director of who finds the body of father can't remember the name and then <UNK> <UNK> to come using the super fast plane in the book the only people who knew about this technology that the father and daughter team had created were themselves and the in the film however there was a massive team involved so the tension was never there how did they find out etc br br leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie it changed everything that happened from then on when the was confronted in the locked room it should have been <UNK> <UNK> who shot the video from his wheel chair the commander rushed in to get the but was shot by in the film it was the commander in the room and was shot <UNK> i think i got this right but i was bored and can't really remember the events in the film br br there was no love interest between and robert and in the book she wasn't at when he arrived and was indeed was <UNK> in from her research work in the book all four of the were killed but in the film the last one of the four survived the <UNK> in the book was kidnapped and robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the assassin at the church of the not blown up like he was in the film by the the bit where robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there saved by his mickey mouse watch alarm ok in the book we are led to believe that <UNK> <UNK> out of the helicopter fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched but it was important in the film because he had to race back with the film there was no mention of how and her adopted father became involved this was also important in getting to know the character of br br in all one of the worse films i have seen i would have left early but my brain went <UNK> and i lost the use of my legs <UNK> a really really poor attempt and not one of ron finest in fact how he will get work again is beyond me i want my money back
<START> another laughably lame and senseless low budget sci fi tv but actually its kind of kind <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> way am i being soft i don't know why they come up with these titles yes there's a <UNK> and yes there's a <UNK> however what's the deal with in between sure they do come to <UNK> in only two sequences one <UNK> an incident and the other being the dodgy climax and quite boring <UNK> i might add the get up is the same old routine of a scientific experiment getting out of hand on a secluded island no dinosaurs about and some innocent <UNK> <UNK> hoping to expose animal testing getting caught up in it this sees a <UNK> dragon and <UNK> becoming massive in statue with the government soon wanting to destroy any sort of the evidence including witnesses of its existence by blowing up the island so this leaves the survivors racing against time to find a way off the prominent <UNK> existed of awful video game cgi hack script few <UNK> sets although the <UNK> island setting was easy on the eyes throwaway characters but i found the performances <UNK> up <UNK> tacky thrills which for some reason kept using the same repetitive shot of the victim just standing there in which implied i'm waiting please eat me now i'm not going anywhere and eventually they were <UNK> well almost as it seemed to always take a second <UNK> to finish them off or just save the <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> them and a very hysterical edge with some sort of <UNK> message amongst the acts of survival director jim <UNK> seems to be on cruise control throughout michael <UNK> has fun with his gruff dialogues and michelle added much needed sparks <UNK> <UNK> is there to <UNK> a lot quite successfully too
<START> this three hour chinese epic set in <UNK> b c may ultimately amount to a familiar theme of an <UNK> idealistic dream of peace through <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> isolation and there's nothing <UNK> challenging about the film but it's a compelling narrative <UNK> with intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid <UNK> even for those not drawn to such historical <UNK> for their own sake it's an astonishing feast for the eyes the scene depicting the coup attempt of the marquis is one of the most <UNK> of physical space and <UNK> in memory and the battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and their <UNK> the title sums up the film's use of compelling <UNK> huge <UNK> set against intimate horrors the of motives set against the most <UNK> hope turning to dust if you've never seen a three hour chinese epic this wouldn't be a bad place to start
<START> i learned much from previous viewer reactions is there one that does not mention too <UNK> is concept i love fred astaire musicals the great great songs <UNK> <UNK> grace but <UNK> if you see <UNK> brainless rich <UNK> dancing on the <UNK> unemployed that's a valid criticism of any movie is <UNK> in the values of its time place not to mention those who <UNK> it  the <UNK> who call the tune great art <UNK> all as did as did <UNK> quiet on the western <UNK> i confess i saw it last 40 odd years ago but the images are burned in my brain it's the greatest battle scene ever likely to be filmed and it makes you horrified to be thrilled <UNK> did someone say that's real death you're watching real extras died making this <UNK> is now special effects defined it seems likewise <UNK> for an age of <UNK> attention <UNK> <UNK> had <UNK> many propaganda catholic church <UNK> the <UNK> was still at it when they called on ancient <UNK> to get the german christian <UNK> <UNK> to recognize <UNK> in the 1990s  remember the chaos forget the props the lighting of <UNK> painted the medieval world  like a there's one in <UNK> court palace showing a massacre crude dutch <UNK> propaganda maybe but it tears at the heart stylized acting so what's henry v olivier movie <UNK> does anyone believe english medieval knight killers talked like that as said the music of is magnificent only ken russell <UNK> had the balls genius to match sound image at this 100 <UNK> level ok you want the bit i'll risk the <UNK> every time <UNK> did not copy <UNK> <UNK> rather his model seems to have been those <UNK> worn by in nazi of the 1930s <UNK> was a genius but unlike hollywood directors he had near <UNK> non commercial time funding modern russian directors are free from political <UNK> but have no money even <UNK> had to make a late great movie in communist russia he was <UNK> but in his own country much like russell how much propaganda is in the eye of the <UNK> imagine sane people from another peace loving world how would they react to <UNK> would the battle or the <UNK> for the dead dominate their if we didn't know about the gas <UNK> ss what about of the <UNK> where can i get a <UNK> dvd cheap
<START> seagal fans beware he does no action scenes until almost an hour into this mess instead seagal runs away from numerous fights letting <UNK> rule convincingly lose every battle actually <UNK> rule could be an up and coming action star but hollywood needs to let him at least hit <UNK> which should happen in a few more years also what sort of <UNK> terrorist wears a bare <UNK> outfit the chick in this atrocity looks like a <UNK> singer for christina <UNK> back to seagal when he finally does cut loose it's his stunt double heavily padded to resemble the <UNK> seagal doing a lot of the work taking the falls i don't remember any <UNK> either it's just your standard kicks punches you'd see in any straight to video martial arts turkey not even so bad it's funny either just plain dull
<START> sadness and nostalgia <UNK> late a 1954 film by japanese auteur now <UNK> a <UNK> of his long <UNK> films thanks to james of <UNK> <UNK> and the japan foundation based on three stories by <UNK> late tells the story of four retired <UNK> now middle aged whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret performance are uniformly outstanding particularly that of who starred in films by <UNK> late spring floating <UNK> and tokyo story among others portrays <UNK> a former geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speak br br she has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money particularly real estate <UNK> and money to her friends <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all former <UNK> friends live in <UNK> circumstances and complain about how <UNK> has become greedy and <UNK> spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet both <UNK> and are in the process of losing their children son is leaving to work in the in and daughter has decided to accept a marriage <UNK> from an older man both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitable br br two male friends visit <UNK> a former lover with whom she once <UNK> double suicide and ken another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years her mood is upbeat but soon turns to <UNK> when she discovers that the two men are only interested in <UNK> money cuts between two extended sequences <UNK> as <UNK> confronts and <UNK> and <UNK> each other over the loss of their children the dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who though their future does not seem bright refuse to see themselves merely as victims late has the simplicity humor and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of <UNK> and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and <UNK> can bring along the way
<START> <UNK> made in 1950 in france was the last film laurel and hardy produced with the bad reputation the duo have for their post 1930's productions i was expecting this film to be awful although admittedly it isn't up to the standard of their vintage comedies i was pleasantly surprised it's watchable and in parts genuinely funny and certainly the plot is of the same standard as you'd expect some gags are derivative from their earlier work but when you consider this film was their first for five years after their last hollywood produced film the <UNK> the routines are executed <UNK> as you'd expect from these professionals some scenes are not up to much but the value of this film is that some scenes are funny and as such absolutely priceless i particularly enjoyed the <UNK> scene br br i felt sad at the end of the film our <UNK> are left on their own desert island it's such a metaphor for the real life truth hollywood and audiences of the time had <UNK> the stars to a desert island of memories and that was to become last image they portrayed in film ollie died seven years later and stan died fifteen years later stan turned down an offer to appear in it's a mad mad mad mad world in 1963 what a shame that was a colour film only two years before he passed however his health probably wasn't up to much br br these boys are probably the greatest comedy performers of all time and although the movie is far from their true potential it's still an honour to watch them appear in film for the last time and touching on the <UNK> of their <UNK> talent
<START> i loved this movie when i was a kid i saw it <UNK> randy <UNK> did a good composition of the soundtrack david <UNK> is the father and recording manager the <UNK> consist of alvin who is best known for playing the <UNK> simon who is a bright and <UNK> <UNK> theodore who is the youngest and is always hungry there is a lady known as miss miller who looks after the <UNK> and has 3 daughters known as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who all have the same character as the <UNK> my favourite songs from this soundtrack include diamond dolls the girls of rock roll the touching my mother alvin really wanted to see europe when dave had to go there for business the <UNK> meet the playing the around the world in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing
<START> as i write this in november 2005 i've become aware that the great british boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the british government not giving film makers tax breaks i think the cause is much simpler a lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years let's have a look at what the brits were producing 1995 2005 br br funky gangster thrillers lock stock and two smoking was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape guy <UNK> style with usually disappointing results br br romantic comedies yeah okay i do realise four <UNK> <UNK> hill etc were produced by american studios but they're still vaguely british films unfortunately because they're guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula which usually involved hugh grant playing hugh grant for the <UNK> time br br black comedies can anyone explain what a black comedy actually is in the british context it's usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resembles mike <UNK> naked br br <UNK> beautiful people is a good example of the third type of british movie filmed in 1999 but set in 1993 it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and it's later revealed that one's a <UNK> and one's a <UNK> so we get a bite sized <UNK> of what was happening in the <UNK> at that time though what's the odds of two former enemies in the <UNK> <UNK> into each other on a london bus this sums up one of the major flaws of the movie irony takes <UNK> over likely situations you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the outcome likely perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film it's called beautiful people but certainly this audience member found them clichéd stereotypical people that i couldn't believe in as three dimensional characters
<START> i grew up outside of germany where they landed every detail of the film was 100 authentic the power lines that they flew over the <UNK> neighbors the grandmother telling the kids that they cant watch west german tv etc this movie brings back lots of good memories to those that are european a great production from disney the same movie in german has <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> using their own voices for <UNK> the english version into german for the german version they also use birds a bird that is native to germany as background noise to let you know that you are in germany i showed this move to many of my german relative and they really liked this movie these people made made a prototype balloon which they had to give up because the <UNK> that they used was too and the other 2 <UNK> that they used for the escape the <UNK> problem was solved when they turned the <UNK> <UNK> upside down
<START> i don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket <UNK> but i saw a poster for some things that stay and i thought that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious not like the usual blonde <UNK> <UNK> so i decided to take the <UNK> and see this movie on it's opening night br br i must tell you i was happily surprised i went to this film with no expectations i didn't really know what it would be about but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by katie <UNK> left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision <UNK> watson also did a fantastic job as the role of disease stricken mother and i must also add that i was quite impressed with the comedic <UNK> of <UNK> park as friend brenda br br the film was wonderfully directed by <UNK> harvey and pulled together in the kind of <UNK> 50's way that leaves you feeling warm and happy even if the storyline tended not to be so uplifting i also thought that the film was well shot many beautiful images of a 1950's countryside will remain in my mind for weeks to come br br this film as a whole was quirky and great i found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open ended way i was still left satisfied whether you are looking for a fun yet powerful coming of age story or simply want to <UNK> about life in the 1950's i guarantee this film is for you even if you have no expectations it is still quite likely that you will be most impressed give this one a shot
<START> spoilers beware <UNK> is a fair movie in my opinion some things do confuse me about it e g <UNK> asks alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing alex replies about 25 years isn't alex supposed to be 18 and some things do <UNK> me about it i loved the <UNK> overall though it intrigued me when this movie was made i wasn't even born i didn't really experience the eighties i was born in <UNK> and i have to wonder sometimes alex would just run in place a bit or throw herself all over not really dancing just <UNK> in to things <UNK> her head back and waving her arms was this considered dancing back then if it was i'm not sure i could've it the <UNK> the flip the fluid movements were great but some of it my <UNK> <UNK> could've done better also if alex is a during the day wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work when she doesn't go to work for nearly a week wouldn't she be laid off living in a warehouse i can almost see it but not quite it doesn't seem right that she's a owns a warehouse house and is trying to get into ballet none of it really makes sense i shouldn't be too <UNK> considering my own background but please maybe jennifer <UNK> is too feminine for me to see her as a i don't know but either way they could've picked a better actress the actors were fine i even liked the romance you make your own decision but mine is rent it once don't see it again it isn't worth it
<START> essential viewing for anyone who watches tv news as it may help to become a little more <UNK> or even cynical on a personal note i recall taking a course some years ago about being interviewed for tv what to do what not to do the course <UNK> impressed on us that tv news was a branch of show <UNK> that depressing view which is probably even more valid today than when it was made is <UNK> by this film never mind <UNK> integrity what counts is the ability to look good and smile nicely and make sure you don't sweat on camera br br the interactions between the three main characters form the centre piece each with his or her own ambitions <UNK> and beliefs brooks takes these differences and sets them into the <UNK> setting of a tv news studio and adds more than a <UNK> of love interest to the mixture the result is a complex if somewhat overlong portrayal of how we compromise every day in order to meet our ambitions and take others with us it is always entertaining although the final scene was perhaps unnecessary given everything that had gone before
<START> this story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago after all this time the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men this story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of <UNK> elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder <UNK> but it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps <UNK> the old men in their dreams and <UNK> in a young man's life the most of what i liked in this film was the suspense in which the young woman appears to the men just before their deaths the special effects were something every time i heard her call out to them i would think not that face again but it was a good movie i just wish that the pace was not as slow or the acting not as tiresome and what i also liked about the movie was the flashback of the <UNK> very authentic as well as the costumes being original
<START> if i heard the male lead say this is madness one more time i would have <UNK> the film is one big cliche with fake <UNK> him under your <UNK> attitudes not one male in this movie has one redeeming quality reminds me of soviet era films with strongly politically oriented messages i couldn't even understand why there was attraction between the leads nor could i wait for the ending
<START> we all know that the world is full of dodgy rip off horror films some of these can be fun to watch due to their stupidity awful effects and <UNK> dialogue but <UNK> which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless <UNK> series does not even attempt to have any enjoyment in it its so poorly done it is really unbearable even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no brain day at home where do we start well the sets are pretty drab my old drama group created more realistic stages the <UNK> <UNK> look like they are from a university and it looks equally unbelievable on the outside even for cover up why would you place yourself near <UNK> where people can easily hear the dinosaur <UNK> whilst the doctors ward just doesn't look believable at all next up in the complaints list is the creature effects well what can i say absolutely pitiful also i think it's worth mentioning the woman's tits should be mentioned as an effect both of the main female characters have so obviously had <UNK> jobs and it brings the characters down being one female is a respected member of police whilst the other is the sweet innocent daughter of the towns sheriff the acting though is by far the worst tragedy eric roberts can be <UNK> for at least trying a bit to give his role something thats where it ends corbin benson should have killed his costume designer for making his <UNK> performance look even more pathetic whilst the female lead looks so bored though with this film you could let her off the other character i'll point out is the daughter who lets her tits do all the acting in the raunchy sex scene ten minutes of endless re run shots of her <UNK> on top of some bloke br br all in all and summed up as one don't bother just don't
<START> maybe this was an important movie and that's why people rank it so highly but honestly it isn't very good in <UNK> it's easy to see that chaplin probably all of hollywood was incredibly naive about the <UNK> of what was really going on in the <UNK> so you can't fault him too much for the <UNK> that affects a modern viewer but the <UNK> remains br br more <UNK> the movie is just clunky it's as if chaplin had no idea that movies had progressed in sophistication since the silent era the set pieces those involving both the jewish <UNK> and the dictator don't flow into each other they just sit there like <UNK> <UNK> of storyline that progress in fits and starts moving somewhere but never arriving at resolution some are funny some less so br br what charm the movie has is strictly in the person of chaplin himself his parodies of hitler's speeches were the best part of the whole thing and there's no denying that he had a physical grace that was delightful to watch but virtually everything he surrounded himself with was annoying hannah was too damn american the storm troopers were too damn american br br <UNK> <UNK> one more thing i don't know what purpose was served by having garbage be the source of evil behind the throne it almost seems like the film is saying that if it weren't for <UNK> influences like garbage wouldn't have been that bad a guy
<START> i cannot remember a more trivial mind numbing and shallow film in other words a real chick flick of the worst kind how can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others only if they don't like <UNK> they made a mistake it seems to <UNK> the worst of female aspirations no real substance to it all happy and shallow yeah that'll please the masses well not this member of the masses what a trivial load of drivel i wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start and to think i paid <UNK> to see this i think this does however represent the <UNK> down of cinema as with most media these days so i like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or what
<START> for a movie i was really looking forward to i was very disappointed i had no expectations of this being another <UNK> but did expect a more significant portrayal of <UNK> last years br br the performance by ed harris was superb but the story line was so weak that the film simply moved from one dreary scene to the next with no continuity br br the only enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the <UNK> and from that point on i could quite happily have walked out without finishing br br i left feeling very <UNK> and still have the feeling that something important was missed
<START> black eye 2 outta 5 stars <UNK> filmed '70s action movie looks like it was made for tv only the occasional <UNK> word and a subplot about <UNK> tip you off that the movie was actually made to be shown in theatres fred <UNK> plays a tough guy ex cop who becomes a tough guy private eye he stumbles upon a couple of murders and attempted murders linked to a mysterious <UNK> there are some <UNK> a <UNK> inspired car chase a fairly original elevator scene and even time for <UNK> to confront the rich lesbian lover of his girlfriend <UNK> graves there is also a scene with <UNK> bullying a poor old man by <UNK> up some priceless old <UNK> photos in his <UNK> shop yeah way to go tough guy maybe you can find a <UNK> to beat up later obviously meant to cash in on the success of <UNK> this and about six thousand other movies this movie doesn't have enough edge or enough originality to make much of an impression
<START> this is definitely an excellent show i don't have cable so i started renting them because my friend recommended it i thought it would be a teen soap you know who's dating who that kind of thing but it was not it is surprisingly deep it is also very witty it moves at a very fast pace and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it it is a comedy drama which is rare when well done it is about <UNK> and relationship instead of the classic mother daughter relationship it is a story of the best friend relationship about a mother and daughter the characters are perfectly cast and all do a superb job it is definitely the best tv show i have very come across
<START> if you haven't seen the first one you have to at least know someone who has and you have to know it was painful to sit through there just wasn't anything good to say about it at all so what's different with the second one why bother making a sequel for a movie that was wretched this one doesn't take itself too seriously it knows it was made for tv and doesn't try to impress with great or serious dialogue there are moments where it tries to get or but these moments are so corny you have to laugh br br thankfully gone are any elements of uwe boll and any hint that this <UNK> from a video game other than the title of course don't go into this movie expecting anything worth mentioning to your friends unless they're into camp lame zombie movies or are interested in making a drinking game out of this movie take two shots whenever ed <UNK> character mentions his dead brother take one shot whenever a bullet would have been better place in the head of a zombie instead of <UNK> three in the chest etc etc
<START> the tv ads for this movie showed the <UNK> hitting a truck head on then getting <UNK> to bits and <UNK> on the other side of the truck i thought the special effects were good but the general style of the movie was <UNK> this is the <UNK> tv series with three boys instead of three girls br br the big surprise for the three teens who are about to become adults is that there is an unknown fourth member of the clan who is out to get them and <UNK> all their power besides driving into <UNK> these kids can fly up the sides of houses climb out of windows push each other into <UNK> of garbage and make the <UNK> in their <UNK> pop out but if they use their powers too often they become <UNK> old and feeble the father of one of the boys is evidence of this as he sits in an attic made up to look like a mummy but he is only 45 years old br br the three good <UNK> are each filthy rich in his own right completely spoiled obnoxious and annoying in any public school these kids would be beaten up every day their <UNK> and facial <UNK> would not cut any <UNK> with the boys from the hood unfortunately for all good people these <UNK> boys were sent to <UNK> school for the <UNK> that couldn't get into harry <UNK> class br br so what was the movie all about three teenagers acting out with each other and their girlfriends one other teenager who <UNK> their power and money and happens to be a lost relative after a few scenes where the <UNK> boys show off their powers and have sex with their girlfriends the movie gets around to the unknown <UNK> <UNK> revenge plot the predictable stuff happens the bad <UNK> <UNK> various friends of the other <UNK> and eventually starts attacking them too the final confrontation happens and that is about it br br the special effects are not bad but nothing special if you like to see <UNK> <UNK> and blue <UNK> then this is a good movie to watch
<START> i'm glad they finally released it on dvd i bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year br br has a <UNK> wit about him that really makes this movie a success its formula is certainly not original but it's very funny nonetheless i am very surprised that it didn't receive higher in the ratings br br it ranks as one of my all time favorite comedies it's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good and sometimes that's all a movie is meant to be
