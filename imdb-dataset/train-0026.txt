<START> this is one of the few movies released about a what if type of situation that made me think it was amazing to hear them speak to each other and <UNK> about all the wonderful and not so wonderful things that happened between them i actually think that there is a very good possibility this occurred like the movie implies and they actually made peace with each other those are good memories for every fan to hang onto and to ask what actually happened between them would be selfish what an amazing movie this was the comedic aspects of the movie were wonderful to think that they were together to <UNK> things up between them in such a way is a <UNK> thought to people who wish they had a chance to clear the air with someone they didn't get to to see john as such a caring laid back character was refreshing from hearing all of the trash that was spoken about him
<START> this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone on my list of favorite movies mental list mind the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series spirited away and fly away home br br i can really relate to the main character jess at the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls she really sucks you into her life i also certainly can't fault any of the <UNK> acting or anyone else's in the film br br the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules the movie is never boring the romance is really cute and didn't make me <UNK> <UNK> hard one thing that really made it though was the indian factor <UNK> parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else the indian people are also hilarious essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it br br feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film they're funny they're refreshing and they make you feel good
<START> the drug years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini series or other kinds of tv documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on tv it's actually not long enough in a way all of the major <UNK> in the decades are covered and they're all interesting to note as views into post modern history and from different sides but it almost doesn't cover enough or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time for example the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business <UNK> itself of <UNK> mass amounts of drugs partly the marijuana later cocaine is really well presented but there are more details that are kept at <UNK> of how much time there is to cover br br overall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs pop culture government <UNK> the upper classes and lower classes and into <UNK> all felt the wave of various drugs over the years and the interplay between all was very evident nobody in the film except for the possibility of small hints with the pot goes to <UNK> drugs outright but what is shown are those in <UNK> clips about the honesty of what is at times fun and then tragic about taking certain drugs the appearances of various <UNK> ridiculously anti drug officials does hammer some points down hard with even in such an <UNK> of the drug cultures and america's connection as a whole as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the <UNK> the only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not <UNK> say <UNK> because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought it is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be <UNK> about them as for example <UNK> continues on in the <UNK> br br is it with the great interest and depth of a ken burns documentary no but for some <UNK> tv viewing for the young i e my age who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago as well as for the <UNK> who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks <UNK> times and then the <UNK> <UNK> more by the same media that years earlier <UNK> and advertised it there are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased which is not totally untrue but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social political and entertainment conditions of drugs <UNK> for better or obvious worse for enough of a fascinating view
<START> if you're <UNK> <UNK> facts then this video is very important the <UNK> of the video is the comments made by buzz <UNK> he is without a doubt from the best of america trained to be objective honest and factual in his reports many <UNK> from america of all <UNK> have reported some kind of contact or <UNK> <UNK> and there are videos from some of those missions at the very least something has happened that requires further objective ongoing investigating i think this <UNK> from buzz <UNK> shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress like all supposed documentary video this one may be <UNK> but it does contain further information and opinions from an accomplished american hero those don't come along every day so the fact that some people aren't interested in details should not <UNK> your from viewing this video if nothing else it is interesting and i recommend you watch with an open mind
<START> pushing daisies was a wonderful show much like dead like me and <UNK> you can tell was created by bryan fuller i can understand how people who don't have much of a love for theater cinema musicals and the like would be annoyed this is not a typical television program and the fantastic is too much for some these people seem to need some a little more linear and muted tone to keep them happy this program explodes with color <UNK> at old movie scenes <UNK> with incredible music and talented performances there is nothing random about the choices that are made from costume to <UNK> the story takes many twists and turns but all very accessible because the conversations are about love honesty courage loss and so many other things we face every day the only unfortunate aspect was the ending of the show and that was rushed because pushing daisies was canceled don't approach this as a typical tv show think of it as an evening at the theater then sit back and enjoy
<START> wow so much fun probably a bit much for normal american kids and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time <UNK> very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and <UNK> esquire moments the whole first act violently <UNK> from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid hero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing <UNK> and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike's work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the anti war anti revenge message of human <UNK> is pretty damn poignant as manic and <UNK> fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk <UNK> <UNK> conceived via cg and <UNK> wrapped into an imaginative multi <UNK> adventure <UNK> <UNK> and one of miike's best
<START> alien hunter 5 out of 10 is it me or does every movie that starts in <UNK> new mexico suck take alien mixed with the thing mixed with contact mixed with of all things on the beach the <UNK> strain the <UNK> scene from <UNK> of the lost <UNK> and a throw in a little stargate to boot br br derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie of course with nothing original plot wise they <UNK> up the gore and sex right nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all <UNK> james <UNK> <UNK> mentions he needs a shower and the <UNK> leslie <UNK> asks to join <UNK> he turns her down <UNK> br br in fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to <UNK> things up this is it i mean if your going to have <UNK> good looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an <UNK> research base why not go for broke br br with about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie alien hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci fi adventure needed a much better plot twist to <UNK> it up and by the way the alien itself is a horribly clichéd <UNK> and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title br br i also <UNK> during viewing what is with the children of the corn in space <UNK> note that since jason of friday the 13th fame <UNK> from <UNK> and that <UNK> have all traveled to space to <UNK> <UNK> teenagers why not the <UNK> the characters in the <UNK> dress like <UNK> run extras and i was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them br br that however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies <UNK> the acting is mostly fine as <UNK> <UNK> his stargate role while <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> model the latest in <UNK> <UNK> john lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it br br alien hunter is a disappointing derivative <UNK> that makes me <UNK> for a proper children of the corn in space movie
<START> the john van <UNK> broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern day witch who <UNK> a successful manhattan <UNK> james stewart may get top billing but it is kim novak who steals the show as one of the most <UNK> witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen the lead pairing is in fact one of the movie's few weaknesses the gray haired stewart seems a bit old for the role and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for novak it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him as they seem <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> it is one of the story's amusing <UNK> that witches and <UNK> are portrayed as <UNK> village <UNK> and <UNK> curiously the stewart novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in vertigo released the same year as this film but then vertigo had a compelling suspense story and the benefit of alfred hitchcock's direction br br the film's comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast including a young jack lemmon as <UNK> <UNK> brother elsa <UNK> their <UNK> aunt and ernie <UNK> as a <UNK> writer <UNK> <UNK> even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of grand witch there's lots to like in this movie wit romance and a great cast that is if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting miss novak i have seen the movie a half a dozen times and i never can
<START> its spelled s l a s h e r s i was happy when the main character <UNK> her boobs that was pretty tight before and after that the movie pretty much blows the acting is like e list and it's shown well in the movie not to mention it is so low budget that <UNK> and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor <UNK> were funny they said many stupid things that made me laugh other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind <UNK> 2 anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally <UNK>
<START> how the grinch stole christmas was a wonderful little christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy i never did see the reason for a remake not to mention a remake that was made with humans the cartoon was just perfect enough what's the purpose of this film but it also seemed a little odd for jim carrey to be the grinch i mean he's a great comedic actor but him as the grinch it just didn't make any sense to me his performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable the whole story of the grinch and cindy lou who was over done and wasn't needed they actually just destroyed the story period br br all the who's in <UNK> are getting ready for their best christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly but cindy lou who is curious and worried about the grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a christmas as the other who's he kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal christmas all together to show the who's what his version of christmas is all about but soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the <UNK> version of christmas br br how the grinch stole christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top i really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version at least in my opinion the make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done not to mention that how the grinch stole christmas was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring jim carry but at least this version makes you grateful for the boris karloff version that is played every christmas br br 1 10
<START> actually it was pretty funny in a god how the hell did this movie get made kind of way if you life making fun of movies which i kinda do go ahead and watch it but if you're actually thinking is this a good movie <UNK> off br br this movie sucked from the very beginning scene with the worst acting i've ever seen in any movie usually they get five minutes into it before you realize this movie might suck but no you know right off the bat this movie talks about edgar allen poe never tried to explain it though to people who haven't <UNK> <UNK> life story so i don't know if any of what was said is fact br br this movie is about a writer ethan poe <UNK> up with his cousin ann they're both <UNK> of edgar allan poe or are they apparently people give a what their <UNK> did this guy ethan poe is actually ethan <UNK> who is supposed to be <UNK> from the story the house of <UNK> that was written by edgar allen poe <UNK> brother shows up sometimes to try to rape her <UNK> also being stalked at one point in the movie by three different people on the same street seriously three they're like right behind her glaring at her and she doesn't even realize the characters that are being murdered throughout show up at the end to try to save the day but they can't at the end ann shoots ethan while he's trying to kill her best friend of course before she shoots him she has to scream out <UNK> this movie should be seen <UNK>
<START> previous <UNK> steve <UNK> stated that a walk on the moon is in his words not worth your 7 i ended up paying a bit more than that to <UNK> what is one of the worst quality dvds i have yet seen of this film or any film in existence even when you ignore the fact that the dvd is clearly <UNK> from an <UNK> master and just plain nasty to watch in motion the film has no redeeming qualities save <UNK> presence to make watching a top quality <UNK> ray transfer worthwhile not that this is any fault of the other actors <UNK> <UNK> diane lane <UNK> <UNK> and viggo <UNK> all score high on the relative to anna <UNK> acting ability <UNK> far more so than holly hunter or sam <UNK> did in spite of an equally lousy script anyway director tony <UNK> resume is nothing to crow about but pamela <UNK> resume includes wes craven's most dramatic <UNK> outside of the horror or slasher genre so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad direction br br as i have <UNK> already the sole reason i watched this film is anna <UNK> in her acting debut she literally acted veterans of the industry with a minimum of twelve <UNK> experience above hers under the table while she is not as far ahead of her <UNK> here her performance as a girl that starts the piece as a brat and grows into a woman whose world is crashing down around her proves her oscar was no <UNK> for some time i have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel and a dialogue <UNK> three minutes into this film is yet another <UNK> of why this woman could literally act the paint off walls anna aside only <UNK> <UNK> comes close to <UNK> any sympathy from an audience sure his character spends the vast majority of the film <UNK> a wife with an existential crisis but he plays the <UNK> reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly i should know even if it is not from the same circumstances here br br viggo <UNK> also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman although perhaps not to the same extent in a manner of speaking he is the villain of the piece but he successfully gives the character a third dimension yes his actions even after the whole thing explodes are <UNK> but not many men would act any differently in his situation nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed up situation so viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here unfortunately these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a <UNK> marriage where <UNK> <UNK> tells us that the mills and <UNK> <UNK> of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exist either writer pamela gray or director tony <UNK> thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks diane who she is to be <UNK> anyone about responsibility br br that said the film does have a couple of things besides anna going for it mason <UNK> original music while not standing out in any way gives the film a certain feeling of being <UNK> into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not roger ebert is right when he points out that while <UNK> is a great actor putting him alongside viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake he is also very correct in that when the film <UNK> over scenes of lane and <UNK> skinny <UNK> or <UNK> one another under a <UNK> it loses focus from being a story of a <UNK> and becomes soft porn the film seems <UNK> confused about the position of its story no matter how many times i <UNK> <UNK> scenes i cannot help but feel he has been <UNK> in the direction or editing one does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long way br br ebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw anna on the screen he thought her character was where the real story lay stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as earth shattering as the moon landing will not help in spite of feeling <UNK> at the manner in which her character's story is presented anna might as well be walking around with a <UNK> sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes while i am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast it is very much as if they did not bother to try with lane and <UNK> fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere hopefully by now my <UNK> about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrong br br i gave a walk on the moon a three out of ten anna <UNK> earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances and that is saying something
<START> while the original 1932 version with preston foster was good there's no remake more worthy than this 1959 one or more impossible to find anywhere just as i strongly suspect mickey rooney to have had something to do with that never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant or a script more thought provoking as well as an improvement upon the original many years after the last of my several viewings of this film in 1970 i read an article in which mickey rooney was <UNK> a visit he'd made to death row and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal <UNK> he'd felt with people in similar circumstances the article was about as short as the main character here and didn't cover much other than the extent to which his extreme <UNK> with the quality of the inmates themselves had been <UNK> even in language i would not care to <UNK> quote here one of my main problems with capital punishment is that of course it is not <UNK> <UNK> applied just as many innocent people are far too <UNK> thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate another problem i have with it is that it is not applied <UNK> enough or for that matter even <UNK> enough the bible makes a special point in such cases about one of the more important purposes of such as a <UNK> being <UNK> <UNK> minus not only a public viewing but also the direct participation of all as for those who claim to prove <UNK> that such is not an effective <UNK> in addition to having a problem about the <UNK> of their data i have little if any <UNK> <UNK> doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a <UNK> is lacking however i do have a problem about the fact that robert duvall in the <UNK> had been <UNK> at all for his particular crime or that the only hope of <UNK> for one such as he would have to be based on a temporary insanity defense as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case in addition to various other questions concerning the motives of mickey rooney for that particular visit he'd <UNK> and about the answers to which i can only try to <UNK> i suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature i don't know exactly when he'd become the <UNK> christian he now makes it a special point whenever possible to emphasize that he is but as anybody should be well aware this particular category of people tends to be the most <UNK> out for blood when it comes to <UNK> an eye for an eye however i have no particular bone of <UNK> concerning that per se just as there's no doubt <UNK> speaking that not all and perhaps not even most shall be <UNK> the same ultimate fate at the hands of the lord himself as a result of his sacrifice on the cross however there is a problem for me about the spirit or attitude with which most <UNK> christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment for contrary to the lord himself who would love to see everybody saved <UNK> 18 <UNK> ii peter 3 9 they seem to go <UNK> out of their way to find reasons to <UNK> what most people on either side of this <UNK> ever burning issue cannot appear to <UNK> appreciate is that the lord is as <UNK> and <UNK> soft in nature as he is hard the two sides of his nature appear to be so <UNK> <UNK> as to render him mentally deranged at least by any strictly human <UNK> yet regardless of how <UNK> <UNK> this miraculously dynamic <UNK> of the water and oil in his nature surely is there can be no doubt that anything short of it or anything <UNK> and <UNK> on either one side or the other of this <UNK> falls <UNK> and <UNK> short of the entire <UNK> truth indeed i've seen the most blood <UNK> <UNK> for the same come out self <UNK> enough on far too many occasions whenever the <UNK> anti death penalty <UNK> are confronted even in the most <UNK> well balanced ways with the fact that although the lord died for everybody not all are thereby going to be saved after all in order to receive <UNK> one must to repeat the same term reach out and receive it that is <UNK> luke 13 3 5 could anything make more sense but then what about the <UNK> command to forgive even in the case of one's enemies of those who despise and <UNK> you without a just cause or <UNK> one of the far too <UNK> difficulties with this kind of sentimentality as <UNK> <UNK> is the way it <UNK> over <UNK> the real meaning of forgiveness the act of forgiveness does not in itself mean the same thing as <UNK> <UNK> the one being forgiven when one takes a clearly sober <UNK> well balanced view here from the perspective of god's own attitude all it actually amounts to is a <UNK> wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way seeing the light and being granted mercy this attitude is of course the very opposite of say that of <UNK> who actually <UNK> it when god told him that his preaching to the people of <UNK> would result in their <UNK> <UNK> didn't want them to <UNK> but <UNK> desired that they be destroyed how self <UNK> cold <UNK> like <UNK> most <UNK> christians he was save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most i envy <UNK> almost as much as he would me however minus the <UNK> of the one being forgiven any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine christian is not going to do him any good in such a case the only one to benefit is the real christian himself
<START> recipe for one of the worst movies of all time a she male villain who looks like it escaped from the <UNK> has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects the first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear and takes time out to pet a deer then you got the unlikable characters 30 year old college students a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots lots more avoid at all costs
<START> very outdated film with awful cliché ridden and <UNK> dialog and a very poor construction in addition cassavetes and falk <UNK> constantly a pseudo good movie it takes no time to discover how <UNK> this intellectual turkey is the first scene is a total bore filled with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the sound is horrible camera movements are without imagination as is the building of characters no poetry no subtle psychology no interesting shots the actors smoke constantly and we see ads for beer <UNK> very cheap indeed one exception ned <UNK> s nice and simple way of playing the hit man
<START> <UNK> becomes born again after getting a magical power which he can use seven times br br there are several problems with this movie that are obvious to the casual audience the <UNK> <UNK> is still at home with his parents the father of the girl next door thinks that he is a compelling boy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> suddenly <UNK> the movie with his <UNK> the worst being how women of <UNK> got their exercise through household work yet we are to believe that he is not a <UNK> even though he was well read he wastes six of his seven powers on a stupid <UNK> i can go on but you get the picture br br there are god men there are gods and there is <UNK> the <UNK> has difficulty fitting <UNK> into one of these categories initially <UNK> is just <UNK> doing what <UNK> heroes do stand up to villains and in spite of being the oldest getting <UNK> by the <UNK> girl in the movie <UNK> does this well and some of <UNK> trademark styles are actually enjoyable <UNK> count is a novelty what makes this movie unbearable is that those few initial minutes are just a <UNK> to an worst book to be ever written even that <UNK> is <UNK> with some comedy which are forced and obvious br br the director doesn't explain the purpose of the hero we see that the hero is facing several <UNK> from politicians as usual but we can't really root for the hero because we don't know what the hero's ultimate goal is at the end when everyone wants him to be the leader the hero gives another one of his <UNK> and walks away to become a <UNK> the director offers no solution to the problem in the climax scene br br a r <UNK> score is really interesting either he shows <UNK> of brilliance or he didn't bother to <UNK> himself fully into this movie who can blame him there is one scene where <UNK> steps into the van of one of the crooks and then throws the knife and starts his <UNK> count the music is very apt for the moment and acts as a <UNK> adding further tension the songs are all mediocre no one would bother with the songs from this movie after a few years br br unfortunately 1 is the lowest rank you can <UNK> in imdb this movie has all the elements that justify its <UNK> place at the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> bottom line best romantic comedy ever this movie <UNK> what all great movies <UNK> for the creation of a world and time that we want to re visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race when i am blue this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh and that is still true after many viewings always fresh br br all of the actors are in top form the characterizations are so dead on and the characters <UNK> so well together that you forget the actor usually difficult to do with matthau robbins and ryan the supporting cast is consistently brilliant <UNK> <UNK> a total <UNK> package <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the three <UNK> <UNK> as greek chorus but time doesn't exist <UNK> something we can launch from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> boss and co worker at the service station and <UNK> <UNK> how many comedies have <UNK> br br don't miss this overlooked treasure
<START> i'm going to go on the record as the second person who has after years of using the imdb to look up movies been motivated by <UNK> film the abandoned to create an account and post a comment this was hands down the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life the plot was on the verge of non existence and none of the puzzle pieces added up in any way whatsoever the acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing how this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me the only saving grace i could find was <UNK> <UNK> cunning and repetitive use of the f word and brilliant sound design if i were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being <UNK> by wild <UNK> i would be up against a difficult decision i'm disappointed that i am unable to give it 0 stars
<START> this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good <UNK> who comes to his aid when his car breaks down that this well meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories br br i found this movie average at best art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography the acting was good and so was eva van der <UNK> singing
<START> sure we all like bad movies at one time or another and we in fact enjoy them this however wasn't even a guilty pleasure it was just crap some guy vince offer who is <UNK> enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk high probably both and thought it was a great idea to make a movie he then <UNK> to show his script to equally high drunk individuals overall this movie was so bad predictable and unoriginal i couldn't get through 20 minutes of it before i turned it off it makes you got served look like citizen kane bat man wtf some guy that walks around with a bat real original almost as good as calling him fat man and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit
<START> the story of the boy thief of bagdad as it was once spelled has attracted filmmakers from <UNK> walsh in <UNK> who starred douglas fairbanks in the first silent rendering of thief of bagdad to less <UNK> more recent attempts the best however remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling magical <UNK> of top quality special effects those effects still work their charm br br no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred <UNK> as the boy thief abu john justin as the <UNK> in love <UNK> <UNK> ahmad and june <UNK> as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil <UNK> <UNK> played by a sinister conrad <UNK> the giant genie is <UNK> acted by rex <UNK> br br ahmad is <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> and when later arrested by that <UNK> <UNK> he and the boy abu suffer what are clearly <UNK> <UNK> ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable <UNK> their adventures through the <UNK> <UNK> hollywood <UNK> are fun but the special effects make this film work br br two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the <UNK> genie who pops out of a bottle with a <UNK> like black <UNK> lawrence w butler and tom howard howard incidentally did the special effects for the <UNK> version of this film both men had long and distinguished careers in technical <UNK> br br <UNK> is <UNK> lovely while little called on for serious acting <UNK> ahmad projects a driven but dreamy <UNK> <UNK> by erotic <UNK> <UNK> is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the <UNK> kind still i don't think anyone under eight ought to see thief of bagdad br br this film makes <UNK> appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present it was great to see computer <UNK> kids in an <UNK> community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them br br thief of bagdad is a pre war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in <UNK> attractive and important releases this is one of the best of its kind br br 9 10
<START> please don't waste your time this movie <UNK> the worst of <UNK> <UNK> dracula van <UNK> anne <UNK> vampire <UNK> rock music and silly biblical references and blade high tech toys i really like vampire movies and novels and there are many out there that are very good but not this stinker not even the soundtrack helps it mostly because the movie <UNK> to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the kick ass metal some reported only a few times did i hear any metal mostly it was tortured <UNK> avoid it like <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> this show is quick witted colorful dark yet fun hip and still somehow clean the cast including an awesome <UNK> of special guests i e molly shannon paul <UNK> the <UNK> guy from office space is electric it's got murder romance family and zombies without ever coming off as <UNK> somehow you really connect with these characters the whole production is an unlikely magic act that left me something of a <UNK> if i do say so myself totally <UNK> and coming back for more every <UNK> night i just re read this and it sounds a little like somebody paid me to write it it really is that good i just heard a <UNK> that it was being canceled so i thought i'd send off a <UNK> of good will this is one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network suits can't figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it do yourself a huge favor if you haven't already and enjoy this gem while it lasts ok so one more thing this show is clever what that means is that every <UNK> critic writer in hollywood is gonna insert a stick up their <UNK> before they sit down to watch it defending themselves with an i could've written that type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely <UNK> hollywood hotel room in other words the internet this is a general interest anonymous website before you give your <UNK> tv hour to dirty sexy money or next hot model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet critics aren't commenting on give my <UNK> show a spin it's fun good <UNK> fun
<START> i think charlotte <UNK> is one of the best performers in the world i can't understand why some people say she's not boring maybe the one who said she's boring is because he she is boring she's a great actress and the movie was excellent it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers the direction was great i <UNK> myself in the french environment with all the sophistication and <UNK> flowers <UNK> problems etc when she goes to the sister's shop is simply amazing <UNK> great we have a very good actress wonderful for long time <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are perfect i like him more than in his next movie la science des <UNK> and eric <UNK> did a very good work br br <UNK>
<START> this early sirk melodrama shot in black and white is a minor film yet showcases the flair of the german director in <UNK> tired story lines into something resembling art set in the <UNK> barbara stanwyck is the woman who has <UNK> by <UNK> her small town husband and family for the lure of the chicago stage she never <UNK> her ambitions and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter <UNK> her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre a high school production that is back in her old town she once again comes up against small <UNK> and has to deal with her hostile <UNK> daughter <UNK> and boring husband richard <UNK> and ex lover the plot is nothing new but sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions with every frame carefully shot and he is aided <UNK> by having stanwyck as his leading lady it runs a crisp <UNK> minutes and that's just as well because the material doesn't really have the legs to go any further
<START> when i go to see movies i would stay up and watch it or if i did not like it i would go sleep but this was pure crap i actually got up and walked out this was poorly script and put together i hated it also they should not have taken brendan <UNK> off he was much better this was not as good as i had expected considering that i really liked george of the jungle 1 and the graphics weren't as good as the first one for instance the bird and when ever he crashed in a tree i hope that the director of this takes <UNK> and next movies he make he needs to <UNK> horrible i really would like to give <UNK> a job well done as she made the movie worthwhile until i walked out overall i give this movie a 2 out of 10
<START> what <UNK> at mgm thought it would be a good idea to place the <UNK> clark gable in the role of a salvation army worker ironically enough another handsome future star cary grant also played a salvation army guy just two years later in the highly overrated she done him wrong i guess in <UNK> it's pretty easy to see the <UNK> of these roles but i still wonder who thought that salvation army guys are hot and who could look at these dashing men and see them as realistic <UNK> of the parts they played a long time ago i used to work for a sister organization of the salvation army the <UNK> of america and i never saw any <UNK> guys working there and that includes me unfortunately maybe i should have gotten a job with the salvation army instead br br so for the extremely curious this is a good film to look out for but for everyone else it's poor writing sloppy dialog and annoying <UNK> make for a very slow film
<START> japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost through the entire film chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comical coincidence as they are running we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment the act of running is a metaphor for these down on their luck people's lives in some way what they're really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams running makes them all feel truly alive the big life <UNK> running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big violent and so absurd that it's funny in a clever way one of my favorite films of all time by genius director <UNK>
<START> well this is the first post am ever commenting on imdb do you get it this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls who will stop ever <UNK> with movies br br as most of them have given their comments i thought of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors though having read worst critics against this movie i thought of <UNK> it assuming it to be some comedy flick well it all started well with some <UNK> comedies then it all started going pathetic man you can believe your self you <UNK> feel like going and <UNK> your head each and every time the pathetic looking woman called the heroine of the movie is made helpless huh well how much can a person <UNK> a sick all <UNK> witch kinda ghost trying to do all she can to <UNK> you and stop you from what you are doing br br the next worst thing about the movie is the zombie hero yes as he <UNK> his fiancé he <UNK> around like a goat with black marks under his eyes and with the hero's terribly stupid sister you <UNK> be bleeding from head to toe if you attempted and succeeded by completely watching this movie
<START> okay i saw this movie as a child and really loved it my parents never purchased the movie for me but i think i'll go about and buy it now i'm a sucker for pre 2000 animated films anyway onto the actual review br br what i liked there was an actual portrayal of heaven and hell one of the few i've seen in animated films character development existed it's easy to <UNK> characters in this movie i e charlie is the selfish <UNK> itchy is cynical but believes charlie carface is obviously the relentless villain etc i also loved king <UNK> song i've always loved loud annoying flamboyant guys this song may have been random but it was so fun finally the detail of the animation was beautiful you could tell charlie was all gruff and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful br br what i did not like the actual portrayal of heaven the way charlie <UNK> to it no surprises whatsoever made it actually seem very boring he denied a place in heaven and still got to return to it in the end i remember a few lines of certain songs such as you can't keep a good dog down let's make music forever and welcome to being dead but i can't remember the majority of any of them the songs weren't that catchy to be honest <UNK> angel she's annoying and that neck <UNK> br br what parents may not like a few very scary depending on the viewer images of hell are shown during the movie carface is quite threatening beer is also implied but not actually dubbed beer gambling is a key element in the movie the good guy dies br br overall i love this movie even if it is a bit forgettable at times the scarier children's animations are always my favorite ones this was created back in a time when producers and writers weren't afraid to give kids a little scare now and then nowadays this probably would have been rated pg kids under the age of 8 or easily disturbed kids should not watch this other than that i give it 9 10 br br happy viewing
<START> this film really tries to hard if your going to make a horror film at least give it a reason to believe in to hook the viewer br br you wait and wait through the film expecting for some grand explanation but it doesn't instead it tries to be too clever ending and not revealing anything br br what was the point of the movie where it's actually going and more importantly what the hell was going on br br why were they there and how does it tie into anything just another weak sci fi horror i love the fake reviews on imdb saying how great it is by related press releases to <UNK> the movie either that or people have low <UNK> it's not worth your <UNK> at all br br i'm not saying the film is better than the fragile but at least that gave you reasoning and why things happened and has an end result this doesn't and it just <UNK> on with tons of padding to make everything feel scary this film is about as low as when a stranger calls god that was lame too br br big tip if your gonna make a horror make it believable with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on so they have a hook into your story because if there's no reasoning or believability then there's no firm hold on anything and it can't be scary no <UNK> to the cast or crew cause they did a good job it's just the poor writing
<START> why am i so convinced there's actually another film version of this novel out there somewhere i saw the film again this year as i am teaching the novel and find the changes in the film annoying there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the ending has been changed they kill him off in the film but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events at <UNK> <UNK> house for many years but does <UNK> and eventually put the events behind him mr <UNK> is a far more sympathetic character in the novel the scene in the film where <UNK> sets fire to the office is plain <UNK> and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to <UNK> the presence of the child is genuinely creepy but pointless <UNK> is haunted by the woman seeking revenge not the child i am sure i've seen a film which is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier have i just imagined this
<START> to make up a movie going audience i'm certainly stunned by the number of positive comments this wretched film has garnered here i can't credit it can't help but be suspicious for that matter of back alley <UNK> to critics who are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for an oscar the hole in the kitchen ceiling might be more appropriately attributed to her scenery chewing she's a wonderful actress but this is an unfortunately <UNK> performance lacking that essential quality film actors must master of catching the <UNK> of the screenplay and maintaining it for the duration of the disjointed madness that is a film shoot br br i don't really want to blame miss <UNK> or most of the other performers well gwyneth paltrow has no excuse for her <UNK> work however because this is a horrendous adaptation a classic case of <UNK> i am prepared to assume i haven't read the book and don't think i will after this the script <UNK> us into the middle <UNK> of <UNK> behaviour and extreme emotional angst <UNK> from <UNK> characters who have developed relationships neither with us nor each other it quickly becomes a <UNK> excessive <UNK> like assault that <UNK> characters and audience alike and left me like a survivor shaking my head at the <UNK> left at the end of each repetitive episode shock and awe would describe my reaction to frantic <UNK> polar mood <UNK> between <UNK> and oh so quiet sensitivity the latter <UNK> by one of the most irritating manipulative <UNK> <UNK> i've heard that is when all this isn't being set to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> period stuff ya know but chosen with an astounding disregard for the tone of the scenes br br how this fine cast got mixed up in this i don't know i can't believe they saw the screenplay before <UNK> they certainly apply their skills with commitment i felt so sorry for the wonderful jill <UNK> <UNK> with a cartoon bag lady costume and wig trying <UNK> to <UNK> something of significance from <UNK> and clichéd dialogue in contrast somehow alec baldwin rises above the material to deliver a consistent nuanced real performance can somebody give this man a lead role of substance please and how about rachel <UNK> wood or joseph <UNK> you'd think the industry could make better use of him and without appearing as <UNK> as elliot <UNK> in m a s h br br my vote a <UNK> turd all right but no link with heaven
<START> the haunting if you have seen the original you know a great ghost story it's perfection on film it's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements it terrified people it still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film so when the haunting was remade in 1999 a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction what why what <UNK> but in my opinion if a remake is <UNK> enough and just wants to <UNK> the story for the newer generation i'm pretty cool with it this is definitely not the case this is just a <UNK> boring shame that will waste your time and i guarantee will deliver no <UNK> <UNK> pg 13 what where they thinking not much apparently br br when her mother dies and her sister <UNK> her <UNK> receives a phone call telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by doctor david <UNK> at hill house a secluded <UNK> upon arrival <UNK> meets mr and mrs dudley a strange pair of <UNK> who do not stay on the property after dark shortly thereafter two other participants in the study arrive wild theo and bad sleeper luke <UNK> along with doctor <UNK> unknown to the participants doctor <UNK> true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear each night the <UNK> chain the gate outside hill house <UNK> anyone from getting in or out until morning when the <UNK> open the lock there are no working <UNK> inside hill house and the nearest town is several miles away doctor <UNK> <UNK> the story of hill house the house was built by hugh <UNK> <UNK> built the house for his wife hoping to fill it with a large family full of children however all of <UNK> children died during birth <UNK> wife killed herself before the house was finished and <UNK> became a <UNK> the first night theo and <UNK> begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house including odd noises and inexplicable <UNK> changes <UNK> is confronted after the main <UNK> is <UNK> with the words welcome home <UNK> and becomes extremely <UNK> setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those <UNK> by <UNK> cruelty she learns that <UNK> built his fortune by <UNK> kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him he then burned the bodies in the <UNK> <UNK> to hide any evidence she also learns that <UNK> had a second wife named <UNK> of whom <UNK> is <UNK> everyone thinks she's crazy while <UNK> is convinced this is where she belongs br br seriously i suggest you stay away from this film it's really stupid and pointless not to mention the actress the played <UNK> <UNK> taylor completely annoyed me her performance her look just everything about her don't get me started on things i would do just to not see her in film again catherine zeta jones just didn't fit in her role as well and liam neeson a wonderful actor wasted talent once again the effects are way over the top and too <UNK> i just can't believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this <UNK> believe me if you are going to be afraid of something be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown <UNK> oh this film is already hurting me just don't see it it's bad br br 1 10
<START> this movie is easily the worst of the series though new line might just be looking at sales they all know the only reason this one made more money than the one prior was due to its 3d ending it wasn't that the 3 d was good either because it was 50's 3d with the red and blue <UNK> <UNK> it was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like beyond that this movie was so poorly done bad script bad characters bad acting worse directing this movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a looney tunes episode br br seriously not for horror audience because it is corny and not scary and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play this whole thing as camp and having it fall way short of what they probably wanted br br i remember most of us who had been fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it had gotten this is one of the movies that helped take horror out of popularity and ride a <UNK> of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than see a good and scary horror film
<START> if <UNK> had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received instead it turns into a star <UNK> disaster of a movie where the stars came in said their lines and picked up their <UNK> without much conviction br br michael caine and his wife beverly johnson work for the united nations world health organization and are busy doing their <UNK> thing in east africa along comes peter ustinov who can barely <UNK> enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a <UNK> slave dealer as johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well br br of course caine doesn't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt the rest of the cast has such folks as william <UNK> rex harrison omar <UNK> and indian film star <UNK> <UNK> in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing br br usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just <UNK> outrageously and feast on a <UNK> of scenery but <UNK> doesn't even have that going for it br br what an incredible waste of time the <UNK> of tax write off is <UNK> the air
<START> the year 2000 had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors other than <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nothing stood out <UNK> had lot of <UNK> due to the <UNK> of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around india and abroad the only information given was that it was a suspense thriller the film is now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good the main plot is to do with <UNK> and is well handled salman and <UNK> give a good performance where salman doesn't actually take is shirt off at all must be special effects <UNK> plays <UNK> wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with <UNK> who plays prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother the three main leads confirm after <UNK> <UNK> jo <UNK> <UNK> they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistry apparently salman khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the <UNK> film industry partly due to the films he chooses <UNK> character does not know <UNK> is a prostitute until the end this kept from her and the rest of the family the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you the songs are all <UNK> well especially <UNK> <UNK> and the main title song the other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as <UNK> loving family <UNK> <UNK> has produced a hit and handled the film subject <UNK> i say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer
<START> i'm not going to bag this film for all the <UNK> technical f u c k u p s it would take two days to outline how the whole thing isn't even remotely possible others have pointed out all the relevant <UNK> already br br given all that i still could have sort of enjoyed it if only they hadn't included all the <UNK> nauseating <UNK> <UNK> sentimental crap which is so out of place anywhere but nowhere more than out in space where the <UNK> mistake can mean instant death br br the crew as well as the real astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their <UNK> nonsense ahead of everything else it completely ruined any value the production may have had left br br i'm surprised <UNK> let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much <UNK> about something so important to them if you haven't seen this yet save yourself the <UNK> watch apollo 13 again at least that tried to be sort of real
<START> <UNK> <UNK> must have been paid a <UNK> sum of money to promote the <UNK> <UNK> off road <UNK> the plot of the movie is pretty simple <UNK> plays a writer who has a bad case of writer's block and needs inspiration so she goes to visit mexico to <UNK> the atmosphere there she meets the hero bert van <UNK> a cowboy who chooses to drive a car rather than ride a horse while <UNK> is visiting with her father's partner at his mining camp a gang of local <UNK> kidnap her and bring her to their camp deep in the wilderness the hero needs to get to her quickly so he decides to drive there in his car this is where the film takes a weird twist bert proceeds to drive over every <UNK> imaginable huge rocks small <UNK> heavy brush <UNK> tree <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc etc for the greater part of the film we get to see this car struggling to crawl over obstacles now mind you this isn't a modern day <UNK> it's a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so it looks very out of place as an off road vehicle and it clearly has limitations for some of the <UNK> it encounters we get to see it stuck more than once in this film but the filmmakers made an effort to show it beating the odds and eventually passing all the obstacles once the hero gets to the hidden camp and <UNK> the girl he jumps in the car with her and drives off with the <UNK> in hot pursuit on <UNK> and at this point it became hysterically funny to me watching this car slowly rolling over huge rocks getting stuck in <UNK> and mountain brush going forward and back to get momentum enough to pass over fallen tree limbs the <UNK> should have had ample time to catch up but they never do even though we are to believe this wilderness chase goes on throughout the night and in a silly climax the car climbs a <UNK> and helps <UNK> and the hero push a huge <UNK> down the side to crush the pursuing <UNK> br br after seeing this film you would think the army should <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> because they clearly have better off road <UNK> than <UNK> and <UNK> tanks combined watch this film just for laughs it's worth it just to see <UNK> <UNK> up to the car <UNK> and saying you did your best brave little car
<START> absolute masterpiece of a film <UNK> mr tom has <UNK> become one of my favourite films of all time nobody should miss out on seeing this film it's just too good mr tom is perfectly portrayed by john <UNK> as the harsh old man who becomes a soft father figure when william <UNK> nick robinson is sent to him for <UNK> almost like 'the town mouse and the country <UNK> a truly heart wrenching film the director knew exactly how to turn book into film and he has done so extremely well the film was so excellently shot that the emotions of the characters and what was happening made the audience feel a range of emotions from love to fear and these emotions could turn on a six <UNK> set in a time of turmoil during world war two this film also shows the difference between the cities and the countryside they are almost like different countries an absolute must see those who don't are missing out on a truly amazing and brilliant film
<START> this is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced written and directed vanity project while i was working as a crew member john carradine commented to me before the burning at the stake sequence this is the worst piece of sh t i've ever worked on and i've worked on a lot of pieces of sh t also an interesting moment earlier when jim mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started <UNK> in the <UNK> location of the <UNK> a religious <UNK> in <UNK> at which point one of the local <UNK> <UNK> low rider <UNK> <UNK> show some respect man which apparently caused jim to remember where he was as he then made a very profound and heartfelt <UNK> for his inappropriate behavior in any case the crew did the job on <UNK> and were never fully paid but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories like the night we caught the producer director's 10 year old son entertaining himself by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tiger traps for us to break our legs in like they say ya <UNK> love the <UNK>
<START> i have to say this is one of the worst films i've ever seen they had a pretty good storyline to go on but than the messed it up so badly first of all the cast is all wrong where did that van <UNK> crap actor btw and <UNK> daddy come from it looks like carlito has come from the hood and used to hang about with some real idiots this film doesn't do <UNK> way any justice im so happy that the sequel carlito's way came out first if i had seen this rubbish first i would have never given the pacino version a chance and anyway pacino is supposed to have read this story thought it's crap and did the sequel instead carlito's way rise to power 1 out of 10 carlito's way 9 out of 10
<START> nick cage is randall raines a retired car thief who is forced out of retirement when he's forced to save his the life of his brother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when he <UNK> up on a job by <UNK> his brothers job of stealing 50 cars in one night he has to get together his old crew that he can trust to help him pull it off and get his <UNK> out of dutch but the cops are onto him so can he pull it off this was one of the great candidates of a film to re make as the original was far from a classic and if you don't go into it expecting much and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole <UNK> just take the movie for what it is you'll end up enjoying the ride watch it on a double bill with the fast and the furious for a night of high speed <UNK> just don't take the car out for a spin right afterwards br br my grade b br br dvd extras 7 minute jerry bruckheimer interview bruckheimer bio filmography action <UNK> highlight reel the big chase 0 to 60 <UNK> wild rides <UNK> stars on the move the cult painted on the heart music video theatrical trailer and trailers for shanghai <UNK> mission to mars and <UNK> ugly
<START> the only reason i give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on br br this film is <UNK> it's like so many other 21st century <UNK> house fodder the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting i didn't care about any of the characters but i did care that some <UNK> bothered to pen this crap i'd complain about the money i spent but my date and i wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an <UNK> theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining live free or die hard which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter <UNK> of <UNK> for 40 minutes
<START> this is a great movie from the lost age of <UNK> made for television drama my all time favourite actor robert <UNK> <UNK> plots a <UNK> through uptight liberal <UNK> and faith in the system <UNK> <UNK> and fear of crime and homicidal <UNK> the teens are a collection of pure <UNK> evil stereotypes and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of <UNK> look <UNK> by comparison but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie building the fear and paranoia by degrees as well as the feel of the whole california setting the cars are really great as well as i recall i give this film a 10 and i defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute remember just because it's made for television doesn't mean it isn't great art
<START> except for the acting of meryl streep which is of note as always i'd avoid this film because it has a dated movie of the week quality about it but it is worth watching if you keep the several <UNK> in mind how a couple <UNK> media <UNK> and how the different are treated br br throughout the movie the issue is the credibility of the different <UNK> are different than us most of the rest of the world so we most of us automatically come at it with an air of <UNK> about them the couple involved is religious different than most of culture and <UNK> different at that so their lifestyle and mindset are suspect to begin with <UNK> are different animals than other dogs so again we're faced with <UNK> questions the real story then is how society and the world treats the different those who have different accents different beliefs than we do and how we treat what they say as suspect br br it's difficult to hear the phrase a <UNK> took my baby without laughing and there are humorous <UNK> sadly all over the web about it but in the years that followed the story and the movie it has been discovered as you'll find in web <UNK> that much larger children have been stalked by <UNK> research by experts in <UNK> have shown that it was not only possible but most <UNK> that the baby was taken by <UNK> maybe a pair <UNK> expertly from the clothing and eaten within moments without a trace br br yet what is left behind is the question of why people <UNK> <UNK> when they were found to be <UNK> children rather than killing the <UNK> to save the children why because a woman's affect expression is so cold she is assumed to be guilty and on and on br br haunting questions with or without the film
<START> a very engaging intelligent and well made film liam neeson and tim roth play their roles superbly the cinematography is outstanding the fight scenes are amazing this is a film i will enjoy watching again and again one of my favorites
<START> despite positive reviews and <UNK> at the international festivals this movie is not for everyone br br the story is very similar to other movies in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family she does that by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy that for some reason falls in love with her she confronts her problems and wins br br in <UNK> it's boxing in bend it like beckham it's soccer and now it's kung fu br br but fighter is much inferior product than these two it was simply embarrassing to watch it <UNK> <UNK> the actress that playing the role of a teenage girl maybe can do a lot of things but one thing she can't do is to act her presence on the screen is <UNK> and clumsy the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions are dreadful her body and facial language are of amateur actress badly <UNK> by the director the rest of the cast is a little better but they just cannot save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer br br even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this it's just so boring the slow motion was really unnecessary the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions not actually fighting not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys and knocks them off their feet br br the only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's european it's very easy to <UNK> this movie a first martial arts film from <UNK> but don't be fooled it's not it's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems which are by the way not really convincing br br bad movie with embarrassing lines acting and story
<START> for a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and <UNK> parker and matt <UNK> comic timing is perfect there are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie i especially like the <UNK> of colors and the way the clash in the sports <UNK> scenes robert <UNK> <UNK> mysteries spoof is also very amusing
<START> first i'd like to say that while i know my share about star wars i am not a fanatic i do not know how many <UNK> a <UNK> rat has or the extended family of <UNK> what i know is this star wars all the movies less so with episode 2 though captured something magical it's hard to say what what button lucas has found and <UNK> pressed but it works star wars is more than a movie it's an idea br br how may you ask i shall explain star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes good vs evil it does this so obviously so profoundly that literally any person from any environment can understand episode <UNK> does the very well <UNK> the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father yet also with the addition of the <UNK> reveals even more to the hinted back story suddenly it's darth vader at the front and viewers realize that it's the story about <UNK> not just luke but even before 1 3 there was amazing depth to it all it felt real as if capsule fell from the sky into <UNK> lap <UNK> a historical account of a galaxy far far away br br star wars is definitely something far above the norm and i must admit whenever i see them particularly this one i feel very small i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined i get a <UNK> feeling when i see them a feeling that something somehow has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope
<START> as a true elvis fan this movie is a total <UNK> and the script is a disaster the movie opens with the beautiful son stay away and the scenery of the grand canyon gives the viewer hope of something special elvis gets in the picture and his talent is wasted big time especially on the rest of the featured songs i sat through this movie twice just to make sure it is a piece of junk 1 out of 10
<START> why bother seeing this movie if you have great movies to see it is a total waste of time and money the movie is so bad that i felt bad for wanting to watching it everything in it is bad actors were bad script was really bad the story is stupid and the worst cgi ever the only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club one interesting thing that there is a <UNK> that we wish that he dies because he is so stupid that we get enough of him i don't remember the name but was the boyfriend of the chosen one br br note if you want to see a good movie this movie isn't the right choice 0 stars out of 10
<START> <UNK> de <UNK> is a very fun action comedy after his great fist movie called el <UNK> del <UNK> and the spectacular tv pro <UNK> los <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made another great work <UNK> de <UNK> looks for moments a movie made in hollywood diego <UNK> and luis <UNK> are two great actors and here they have great performances the movie is very fun and funny and it has superb moments <UNK> de <UNK> is a very fun action comedy that i totally recommend if you wanna have a great time and i have to <UNK> <UNK> for all the talent he has br br rating 9
<START> you've gotta hand it to steven seagal whatever his other faults may be he does have good taste in women if you pick a seagal movie chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it and usually they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight shoot guns kill with knives etc flight of fury offers the duo of <UNK> <UNK> who has a very sexy face with <UNK> lips to match angelina <UNK> and katie jones and finds time to get them involved in both a <UNK> and a little lesbian <UNK> and if it seems like i'm spending a little too much time talking about them it's because the rest of the movie although passable is so <UNK> that it's hard to find much else to talk about ironically the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself who looks as if he can't even be bothered to try to pretend to care this being a military type <UNK> there is very little fighting in it and he doesn't fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot the best in the world of course very well which may explain his almost offensive <UNK> 1 2
<START> this beautiful story of an elder son coming home and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from is poignant and moving it shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the western world with a sense of family that we have lost the story is beautiful sad and at times funny and comic it has a feeling of realism that we don't seem to see any longer in our western movies br br the acting is unusual in that as the movie progresses it almost gives the impression that it is not acting but a documentary of ordinary people this is brilliant directing and movie making br br would love to see more movies by this director
<START> finally timon and pumbaa in their own film br br 'the lion king 1 1 2 <UNK> <UNK> is an <UNK> new take on a classic tale which classic tale you ask why 'the lion <UNK> of course br br yep if there's one thing that disney is never short of it's <UNK> br br but that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film it's basically the events of 'the lion <UNK> as told from timon and <UNK> perspective and it's because of this that you'll have to know the story of 'the lion <UNK> by heart to see where they're coming from br br anyway at one level i was watching this and thinking oh my god this is so lame and on another level i was having a ball much of the humour is predictable i mean when pumbaa makes up two <UNK> a big one for himself and a small one for timon within the first <UNK> we all know that timon is going to take the big one but that doesn't stop it from being hilarious which imo is <UNK> <UNK> in a nutshell it's not what happens it's how br br and a note of warning there are also some fart jokes seriously did you expect anything else in a film where pumbaa takes centre stage but as fart jokes go these are especially good and should satisfy even the most particular <UNK> br br the returning voice talent is great i'm kinda surprised that some of the actors were willing to return what with most of them only having two or three lines if they're lucky whoopi goldberg is particularly welcome br br the music is also great from <UNK> <UNK> at the start to <UNK> all i <UNK> an adaption of <UNK> <UNK> a song that was cut from 'the lion <UNK> and is frankly much improved in this incarnation the music leaves me with nothing to complain about whatsoever br br in the end timon and pumbaa are awesome characters and while it may be <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and <UNK> <UNK> situations then so be it it's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with br br am i starting to sound creepy br br either way 'the lion king 1 1 <UNK> is great if you've seen 'the lion <UNK> far too many times especially if you are right now thinking don't be silly there's no such thing as seeing 'the lion <UNK> too many times
<START> first an explanation despite my <UNK> i'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is not one of the best films ever made all the criticisms <UNK> here have valid points also be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate neil simon's brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter he does have a <UNK> new york ear for dialogue especially dry jewish love <UNK> sarcasm and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this movie br br so much for <UNK> here's my main point walter matthau is flat out perfect even beyond perfect in this movie i have never seen him funnier or more touching for that matter because at the same time that he shows us the <UNK> of this character who refuses to give up his big star self image or <UNK> attitudes even as his <UNK> is in decline he also shows us the more vulnerable maybe even <UNK> scared person inside the <UNK> and he only barely shows us that sad part it's just enough to really get to you if you happen to be <UNK> with your own father's or husband's mental decline right now i mention this as a warning but artistically it's just enough pathos to give this character the most <UNK> deep roots i'm seen in possibly any film performance this is beyond method acting <UNK> performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery this is a masterpiece of comic acting br br about richard benjamin i personally find his acting annoying in general and his work in this movie is no exception although he has some fine moments here chicken is funny is one of them so if you like him you should like him here and if you don't this movie won't change your mind br br about the 1976 oscars i agree that matthau was unfortunate to be up against nicholson in <UNK> nest that year it was a killer year for leading actor competition if only there were separate oscars for comedy and drama then i think the best actor oscars would have gone to al pacino for dog day afternoon and to walter matthau for the sunshine boys not to <UNK> jack's fine work as <UNK> but i think that pacino and matthau were each clearly more masterful and <UNK> effective and downright legendary in their performances than nicholson was that year also i believe that burns got the supporting actor oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance i mean he was good in this movie but not that good <UNK> fine as ever but <UNK> in itself return to show <UNK> beat brad <UNK> truly brilliant debut in <UNK> nest not to mention chris <UNK> stunning debut in dog day afternoon which i think proves my theory br br oscar theories aside here's my bottom line review if you like <UNK> comic acting then see this movie and <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> and wonderful grandmother inspired gestures fleeting facial expressions and seemingly <UNK> <UNK> but if you're currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now
<START> it is pretty surreal what these flies can do eh well this is a cartoon so anything can happen in it br br at first i must tell you that i love animated movies unfortunately this year's <UNK> is very weak this cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws br br 1 i <UNK> the tag line it suggests that this movie has great 3d effects well i did not see any at least not something special i never saw before br br 2 the flies in this movie look nothing like real flies at least they could've make them black but <UNK> flies seriously with giant heads and slim <UNK> br br 3 the story i guess it was written for 6 year old kids i could tell it in two sentences it is so over <UNK> br br 4 excessive <UNK> for example they are american files after all oh give me a break
<START> which isn't exactly a <UNK> <UNK> overall <UNK> was a much better movie sure in that movie matt <UNK> played a complete <UNK> bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the <UNK> but the special effects in <UNK> were better the plot lines were better and the acting was better here are the problems with blood surf 1 the killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a <UNK> jaw 2 the plot is ridiculous matt <UNK> co get <UNK> on a deserted island in which they encounter a <UNK> group of ugly <UNK> natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film and 3 there's not enough croc time there are a couple of redeeming qualities of blood surf the actresses are pretty attractive and matt <UNK> gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie but if you're on your <UNK> and only have enough time to watch one matt <UNK> killer crocodile movie skip this one and fire up <UNK> instead
<START> this film was positively the worst film i have ever watched i couldn't sit through the whole thing i also think writer must have some weird fetish for women <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i mean what was that all about i cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have <UNK> a <UNK> rental <UNK> the quality both picture and sound are terrible the acting well doesn't exist it was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee crap and <UNK> were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup <UNK> avoid at all cost the girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part <UNK> they'd be willing to take their tops off while these girls have nice bodies it certainly didn't make up for the fact their <UNK> was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears br br this was like possibly worse than an <UNK> school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to <UNK> around a car br br <UNK> not one to buy folks sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but i could not find anything positive to say and i would like to think i may save someone else wasting their money like i have
<START> i first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my <UNK> system i like danny <UNK> and thought it might be interesting on top of that i'm a fan of max <UNK> work and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon with both of those i thought it would hold my interest i was wrong just a few minutes in and i had the fast forward button down i ran through it in about 15 minutes and thought that was it br br afterwards i read some of the other reviews here and figured i didn't give it enough of a chance i recorded it again and watched it through there's 75 minutes of my life i'm not getting back br br i can't believe there aren't more bad reviews personally i think it's because it's hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum how many ways are there to say this is a waste of time br br the movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts profanity and <UNK> jokes the characters are flat the parody of swinging the <UNK> is lame essentially <UNK> the tune getting through a e hitting the obvious profanity a f and then having no idea where to go the trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn't work the first time let alone the following ones br br across the board the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to out south park stone and parker without the ability to determine what is and isn't funny this might be amusing if you're high otherwise it's not
<START> could contain spoilers i'm surprised by the high rating of this film to be honest really am all i saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say note to self must check the rating for platoon on here this movie was so black and white americans good anyone else either evil or useless i take it the british troops in it were meant to be <UNK> one of the most elite <UNK> in the world most would agree with i'm pretty sure they lost 3 men and the others ran away while the us troops who weren't even elite soldiers in the fighting sense held the ground and opened up a can of <UNK> ass on them evil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dead on strings to mind the only good thing i have to say about this movie did come in this sense when the sniper took out the <UNK> man <UNK> flash from distance good noise used really well done that bit but the rest spare me what am i 10 years of age over here well i'm not and can see nonsense propaganda in a movie and boy did this movie have it br br spoiler oh <UNK> and in the main crazy wild guy can't stay at home with his wife and young child no he has to sign up for another year to fight in a nonsense lie of a war why because young men need thrills or something apparently like say i'm surprised by the high rating of this movie really am br br p s i'm not hating america i'm hating the message of this movie that seems to not even want to confront issues of an illegal war in my eyes which ok fair enough because clearly there are people out there who think it's a just war for whatever messed up reason wanted to say something else her but <UNK> but hey that's up to them but to <UNK> out a movie so one sided like it's black and white good v evil is lazy and treating me as a child in war there is a lot of grey and it's two sometimes more sides who believe in what they are fighting for not star wars with something something dark side <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> sake hollywood at times you really do take people for <UNK> then again 7 8 well maybe you are right to but i'll not be buying it glad i <UNK> this movie tell you all that for nothing
<START> long boring <UNK> never have i been so glad to see ending credits roll
<START> who wrote this some guy named john cohen i guess this was the first screenplay he's ever worked on someone should've told him you're supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say br br and who directed this scott <UNK> son of <UNK> marshall my the nut has fallen far from the tree someone might have wanted to let him know that you can in fact shoot a scene in a cab in new york and it will look real and you won't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from jessica simpson but hopefully he's learned that lesson now br br and jessica simpson naturally she can't act hell she makes jessica alba look like <UNK> hepburn and yet she's starring in this movie oh wait it was produced by her father okay that's why she got the part that's really the only reason i can think of br br so should i be surprised it's bad no should i be amazed at how bad it is i think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as i did i mean you expect a movie starring jessica simpson to be bad but this it's not just bad it's the complete opposite of a classic film think of a great woody allen movie this film is as bad as that film is good it's the anti annie hall br br i am so glad i didn't pay to see it i stopped watching ten minutes in <UNK> i couldn't go on no doubt i would've walked out of the theater sooner in fact i wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing the film starts out laughably bad and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of chinese water torture and then around when the first act is ending you realize it'll only get worse and that's when you either need to leave or kill yourself br br in conclusion this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water <UNK> at <UNK> bay although some prefer the water <UNK>
<START> envy is bad for a number of reasons yes there are unlikeable characters that's not the problem it is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all the war of the <UNK> featured unlikeable characters but due to proper <UNK> we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate whereas in envy the introduction is thin the characters are never believable and the plot only makes things worse br br ben stiller is simply repulsive in his role and i'm a fan of his work most of the time stiller <UNK> to have this released straight to video and now i can see why the movie <UNK> that he's best friends with jack black but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate stiller hates black i thought this would develop into some sort of one sided relationship a la the cable guy but it never does instead stiller insists he's his best friend and i felt confused as he seemed to treat black like well poo the movie's plot is ridiculous but it doesn't matter because it's supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale unfortunately the message is lost in the mess walken gives a good performance but black is off key and annoying and i usually find him very funny no it's not a horrible film but i still can't believe barry <UNK> rain man <UNK> is responsible for this it's not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better i wish <UNK> poo <UNK> did exist so we could make this film disappear forever
<START> there was nothing of value in the original movie this one was even <UNK> the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing anyone connected to this film has to be high on something so what was the story line what was with the girl was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film sadly i tried several times to watch this i even borrowed a kid from someone to get some <UNK> kid said it was stupid and he was four years old i find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a b film that might be pushing it i did love the theme song good thing it was only a dollar it was worth it i suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be is pot legal in france
<START> <UNK> runs in a linear fashion expect no fast paced action and neither will you find yourself with <UNK> breath because there are simply no <UNK> on the edge moments br br there is not much of a <UNK> so don't expect one either i would not fault the acting the show would have been much worst if not for <UNK> acting which was the film's only saving grace and oh that cute little girl too br br the humour is at best weak and the show must as well pass off as an anti drug campaign which employs the usual shock <UNK> <UNK> in the scenes with zhang to tell us stuff that we already know i e drugs break up families heroin drives you crazy it is not so easy to <UNK> off you will fall into a vicious cycle br br i know it may seem all a little harsh but i feel that the show is far from <UNK> and somewhat <UNK> spoiler alert take for example when andy <UNK> got brought to the police station what we were just told <UNK> we have all the tapes and evidence against you since <UNK> and that is how he got caught nope no chasing car action just a jump of scene which kind of <UNK> <UNK> role as an undercover in the first place i suspect the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is after all a production of <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> production film company
<START> i'm not sure quite why i <UNK> contains spoiler because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it br br visually it mostly delivers well apart from some 80's <UNK> rubber mask monsters i'll say now that before watching this i had never seen the band <UNK> nor knew anything about them bar that they won <UNK> apparently the monsters in this are members of the band pretty much in their stage <UNK> whatever anyway i didn't know this while watching i just thought the monsters demons were mostly passable just about br br i'm almost sure there is a semi coherent explanation behind what we see on screen but it may actually be better not to know it it probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it the action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly br br i gave it a four mainly because i got a good laugh out of it especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing must have been the mood i was in but i found that <UNK> funny for some reason then i look up the movie on the internet and find out that nobody knows what the hell it's supposed to be about that amused me further and raised my score an extra half point to a 4 10 br br it's not scary or particularly coherent but it's pretty nice visually and <UNK> overall far from essential but watchable don't expect too much and don't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood
<START> attention spoiler br br many people told me that <UNK> of the <UNK> was tim <UNK> worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film so i decided not to see it another friend of mine who hadn't seen the movie yet advised me to watch it in spite of this because a tim burton movie is still a tim burton <UNK> i decided to do it and i found that he was right br br it's clear that a remake of such a famous film as planet of the <UNK> is automatically influenced by commercial thinking still tim burton managed his film to represent his weird <UNK> just as well as <UNK> or <UNK> if you are already fond of burton movies it's hard not to like one of his films even if it has some flaws nerve <UNK> monkey <UNK> over dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been without difficulties replaced by <UNK> else br br what the film gives us in the first place is an answer to the question what's the result when tim burton is <UNK> to create a remake first of all burton wouldn't be burton if he wouldn't refuse to call it a remake from the start it's a re <UNK> on the other hand burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring charlton heston as human and he knows that a remake doesn't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared so all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film e g by <UNK> to quotes concerning the story line burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with  and here is the spoiler  leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever br br now this is the <UNK> answer to people's expectations they hold because of the astonishing shocking ending of the first planet of the <UNK> an ending even more unexpected more astonishing and completely confusing because  and here i'm <UNK> with various planet of the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK>  it does not make any sense there cannot be a meaning to it or just a so complicated one that it becomes <UNK> tim burton is playing his cruel games he does it with a grin and he does it well burton fans will sure like it others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of <UNK> well and i don't think producers will ever ask burton to direct a remake <UNK>
<START> this movie had a fairly good sounding plot but the <UNK> was very slow very slow indeed even if someone thinks this is a cult classic i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched br br the cinematography is not excellent but not the worst either the sounds are ok lighting ok br br i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film student br br the movie does not contain music and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either and the woman <UNK> on the edge of the bed was plain stupid br br no <UNK> here skip this utter boredom i've seen worse believe me but this is just waste of time and i don't get the good reviews here especially the high ratings
<START> in the opinion of several of my friends and family members including myself this is the finest of the entire gamut of tarzan movies johnny <UNK> never played the part as well in the following issues in the series it definitely rates a 10 in my collection of films
<START> joel <UNK> made a heck of a choice when he decided on this cast and this script the story is well written and well laid out and this entirely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant it seemed that there were 6 leads and about a half dozen supporting and by far this is the best thing about the movie the fresh young faces of tomorrow it has been a long time since hollywood has touched the controversial vietnam war films which says something for the story that needed to be told as stated by <UNK> and <UNK> lands in that handful of top war movies period yet it can not be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of <UNK> and the others i think anyone who just wants to see a good film with out all of the special fx but just good gritty drama should go see <UNK> obviously <UNK> best works in the past 8 years
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is the responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of latest spanish cinema just take a look at his <UNK> <UNK> so i didn't expect that much of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in fact i don't know why in the world did i decide to watch it anyway i just did and what a surprise it looks that <UNK> <UNK> has finally <UNK> and now he's capable of making a good movie he's last work deals with the <UNK> crisis the disappointing and the seeking for a second chance after you've ruined it all the last half hour of the movie the more dramatic is the best part and it just makes worth watching the film also we have <UNK> <UNK> playing the main role and i keep on thinking he's the best actor of his generation by far br br my rate 7 10
<START> i can't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6 it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long long time br br in a no budget way it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck br br this film should be avoided at all costs it's one of those festival films that only please the pseudo <UNK> because they are so badly made those people think it makes it different therefore good br br bad film making is not different it's just bad film making
<START> although i have not seen this mini series in over twenty years i can still remember how the balance between character plot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded the use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story the two versions i've seen were dubbed english and french but the actors appear to speak their own language not just italian so there is a <UNK> problem it does not spoil the story telling among the cast irene <UNK> as penelope is the most recognizable to north americans recommended to all followers of <UNK> ever returning
<START> an <UNK> over the top action adventure first blood part ii seemed to catch the mood of the us at the time of it's release in the mid 80's with right wing <UNK> and <UNK> anti red feelings still not finished yet though the <UNK> of a certain <UNK> <UNK> in the heart of the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> would soon render these types of films redundant even reagan himself eventually admitted this <UNK> br br in that sense we can be most grateful to <UNK> not for his <UNK> <UNK> with the us nor his <UNK> of <UNK> or even his support of democracy being restored to the eastern european countries in the former soviet <UNK> backyard no it's the final <UNK> of foolish <UNK> <UNK> cold war adventures like this the first rambo film was hardly perfect though at least was a mildly <UNK> and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline in this sequel any sense of even the <UNK> conviction is instantly <UNK> for silly senseless plotting and incident in which rambo single <UNK> takes on scores of <UNK> stereotyped <UNK> and russian troops to rescue american <UNK> ten years after the conflict ended with the americans on the losing side br br perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box office success was to let many americans <UNK> in fantasy they may have lost the war but there was still unfinished business at hand and ludicrous comic strip <UNK> with a robot like hero killing virtually every red on sight with as much <UNK> as possible <UNK> such <UNK> far fetched ideals br br this could have been entertaining on a superman <UNK> level but sadly everything is played absolutely straight but that is not to say that there is no humour in the film sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind the action scenes though technically adequate never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or <UNK> because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of <UNK> namely our hero rambo is always <UNK> aside from a few cuts and <UNK> here and there despite the tons of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc going around him br br in between the mayhem what there is of a script consists of the <UNK> clichés and <UNK> stallone who co wrote the script with james cameron a long way from the exciting terminator made the previous year deliberately seems to have given the rambo character as little to say in understandable english and merely comes out with moronic <UNK> almost as though he has invented his own brand of <UNK> only understandable to himself maybe his colleague cameron was thinking of the terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character in this sense rambo seems even less of a human than the terminator did the rest of the cast do little better with good actors like charles <UNK> and richard crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given and steven <UNK> <UNK> it up outrageously yet again with another of his russian <UNK> red army villain roles <UNK> <UNK> is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing how come that sly managed to survive <UNK> electric shock torture to kill yet more of those red <UNK> <UNK> well credibility is never this film's strong point it is a work of fantasy comparable with the wizard of oz at least that was meant to be a fantasy and an immortal classic it turned out to be this is only a classic of the most dismal and indeed offensive kind and as for <UNK> climactic speech rather <UNK> after <UNK> all those people eh by the way in the same year he also made rocky iv br br rating 3 out of 10
<START> this is a wonderful movie about the struggle of the <UNK> and their final <UNK> in salt lake <UNK> the beginning and the ending are especially powerful and the message is one we all have to be reminded of god doesn't talk but he <UNK> if we would only listen as i am writing this in the midst of the horrors going on in new orleans and the surrounding area due to <UNK> i was especially moved by the <UNK> having to leave everything behind and move on after joseph smith was <UNK> people came to this country to escape religious <UNK> and yet they could not the struggle of the <UNK> to cross the country the cost in lives the <UNK> they suffered was truly awe inspiring <UNK> their tremendous strength as far as the actual beliefs of <UNK> this is not heavily gone into and <UNK> is mentioned but is not a <UNK> of the film at all br br the cast is top notch though others who have commented know more about the actual characters and can talk about how true the portrayals were but as actors dean jagger mary <UNK> brian <UNK> john carradine jane <UNK> all do excellently with the script they were given br br though the film could have easily stood on its own and certainly does today <UNK> power and linda <UNK> were added to the cast to get the crowds into the movie theaters to see a film about the <UNK> power is <UNK> handsome as a young mormon and <UNK> as <UNK> is not a mormon but stays on with the family after her father is killed power does not have much to do until the end of the film when he has a big scene and <UNK> still a teenager at the time of the filming has even less though they make a lovely couple their fate is left unclear regarding her <UNK> and one does wonder about the <UNK> in their case you can't beat either one for eye candy however
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br the american military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can <UNK> <UNK> unlike any other a <UNK> pilot steve <UNK> steals it and plots to hold the us government to <UNK> with it so they are forced to send in their best man john <UNK> seagal who else to stop him in exchange for his freedom from a <UNK> centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the <UNK> information he's learned over the years br br i <UNK> attack force because i could tell from the cover and all the post production <UNK> that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came <UNK> in it just confirmed what i thought but i decided to give <UNK> a go because shadow man by the same director wasn't bad and what the hell seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe just maybe he could make a great film again oh what a fool i was br br dubbing horrendous stock footage of <UNK> stealth fighter <UNK> awful camera work cheap production values <UNK> unconvincing fight scenes that have become <UNK> trademark and a boring sleep inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere br br thankfully his next film once upon a time in the hood which i'll be skipping apparently marks the end of his contract with <UNK> meaning no more of these awful european <UNK> action films and his next film prince of <UNK> might mark a return to theatres hell he's done it before and stallone will have managed to do it before him rocky <UNK> br br this isn't a flight of fury it isn't even a flight of fun it's a flight that fails to even take off the ground
<START> evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything i am not sure how much john <UNK> <UNK> got but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an <UNK> for even being associated with such a rotten movie the special effects were worse then effects from the 1950's b movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse as to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion the english was terribly <UNK> and i think no one could really even speak english they just <UNK> how the words should sound instead of <UNK> the script and trying to make their character both life like and real
<START> well maybe the pc version of this game was impressive maybe i just finished playing the <UNK> version and it's pretty much a complete mess br br there are a couple elements that are okay or promising i'll mention those first because it will be over quickly first the idea of a historical <UNK> like game is a great one the game gun was a historical <UNK> like game and unlike mafia gun was excellent i'd love to see a game set during <UNK> era done right next the storyline is well written the story makes sense it has dramatic <UNK> it uses an unusual device with much of the game being a <UNK> and it's interesting finally some of the graphics especially those used during <UNK> are impressive <UNK> <UNK> seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where <UNK> <UNK> on that effort especially the characters unfortunately in many other areas the graphics kinda stink and i'd much rather have excellent <UNK> than impressive looking characters br br the <UNK> is what sinks this title so low first off the controls and camera absolutely suck that has to be the first focus of any game <UNK> you can't release a game where the controls and or camera suck number one there's no reason that the <UNK> character tom can't have his full range of motion controlled by the left <UNK> stick unless it's absolutely necessary and it hardly ever is i hate the set up where the left stick moves the character in a <UNK> way and the character can only turn using the right <UNK> stick here it's not only unnecessary it makes most of the <UNK> actions a challenge for example tom has to climb on a couple missions but the game is designed so poorly that you have to <UNK> keep <UNK> both the right <UNK> stick and the camera and then press <UNK> every time you need to climb or tom will <UNK> instead br br next i've never seen a worse fighting system the first problem is that you can't auto aim or lock on to any targets at one early point the game seems to tell you that you can use <UNK> or <UNK> to lock on to targets but that never worked so to focus on any enemy you have to struggle with the stupid right <UNK> stick and try to keep <UNK> both the character's <UNK> and the camera which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make tom disappear all the time by that time you're probably getting <UNK> or shot to death br br next if you're touching or almost touching an enemy and that's certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using <UNK> weapons the fighting system which primarily consists of <UNK> or holding <UNK> is completely useless enemies can <UNK> you almost in a bear hug but you just can't move unless you back off so close fighting tends to consist of you <UNK> on the left <UNK> stick yelling at the character to move away which it won't do 50 of the time then <UNK> <UNK> as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes <UNK> useless and if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime you're also going to struggle with the right <UNK> stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything by that time you're probably getting <UNK> or shot again and your only option will be to try to move the character away again my fights often consisted of making tom run circles around an area like a comedy film hoping that i could gain enough time to struggle with the <UNK> stick and get a couple shots in before being at the <UNK> mercy again so much for realistic fighting br br and the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns if you're touching someone half the time the <UNK> just won't allow you to fire off a shot yet they can still <UNK> you full of holes additionally there's no auto aim and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive even with the sensitivity set to zero under <UNK> <UNK> tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you luckily or not damage seems to be recorded almost randomly it can take one to ten shots or more to <UNK> any character and there's no rhyme or reason to it you can put five shots into an <UNK> head and near point blank range and they'll still return fire and hurt you yet the game <UNK> seemed to care enough about realism than they built a <UNK> into your aiming system so after shots with powerful enough guns your aim will <UNK> off target and you'll have to fight with it again br br as for the celebrated graphics except for the characters and <UNK> that you're close to they're actually pretty disappointing the distance always seems mostly empty and there are often <UNK> of flat colors and <UNK> nearby when you're driving the city wasn't very well designed it's not varied enough and there aren't many interesting things to see or do the cars seem slow and they're difficult to control they also all drive about the same some have mentioned the music but that was also pretty <UNK> a much better job could have been done on that end also as many others have mentioned the load times are ridiculous and constant they tend to be over a minute long and they occur between and in the middle of everything even races br br overall the mafia <UNK> to <UNK> at least seems to have been very rushed the game feels and plays like an <UNK> hack job
<START> i am a huge michael madsen fan so needless to say i bought this movie without even renting it or anything this movie was so horrible i didn't even take it back to the store i wouldn't want anyone else to be subjected to this human poison i just threw it in the trash never mind the money it was worth the price to be able to throw it away the acting wasn't that bad it wasn't good or anything the story was horrible and the ending was something i despise he was a broken man alcoholic his life was a bunch of junk i thought his horse <UNK> was an awful device to show his childhood innocence a dog would have been much much better i also hate religion so this ending without a doubt <UNK> me jesus <UNK> all i hate that i know people just like this that are huge christians and <UNK> and time will show that god doesn't <UNK> all or anything it was a horrible movie if u have the option to see it pass or better yet buy it or rent it and throw it in the garbage and leave the coffee grounds on it in the morning
<START> i watched it with my mom and we were like br br what the hell we didn't get it at all i may have this wrong but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father that movie was terrible this is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie bad suspense movie shakes <UNK> at movie i'm never seeing it again and i'm a big fan of lifetime movies too they kinda need to quit trying to make movies outta books it's driving me crazy br br and <UNK> was butt ugly and yet she loves him more than hugh who was a tiny bit <UNK> looking br br my rating 1 10
<START> who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community certainly not the makers of fido who take us to a never never land version of the 1950's where the undead have been turned into <UNK> and servants for the <UNK> middle class timmy robinson is the all american boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full time domestic a recently <UNK> zombie whom timmy has <UNK> dubbed fido all of this has been made possible by <UNK> a big brother type organization that has found a way to render the zombies who were originally brought to life by radiation from outer space <UNK> and <UNK> at least most of the time br br this twisted modern day spin on the tv series <UNK> it might easily have been entitled a boy and his zombie takes <UNK> satirical <UNK> at such pre '60s concerns as obsessive social <UNK> here keeping up with the <UNK> means having more zombie servants than the folks next door the <UNK> of suburban life the corporate control of <UNK> affairs small town corruption and nuclear family values all played out in a beautifully designed setting of <UNK> colored houses and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the movie doesn't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless <UNK> to generate laughs instead this is a low <UNK> subtle little satire that <UNK> <UNK> chuckles rather than full <UNK> <UNK> much of the humor <UNK> from the <UNK> between the <UNK> of the setting and the <UNK> attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community life magazine has been replaced with a <UNK> entitled death magazine despite some <UNK> graphic violence the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950's itself and the cheesy low budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade br br <UNK> ray carrie ann moss and dylan baker are <UNK> and appealing as the wide eyed timmy and his <UNK> esquire parents with slightly sinister undertones while billy connolly <UNK> the well <UNK> impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a <UNK> corpse br br this is what <UNK> might have been had <UNK> best friend been <UNK> <UNK>
<START> we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and <UNK> giving a <UNK> performance the plot is <UNK> and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable br br just terrible
<START> this is a reunion a team and a great episode of justice from <UNK> to resolution clark has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny to a superman who like green arrow sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones ready to save the whole planet this is not just a thrilling story about <UNK> loyalty and friendship this is also about deciding what's more important in life a lesson for clark i do not want the series to end but i hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what justice shows without any <UNK> pushes and put a good end here of <UNK> and a wonderful beginning of superman br br in this episode however we should have seen more contrast between lex and the team nine stars should give it enough credit
<START> one of the previous reviewers wrote that there appeared to be no middle ground for opinions of love story one loved it or hated it but there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10 for me this movie rated a 4 there are some beautiful scenes and locations and ray <UNK> turns in a fabulous job as <UNK> father but the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings at least not for me i may be a bit of a <UNK> but i tend to avoid movies with ryan <UNK> i still haven't seen barry <UNK> because most of them but not all are ruined for me by his presence the lone exception is what's up doc in which his straight performance is the perfect <UNK> for barbra <UNK> <UNK> protagonist and not <UNK> he takes a shot at love story for good measure <UNK> and <UNK> tend to <UNK> their lines rather than act them br br this movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career it was tommy lee <UNK> first movie
<START> when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it i <UNK> that while the presence of a particular star usually <UNK> a certain level of quality because of their artistic control with nicole kidman the influence she <UNK> is <UNK> to film enjoyment imho thus for instance <UNK> even <UNK> the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is <UNK> home or other films promoting gay and <UNK> as worthy of anyone else's attention or other pet causes of <UNK> br br here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job i don't how or who was able to <UNK> her but apparently it worked the way the film depicts her <UNK> despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman and consequently what makes a man's most desperate hopes <UNK> <UNK> br br of course the fact the male lead transforms from a <UNK> clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego <UNK> fantasy but his transformation is adequately believable it isn't <UNK> contrived as it would be in a film <UNK> to <UNK> male ego instead it accurately records necessary growth <UNK> from the films unique circumstances br br also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human apart from their criminal mission her gang has a <UNK> rough and <UNK> <UNK> which is foreign to american culture and while they are his <UNK> they are never really his enemy in effect they teach him to be compete br br i really <UNK> at <UNK> ability to physically appear russian it had me wondering whether her <UNK> was russian but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing br br i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film despite my gratuitous <UNK> at ms kidman the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime
<START> being an <UNK> since the days of <UNK> i can still say that <UNK> is one of my favorite <UNK> of all time considering when it was made the animation is of superior quality there are no <UNK> and sequences in which the art <UNK> in quality although the final episode is in black and white it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film although it has been described as being sappy it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do since the main character is a female it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to macho man tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers the <UNK> for <UNK> incidentally also plays <UNK> in <UNK> 1 2 <UNK> is as 3 dimensional a cartoon can get her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will the only complaint i have is that the <UNK> looked somewhat like teddy bears even the <UNK> <UNK> a rather dubious <UNK> laser and buster shield which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant <UNK> cloak around itself in true dracula style technique i doubt that scene was meant to be funny but it <UNK> me up yet all in all i would rank <UNK> in the top 20 anime of all time
<START> i had been looking forward to how to lose friends alienate people for months particularly due to the fact that kirsten dunst and simon pegg were starring simon pegg is a comedic genius and kirsten dunst has always been a favorite actress of mine how to lose friends alienate people hit the spot of course not perfect but very enjoyable and funny how to lose friends alienate people follows the life of sidney young a <UNK> bumbling british celebrity journalist who is hired by an <UNK> magazine in new york city in spectacular fashion sidney enters high society and burns bridges with bosses peers and <UNK> after <UNK> one black tie event by allowing a wild pig to run rampant sidney catches the attention of <UNK> <UNK> editor of sharp and accepts a job with the magazine in new york city <UNK> warns sidney that he'd better impress and charm everyone he can if he wants to succeed instead sidney instantly insults and <UNK> fellow writer alison olsen kirsten dunst he <UNK> to target the star <UNK> of power <UNK> <UNK> johnson gillian anderson he also <UNK> his direct boss lawrence <UNK> danny huston sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone his saving grace a rising <UNK> sophie <UNK> <UNK> fox who develops an odd affection for him in time <UNK> friendship might be the only thing saving sydney from his <UNK> <UNK> career the storyline is very interesting and the acting was top notch with what the actors were given simon pegg is still hilarious as ever he makes sydney bumbling obnoxious and annoying as real as it gets but later in time making sydney not just likable but also a real character who you root for in the end kirsten dunst and jeff bridges were brilliant kirsten had some very wonderful acting and hilarious scenes and jeff bridges is just jeff f <UNK> bridges how can you not like him he makes <UNK> a very humorous character with some wit and overall you just love the guy gillian anderson <UNK> fox and danny huston were great as the supporting cast each had their own personality that were overall pretty unlikable but that's what just made the film work one thing i didn't enjoy was how one dimensional some of the characters were i understand that most were the supporting cast but some of the cast was underused and could've given the film some more spice to it how to lose friends alienate people will never be on anyone's top 10 films ever or even top 10 comedies ever but it has a very high entertainment level and some scenes may even charm you as well how to lose friends alienate people is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the year 8 10
<START> even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the 1960s ok so katie didn't join the <UNK> family and nobody died at <UNK> this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest <UNK> the wonder years and oliver <UNK> 60s films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right
<START> super <UNK> makes a great <UNK> of your new dvd <UNK> 5 1 channel sound system the <UNK> camera puts you right in the race car where you cruise around various tracks at high speed reminiscent of the driving sequences in grand <UNK> if only that would appear on dvd i enjoy watching it again and again br br the only minus and why i didn't give it a 10 is some of the driving sequences look <UNK> like the film was <UNK> up the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief all you can hear in a real car is the engine you won't hear <UNK> as you go under bridges
<START> i read somewhere in a fairly <UNK> review that this is something of a live action <UNK> anime and i think they're on the right lines i first watched this movie when i was very young and i've been dying to see it again and when i finally did just recently all the memories came <UNK> back i don't think this is to be taken too seriously it's just a bit of good old 80's almost a tv movie fun it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future although this point isn't <UNK> too much what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didn't sound generic no clichés no predictable lines all in all just good fun maybe time hasn't been kind to this little movie but still i can find appreciation for it in me it's by no means perfect but it's entertaining and doesn't try to be anything other than that let the <UNK> and comic store guys worry about <UNK> who cares see it for yourself and make your own decision no one else's opinion matters
<START> i have been a fan of this movie for years and years because of <UNK> <UNK> move into the <UNK> i had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me sally field and kevin kline are beyond fabulous although i never have watching daytime soap operas this movie kills me every time i watch it the acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart i highly recommend that you watch this if you haven't already you will get to see elizabeth <UNK> whoopi goldberg <UNK> <UNK> and carrie fisher to name a few all give splendid performances
<START> first of all this movie is <UNK> minutes long which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies second of all you need to do this this sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky and pigs eating their own fried flesh that's only the beginning the scenes and images extraordinary on their own flow together without obvious <UNK> <UNK> in a way that demands re watching furthermore the dvd includes an amazing director's commentary which given the extremely spare dialog only enhances the viewing the commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes but also provides priceless quotes on the <UNK> of cat soup along the lines of well the artists were asking what we should do in this scene but i didn't know myself so its hard to say why it turned out as it did that's a bad <UNK> by the way also the sound throughout the film is very high quality very precise and very moody in all the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows br br first viewing watch the dvd without the commentary second viewing watch the dvd with the commentary third viewing <UNK> without the commentary br br once you've watched it three times however you're not going to stop there
<START> eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life when i saw it for the first time about 2 years ago i was in <UNK> for weeks after it to date i have seen it a further 17 times and i still laugh my ass off each time for those who dont know eddie murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a hollywood superstar there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in 1987 which goes flat during the middle if you are not the sort of person who can't stand swearing then i wouldn't advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every 5 10 seconds i gave this a 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best
<START> the dazzling <UNK> minute dance sequence of george <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> piece an american in paris is an <UNK> <UNK> choreographed with <UNK> and <UNK> flair by gene kelly the vibrant combination of color music and dance is still eye <UNK> startling as the piece is broken down into scenes inspired by selected master artists <UNK> in the opening place de la <UNK> piece <UNK> in the flower market <UNK> in a paris street <UNK> at the fair vincent van <UNK> in the spectacular place de <UNK> piece and <UNK> <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> where kelly wears his famous white <UNK> the <UNK> minutes that <UNK> this finale are not as exciting not by a long shot but there are certain charms to be had in viewing the entire 1951 oscar winning musical br br director <UNK> minnelli and screenwriter alan jay <UNK> have fashioned a surprisingly sophisticated if rather slight romantic story focused on jerry <UNK> a former g i who has remained in paris after the end of wwii trying to make a living as a painter with his <UNK> manner and athletic dancing style gene kelly can be <UNK> <UNK> and irritating as a screen personality but he seems to find his <UNK> as the <UNK> jerry the love triangle plot is focused on <UNK> involvement with milo roberts a self <UNK> art <UNK> but a sexual predator when it comes to young artists on their first date in a crowded <UNK> nightclub jerry <UNK> falls for <UNK> a young woman who turns out to be the fiancée of <UNK> a professional entertainer and friend of <UNK> pal adam an out of work concert <UNK> romantic complications ensue until the inevitable ending but not before several classic gershwin songs are performed br br the best of these is the most <UNK> a <UNK> romantic song and dance to our love is here to stay along a faux <UNK> river in a blue <UNK> <UNK> with yellow fog lights the way kelly and leslie caron circle each other is <UNK> as they approach each other <UNK> at first and then <UNK> beautifully to the music leading to the final <UNK> few films have so <UNK> and <UNK> shown two people falling in love i got rhythm and <UNK> spotlight kelly's <UNK> tap dancing and <UNK> singing while <UNK> you is <UNK> <UNK> by caron in a five scene montage of <UNK> all over the map description of <UNK> to adam designed to show off <UNK> dancing <UNK> the sequence is similar to the one in on the town where vera ellen showed off her considerable dancing skills when kelly's sailor character described his multi <UNK> vision of miss <UNK> br br as <UNK> the <UNK> year old caron in her first film dances superbly throughout and handles her role with <UNK> charm with her acting talent not to bloom for several years looking quite glamorous nina <UNK> plays older as the manipulative milo and manages to be likable enough for us to care about her fate while oscar <UNK> is just his <UNK> self as adam performing an elegant i'll build a <UNK> to paradise george <UNK> plays <UNK> so <UNK> that you feel bad that he does lose the girl at the end this is not the best all around mgm musical but there is certainly enough movie magic to make this quite worthwhile the 2000 dvd contains a fairly <UNK> print but little else in terms of extras
<START> i would say for it's time this movie was awesome and yes if you have no desire to become a christian then why bother watching it i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind series they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people i think in order to actually judge this movie you should see it there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if i am not mistaken don't use our comments to judge see the movie for yourself god will bless you if that is why you are watching them
<START> who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie br br accidental killing of a security guard characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them and better br br a red <UNK> of death please br br <UNK> weak thugs br br acting from hell br br <UNK> this movie shifts between teen comedy thriller <UNK> and female <UNK> rambo br br unbelievable and it's an insult to any thinking person do not watch walk away it's more horrible than you may imagine br br and on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence br br mrs <UNK> shoot 'em up was fun and funny this is just pathetic and terrible good luck next time
<START> father of the pride was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life and that is pretty sad specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air think in the simple life i admit that are many similarities with this show and the simpsons but despite the similarities the show have it own merits the animation is just adequate not incredible but is good the best are the characters all the animals are very likable and funny and even <UNK> and roy had their moments the music was good i liked many of the songs br br even if the show isn't very original i think that this had lots of potential like mission hill a show that isn't very famous but i liked a lot this didn't have the appreciation that it deserved what a shame
<START> sidney young pegg moves from england to new york to work for the popular magazine <UNK> in a hope to live his dream lifestyle but struggles to make a lasting impression br br based on toby <UNK> book about survival in american business this comedy drama received mixed views from <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> funny but with charm by the actors how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond make fun at another culture comedy but it isn't br br this 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story we start off in the past then in the present and are working our way <UNK> to see how young made his mark at one of america's top magazines br br pegg hot <UNK> is too likable for words whether it's hitting zombies with a <UNK> bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the english actor brings a charm and light <UNK> to every scene here when the scripting is good but far from his own standards he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for his antics with babe 3 are unforgivable simply breathtaking stuff as is his over <UNK> dancing but he pulls it off <UNK> br br bridges and anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest <UNK> fox who stole transformers reminds everyone she can act here with a funny <UNK> of a stereotype film star the fact that her character sophie <UNK> is starring in a picture about mother <UNK> is as laughable as her character's antics in the pool to emphasize the point there is a dog and pegg rounds that off in true brit style comedy with a great little twist br br though a british film there is an adaptation of american lifestyle for young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to story telling young wants the down right dirty <UNK> with the american <UNK> the inclusion of modern day <UNK> stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film <UNK> gives this edge br br <UNK> first picture is not perfect there are <UNK> in concentration as the plot becomes too <UNK> with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary the physical comedy can also be overdone as a side note the <UNK> on the dvd are some of the finest you will ever see which are almost half an hour long br br this comedy drama has simon pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy it is worth watching
<START> <UNK> advertising i saw a commercial for <UNK> way rise to power that states from the producer of scarface and carlito's way lets get it straight michael bergman did not produce scarface in fact he was <UNK> room <UNK> for scarface not to take away from <UNK> talent but in my opinion he should of had a little more class i think i can speak for the masses when i say we hate being blatantly <UNK> to as far as the movie goes it was poor at best i did think <UNK> daddy did a good job although luis <UNK> should be ashamed for working on this film overall this film did not do a good job filling in the <UNK> for carlito's way it's obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film
<START> you're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse i rated the <UNK> murphy movie a 3 i'm a harsh <UNK> the second lowest i ever gave <UNK> the worst being battle at bloody beach if you're curious i give this movie a rating of 8 and i'm a harsh <UNK> it's the civil war story of <UNK> soldiers if you want to call them that against the north people like <UNK> and the men who <UNK> with these <UNK> br br the original was a <UNK> version very clean cut while still depicting the horror of what these men did actually movies such as the older version are best viewed by mature audiences who can <UNK> the story i would be more apt to rate the original r and this one with it's gruff nature a <UNK> because the newer movie gives a very honest version a message more easily <UNK> by a juvenile than the older version br br film makers since the early sixties have <UNK> about realism but few of them deliver instead they just give the drab scenery drab costumes and drab events but with comic book cardboard stereotype characters the weakness of the spaghetti era br br modern film makers have realized this mistake it is evident in a superior style of western we usually see today this movie is an example it gives the realistic settings but also gives us characters we can believe exist in that era br br it has a few <UNK> which makes a complete sit through a bit hard and it has some unexplained situations but unexplained situations are okay as long the entire movie holds up and the characters are intriguing enough br br it begins a bit campy but really <UNK> the main character is one we can identify and at least have some sympathy for the <UNK> murphy character of the early movie really evokes no sympathy and is too self righteous without motivation br br the character in this movie follows the lines of a true anti hero there is motivation and a method to his madness we never feel he is truly right but we can understand where he comes from br br there is plenty of action in the movie there is also some humor one good scene is when the heroine tells the hero she wouldn't lie to him and he <UNK> that over br br this movie succeeds in doing what film makers have been trying to do for decades this director and writer team got it right br br recommended complete success
<START> hard to believe perhaps but this film was <UNK> as <UNK> from more <UNK> than any other film produced prior to the <UNK> of the <UNK> hayes code yes indeed priests actually told their <UNK> that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin br br i'm not making this up they had several reasons as follows br br item jane likes sex she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their <UNK> shelter she stretches <UNK> and with a <UNK> look she says tarzan you've been a bad boy so they've not only been having sex they've been having kinky sex a few years later under the <UNK> code people especially women weren't supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex br br item jane prefers a <UNK> if wise and <UNK> savage tarzan to a <UNK> respectable nine to five man holt when holt at first <UNK> her with a pretty dress from london she <UNK> a bit when holt tries to kill tarzan and holt and jane both believe he's dead she <UNK> a lot but when she realizes her man is very much alive the <UNK> of civilization <UNK> for her and why not <UNK> and jane's relationship is <UNK> he lacks the <UNK> <UNK> that would <UNK> him to <UNK> himself as the head of his wife to boot he lacks many more <UNK> <UNK> for example jealousy when holt and his buddy arrive tarzan <UNK> them both <UNK> knowing perfectly well that holt is jane's old flame when holt gets her <UNK> up in a london dress and is slow dancing with her to a <UNK> <UNK> tarzan drops out of a tree and draws his knife jealous nope he's merely <UNK> toward the weird music machine since he's never seen one before once it's explained he's cool br br item <UNK> holt is dirty minded savage tarzan is <UNK> sexy as jane slips into <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> holt gets off on watching her <UNK> as she changes into the fancy dress by contrast after tarzan <UNK> pulls the dress off kicks her into the swimming hole and <UNK> in after her there follows the most <UNK> erotic nude scene in all cinema the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water ballet the scene was filmed in three versions <UNK> topless and nude the scene was cut prior to the film's release but the nude version is restored in the video now available and when jane emerges and <UNK> the <UNK> steals her dress just for a <UNK> jane makes it clear that her <UNK> is only because of the <UNK> of <UNK> men and their <UNK> where is the universal <UNK> so dear to the hearts of <UNK> nowhere that's where another reason why the hung up regarded this film as <UNK> br br item the notion that man is the crown of creation and animals are here only for man's use and comfort takes a severe beating holt and his buddy want to be guided to the elephant graveyard so they can scoop up the <UNK> and take it home they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard you reader are thinking fat chance and you're right he's shocked he <UNK> elephants sleep which to him explains everything jane explains <UNK> feelings which the two gentlemen find ridiculous br br item jane the ex <UNK> woman is far more <UNK> than the two <UNK> men she <UNK> holt and buddy blow it and find themselves <UNK> by hostile <UNK> and wild animals it is jane who maintains her cool while the boys panic she takes charge <UNK> orders at them and passes out the <UNK> br br item jane's costume is a sort of <UNK> with nothing underneath the original idea was for her to be topless with <UNK> artistically <UNK> off her <UNK> which indeed is the case in one brief scene br br lastly several men of the cloth complained because the film was called tarzan and his mate rather than tarzan and his wife no comment br br of course tarzan who has been <UNK> back to health by his ape friends comes to the rescue <UNK> the white hunters and <UNK> the pack elephants and african <UNK> to return the <UNK> they stole to the sacred place <UNK> it came the end br br so there you have it an utterly <UNK> film like all the other films about complex and interesting women see e g possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey which <UNK> such a flowing genre in the early 30's and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the <UNK> of the <UNK> code br br the <UNK> de <UNK> of this film is best expressed by jane's soprano version of the famous tarzan yell a nice touch which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions br br let's hear it for artistic freedom feminist jane and sex
<START> when i went to watch this movie my expectations were really low but i was pleasantly surprised br br i thought i was going to watch a boring teen flick but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed the acting was somewhat convincing especially from <UNK> who really shows his talent in this movie and the fight scenes were for a low budget movie very well done br br i think this movie deserves a <UNK> audience than it has received it is a movie which can be seen by the whole family maybe not the smallest of kids since it contains some rather rough scenes a movie about love and the problems that can occur when you go against your family traditions br br yes the movie is very much like bend it like beckham but i actually think this movie pulls it off better
<START> i really like this film when i started to watch it i thought i would get bored pretty soon but it surprised me i thought it was a great film and have seen it a few times now the characters are believable and i have to say that i fell in love with brian austin green all over again the first time being beverly hills <UNK> i would recommend this film if you are a fan of his but i do agree with another comment made earlier that the ending is sort of disappointing i would have loved it to turn out a little different never mind though good gripping story
<START> life <UNK> is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard the acting is rather amateurish at best the special effects are obviously low budget but not too bad the story line is rather stock but with an interesting twist computer run amok but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable for me at least part of the <UNK> of this movie is the prominent role of <UNK> <UNK> she may not be the greatest actress in the world but having been a former <UNK> of the month she is cute enough in all life <UNK> is much like other low budget sci fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable br br the white star lines bit is cute if completely inaccurate the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the <UNK> lines <UNK> and the last ship to <UNK> under the white star colors was the <UNK> not the sister of titanic which was sold for <UNK> in 1960
<START> the fury of the <UNK> is a very good film that has a good cast which includes paul naschy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mark stevens francisco <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the acting by all of these actors is very good the <UNK> is really cool he looks great and he sound like the looney tunes character the <UNK> devil there are some really hilarious scenes in this film the thrills is really good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed very good the music is good the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end this is a very good and thrilling film if you like paul naschy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mark stevens francisco <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the cast in the film <UNK> films horror sci fi thrillers dramas and interesting classic films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today br br movie <UNK> note br br i got this film on a special dvd that has doctor <UNK> coffin the <UNK> and the fury of the <UNK> from vintage home entertainment see if you can find this winner with three bizarre but classic films on one dvd at amazon com today br br if you like werewolf films i strongly recommend these werewolf of london <UNK> the wolf man 1941 frankenstein meets the wolf man 1943 house of frankenstein 1944 <UNK> an d <UNK> meets frankenstein 1948 the curse of the werewolf <UNK> an american werewolf in london 1981 silver bullet 1985 werewolf 1987 the monster squad 1987 my mom's a werewolf 1989 project <UNK> 1995 bad moon 1996 werewolf 1996 dog soldiers 2002 underworld 2003 and van <UNK> 2004
<START> i thought that my favorite martian was very boring and drawn out it was not funny at all the audience just sat through the whole movie and didn't laugh at all not even the kids laughed that is sad for a disney movie i thought they could have found somebody better to play the martian rather than christopher lloyd he was really stupid and he was not funny i thought the talking suit was really dumb in the original television series the suit doesn't talk and move around in my opinion they should not have wasted their time on this movie i give it two <UNK> down really a waste of time and i would not recommend the movie to anybody thank you
<START> thankfully saw this on a plane to <UNK> recently thought i'd missed it at the <UNK> <UNK> paris je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films about 5 mins each by 20 directors showing love in various <UNK> of contemporary paris br br one of my <UNK> segments is <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> great expectations harry potter and the prisoner of <UNK> which was done in one continuous shot and features nick nolte br br the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> starring steve <UNK> as a tourist in the <UNK> was hilarious juliette <UNK> and willem dafoe in <UNK> des <UNK> was haunting br br for maggie <UNK> as an american actress <UNK> in <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> to have portrayed anticipation and <UNK> in such a short period of time was just brilliant br br <UNK> wood as a vampire victim in <UNK> de la <UNK> was pretty surreal while emily <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> played a cute couple in wes craven's <UNK> <UNK> br br natalie portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually <UNK> french boy in <UNK> saint <UNK> but despite the many portrayals of young love a more mature execution by gena rowlands in <UNK> <UNK> was equally <UNK> inducing br br this movie is perfect for those with <UNK> because each sequence is driven and carefully thought of br br there are also a number of memorable quotes one in particular is this one from a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days in pretending to be a man in love he became a man in love
<START> long before tim <UNK> and jerry b <UNK> would shake the world of the christian <UNK> and make millions in the process with the left behind books mark iv pictures the christian film distribution company of the billy graham <UNK> association gave us this <UNK> what i love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail sitting in a living room instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this post rapture <UNK> we sit in the living room hearing about it on the news because the filmmakers can't afford to show it the film's premise is grounded in pre <UNK> pre <UNK> <UNK> believing that christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth what used to <UNK> me in junior high now makes me laugh the intriguing adventures of patty and her journey throughout the <UNK> and two of the film's three sequels tells her remarkable story of <UNK> and ultimately <UNK> i hate to admit it but i still thoroughly enjoy watching this it even has the same exact score of monty python and the holy grail i think i'm the only person in history to make that observation
<START> a chinese <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> the arrogant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> around the emperor in pre war japan is accused of being a <UNK> and <UNK> for life his loving wife who supports totally her husband and his ideas is left alone to save her family from <UNK> this movie is a huge statue <UNK> in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind <UNK> <UNK> is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she didn't get an asian oscar for the best female role in 2009 it went to a young girl with very limited acting potential br br this deeply moving and most <UNK> feature is a must see for all <UNK> <UNK> on earth
<START> first off i would like to say that i am a fan of chris rock i like his other movies but this movie is just like my summary the biggest sack of crap ever in the beginning chris rock plays an aspiring comedian who get stage fright at a comedy building called the apollo on his way home from a gig while riding his bike he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a truck a little while later he chooses the body of an old white and selfish millionaire then he dresses up like the music group <UNK> while trying to replay the scene from the original where he comes out as a <UNK> second he goes back to the apollo and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body and starts <UNK> the white population and tries to be black do you get my drift this movie is awful it tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out looking like a sack of crap just take my advice don't even watch this movie
<START> i did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a welles box set i had recently purchased a box set i <UNK> got because i wanted to own a man for all seasons and to also re <UNK> <UNK> so i stick orson and rita in the player and i'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure br br on the surface the story seemed a simple one man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband and then br br well it becomes murder mystery of plotted <UNK> and much <UNK> michael o'hara orson welles himself doesn't really know what is going on he is as confused as the viewer is and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as elsa <UNK> rita hayworth has its moments but you just know that things are going to go <UNK> shaped br br so many wonderful things in the film it has welles visual style all over it see a scene in an <UNK> that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is <UNK> on the eye the narration from o'hara is <UNK> self mocking and we get good light relief by way of a court case with everett sloane considerably lighting up proceedings br br yet the film is an <UNK> and in fact it's a choppy viewing experience because as i was to find out after studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer but unfair on welles' vision i'm positive that a full original cut of this film would have been <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as it is tho we have a very good and intriguing film one that sadly only hints at greatness but remains a <UNK> engrossing film that i'm glad i own to <UNK> further 8 5 10
<START> i would strongly recommend this film for any musical fan whose been dying to see a musical make a faithful transition from stage to screen sure it's long but it's length is a <UNK> to how true to the original musical script the film is being the sets and cast really make sweet apple <UNK> the place to be <UNK> <UNK> anne <UNK> also does a splendid job with choreography giving the dances a nice small town period feel br br the casting at a glance may look strange to some but they really are <UNK> marvelous reading <UNK> 's comments on jason <UNK> performance made me sick in fact his <UNK> literally steals the show as albert he mixes his own unique blend of manic <UNK> with dick van dyke <UNK> charm to create a new and improved albert the fact that he can dance and sing like <UNK> business <UNK> hurt either george <UNK> is another stand out who <UNK> upon paul <UNK> take on harry <UNK> by making him less manic and more down to earth and strict his whole character and body language scream over my dead body marc <UNK> takes the elvis aspect of conrad <UNK> to new heights with his subtle <UNK> of a thank you very much in honestly sincere his <UNK> though <UNK> back more to young elvis then the <UNK> <UNK> conrad of the original film the fact is that this movie <UNK> so greatly from the original film which added drawn in <UNK> faces <UNK> on speed and the russian ballet what did any of <UNK> have to do with bye bye <UNK> i wonder the only possible advantage the original version has over this one is ann <UNK> otherwise the update is better in every possible way where the old version cut many songs and <UNK> dance breaks <UNK> there was no need for them and for all <UNK> and purposes ended the movie in the middle of the play the new version has restored the original music score and has added some great new stuff as well a giant step being the standout in that category we know live in trying times but if you want to get your mind off your troubles and put on a happy face then this is one worth checking out
<START> i remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to <UNK> it all came <UNK> back why this hasn't had a video or dvd release yet it's <UNK> that this <UNK> of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been in fact this is the one john carpenter film that hasn't been released in fact i haven't seen it on the tv either since the day i watched it kurt russell was the perfect choice for the role of elvis this is definitely a role he was born to play john carpenter's break from horror brought this gem that i'd love the tv to play again it is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes <UNK> out most of <UNK> greatest hits with gusto i think this also was the film that formed the <UNK> with russell and carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies escape from new york the thing big trouble in little china and escape from l a someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life which i feel would not only <UNK> the king but also ruin the magic that this one has if this doesn't get released then we are gonna be in <UNK> hotel
<START> i saw this movie and at times i was <UNK> believing this movie <UNK> me ' <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> for years to come re watch star wars don't watch <UNK> br br as a responsible parent i'm speaking to those who are parents now i you would not let my your child ever <UNK> of this video festival of the pseudo occult to <UNK> <UNK> is satanic to a co viewer is likely to <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> ' he is <UNK> alien <UNK> and wholly <UNK> like the <UNK> man made flesh invisible to adults <UNK> children with <UNK> they could never afford without the <UNK> made possible by years of self denial and <UNK> <UNK> he is a <UNK> of easy answers and false ideals he is everything the morally conscious viewer is not he is the devil's own ron <UNK> br br i pray i mean this literally and <UNK> with an emphasis on the former that this movie has not made the format jump to dvd it is my hope that this type of <UNK> film <UNK> died an un <UNK> death in the cold nights of 1994 br br <UNK> also loves pizza i forgot to mention that it comes up a lot
<START> if you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty <UNK> you'll enjoy d war if you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films you'll enjoy d war otherwise don't bother i saw the movie today with my <UNK> and 3 of their friends they really loved it and that made me feel good after the movie was over all the kids my <UNK> and their friends could not stop <UNK> me for taking them to the theater br br the cg is good acting and directing are horrible storyline is extremely simple but since the half of the audience was kids they were screaming shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen this made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been br br it's a good movie to take your kids to but except for the final battle sequence d war is disappointing i give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much
<START> i am shocked shocked and <UNK> that the <UNK> of you imdb users who voted before me have not given this film a rating of higher than 7 7 that's a c if i could give <UNK> a 20 i'd gladly do it this film ranks high <UNK> the <UNK> of modern comedy alongside half baked and <UNK> as one of the most hilarious films of all time if you know anything about rap music you must see this if you know nothing about rap music learn something and then see this comparisons to <UNK> <UNK> fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film if you liked bob roberts you'll love this watch it and vote it a 10
<START> so where are the cannibals those intrigued by the title and the <UNK> <UNK> appeal of this film will be let down instead we are shown a strange man and his re visiting of a <UNK> new guinea village full of natives one of whom was his lover several decades prior the man <UNK> <UNK> is new york jewish as they come and somehow this is <UNK> with the documentary as he appears in his <UNK> in several scenes br br there are no real cannibals here only stories <UNK> by some of the natives and by <UNK> himself not all together a bad film very interesting and great cinematography <UNK> remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from western civilization as one can get br br it's just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary br br 4 out of 10 kids
<START> this is arguably the best film director <UNK> <UNK> made until now a skilled tv director well trained in story telling and in directing his actors through long epics he tried to catch in this very low budget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the <UNK> live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks resulting in <UNK> lives each character trying to live his own life to watch and control the other while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure by political and historical forces well beyond his control some call this destiny but destiny has a very <UNK> representation in this film br br there is no explicit political saying in <UNK> characters never discuss politics not even at the level of saying <UNK> ' when they hear that a new terror attack happens their reaction to events is to <UNK> the attack and to count the victims using the official and media <UNK> for the dead and the wounded they do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb and waiting for the next one to happen personal social professional life seems to work <UNK> but is deeply flawed and influenced by events the main character played by the director is a playwright whose mid life personal and creative crisis is <UNK> by the pressure of the events and by the fact that he is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes he hires a private detective to follow his girlfriend who is a tv <UNK> reporter whom he suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show another failed man former military whose business and family life <UNK> under the events he starts to write a play that <UNK> copies the reality and will bring it to the stage in theater in film scene that reminds hamlet as well as <UNK> new <UNK> it's not that i would dare suspect charlie kaufman looking over the shoulder of <UNK> he certainly needs not that but the israeli director screen is brilliant into <UNK> the later film and the first directed by kaufman as in the american film actors play real persons and start <UNK> with them in an reality meets stage meets reality <UNK> which never lacks logic at least not artistic logic br br <UNK> directs his actors with the usual talent <UNK> them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them his style is much more free here than in his tv series and the <UNK> effects although borrowed from american horror movies work pretty well all over the ending seemed to me a little <UNK> and unsatisfying dramatically but the <UNK> of the <UNK> killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a <UNK> loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film
<START> i was surprised at how fascinating this movie was the performances were extremely good especially by rea as the compassionate no nonsense detective br br despite a low budget no big fx or flashy <UNK> citizen x somehow manages to <UNK> the majority of similar big hollywood films by just telling the story br br true stories tend to end with a <UNK> rather than a bang and that's the case here but apart from that this is a highly recommended detective yarn
<START> just read the original story which is written by <UNK> in 18th century strikingly the movie <UNK> the original spirit very well though the plot was <UNK> tremendously the film language the rhythm the special effect are all from hollywood but still there is a chinese core it is amazing how <UNK> tsui managed to combine them together the result is pure beauty
<START> all the elements for a bad night at the movies are in place dialog <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sets <UNK> wood acting a horrific late '80s <UNK> score and an overall look that suggests anything on the sci fi <UNK> programming schedule circa 1993 though <UNK> starts off with a lot of promise the film <UNK> into bland idiocy and mst3k style cheese as clark kent wannabe <UNK> peter <UNK> gene <UNK> is <UNK> into releasing information on his <UNK> projects but when he <UNK> his vague experiment on himself he transforms into a vaguely defined creature that bears more than a passing resemblance to <UNK> <UNK> from house by the cemetery the fx work is fairly good for such an obviously low budget production though i suspect most of it is kept in shadow for a reason but overall <UNK> leaves a bad retro <UNK> in your guts in spite of its hopes to <UNK> us otherwise i can't help but agree with one character's closing remark it was a nightmare from the past
<START> i don't have much to add to what has been said before but it's very much a film of it's time and the first and likely only time that the studio hung the film totally on the dead end kids br br the <UNK> gave the boys plenty of help from director ray <UNK> and an <UNK> budget to an almost magical cast of supporting actors at every turn we get one of those gem performances from real pros they are too many to list but it seems like just about everybody on the <UNK> lot sans the very biggest stars walk through this picture see if you can spot john <UNK> br br the only over the top performance is from the always reliable <UNK> <UNK> as a mob boss with a <UNK> complex he plays this character almost exactly like that of the <UNK> leader in gunga din he's something to watch and <UNK> main is excellent and gets her best role since dead end br br my <UNK> for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like city for conquest br br <UNK> for <UNK>
<START> john waters most accessible film to date is one of his better ones considering it cut down on all of the <UNK> and outright <UNK> which seem to <UNK> most of his previous work sure the nudity and the sexual references are still there at least it is presented in a fashion br br that cannot be deemed too foul or disgusting due to some great casting choices this film really brought out the silliness associated with modern art and the <UNK> nature of your modern artist funny and somewhat lighthearted if that is possible for waters this is one of those films i would watch on a rainy day
<START> just what we need another remake of vintage hollywood cinema with eddie murphy miscast again in his second time around after the nutty professor 1996 this shows why we're running out of special ideas in making a quality movie ladies and gentlemen it has some signs of hope for its likeable and delightful imagery of animals who can act and speak with humans things can only get more worse unfortunately bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of family <UNK> instantly even parents and children saw the trailer ad on the family channel which was followed by utter angst and disgust in the movie theater sad to say this is the more <UNK> pre millennium era but enjoy it while it lasts 'cause things can only get worse with time more went wrong with the all new dr <UNK> it is absolutely <UNK> feeling too flat i also hate that irritating voice of chris rock we need more talented voice overs than a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> who don't want to <UNK> <UNK> i'll have to agree on my local newspaper giving this among the top five worst movies of 1998 then again the original version wasn't any good either murphy's next project could be <UNK> if he's not careful
<START> when the grinch came out i was excited though i thought it was going to be a happy go lucky film and it was though it did have a little nightmare before christmas touch to it you know kind of dark and spooky i loved this film because it helped fill people with the christmas spirit so mostly the grinch saved christmas and what happened then well in <UNK> they say that the <UNK> small heart grew three <UNK> that day merry <UNK>
<START> sensual and tough maria <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> marries a soldier in the middle of world war ii and spends a half of day and the whole night with him that's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison she carries on with her life becomes a successful <UNK> being not only sensual but intelligent ambitious and willing to use sex whenever or wherever necessary i don't know a thing about business but i do know what german women want you might even say i'm an expert on it while climbing up to the success she always remembers her husband <UNK> her man and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him for their future happy life together maria <UNK> 's style reminds much of <UNK> by <UNK> favorite hollywood director douglas sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in <UNK> germany <UNK> <UNK> literally shines in every scene of the movie and she is fantastic br br 8 5 10
<START> i went to see this movie with the most positive expectations i had seen <UNK> previous movie march of the <UNK> and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio however i was severely disappointed most of all this movie is terribly boring literally nothing happens i tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend and we both ended up laughing because i could only <UNK> things like well then the winter comes and then spring and then there's an eagle and a river and one time it is dark and the girl goes into a cave and another time the fox has babies and so on after about half an hour i began <UNK> <UNK> rolling my eyes <UNK> the reviewer at the radio station and hoping that it would be over soon but the movie went on and on when it finally ended i had <UNK> so deep into my chair that i must have looked somewhat similar to stephen <UNK> the most annoying parts of the movie are a the girl who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with she wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie one year and shows exactly two facial expressions joy and seriousness she is cute no question about that however a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all too human presence i found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear <UNK> in the river or something similarly terrible b the commentary by the girl's adult voice which tells us nothing but <UNK> obvious boring redundant things c the music which is desperately lacking subtlety when the girl is happily jumping around the music jumps around too when the fox is threatened by an eagle the music becomes threatening too it reminded me of the very early days of film making and was just too predictable to enjoy admittedly many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it at least they got somehow involved thus my warning concerns adults only if you are over ten years old avoid this movie you can get a better and cheaper sleep in most other places
<START> watching this movie is like eating a <UNK> of nothing but <UNK> it initially looks great but ultimately provides no satisfaction none br br the plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil so how is it possible that with this basic plot and robin williams that the movie still turns out so badly it's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever much like the terrible <UNK> picture williams did at the beginning of his film career the film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there wasn't enough money left over to hire writers who had <UNK> grade school br br the film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on i really am unsure why it was made in the first place it certainly wasn't made to provide any sort of entertainment
<START> the basic plot in this movie isn't bad a lady makes it big and comes back to her <UNK> <UNK> to be <UNK> but despite good acting by robert young and eve <UNK> the movie is a mess the blame for this i place on either joan crawford or the director or both as her performance is just awful instead of being a real person she does a wonderful <UNK> of a deer caught in the <UNK> in other words she stares off into space and has a <UNK> i am <UNK> stunned expression after just a few minutes it really became annoying for me now this is certainly not the only crawford film i dislike for her performance as she had done more than her share of overacting in films such as johnny guitar or many of her later films such as <UNK> my advice is to try a different crawford film there certainly were better
<START> i was <UNK> over the list of films of richard burton when i came to this title that i recall vividly from when i first saw it on cable in 1982 i remember dialogue from <UNK> <UNK> that was just amazingly bad i remember richard <UNK> character looking so hopelessly lost and then remembering how his motivations didn't translate to me in short i remember circle of two because it was so <UNK> awful br br this movie came out at a time when america was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with <UNK> or <UNK> angles on teenage sexuality recall the blue <UNK> and other brooke <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> little <UNK> beau <UNK> and other films that just seemed to <UNK> on teens having sex particularly with adults as a teenager during this time i found the obsession combined with the sexual <UNK> of the 70's and 80's made for a <UNK> unsettling environment in which to figure it all out so to speak br br circle of two is not <UNK> acted or needlessly <UNK> like blue <UNK> in fact it <UNK> the question of love between the young and the old in a brave if totally failed way but honestly it is one of those films you will never see if you didn't see it on its first run because it was so truly awful no one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be <UNK> distributed again
<START> first off i want to say thanks disney for finally releasing the cinderella movie on dvd now you have all the disney animated films on dvd including the 1999 limited <UNK> what are you going to do next you're going to disney world well technically i mean look at the castle br br anyways disney remains magical in his 1950 animated classic film cinderella the movie that put fairy tale movies on the map we are all familiar with the story of cinderella her <UNK> her date the glass <UNK> the <UNK> that turns into a <UNK> just for saying <UNK> <UNK> boo and of course trying to head home by midnight br br what i like about this film it's a grand old fairy tale that children like now in a movie form as well as on dvd as well br br cinderella thank you disney 10 stars
<START> this had to be one of the worst films ever when kate shows up and jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start <UNK> so hollywood another bad scene was when kate was running her hands over the <UNK> it appeared that she was <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> acting is so bad in this film i could not connect with them or feel there love for each other the other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed <UNK> anyway this was such a campy movie i usually like these type of films but i just couldn't get into this film too many unlikely situations and again <UNK> acting didn't help the film also she is all <UNK> <UNK> must put her makeup on with a <UNK> knife because she looks glamorous in the <UNK>
<START> i love korean films because they have the ability to really quiet <UNK> really capture real life i tend to watch korean movies just for that reason alone i've seen this directors other movies before the one that comes closest to the feelings i got from this is <UNK> and another awesome film called this charming girl br br however my title summary is supposed to be from a <UNK> perspective so i'll just start doing that instead of just <UNK> it with praise br br for a non christian perspective director chang <UNK> lee has captured an <UNK> and almost <UNK> real portrayal of a modern <UNK> church regardless of <UNK> <UNK> and all i've always been waiting for a christian film that truly portrays the darker <UNK> of church life because christian films tend to speak in a language that is different to those they want to share their faith to many films with religious undertones though having good motives tend to just have the <UNK> of a disney film or after school special they need to show life as it is real people curse real people lust real people fall and though christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life and do <UNK> <UNK> character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman that found god but because of life's bitter realities loses that love for him she once had she doesn't deny god exists it is just that she refuses to accept to live with the idea that he is an all loving and <UNK> god br br in her decent to the edges of morality and madness her character asks questions that are in the mind of every one religious or not br br if god is love why does he allow such terrible things to happen this film doesn't answer that rightly so and i believe the last 10 minutes of the film though open to interpretation leaves us with a hopeful future for our main character and brings the idea of secret sunshine full circle br br i don't believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had in any way tried and set out to be that there in lies the reason why it worked even more it's real it's honest and because of that it is by far the best <UNK> of a real christian life i have seen on film
<START> i grew up on scooby doo where are you and i still love it it is one of my favourite cartoons along with <UNK> duck <UNK> peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry this show though is good for kids the voices are good don <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are perfect as scooby and shaggy the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation however it is rather disappointing i normally don't mind <UNK> but when he appears to be like the main character it gets annoying fast complete with the <UNK> puppy power <UNK> is somewhat more annoying than usual also half the gang are missing after the first year somehow it didn't feel like scooby doo and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal very little chasing monsters or <UNK> the baddies all in all not as bad as shaggy and scooby doo get a clue but this show is disappointing 4 10 for the animation voices theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids <UNK> cox
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> short film entitled the great train robbery bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and <UNK> that one <UNK> to be blown away by another <UNK> early film just like <UNK> a trip to the moon critics have <UNK> this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema in my eyes they were right it had everything from the planning the actual heist of the train the murder of an <UNK> <UNK> and that <UNK> final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business  it was all monumental for its time from here to eastwood every western filmmaker has used <UNK> image in some form or another to create their own story one cannot say that this film didn't open the door but the struggle comes from the story itself the genre was defined by porter but outside of its initial excitement  there really isn't anything to <UNK> onto perhaps i am jaded by the cliché modern westerns and their <UNK> messages but how can something be cliché before being cliché to me the great train robbery seemed forced <UNK> and <UNK> br br unlike <UNK> porter tells a very linear story robbers change the course of a train rob it then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains and the final scene ends like any <UNK> film without any surprises or <UNK> and that <UNK> man with a gun to your proverbial face it is bland <UNK> film is boring in the edition i watched there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion which felt cheap and was not <UNK> to the filmmaker or to the viewer the issue remains that while it is important <UNK> film has been borrowed time and time again it has in effect become <UNK> the story itself does not carry the emotional <UNK> it once has unlike <UNK> early film i cannot watch this again i know what has happened i know there is very little missing from behind the scenes and that finally it is just what it has set out to be  a simple story leading from point a to point b to point c this issue is not only my <UNK> with this film but also the strongest element to see in such an early film while it was dull the fact that it told such a strong narrative  that our characters were characters with motives and drives was outstanding to see in an era where <UNK> films seemed mainstream this broke the mold again not that i am jumping on the <UNK> <UNK> about this film  it is an important film  it just isn't a great film br br overall i was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted but i was equally as happy to leave this film behind porter is a talented director and g m anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field but i just wasn't in awe of the film i wasn't expecting big budget effects like <UNK> work nor was i expecting a <UNK> of a trip to the moon but i did want to see the same creativity exploration and originality i felt porter played it safe if that can be said with such an early film but i couldn't feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds i wasn't rooting for anyone and the final conclusion proved that the <UNK> <UNK> of it had worn off minutes after the film started it was <UNK> but not monumental the great train robbery has lost its space in the time capsule of cinema br br grade out of
<START> this is one of my all time favorite films and while it may move too slowly for some it's well worth seeing a corporate lawyer richard chamberlain is dragged into a case involving city <UNK> and this is no ordinary case ok a man has died but it wasn't exactly a normal killing there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic oppressive the <UNK> are <UNK> a secret and refuse to <UNK> the <UNK> this has a lot to do with white men making <UNK> about city vs <UNK> <UNK> and of course no <UNK> in the big city would practice <UNK> ways uh huh chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what's happening although no matter how many times i've seen this i can't quite grasp the exact connection this is a very eerie and creepy film and is a fine example of peter <UNK> ability to create tension out of nothing the ending is a little ambiguous but i take it literally it's the <UNK> way out and the scariest 10 out of 10 and highly recommended
<START> bruce almighty is the best jim carrey work since the truman show and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent hey hollywood look how good i can act box office <UNK> it's great to see jim <UNK> and <UNK> his strengths he won't get an academy award but the film itself will last longer than many of the awarded films of the academy he is at the top of his form in this most recent film it's like the return of an old friend br br carrey freeman and aniston all do a great job together comfortable in their comedy roles superb comic timing and obviously having fun together but without the hey mom look how funny i am type of comedy a real surprise was steven <UNK> as <UNK> nemesis <UNK> of the daily show fame who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film i laughed harder at carell than anyone else in the past three years br br i can <UNK> the religious nuts in the us will be up in arms over the treatment of god but the bottom line of the film is true to all major <UNK> beliefs we are masses of <UNK> trying to get through our short lives by <UNK> our free will without married with children t o complain about this will likely become a target of people with misplaced <UNK> who know the types men <UNK> in gold watches on sunday morning and late <UNK> television selling <UNK> to god and again about 0 5 of the country will care and 80 of the media will report it br br the bottom line this a purely entertaining film each audience member <UNK> wondering what they would do and a feel good feeling at the movie conclusion a walk down any major street in america has to confirm that god has a tremendous sense of humor what better comic genius to remind us of that than jim carry br br thanks again jim it's great to have you back
<START> i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst the gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially <UNK> it's even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top <UNK> russo plays her role wonderfully feminine usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw man villain but the only <UNK> is the gorilla it's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really can't treat them just like people because they aren't not many films venture into this territory and it's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human animal similarity
<START> that kid a is such a babe this movie was no <UNK> a e of which it is in many ways <UNK> after but still came off as entertaining the fact this lost to a piece of monkey crap like tomb <UNK> makes wanna cry includes some of the most entertaining characters i've seen in disney film
<START> tom hanks like you've never seen him before hanks plays michael sullivan the angel of death he is a <UNK> for his surrogate father john rooney paul newman an elderly irish mob boss <UNK> young son tyler <UNK> witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of <UNK> wife and other son enter jude law as a reporter photographer willing to kill sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead <UNK> filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30's sometimes the pace <UNK> down but then a burst of graphic violence <UNK> the story director sam <UNK> directs this powerful drama about loyalty responsibility betrayal and the bonding of a <UNK> man and his young son other notable cast members are dylan baker stanley <UNK> daniel craig and jennifer jason leigh hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie make room for some oscars
<START> blows my mind how this movie got made i watched it while i worked at home writing <UNK> and answering the phone i only watched it because i hoped the revenge part would be good needless to say the revenge and the forced plot twists were not worth the <UNK> during which they were watched in fact i'm not even sure what happened at the end any more the acting was as bad as re <UNK> scenarios on the fbi files show by far the worst re <UNK> really only arrest and trial can possibly be as bad at re <UNK> i didn't even know that the leading man was in third eye blind until i looked the movie up here on imdb but its obvious why he hasn't made any movies since i hope he is a good singer
<START> i cannot comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema i first encountered movies at the end of wwii through roger <UNK> splendid penguin book film which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to re read today my introduction to many classics films such as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> magnificent documentary metropolis the <UNK> of dr <UNK> and ecstasy came first through this book and later at my university art house cinema ecstasy had <UNK> the wrath of the <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> her subsequent divorce and the brief swim she took in the buff but roger <UNK> ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a <UNK> <UNK> beautiful visual <UNK> to love a view <UNK> by many imdb users a very lonely young man when i saw it i willingly <UNK> no further opportunity to see ecstasy <UNK> until the introduction of home videos by then it had become a <UNK> memory not to be disturbed quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this <UNK> very superficial ecstasy is much more of a <UNK> on the continuity of human existence against which individual lives are insignificant perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> used to term 'the <UNK> br br ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong disappointed she returns home and <UNK> him soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young <UNK> man she meets whilst out horse riding she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience her former husband cannot face <UNK> and gives the young man a lift in his car <UNK> that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to <UNK> at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself after these exciting <UNK> sequences a bland predictable and almost inevitable ending <UNK> that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy <UNK> life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through <UNK> to this stream can we be truly happy this story is trite the acting is no more than adequate and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage as did most of its <UNK> long ago what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction coupled with something <UNK> but in cinematographic terms very important it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film it is sub titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub titles and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch the <UNK> in the tale is <UNK> continuously but so subtly that only when <UNK> after viewing does one become fully aware of it for example the names eva and adam the obsessive behavior of <UNK> on his wedding night which shows that <UNK> have become the most important thing in his life and <UNK> his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery a <UNK> <UNK> a flower a key entering a lock a breaking <UNK> during <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sequence with adam etc and the final post suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to <UNK> the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to society as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on br br as a 1933 film i would rate this at 9 even comparing it with contemporary works i would not <UNK> this below 8 for me the film will always remain a must see although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment unfortunately in north america contemporary <UNK> of this film have been distorted by the extreme 1930's reaction to hedy <UNK> very brief and relatively <UNK> nude scene which she had difficulty living down in hollywood some critics who have clearly not seen such classic films as <UNK> <UNK> back to god's country bird of paradise or some of the early works of d w <UNK> and c b demille have even <UNK> referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film this scene was probably part of the original novel and the film would have been very little different if the director had chosen to rewrite it br br two further thoughts firstly this is a czech film released there in 1933 its final message about hard work <UNK> positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of nazi <UNK> and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations i do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when i first saw this film were they removed from the copy i saw then secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very <UNK> even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime we should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our <UNK>
<START> jane eyre has always been my favorite novel when i stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90's i was <UNK> this is the best and most complete version of the book on film this version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it timothy dalton is amazing as rochester i was glad that they cast a normal looking actress zelah clark as jane and not a glamorous person i love the sets and the location for anyone who is a true jane eyre fan this is the version to watch for those of you who are interested i just found this version on dvd i have watched my vhs copy almost to breaking so i was thrilled to find it on dvd
<START> i hated this crap every friday as part of <UNK> it was on and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week if you want to see something funny go watch no on would tell starring <UNK> cameron and fred savage it really is hilarious shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible tv show this show really makes me sick i hate those kids and bob <UNK> needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this <UNK> i've seen <UNK> stuff everywhere else but here i <UNK> writing 10 lines watch <UNK> <UNK> to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment
<START> having seen men behind the sun i guess i hoped for an evolution in style technique to match the larger scale of this movie i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard hitting fact based <UNK> account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocities but this is not it this plays like a bottom to mid <UNK> european nazi exploitation movie from the 70s e g ss experiment camp etc perhaps more like <UNK> women of the special section actually granted it has a greater scope and more people running around but it <UNK> to the same cheap and <UNK> device of lots of hapless non actors <UNK> falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake <UNK> <UNK> up with the occasional poorly executed <UNK> sequence the admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power watch channel <UNK> 'the <UNK> aired recently still running as of 1 no 2006 for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the <UNK> of war featuring excellent in context use of actual footage this is the type of treatment the horror of <UNK> deserves not this hackneyed exploitation garbage a better executed exploitation movie minus the <UNK> use of stock footage would have been fine but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie rating 3 5 as exploitation 1 as a treatment of the subject
<START> this is an odd film for me as after i reviewed a nice film from a new film maker far out by phil <UNK> another writer director ryan <UNK> <UNK> me and asked me to watch and review his film the cure i don't normally review films this way but what the heck i love shorts and couldn't wait to see another br br interestingly while it turned out i did like the cure i was not thrilled by it and let <UNK> know to his credit he encouraged me to review it anyway giving it my honest <UNK> br br the film has tremendous style and as far as <UNK> direction goes it's exceptional especially for such an inexperienced film maker it's his first film the combination of exceptional choices of color pacing and music that well suited the film created a great sense of atmosphere you really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making however the thing i didn't love was some of the writing while the basic idea was great the ending was just too easy to <UNK> i really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist however considering that this film is from someone who shouldn't be able to make such a professional film given his experience it <UNK> well for his future good job
<START> one would think as i did that with steve martin goldie hawn and john <UNK> a movie should be at the very least decent these stars especially martin and <UNK> have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time br br well apparently i was grossly mistaken this is single <UNK> one of the worst movies i have ever seen it <UNK> my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny it <UNK> me to watch these talented actors <UNK> one of the most positively lame scripts i have had the misfortune to come across based solely on the big names i remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoever br br normally both with movies and in life i try to stay away from biased comments and broad <UNK> but with this film it's hard not to let loose i can count on one hand perhaps even two or three fingers major hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this this is easily one of the worst comedies ever made br br i tried to enjoy this i really did but the out of <UNK> ultimately fails miserably if you really want time efficient entertainment just take your money and watch it <UNK> as you <UNK> it down the toilet just please don't watch this movie
<START> let me being by saying the i followed watching this video by watching saw and after bleed saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though i thought it was only fairly good bleed is pretty bad the best part is seeing the female cast nude the gore is very fake looking and over done it has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and i didn't want to stay to see the horrible ending if i could i would <UNK> these actors and actresses the only reason being is that debbie <UNK> <UNK> has been in over a hundred other videos and i've also seen two other members of the cast in equally or worse motion pictures they should not allowed to continue this madness
<START> prolific and highly influential filmmaker martin scorsese <UNK> a selection of his favorite american films <UNK> according to three different types of directors the director as an <UNK> d w griffith or f w <UNK> who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward the director as a <UNK> filmmakers such as douglas sirk samuel fuller and mostly <UNK> minnelli directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films and the director as <UNK> those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hang ups like orson welles <UNK> von <UNK> charles chaplin nicholas ray stanley kubrick and arthur penn br br he shows us how the old studio system in hollywood was though oppressive the way in which film directors found themselves <UNK> the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations during his clips from the movies he shows us we not only discover films we've never seen before that <UNK> our interest but we also are made to see what he sees he <UNK> his <UNK> sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves br br the idea of a film <UNK> has been <UNK> as <UNK> hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make lists however <UNK> merely <UNK> the best and supporters of film <UNK> argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a <UNK> <UNK> of the best films a lot like a greatest hits tape if just as a beginning direction for film students all in all one's experience has shown that all writing about film including reviews function to <UNK> a film <UNK> some film <UNK> can definitely be <UNK> but others can be <UNK> as an example the internet movie <UNK> top 250 movies list includes many films included on several <UNK> film <UNK> but also features recent hollywood blockbusters at which many film <UNK> <UNK> like the dark knight which <UNK> <UNK> in the top ten amidst the first two godfather films <UNK> list and one flew over the <UNK> nest and the <UNK> of similar productions further down such as iron man sin city die hard the terminator and kill bill <UNK> 2 writer <UNK> taxi driver paul <UNK> has <UNK> referred to his <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> that this is positive br br scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political <UNK> but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of american cinema in both <UNK> <UNK> we see that there is really no particular virtue in either <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> concentrates all attention recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding that <UNK> could easily lead to self <UNK> much in the vein of the condescending work of jean luc godard or the <UNK> of the production practices of a filmmaker like michael <UNK> yet <UNK> <UNK> a belief of representative freedom as being only the <UNK> of the people's will as has been previously <UNK> about the all <UNK> <UNK> the people have about cinema <UNK> could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema one can only continue seeing films because it is a vital social and <UNK> practice and that's what martin scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us something which can't be told without being seen first hand
<START> in this truly fascinating dark film a young <UNK> student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money in return the devil takes his mirror image this is done brilliantly in the movie and <UNK> <UNK> when <UNK> the student is earlier practicing <UNK> in front of the mirror a visual metaphor for a man at war with himself which <UNK> his immediate future the student enjoys his money but the woman he loves is <UNK> he has made a <UNK> with the devil he is cut off forever from love and other <UNK> of the soul you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money you cannot have both <UNK> is haunted by his double the <UNK> express this beautifully as does the action some of the scenes are incredible the sense of doom when the devil disappears with <UNK> mirror image is amazing as is the sense that his <UNK> has forever cut him off from human society the scene where he runs away from his double and ends up in the <UNK> at the edge of the town no longer entirely human he has lost his soul he is like a hunted animal outside of human society there are so many other things to say about this incredible film paul <UNK> was an amazing actor and director a cultural hero of mine it helps if you know a bit about german history at the time this film was made and about german <UNK> tradition don't <UNK> it get a proper book just remember it's a very early film it's a little clumsy at times but considering what it has to say and it's tragic finale it's one of the best ever yes it is
<START> <UNK> <UNK> michael kitchen and <UNK> green wow what a trio ok so this is no anna <UNK> but it is a good love story very well written and well acted by all even a few <UNK> out <UNK> moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on <UNK> age bias and <UNK> aging <UNK> issues br br quirky guitar music added to the story as well br br while i have been a fan of ms <UNK> since <UNK> in the '70s and mr <UNK> since 'the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i have only recently discovered mr green <UNK> and mrs jones' <UNK> <UNK> etc making me ask the question why had i not seen <UNK> until recently admittedly more of a <UNK> <UNK> than something a man will sit through it is perfect for a rainy <UNK> lazy viewing
<START> short version seed isn't worthless it's just derivative and inferior and soulless br br long version if you have never seen any of the films <UNK> the vaguely defined psychological horror genre this movie will probably melt your face off maybe not but it will give you a good burn the opening montage of real animal abuse will be sufficient to open your eyes to possibilities of brutality on video and the only memorable gore scene later in the film will perhaps be more than you can handle the climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other film has br br but that's if you don't have much experience with the genre if you've seen the real thing august <UNK> <UNK> for example you will as i did find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the film br br other reviewers have compared this to the video <UNK> of old i understand this comparison like the video <UNK> seed is more violent than a mainstream horror film and less subtle but the reason the video <UNK> are still known to us is not only for the above reasons those that are still popular had something special <UNK> me to be ambiguous i think you will understand those that have stuck around had soul br br take this quote from <UNK> <UNK> director of burial ground on an interview on the new ish dvd we will never have more films like these because today technology has <UNK> imagination and technology is cold so many things will disappear because small films like these won't be produced anymore today we have great exceptional tricks that are very expensive but they are cold today a horror a terror film of this kind costs more than a million dollars these films were not so expensive they are real effects made with our hands br br perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison to old school horror so seriously but <UNK> has hit the nail on the head even at their most seemingly <UNK> the best of the video <UNK> were pursuing a primitive truth and this is where boll falls short it's like he's seen the movies and not understood them everything on the <UNK> is there <UNK> about making a statement about humanity an obscene torture scene etc but it is as <UNK> puts it cold the gore is all cgi the whole thing feels like scenes <UNK> together from other movies of various genres and the pacing is <UNK> slow man so slow br br another interesting note the one gore scene really reminded me of a video game br br anyway enough <UNK> weak movie
<START> this had high intellectual <UNK> the main lead <UNK> to give a deep meaningful rendering with voice over for his frames of mind naturally and he was certainly influenced by the fifties sixties method which when the script and the direction were worthwhile did give stunning results see <UNK> newman winters but here the story is abysmal besides it moves too slow you could edit at least 20 minutes including pointless flashbacks and the plot line would not be changed at times it's very <UNK> that bruce dern believes in his uncle character and his portraying often <UNK> on parody an interesting side is only <UNK> over the relationship young boy hero if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child when he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him some welcome <UNK> emerges but it's <UNK> and only the final scene returns to it br br word to the wise take <UNK> at close range instead it has two great actors christopher walken and sean penn together it's also an offbeat movie but it's gripping suspenseful here my <UNK> points <UNK> towards zero throughout
<START> the straight story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line he decides to make the trip on his <UNK> as he can't drive and he wants to make the rip by himself the film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way br br richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy <UNK> in an endearing performance as his daughter and harry dean <UNK> in a small but infinitely crucial role br br at first i felt that a story of an old <UNK> trip across the country side would be dull but i soon discovered that lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie i would recommend to anyone
<START> ok the portrayal of the stereotyped <UNK> in this story is just plain wrong i do agree that elvis looks rather good here but yeah his skin color does seem to change during the movie i was thinking ok he was never that <UNK> in real life it's some of the most obvious brown <UNK> makeup that i have ever seen it's as bad as the <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americans br br this movie is o k but typically lame story and mediocre songs like in all of <UNK> later films he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible i keep thinking <UNK> <UNK> that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out it is cool to see character actors joan blondell <UNK> <UNK> l q jones henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie though br br burgess <UNK> <UNK> makeup is absolutely awful it's the worst of the bunch for sure what were the filmmakers thinking was mr meredith doing this one just for the money or what i do love certain elvis movies though for example <UNK> me <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> las <UNK> i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv co stars mary tyler moore and ed <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> in which elvis plays an inner city doctor br br oh well at least elvis made a few good films but the mediocre and bad ones <UNK> the decent and good ones br br i'll always love elvis thank you thank you very much
<START> i haven't seen it in over twenty years <UNK> was the bus driver <UNK> johnson was the tour guide <UNK> was the <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> looked very much at home as the villain a natural i think i watched it back then most for <UNK> who i had seen <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> crossing but also to see <UNK> johnson br br i was a little bored that johnson was so serious br br and yes it <UNK> plots in reading other <UNK> i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl but then that priceless <UNK> business turned up out of the blue br br i was going a <UNK> if it came on as a late movie i would probably record it to check it out again but i wouldn't be nostalgic over it not yet anyway br br there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out
<START> this has to be the worst movie i've ever attempted to watch in the first 15 minutes there wasn't anything to keep my interest in this movie i was on vacation at the time and had plenty of time to <UNK> to a just for the fun of it movie the <UNK> we were staying in had this movie in stock they must have got it from the 1 store or something br br if you like adam sandler this is nothing like any other movie he's made this started with a bad premise and then just got worse there's nothing even remotely funny in it br br i've watched a lot of movies including some i didn't care for but if you decide to waste your time on this movie don't say i didn't warn you
<START> i came in in the middle of this film so i had no idea about any credits or even its title till i looked it up here where i see that it has received a mixed reception by your <UNK> i'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as i watched the beautiful and sensitive score written in a <UNK> <UNK> style my surprise was great when i discovered the score to have been written by none other than john williams himself true he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as <UNK> list but one usually associates his name with such <UNK> as star wars but in my opinion what williams has written for this movie surpasses anything i've ever heard of his for <UNK> sensitivity and beauty fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie and another recent score of his for catch me if you can shows still more wit and sophistication as to stanley and <UNK> i like education movies like how green was my valley and <UNK> that one with john <UNK> and his young african american charges in south <UNK> and danny <UNK> renaissance man etc they tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening a story which can't be told often enough this one is an excellent addition to that genre
<START> whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching this depends how you like your horror movies if you like them so god damn awful they're hysterical watch away jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie i've seen in my life and i've seen <UNK> time <UNK> and i say this as a fan of the low budget horror gore genre and having seen a good few to compare it to i'm not even going to go into the <UNK> of what makes this movie was bad as it is the only good thing about it is it's so so terrible it's one of the funniest things i've seen in years if you can find this to rent cheap it's definitely worth watching if you were involved in making it shame on you o imdb need to introduce a 0 10 <UNK> especially for this movie it thoroughly deserves it
<START> when i first started watching this movie i was looking for some kind of subtle <UNK> but it soon <UNK> on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train the interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring its not that i don't get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact it's just that in this film they are very boring if you want to see and <UNK> these kinds of relationships you'd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you it is realistic but you wouldn't go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie
<START> hard to believe that director <UNK> <UNK> once did the <UNK> and very funny <UNK> 1976 and now only seems to do by the numbers hollywood thrillers br br this is very lightweight john <UNK> material crossed with the plot of a tv movie <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> and independent crime investigator <UNK> in serial killers ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo not good when two <UNK> college <UNK> <UNK> and pitt decide to send them on a wild <UNK> chase by <UNK> very clever and misleading <UNK> evidence at a crime scene br br fair enough but while <UNK> and chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overly melodramatic flashbacks <UNK> an important event in <UNK> history then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff side <UNK> cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the <UNK> ending will be set <UNK> the atmosphere br br watch any episode of <UNK> instead it's to the point and far more exciting
<START> rupert friend gives a performance as prince albert that lifts the young victoria to unexpected levels he is superb as we know queen victoria fell into a dark deep depression after prince <UNK> death and looking into <UNK> friend's eyes i understood the film doesn't take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life an act of love i believed it or i should say him i believed what he felt was real nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the <UNK> and <UNK> of friend's characterization emily blunt is good but i didn't believe for a minute she was victoria no real sense of period it may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director <UNK> <UNK> this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today <UNK> <UNK> is an inspiration for all leading directors of india br br the film tells the real life scenario of <UNK> police of the 70s unlike any police of other cities in india <UNK> police <UNK> a different system altogether <UNK> <UNK> creates a very practical <UNK> with real life approach of <UNK> police environment br br amongst various police officers colleagues the film describes the story of <UNK> <UNK> a young hot blooded cop coming from a poor family his father is a harsh police <UNK> <UNK> himself suffers from his father's <UNK> <UNK> of his father's atrocities on his mother <UNK> approach towards immediate action against crime is an <UNK> <UNK> for his own job satisfaction the film is here <UNK> in a plot <UNK> <UNK> constant efforts against crime are <UNK> by his <UNK> this leads to <UNK> as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction resulting from the <UNK> his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the <UNK> rooms bars also turning him to an alcoholic br br the spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system he is aware of the system of the <UNK> where the police politicians are a <UNK> associated by far end his compromise towards <UNK> practice is negative finally he gets suspended br br the direction is a master piece thoroughly hard core one of the best memorable scenes is when <UNK> breaks in the underworld gangster <UNK> <UNK> house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic at many scenes the film has hair raising moments br br the practical approach of script is a major punch alcoholism corruption political influence courage <UNK> all are integral part of <UNK> police even today those aspects are dealt brilliantly br br finally the films belongs to the one man show <UNK> <UNK> portraying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly
<START> i was curious to know how critics <UNK> to this rousing inspiring film so i went to rotten tomatoes and was <UNK> to discover that the pompous <UNK> gallery that is our <UNK> film critics had given the film an average <UNK> or rotten rating br br all i can say is if this movie doesn't move you you have no heart it's interesting to note that the same film on the same website got a <UNK> rating from viewers br br not that the opinion of critics is all that important to me after all i can't think of a more useless <UNK> profession some <UNK> gets paid to go to the movies what a tough life and does the same thing everyone else on the planet does forms an opinion but these <UNK> have a way of coming across like their opinion somehow matters more than yours and even worse they love to hate br br i'll grant you that this movie is old fashioned well except for the f bombs <UNK> and a little predictable after all you know right from the beginning that cuba gooding jr portraying real life navy hero carl brashear is going to triumph eventually at every turn simply by the way he comes across determined and <UNK> strong <UNK> and optimistic br br but his performance and that of de niro as billy sunday a <UNK> character of several real life people are so strong so inspiring that you'll be on your feet cheering many of the film's scenes especially the courtroom climax you'd have to be a real stick in the mud not to be moved by these scenes like our <UNK> film critics michael <UNK> is excellent as well as a sweet natured <UNK> diving student that befriends <UNK> brashear if anyone has seen higher learning this character totally <UNK> that character br br anyway this <UNK> what i've always felt don't listen to critics see this movie and get inspired
<START> i'm a big fan of troma but i can't figure out why they bought the rights to this movie it's so boring i felt like i was watching for 3 hours some where on the plot summary it says but what satan doesn't know he's stuck with annoying tourists well they didn't seem to bother him in the movie just me br br the only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays satan i like bad movie's but it was just boring
<START> this must be one of the most overrated spanish films in history its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political <UNK> make it really childish with only good bad characters the world is just not like this and good movies show complex characters with opposite <UNK> <UNK> etc however what i hate most about this film is <UNK> friend's father the director tries to teach us a good lesson <UNK> artists with <UNK> heads are not always bad guys in fact they can be better than the average looking dad wow this is like philosophy or something thank you <UNK> i'll <UNK> you for the <UNK> prize of literature
<START> this is a horrible movie all three stories are <UNK> with a psychiatrist <UNK> line which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad the first is about wild wolves and some lady there are some things that don't make sense but the <UNK> thing makes up for that the second one with bad bill paxton as a maniac roommate should not be viewed by anyone the last one sadly the best is almost incomprehensible which i guess makes it better than the other garbage
<START> when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> aired last season i was pleased <UNK> i thought is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clip show concept instead of <UNK> footage they're <UNK> jokes in a self aware manner and i really enjoyed it br br i found it really unfortunate that i was wrong one season later they <UNK> to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do the clip show and it looked like it was put together by the work experience kid dr <UNK> <UNK> head shows just how lazy the <UNK> were in putting it together as it doesn't appear again until <UNK> long <UNK> some 4 episodes later i can't imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well constructed sitcom who knows why it was <UNK> there it just seemed lazy and out of place reminding me largely of episodes that have aired within the past year br br three second clips <UNK> together with background music is a dvd extra for a very rainy day not an episode of prime time television
<START> this is a film that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access as it doesn't exactly give the viewer easy watching the story about troubled spike and his friend <UNK> is not exactly a friday night film yet it has its own unique edge and i found that it was entertaining there are moments of brilliance given that the film was shot on such a low budget such as when spike <UNK> the <UNK> however i did not really understand the relationship between spike and <UNK> and to be honest it made me spend most of the film trying to work it out and also i did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not really much action it is a small film that is complex to watch and that is what makes it appealing
<START> i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial the commercial was great but it i found out later that it had every explosion or <UNK> <UNK> in the entire movie about 4 and even some that weren't in the movie there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to <UNK> people i guess my world of innocence ended that day when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies
<START> amateur no budget films can be surprisingly good this however is not one of them br br ah another brad sykes atrocity the acting is hideous except for emmy smith who shows some promise the camera direction needs serious <UNK> and no more hold the camera and run gimmicks either it just doesn't work the special effects are unimaginative there's a problem when the effect can be identified in real time if you're going to rip off an ear please don't let us see the actor's real ear beneath the blood the scenery is bland and boring same as mr sykes other <UNK> and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal see the scenery comment br br did i mention the lack of any real plot or character development apparently the scriptwriter didn't br br whoever is funding this guy please stop i've seen some of his other home movies which i will not plug and they are just as bad normally a director will grow and learn from his previous efforts not this guy it's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker but anyone can be a hack br br definitely not even a popcorn film of course chewing on popcorn <UNK> would be less painful than this effort br br award the worst ever military push ups in a film
<START> alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be <UNK> compared to him br br the main subject of this <UNK> vehicle all the ideas almost everything was already in hitchcock's classic rope the two students who commit a gratuitous crime <UNK> philosophy and the clues that the boys <UNK> the master was the first to transfer them to the screen and with an <UNK> minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force br br murder by numbers does not take place in a single room like the rope mind you and what a supreme originality it <UNK> two cops against the evil youngsters and you would never guess it these two cops are very different actually <UNK> plays the part of woman living like a man and her partner chaplin is as shy as a clueless <UNK> the two <UNK> performances are not really mind <UNK> not as good as say that of edward norton in primal fear br br well you know rope was so good
<START> though i can't claim to be a comic book fanatic i have read my share so i guess i'm part of the audience of this film and i wasn't disappointed it does run out of steam near the end it's almost <UNK> with ideas and it seems like lena <UNK> one of my favorite actresses was left on the cutting room floor also a little of hank <UNK> blue <UNK> can go a long way still it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun all the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles especially william h macy as the straight arrow <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> and unlike some i found the design of the city to make the joke even funnier i also liked how disco was the music of choice of the bad guys somehow it seemed appropriate
<START> this is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing doesn't appear literally until half way in nevertheless i was engaged by the hook of the phantom lady curtis though competent as the <UNK> accused scott henderson looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards perhaps he should have <UNK> his <UNK> and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence while another <UNK> had a problem with <UNK> tone as jack <UNK> i found his portrayal of the character to be <UNK> complex he is no stock villain superb character actor elisha cook jr is again in top form as the <UNK> man with big ambitions ' his <UNK> in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of <UNK> this movie however is carried by the very capable and <UNK> ella raines as the devoted would be lover of henderson carol <UNK> she definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of lauren bacall this is the first of her work i have seen and i am definitely inclined to see her other roles the rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent all in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to recommended 8 10
<START> <UNK> is a far from great film from a stage play directed by <UNK> <UNK> in the scheme of <UNK> films this is above the level of most of his post don't look now work which is <UNK> by <UNK> use of <UNK> russell as lead actress she's actually very good here and far from the problem in other <UNK> films like bad timing and cold heaven as the actress who is marilyn monroe russell is very effective portraying her as a thoroughly <UNK> but likeable <UNK> she plays well alongside michael <UNK> as einstein who is excellent to say the least he looks the part admirably and while <UNK> russell doesn't look exactly like monroe she certainly is attractive enough to make the part ring true other players are adequate if not quite as <UNK> as <UNK> and russell are a pretty <UNK> intelligent script is directed well by <UNK> but certainly not brilliantly like <UNK> or performance as in other later <UNK> films he tends to rely too much on vague <UNK> flashbacks that add very little to the film in many ways the film would have worked better as a shorter say 60 minutes more modest piece still a quite acceptable passable film at times quite excellent but somewhat lacking overall rating 1 2
<START> i'm sure that not many people outside of australia have ever heard of the legend of ned kelly i once saw a documentary about the man but that's the only time i once saw or heard anything about him and i guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face no one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject br br the movie tells the story of ned kelly's life the irish immigrant has lived in north west victoria all his life but has never been very welcome by the authorities the police always <UNK> him of everything they can think of and they keep <UNK> his family when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes he forms a gang with his brother and two other men they start robbing banks and even <UNK> an entire town for 3 days all this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen they are <UNK> finally they take over a pub in <UNK> where they have a party with all the <UNK> waiting for a train full of police to <UNK> at a part of the track that they <UNK> up but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four <UNK> br br it's very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false i guess nobody really knows because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth one camp says he was a hero some kind of robin hood the others will say he was an ordinary criminal a murderer and a thief i really couldn't tell you which of them is right perhaps both are but what i can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same br br this movie was a nice addition to the documentary i once saw and i really enjoyed the performances of all the actors heath ledger orlando bloom <UNK> <UNK> geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a 7 5 10
<START> if movies like <UNK> rip off <UNK> then hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like <UNK> these barely animated <UNK> have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies which involve basically <UNK> characters' sex dreams oh joy but what that has to do with anything is <UNK> guess except to let the director <UNK> his kinky <UNK> for <UNK> they show this down in the <UNK> circle of hell one suspects there's no real plot just <UNK> kill and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to <UNK> the viewing audience
<START> i have to say i totally loved the movie it had it's funny moments some heartwarming parts just all around good me personally really liked the movie because it's something that finally i can relate to my childhood this movie in my opinion is <UNK> more towards the young gay population it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up all the <UNK> name calling and not knowing is something i like most other young feminine boys will always remember and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay so i would definitely recommend seeing this movie probably shouldn't really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
<START> this rather formulaic swords and flying <UNK> movie is a decent early display of john <UNK> talents the cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable unfortunately the film <UNK> under the burden of a dull story and a <UNK> low budget check some of the <UNK> fight scenes if you doubt me nonetheless it's worth seeing especially if you can catch in <UNK>
<START> i love playing football and i thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it this was a good hollywood bollywood film and i am glad it won 17 awards <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> knightley were good and so was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> meyers was great at playing the coach jazz <UNK> <UNK> loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married when jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets juliet <UNK> <UNK> and joe <UNK> <UNK> meyers who is her coach when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wedding at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play
<START> this movie looked good good cast <UNK> topic and an explosive opening it went downhill from there why was it filmed by hand held camera it shakes <UNK> part captures scenes and simply <UNK> the viewer a poor choice indeed as if this was not enough the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all and then it commits the worst sin of all after leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of <UNK> they roll credits without revealing the denouement the ending the payoff like what the heck was the motive how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending <UNK> this movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud what a waste of effort poor effort by writer and director
<START> <UNK> de <UNK> fits <UNK> into the buddy action movie genre but <UNK> its roots thanks to excellent casting tremendous <UNK> between its leads and outstanding photography diego <UNK> stars as dr <UNK> a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective diaz luis <UNK> who's been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor <UNK> who seem to have been involved in am arms <UNK> conspiracy diaz has been suspended from duty but he's the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be <UNK> <UNK> and diaz soon find themselves <UNK> in a conspiracy involving <UNK> intelligence community and some <UNK> and the film <UNK> them at a crucial point that allows <UNK> to develop some impressive <UNK> skills of his own <UNK> and <UNK> are excellent together and remind me of screen team <UNK> hill and bud spencer though <UNK> isn't as <UNK> handsome as hill remarkably even at almost two hours in length <UNK> de <UNK> doesn't wear out its welcome and indeed writer director <UNK> <UNK> sets up a potential sequel in the film's charming <UNK> all in all a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither <UNK> to the lowest common <UNK> nor insults your intelligence
<START> true it does not follow the book very closely but it's still a very entertaining take on the story <UNK> was far better in the role than i expected and <UNK> avoided the silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness portrayal most of us probably expected <UNK> kate <UNK> in indiana jones the temple of doom br br at any rate it's amazingly better than richard <UNK> awful pair of <UNK> flicks br br it is very reminiscent of a western in many ways about the only thing i didn't care for was all the <UNK> but i guess that is part and <UNK> of the genre like how can you have an african adventure story without witch <UNK> and <UNK> wise wandering <UNK> <UNK>
<START> absolute garbage the reason that this is so terrible is not because it <UNK> from the formula but because the plot was just pathetic br br the supposed star didn't do anything to solve the case and neither did anyone else really it was just routine police work utterly tedious br br you sat right till the end hoping for a twist and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment br br there was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap could the <UNK> personal involvement finally cloud his judgement br br all the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it but surely a genius like lt c by constant conversation with the <UNK> husband would gradually <UNK> a <UNK> plot involving a tape <UNK> playing in the shower room while a masked <UNK> surprises the bride hides the body and then plants subtle clues it could have been good it was a complete waste of time
<START> my goodness this movie really really shows the talents of actors billy <UNK> <UNK> his acting muscle truly an amazing man if you look at him in <UNK> as a rebel <UNK> saints as a madman killer and then finally in fido as a zombie his character in fido looks from cute to frightening absolutely fabulous <UNK> ann moss is no hack either jumping in career from matrix and <UNK> as a darker character to a heart warming conservative 1950's housewife rare these days to see actors being able to not be so type casted br br now onto the storyline no spoilers don't worry this movie would make max brooks author of zombie survival guide world war z happy with joy finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy br br if you like zombies if you don't like zombies if you are just bored or if you are too busy go see this movie
<START> i should love this movie the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me the movie makes working class people look low and cheap the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy barbara stanwyck as the mother <UNK> the daughter but the daughter <UNK> a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it again the acting was very very good and worth watching i really don't like the story line just a personal <UNK> thank you
<START> maybe not the most original way of telling a story we've seen all this before in many movies but i liked it october sky alot anyways it got something great directing and good acting by all parts especially laura dern the teacher and chris cooper the father i wanna be a rocket engineer
<START> although this show has been off the air since 1973 after viewing a dvd set i borrowed at our library i felt compelled to say a bit about it br br i can remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s and sometimes there would be a little sunday night party with friends to watch this on nbc on one of the few color <UNK> br br i really enjoy history not so much for the names and dates but how it influences us today and how so much can be so profound based on the most <UNK> actions of the time case in point virginia city <UNK> which became one of the <UNK> cities in the world because of the silver got its name from a character named old <UNK> who in the town's early days stumbled out of a saloon fell and broke his <UNK> bottle br br old <UNK> didn't want to waste the occasion so as the precious <UNK> was <UNK> into the dirt he decided to <UNK> the town virginia town the area became known as the <UNK> <UNK> because another character henry <UNK> had the reputation of trying to jump everyone's claim and the area became known as the <UNK> <UNK> br br i just watched an early episode that dealt with these 2 subjects other episodes dealt with mark <UNK> literary rise while a reporter for the <UNK> enterprise br br it was wholesome and frequently educational family entertainment as someone else <UNK> each episode would really be considered a movie in its own right rich scripts and characters br br one thing it twisted the truth on was the <UNK> to virginia city and the <UNK> in truth to ride from the <UNK> all of northern lake <UNK> one would have to ride his horse about 3 000 feet 1 000 <UNK> down the <UNK> <UNK> to the high desert 3 000 4 000 feet of the carson valley then another 30 40 miles to virginia city br br needless to say the <UNK> would have some sore rear ends doing this on a regular basis but every writer should have some <UNK> with the truth br br how i miss that show even today
<START> for a made for tv horror movie the movie started off very interesting i was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film but the ending was a total <UNK> the movie was going along fast paced and was building up to it seemed like anyway to a very climatic end but guess what there is no end the movie is just over and after almost one and a half hours the audience is just left wondering what happened why were all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered there was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the plot this film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it very <UNK> this film looks like the producers just ran out of money and never completed the film a real bomb
<START> those childhood memories when things were new and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life br br one of the initial memories i have from childhood is this animated program galaxy express <UNK> about a young boy named <UNK> who goes on a train ride around the galaxy in the hopes of gaining a mechanical body in order to avenge the senseless death of his mother at the hands of cold hearted <UNK> gathering mechanical hunters accompanying <UNK> on his journey is <UNK> a woman of exquisite golden beauty who reminds him of the mother he lost all those years ago br br back in the early 80's as a boy who attended <UNK> and the early years of <UNK> school in <UNK> south korea galaxy express <UNK> was a <UNK> popular animated program <UNK> from japan which inspired young boys who tuned in to dream of countless adventures in their often <UNK> and exciting journey through life that <UNK> them the memories of <UNK> into this animated program on <UNK> between 8 to <UNK> before bed time br br those were some wonderful memories never to be had again br br as i moved to america and while <UNK> here for over 2 decades i sometimes wondered about that time and place in a country thousands of miles away divided from america by an enormously vast ocean of this childhood program with its hit theme song and of the boy named <UNK> his protective companion <UNK> the enigmatic train conductor and of the <UNK> train galaxy express <UNK> br br many many years passed br br last summer while i was in korea i was able to track down a copy of the original galaxy express <UNK> 1979 on dvd and it brought back a lot of nostalgic heartfelt memories galaxy express <UNK> remains as captivating as the first time you discovered it all those years ago opening up those nostalgic memories of new <UNK> an important stepping stone for young boys who tuned in and <UNK> on their life's journey into <UNK> br br here's to wonderful memories good bye <UNK> good bye galaxy express <UNK> br br good bye to my childhood br br 10 10
<START> while watching this movie i was frustrated and distracted and by the end i wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5 i thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on even my a d d couldn't keep up it felt like a slight acid trip everything looked flat there was no dimension to anything there were so many <UNK> lines and <UNK> i really wanted to stop the movie mid way and smash my burned copy of this movie but after i finish watching it i went online to read up on the movie and i should have done a little research into this movie before watching br br the secret of kells is loosely based on the true story about the original book of kells a small boy brendan is given the task of <UNK> new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written this book will contain information that will help change darkness into light brendan lives in the village of kells behind huge stone walls taking place in the <UNK> century <UNK> uncle the <UNK> of kells is trying to build the wall to keep the <UNK> out <UNK> uncle insist he help complete the wall but a <UNK> and keeper of the book secretly trains brendan to <UNK> in on his <UNK> skills and convinces him to complete the book and carry out it's word br br the entire time i watched the movie i thought i was missing something because i didn't really understand what was going on i figured i was just missing a piece of irish history a simple <UNK> search taught me all i needed to know about the original book of kells after reading many <UNK> my opinion of the movie greatly changed br br the book of kells is a copied version of the first few books of the new testament <UNK> into latin by <UNK> monks in ireland in the <UNK> century along with it's <UNK> and <UNK> script the book is also beautifully illustrated in <UNK> art a type of early art form know for it's <UNK> complexity and <UNK> <UNK> much of the art in the book of kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time flat and <UNK> challenged with no perspective but what makes the book of kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it's use of many colors br br the secret of kells is very colorful i originally thought the animation was flat and boring it reminded me a lot of the cartoon samurai jack which also had a flat and <UNK> look to it once i learned about the art styles of the book of kells it's obvious that many of the styles from the book are <UNK> in the movie there are lines and <UNK> and various <UNK> that inhabit <UNK> mind whenever he goes into his imagination <UNK> <UNK> resembling the sun <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> begin filling the screen the edges of the screen become framed in <UNK> moving <UNK> or circles transitions are filled with color and <UNK> <UNK> from the trees to the floors many things in this world are covered in <UNK> or <UNK> br br <UNK> in at 70 minutes minus credits the secret of kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people maybe just children interested i think one has to generally be open <UNK> to the secret of kells as half art piece half movie about history despite looking like it was animated with <UNK> <UNK> it's a very nice looking movie but based on the 20 films <UNK> for oscar consideration i don't think it was worth being nominated over mary and max br br <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> this is a really old fashion charming movie the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston <UNK> movies fi you want to watch a movie that doesn't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it the acting is good and i really liked michael <UNK> he was in <UNK> too and while you were sleeping the rest of the cast is fun it's just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own <UNK> i know sounds <UNK> but it is and that's what makes it fun to watch it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you but at least you'll know
<START> this was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen i am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie in fact when i'm renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies they are always good for a laugh believe i know i have seen many but this movie was just so terrible it wasn't worth a chuckle i was considering turning it off in the first five minutes which i probably should have there is nothing good about it first and foremost the camera crew <UNK> a the intro was stupid just like the ending acting and special effects were terrible please i'm begging you do not watch this movie you will absolutely hate it
<START> so often with stephen king adaptations you just get a collection of characters <UNK> dialogue from the books this really captures the heart of the book maybe because they don't use large <UNK> of text straight from the book but it's a bit more of an <UNK> of the events in the story a big part of its success is <UNK> hughes as baby gage <UNK> <UNK> and denise <UNK> <UNK> crosby really act like his parents there's a scene where louis is <UNK> gage and they are very natural together fred <UNK> is wonderful he nails the <UNK> accent perfectly without <UNK> into parody and is wise and warm just like <UNK> should be 8 out of 10
<START> from the moment christopher lee puts on a pair of punk <UNK> and tries to sneak into a punk rock club you know you've got a stinker on your hands this film had potential beneath all of the <UNK> there are the <UNK> of what could have been crafted into a decent film if not an interesting one the final product is a real mess however aside from the gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women howling ii winds up being a laughable excuse for a horror film christopher lee gives it a <UNK> of credibility but even he cannot raise it above the level of crap br br having never seen any of the other films in this series this critic will be forced to accept on face value that this is a genuine <UNK> of the events in part one we start off at a funeral for one of the characters from the original and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in <UNK> with a small group of heroes ready to battle a <UNK> of werewolves the film is paced fairly well and there are not too many dead spots the action is there it just isn't filmed well one bright spot is the music of a punk band called <UNK> though their song is played quite often it is rather catchy br br the problems with this film are great in number first off the acting is worse than pitiful christopher lee is good enough but that's where it ends the two leads <UNK> brown and annie <UNK> are lacking in just about everything you'd want for such characters the writing is wretched the editing redundant and the direction amateurish there are a couple nice special effect gimmicks but the cheesy ones far out <UNK> them in number <UNK> <UNK> is nice to look at but her acting performance is less than satisfactory judd omen looks the part he plays but his voice and acting are unconvincing to say the least much of the dialog is in an <UNK> language that may or may not be latin br br i liked the general idea for the story i always enjoy stories of true <UNK> out to battle seemingly <UNK> forces of evil one scene where a small group of good guys are <UNK> through a dark forest and shooting down a bunch of werewolves is even kind of exciting kind of maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film a bit more compelling 3 of 10 stars br br the <UNK> br br side note as of this writing the censors at youtube com have still not taken down the ending credits with <UNK> <UNK> ripping off her top several times while the <UNK> song is playing catch it while you can
<START> the great ecstasy of robert <UNK> is bad film in every way the script the dreary pace the lack of depth in any character the pointless sub plots the dreadful acting the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film i've ever seen i found nothing likable enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way br br i imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark with its moody lighting long <UNK> <UNK> and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack if so they failed utterly it just bored me and i wish i had never watched it br br avoid at all costs
<START> this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action it's just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is rome italy thats the best place ever the actors are great mary kate olsen is such a great actress she plays charlie and thats a great character and ashley olsen play <UNK> and thats a great character to love when in rome love it
<START> it's die hard meets cliffhanger when a <UNK> resort is <UNK> by terrorists and it's up to one cop jack <UNK> to stop this br br a b action movie that borrows from other films and is quite good with pretty good action a ridiculous plot as always in these movies and three fine stars thomas ian griffith as the cop and <UNK> kinski and christopher plummer as terrorists if you don't like stupid b action movies this is not for you
<START> lately they have been trying to <UNK> this film late night on cable tv commercials don't believe the hype i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres this is in my opinion the 3rd worst movie of all time just behind mac me 1 worst and jack frost 2 worst but i must admit they are all close and all terrible really nothing of this movie is funny or disturbing or anything else it claims to be so don't waste your money the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy i'm not lying about that someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film it is that awful if you don't believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this which i doubt you can finish two thumbs <UNK> down
<START> this gets a two because i liked it as a kid but it became so redundant that i just started to hate it i can't give this a <UNK> review because it would be <UNK> one thing after the other i probably wouldn't say anything that everyone else didn't say already br br the only other thing about this show is that it's pretty nasty with the kid with the <UNK> to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it i have a cousin that loves this show and he's the strangest and dumbest person i have met this show should be pulled from the air it's always the same thing over and over they need to put better shows on nick i'm getting really really tired of stuff like this
<START> after reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so so i finally decided to throw in my no cents worth i agree with most on the point that if it hadn't been for lauren lewis and chris ferry it would have been a disaster filmed in <UNK> oh just north of <UNK> where all the real talent <UNK> south down i <UNK> years ago at least as far as a tank of gas would allow i did get a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they <UNK> a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without an <UNK> of confusion this wee tale by the brothers crook is like an old record with a skip in it as an american i understand the difficulties <UNK> film artists have to face a trip to romania would have wiped out the budget for sure lets face it this whole film was a loop de loop of claire in the gas station claire on the side of the road claire under the <UNK> claire in the house claire in the <UNK> claire at school claire here and claire there it almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast josh and jeff have to make a living but don't write a two page script and turn it into an hour twenty flick before writing another screenplay about dreaming ghosts watch an episode or two of ghost <UNK> or something and get a little background all of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film also there is an appearance by co director jeff as he is in all his films just like alfred hitchcock eh one thing the film had going for it is that the cameraman seemed to have a <UNK> on lauren <UNK> <UNK> well with all sarcasm now satisfied i still recommend the film for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the <UNK> time of her career i hope and that chris ferry has established himself as a villain worth watching
<START> this <UNK> and fun short from <UNK> the time when charlie chaplin and <UNK> <UNK> were the big names in comedy features the young oliver hardy as a <UNK> do well who has to quickly impress his wealthy uncle by producing a wife and baby for his visit br br of course this does not go smoothly and soon there are rather more wives and babies than he can cope with plus the mandatory chases and <UNK> that are the hallmark of early movie slapstick br br restored well it can be viewed as part of 'the early films of oliver <UNK> and is now available on dvd a fine addition to the available <UNK> of the big screen favourite comedy duo
<START> i couldn't wait to see this movie about half way through the movie i couldn't wait for it to end all of the white actors were delivering their lines like woody allen had just said say it like this then they said their lines on screen like they were trying to imitate woody allen it was so annoying we all know how will ferrell really talks and he doesn't stumble over his words like mr allen the comedy portion of this film was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining i must admit that i have never been a major woody allen fan and this movie definitely has not converted me i think that his writing was just as bad as his direction this movie will go down as one of the worst 10 movies i have ever seen
<START> <UNK> is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy gang caper <UNK> film and feel good british movie br br it is the brilliant lead characters that set this movie apart from other films in this genre stars phil daniels gary stretch and <UNK> bell have a great chemistry and make their characters hugely likable and realistic the main story <UNK> around their road trip from london to <UNK> and the adventures and <UNK> that occur along the way this small film also has a great heart it is not just for bike fans as it <UNK> around the character's relationships with each other including dreams and regrets such as gary <UNK> fred longing for the family he left behind the cinematography is also great a love letter to the <UNK> countryside as well as capturing the <UNK> of london streets and typical pub life in the <UNK> country towns br br stylish slick fantastic soundtrack likable characters and funny storyline i would recommend <UNK> in a <UNK>
<START> i first saw enchanted april about five years ago i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas it's about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april leaving their <UNK> lives behind them they are very sad women at the outset of the film and you can't help but root them on as they plan this get away with two other women they invite along to share the <UNK> this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen <UNK> pure and simple with no car chases no <UNK> and no deaths it was made with care and in very good taste you cannot help but smile all through it except when you're crying happy tears
<START> prominent attorney walter <UNK> takes a murder case pro <UNK> wins an <UNK> and discovers that his client <UNK> <UNK> was not only guilty but part of an <UNK> ring reaching to the highest <UNK> of the city <UNK> by his own <UNK> he <UNK> an investigation stumbles onto the identity of the unknown man who heads the <UNK> and murders him br br the <UNK> engage when <UNK> is charged with this second murder and <UNK> must defend him by pointing to the existence of another unknown man himself though somewhat short of urban <UNK> and long on <UNK> the unknown man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its <UNK> of the <UNK> corruption of american <UNK> politics that came to light in the <UNK> years
<START> another double noir on one disc from warner home video and by far the better of the two movies is <UNK> marvellous 1950 thriller where danger loves this is a memorable classic with a great cast in robert mitchum faith <UNK> and claude <UNK> <UNK> photographed in black white by nicholas <UNK> it was tightly directed by john <UNK> where danger lives is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish <UNK> that was hollywood's past see my full review br br unfortunately none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc the abysmal mgm 1949 stinker tension poorly written allen <UNK> and directed by john <UNK> this movie is full of ludicrous <UNK> and unlikely situations the <UNK> relationship between a mild mannered and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> played by richard <UNK> and his overtly <UNK> wife a <UNK> audrey <UNK> is totally implausible and unconvincing how on earth they ever got together in the first place is <UNK> guess then when she <UNK> <UNK> him for one of her <UNK> lloyd <UNK> our <UNK> <UNK> instead of being <UNK> and over the moon with his new found good fortune plots revenge and attempts to kill <UNK> but at the last minute <UNK> out the guy gets murdered anyway and our <UNK> is immediately suspected by homicide detective barry sullivan another bland performance so who did kill him well at this stage of the movie you really couldn't care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director <UNK> mr <UNK> has no idea of pacing and is unable to <UNK> even a <UNK> of style into the thing there is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from <UNK> off the only tension contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and <UNK> in the fingers of barry sullivan as he gives the intro at the film's opening so much for that a most unfortunate effort <UNK> la <UNK> br br best things about this turkey is the smooth <UNK> cinematography by the great harry <UNK> an effective score by a young andre <UNK> and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely <UNK> <UNK> before she found her dancing shoes hey maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of <UNK> huh br br in its favour however are the <UNK> of extras that are included which boasts trailers <UNK> and <UNK> for both films but the disc is worth it alone for the rko mitchum classic
<START> i didn't approach still crazy with any real anticipation just another <UNK> picture i figured good nostalgia for the baby <UNK> this film is partially that but so much more brian gibson the director previously <UNK> a biography of tina turner and is quite successful in his style i suppose it is fitting that this was his last film br br the cast is well chosen bill <UNK> is perfect in his role as the <UNK> <UNK> actor turned director bruce robinson appears as the <UNK> washed up <UNK> he does a superb job even though he hasn't appeared on film since the late 70's if you're looking for an touching and funny film with some great songs you've found it br br 7 4 out of 10
<START> let's think people quit bad <UNK> the original for it's time the original battlestar series was a masterpiece even still with all the stars story lines and art <UNK> greene was great as <UNK> and richard <UNK> was perfect as apollo and <UNK> <UNK> was funny as <UNK> but i dare say not as pretty as <UNK> as <UNK> br br i loved the episode with the <UNK> and <UNK> from earth was good john <UNK> was great as <UNK> war of the gods the best was experiment in <UNK> i thought that was a tribute in a way to heaven can wait then you had the women of battlestar not to compare them to let's say <UNK> who is <UNK> beautiful as number six but jane <UNK> beauty could not be compared to let alone <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> was fantastic she had beauty that a <UNK> would be embarrassed by i loved the original as much as the new br br can you imagine if john <UNK> had a number six br br <UNK> for listening
<START> i love movies and i'll watch any movie all the way through just to give it a chance i can finally say that i found a movie i can't watch all the way through the acting is terribly stale and <UNK> the cgi looks like a computer geek did it in his mother's basement with minimal <UNK> and the long scenes of just walking and this movie is three hours long i didn't even make it 15 minutes until i fast <UNK> the dvd the scenes with the aliens are very short <UNK> instead of <UNK> this war of the worlds lets name this war of the walking long <UNK> this cost 5 million dollars to make what they spend the money on the dramatic opening song br br oh but on a positive note one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people that's hilarious not because people are dying but because when they turn to <UNK> they still <UNK> for 20 seconds afterward br br so like i said if you are a fan of boring stale action less movies here is one for you dvd collection but i didn't write this for you i wrote this for the <UNK> upon <UNK> of other people who will hate this movie it is not worth your time or money br br i know this is by the book but the book isn't that long and i'm a complete book worm nerd geek whatever but why just get the steven spielberg version it's not all that good but it's 10 times better than this br br i give this a big fat zero out of 10
<START> i saw <UNK> well she wasn't exactly kissing santa <UNK> he has his hand on her <UNK> and wicked thoughts in mind br br this was enough to emotionally <UNK> a young boy who wanted to believe he grew up to be a bitter man who was upset at the quality of the toys being made and the lack of christmas spirit br br expecting a real slasher flick i was very disappointed that less than a handful of people dies and there was no nudity at all what a <UNK> br br i wanted to like this flick but it was just too slow and really didn't have a good script i didn't expect great acting but i sure wanted some action there just wasn't any
<START> put a dvd of this flick in a time capsule and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one which <UNK> the minimal rating on a 1 to 10 star scale br br bill <UNK> and ray <UNK> have been at the top in ratings and with <UNK> of millions in <UNK> <UNK> with their television <UNK> yet each has had no success in big screen offerings this has also been true for other tv personalities perhaps because many of the stories which are presented for two hours or so seem more suited to either a 10 minute skit or at most the 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a half hour program br br this film however doesn't have one single element which would warrant two or three minutes of time on mad tv snl or anywhere else on a screen or stage br br its <UNK> date is listed as 2002 but release date to dvd only is shown as 2004 it also was filmed not long before rodney <UNK> death so its one redeeming value is that it probably provided at <UNK> a few hundred thousand more dollars for his <UNK> br br i'd never heard of it but found it when turning on my set and frankly became fascinated by it some movies are so truly awful that they rate a sort of top rating in reverse so bad that you can move the <UNK> backwards to a 9 or 10 plan 9 from outer space is the best example and the bruce <UNK> village people <UNK> can't stop the music is another br br unfortunately this flick falls short even there even if <UNK> earlier work as well as some of his fellow cast <UNK> fell short of citizen kane or casablanca there were many moments of humor and a story providing at least a <UNK> of interest br br unfortunately this presentation doesn't seem to possess even a minute or <UNK> worth of such material
<START> down to earth 2001 out of four br br by blake french br br down to earth is such a <UNK> and desperate comedy it makes sitting home on the couch watching a chris rock <UNK> comedy act on tv look like heaven speaking of heaven the film is based on the 1978 movie heaven can wait that was a good movie and this is good to demonstrate how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent material and turn it into garbage directors chris and paul <UNK> miss nearly every target from concept to storytelling down to earth fails miserably this is one incredibly bad production br br chris rock is a lousy <UNK> comedian both in his role in this movie and in the real life he plays lance barton whose manager frankie <UNK> even feels sorry for him when he is <UNK> off stage during amateur night at a local theatre soon after the script <UNK> his lack of talent the character is killed by a <UNK> truck death played by eugene levy has made a mistake taking lance before his number was up god's assistant <UNK> <UNK> is very angry and decides to let lance make up the remainder of his time on earth as long as he takes the only available body of a 60 year old white millionaire br br the old man's name is mr <UNK> whose life has problems of its own his wife jennifer <UNK> is having an affair with his assistant greg <UNK> who is robbing him of his money but that's all right because lance inside mr <UNK> has fallen in love with a young black woman named <UNK> <UNK> king meanwhile there are plots to kill <UNK> lance attempting to get a better body and <UNK> confused feelings dealing with a hospital situation involving mr <UNK> <UNK> br br down to earth has some good ideas but they are in a pointless and unconvincing love story filled with <UNK> and recycled material the biggest problem it runs into is how we perceive lance as mr <UNK> chris rock is the actor with popularity and publicity so he is not going to be absent from most of this movie all of the characters see the new lance as mr <UNK> but we see him as chris rock this is convenient for the love story we believe a young woman would fall for lance but in reality he is actually an old gray haired <UNK> that is not so convincing br br the one joke comic situation is supposed to be watching an old man doing funny things that are really done by a young black man but what <UNK> laughter is when characters run into conflicts without their knowledge just look at there's something about mary in the funny scenes the characters are exposed to awkward experiences and not at their will here lance knows he is in an old man's body and does things old men would not normally do if lance did not know the body he was in then that may have had potential br br another problem with the concept we never knew mr <UNK> in the first place so how can we compare lance in his body when we do not know what he was like originally to top everything off chris rock needs to be the center of attention here and makes the character too much like rock he <UNK> simple <UNK> routine jokes that are tedious and painful his dialogue is so obvious wooden and straightforward i hated the film's sense of humor there are so many unfunny jokes and horrible comic situations it is like watching chris rock being chris rock not a character in a movie br br let's emphasize the <UNK> in down to earth mark <UNK> does not do any worse here than he did in the <UNK> in <UNK> rock vegas eugene levy and <UNK> <UNK> are well cast but they are at the mercy of a <UNK> script those are all the good qualities i can mention at this time and if you give me another week to <UNK> it is not likely that i will come up with any more
<START> i agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best kung fu movies ever i watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it the <UNK> scenes are brilliant and you can really <UNK> with this guy because he is treated as an <UNK> nice humour and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks if you like kung fu you would love this
<START> i watched the movie the flock because of the casting of gere and danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting this was one of the worst movies i've seen in a long while and i've seen some <UNK> i've never posted online before but this movie was so awful i had to do so i suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish it's unbelievable the story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite it's nauseating poor gere he deserves so much better as for the gere danes on screen <UNK> because of the horrible writing one doesn't believe either character for a single minute i'll bet gere wishes he could buy back the negative were such a thing possible it's a shame to see talent wasted so badly not to mention i wish i could get my 2 hours back i know what you're thinking how do i really feel
<START> you have to admire brad sykes even if you don't particularly want to a man who <UNK> out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic <UNK> but keeps on doing it all the same even the half hearted praise than <UNK> his camp blood films is given <UNK> and i'm as guilty of this as anyone brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix a neat idea a <UNK> character whatever but without the <UNK> to take it further than base level he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be joe <UNK> gives a spirited and very funny performance as <UNK> jackson and its a credit to sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the <UNK> of the film coming to a <UNK> near you in a parallel universe somewhere
<START> grey gardens is a world <UNK> itself edith and little edie live in near total isolation eating ice cream and <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> kitchen in their apparently shared bedroom cats <UNK> about while mother edith insults her daughter's <UNK> this is a <UNK> williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and <UNK> as the bizarre and <UNK> dialogue is 100 real br br the situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50 ish daughter lived for a decade other than that they were poor and clean they would <UNK> all day grandmother talking about her <UNK> perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men work and self expression br br this film is a must see for anyone writing a mother daughter relationship of this kind it is sad and <UNK> but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the <UNK> comfortable enough to expose themselves so <UNK> it is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context <UNK> of a powerful family <UNK> into <UNK> in the <UNK> of their own mansion
<START> well i gave this movie a 7 it was better than <UNK> but not as good as in the beginning as far as the <UNK> movies go i really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal let's hope the producers and cast get the next series <UNK> up to the standards of <UNK>
<START> i thought watching <UNK> videos on corporate <UNK> was tedious this movie went nowhere fast what could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars a picture of some <UNK> swimming pool he really needs to answer his phone by the way a <UNK> matrix <UNK> doing its job and <UNK> and <UNK> sitting in a yellow <UNK> control room repeating t minus 10 and counting as if something exciting is going to happen it doesn't so don't get your hopes up the best thing about this movie is to see james best and <UNK> <UNK> in something other than there famous tv personalities and that is <UNK> to find anything good and do not get me started on the music which was totally composed of a <UNK> some large marine <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> this movie is as close as i have given a one yet but it gets the 2 because i actually was able to finish this insomnia cure and didn't have to leave in the middle avoid at all costs
<START> this was just plain terrible i read this book for school i made as on all of the <UNK> and to see it like this my teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it and it was worse than leonard part 6 plan 9 from outer space and hudson <UNK> put together the thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over first of all it was made on hallmark second the acting was terrible third it was like completely different from the book literally it was so bad i asked myself to be <UNK> basically i would rather watch basic instinct 2 than watch this take my advice don't watch this film no one would want to watch this it was horrible horrible
<START> wow this movie bored the pants off me when i saw it bland pointless and <UNK> br br apparently ash and co can travel through time with the help of the spirit of the forest <UNK> <UNK> much there they meet a <UNK> kid named sam and the plot begins br br so tom ash and <UNK> sam get high with nature become hippies and try to free <UNK> the spirit from some weirdo hunter guy i don't even know what else went on it all went by in a <UNK> <UNK> friends were hardly in it and all the fight scenes were boring br br after saving the day ash and his infamous friends must return to their time while watching sam <UNK> away with <UNK> that scene was just creepy o o then after returning to their time ash learns that his new friend is actually his <UNK> grandpa and i think that's it pretty retarded isn't it if you love your children you won't expose them to this 1 out of 10
<START> cash now played by <UNK> <UNK> in for angelina jolie has <UNK> to a post apocalypse <UNK> after her <UNK> has died from old age said <UNK> was played by <UNK> <UNK> an actual decent actor and now she finds that people wander through the <UNK> looking for <UNK> to trade for <UNK> metal and cash she leads a group of burned out <UNK> that includes william <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a human scientist played by <UNK> <UNK> against bounty hunter richard lynch malcolm mcdowell has two minutes of screen time as lynch's <UNK> cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature the problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as mcdowell <UNK> and <UNK> are given little to do <UNK> is indeed a whiny heroine and lynch is too over the top as usual and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun bad as it's hilarious predecessor the one with van damme the second one is just dull also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost <UNK> <UNK> any good idea it has as an action flick this is routine and by the numbers b movie stuff and it is competently made that's the only thing positive i can say about it br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
<START> very low budget police <UNK> film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in central park and their only clue is a <UNK> on her arm although released by rko this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution the cast and crew with a few exceptions among them a young and uncredited jack lord director edward <UNK> and cameraman william <UNK> are comprised of complete <UNK> and it shows the performances are universally sub par and wouldn't pass <UNK> in a high school training film the direction is <UNK> and choppy and as mentioned previously there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors however despite the film's many shortcomings it does have a few good points the location shooting in new york city and the film's ultra low budget gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior the naked city a shootout in a dark basement is <UNK> handled and some of the investigating <UNK> are clever otherwise it's not much to write home about it is worth a look however for a glimpse at the <UNK> sections of new york city in the early 1950s and old car buffs will be <UNK> to see the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> cars in the streets br br
<START> the question of whether or not one likes this film version of the ghost train <UNK> depends on one thing and one thing alone your reaction to the performance of arthur <UNK> br br he tends to steal almost every scene he's in and not always in a good way sometimes you wish he'd settle down or back off just a little to allow the <UNK> many characters to feature and develop which they do to some extent but somehow everything keeps pointing back to <UNK> tommy <UNK> character br br personally i like the film and even like <UNK> to an extent i always seem to <UNK> it into the vcr at those odd hours of the early morning when i can't sleep and really can't find the energy to watch anything else there is something about watching old b w movies in the quiet dark of pre dawn that i find appealing
<START> rod <UNK> was of course a genius and his wonderful playful creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development there are no such shows now but rather housewife <UNK> ala eva longoria or <UNK> <UNK> or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that <UNK> our high tech screens br br jack <UNK> edged into the episode with such acting <UNK> and with his usual <UNK> that i can't help but think that rod <UNK> was <UNK> that long ago <UNK> show around <UNK> even though he was an <UNK> to the flow of the story this episode ends with a twist as usual but shock and humor are mixed with especially <UNK> <UNK> br br rex lewis field
<START> very much a film from the times extremely long sequences with no dialogue bad flashbacks and an almost entirely male cast the two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men br br o'toole is riveting whenever he speaks unfortunately he spends much of his time <UNK> through <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is always a joy to see but he too is terribly underused br br the film has one additional positive aspect in that it depicts many aspects of british <UNK> and fascist <UNK> such as the casual appearance of the <UNK> <UNK> that many people today are unaware of too many of today's films about wwii paint the allies as all good and the <UNK> as all evil when history tells us people are far more complicated than that br br this would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the <UNK> and are <UNK> on the couch and not able to <UNK> anything too complex if you just need something to pass the time while your <UNK> <UNK> this is the movie for you
<START> you do not get more dark or tragic than othello and this movie captures the play fairly well with outstanding performances by lawrence fishburne and irene <UNK> <UNK> expresses to the viewer <UNK> torment as he falls prey to <UNK> lies very convincingly even providing a realistic <UNK> episode <UNK> is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the <UNK> of <UNK> revenge against othello or the object of his wrath it is not clear which since no motive for <UNK> behavior is offered although kenneth <UNK> <UNK> displays his usual talent for shakespeare in this movie he is somewhat <UNK> the characters of <UNK> and <UNK> also wander in and out of scenes even though they like <UNK> seem more crucial to the plot i have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out but i know that shakespeare tends to develop his characters even the seemingly <UNK> ones very well br br if i had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more the director had a great cast and no one offered a bad performance the relationship between <UNK> and othello and that between <UNK> and <UNK> need to be further developed earlier in the film i have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests although you get a sense of this very late into the movie also othello and <UNK> need more time together although their anguish is convincing the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met on the other hand maybe the did just meet like romeo and juliet br br in brief good performances too short br br
<START> what was the worst movie of 2003 cat in the hat <UNK> <UNK> non i <UNK> that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year badly written badly edited and if i may be so bold badly acted the order is the black hole of film a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck it isn't even accidentally funny like for example <UNK> br br you know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn't going to be very smart they <UNK> the movie originally titled the sin <UNK> because they figured americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was even though they go to great <UNK> to explain what a sin eater is in the movie instead they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of heath ledger looking <UNK> are more than enough to get you in there br br and hey what do you know they were right my ex girlfriend saw the picture of heath and dragged me in <UNK> producers you've met your target market she also liked grease ii so you're in good company br br back on topic heath plays a catholic monk from a specific you guessed it order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor he has <UNK> issues possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion much less be a <UNK> monk the only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy as much as i've wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen his attempts at humor reminded me of all the <UNK> in my high school who did <UNK> of monty python thinking that if they just said the lines like the <UNK> did they would automatically be funny you know the sort of people i'm talking about br br if i utter any more i would be in danger of <UNK> spoilers frankly the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created
<START> well where to start here <UNK> presents me with a bit of a dilemma had this film come out of italy in say 1975 been directed by <UNK> <UNK> and starred david <UNK> then i'd be <UNK> it up faster than <UNK> drinks water on a <UNK> day because whilst tarantino and rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to <UNK> cinema dan reed has produced a rape revenge <UNK> picture of his very own in england and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken rodriguez to turn rose <UNK> leg into a machine gun because if you want to play <UNK> <UNK> then let me call out the <UNK> br br 1 rich high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and equally <UNK> gets the <UNK> for him check br br 2 gratuitous shots of said high flying career woman in various states of nudity check br br 3 convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who cannot be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in check br br 4 unnecessarily graphic rape scene <UNK> by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape check br br 5 gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> is pretty basic stuff <UNK> meets anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss on the way home they upset three locals in a <UNK> who take their revenge by giving <UNK> a good <UNK> and gang <UNK> anderson the couple then set about getting their revenge so far so straw dogs late night trains house on the edge of the park i spit on your grave etc etc so why didn't i think much of this film a number of reasons i suppose first off having the likes of gillian anderson in the cast <UNK> <UNK> lead me to expect better but it's the complete lack of honesty here than <UNK> most br br because whenever anyone sits down to watch <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> women and murdering their <UNK> in those period pieces from the 70's then they always know exactly what they are getting low budget <UNK> designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common <UNK> the baddies <UNK> and murder the <UNK> the <UNK> turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back and everyone goes home satisfied their desires to see a bit of nasty violence <UNK> and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored br br as writer and director however dan reed clearly believes <UNK> has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that and desperately tries to <UNK> his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there for instance when anderson and <UNK> are planning revenge on their <UNK> they learn that one of the <UNK> has a <UNK> year old daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with when anderson finally meets him face to face he <UNK> that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter the casual and <UNK> way that reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jaw dropping it's almost as if he expects this simple reference to <UNK> to be enough to throw the audience's moral <UNK> into <UNK> and make them leave the cinema thinking they've just sat through something of significance to make sure we <UNK> <UNK> at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time ostensibly from the view of the <UNK> and his concern for his daughter but reed <UNK> that we get plenty more shots of anderson rough handled and raped across the <UNK> of her car gratuitous does not enter into it br br after being told his reasons for <UNK> her anderson ties him over a table <UNK> the business end of a sniper rifle complete with <UNK> <UNK> just in case anyone wasn't clear on the <UNK> imagery up his <UNK> but lacks the courage to pull the trigger telling <UNK> who has no such moral <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that <UNK> and russell may have discussed in their rooms back at <UNK> over tea and <UNK> it is almost unwatchable in its <UNK> br br in fairness ms anderson acts her guts out throughout the film it's obvious she wants to leave <UNK> far behind and bless her she certainly does that one wonders what <UNK> would have made of his <UNK> partner <UNK> down to take a <UNK> at the side of the road and then <UNK> a man with a gun <UNK> on the other hand does what he's done in virtually every film he's made to date that is plays a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cockney type <UNK> with a <UNK> grin a <UNK> line of <UNK> and a face that most people would never get tired of <UNK> this is particularly true at the closing scene where after murdering his <UNK> in cold blood <UNK> <UNK> at the camera in what i'm sure is meant to be a look of existential anguish that invites us to <UNK> at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral <UNK> he has had to overcome but instead is far more reminiscent of oliver hardy looking <UNK> at the camera after stan has landed him in yet another fine mess which incidentally sums up this film quite nicely
<START> this review also contains a spoiler of the first movie so if you haven't seen either movie and want to but don't want the spoilers please don't read this review br br while this movie is supposed to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time the movie is a poor copy of the first cruel intentions the actors that they had portray ryan <UNK> christian and sarah michelle <UNK> kathryn are very poor <UNK> indeed neither can pull off the smarmy <UNK> rich kid attitude that the original actors did it's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was <UNK> not so much between christian and kathryn but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it there are also inconsistencies in the plot if this were truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn then why is it that christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie he supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie with reese <UNK> character br br also the tie in with the photography you could be a model comment at the end was totally lame and didn't add anything at all overall this movie was a waste of time i can't believe they made a cruel intentions 3
<START> mr harvey lights a candle is <UNK> by a brilliant performance by timothy <UNK> br br while we can predict that his titular <UNK> up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or <UNK> based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are <UNK> is surprising <UNK> range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the mike leigh <UNK> br br while an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on the simpsons this central situation of a visit to <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> script is well contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost <UNK> divided into acts br br we're introduced to the urban british range of <UNK> and <UNK> diverse kids with their uniforms i couldn't tell if this is a private or public school as they gather  the <UNK> black kids the serious south <UNK> and muslims the white bullies and mean girls  but conveyed quite naturally and <UNK> the young actors some of whom i recognized from british tv such as shameless were <UNK> in representing the usual range of junior high social <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> puts more warmth into the <UNK> role than the <UNK> she usually has to play br br a break in the trip leads to a <UNK> crisis for some while others remain <UNK> oblivious we think like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of <UNK> that we will be <UNK> fed a <UNK> lesson about religious tolerance but it's much more about faith in people as well as god which is why the bbc showed it in england at <UNK> time and bbc america showed it in the u s over christmas br br <UNK> press who was also so good in summer of love has a key role in mr <UNK> redemption that could have been played for movie of the week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way unfortunately i saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials br br while it is a bit heavy handed in several times <UNK> calling this road trip a <UNK> this quiet film was the best <UNK> of good will towards men than i've seen in most holiday themed tv movies
<START> interesting fast paced and amusing br br i'm not one of those people who watches loads and loads of television i stumbled across this show while home sick with a bad case of the <UNK> one day and was immediately hooked i developed quite a crush on john burke both he and claire did an amazing job of <UNK> the show together you could really tell that they both loved their jobs br br the super collector segments were excellent i found myself interested in things i had never previously given a single thought to br br what i would really like to know is whatever happened to jack the dog did one of the <UNK> adopt him
<START> the movie starts something like a less hyper <UNK> more <UNK> dead or alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers but when a police officer is killed one <UNK> gets involved and when he discovers that his brother <UNK> is also involved things get bloody quite fast br br an earlier work of miike's <UNK> <UNK> society is still filled with his usual in the ol' <UNK> and sadistic sex acts though it's not one of his more <UNK> or flamboyant pieces rather it's a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction as <UNK> <UNK> his way through the underground a <UNK> that leads him to a gay <UNK> leader who sells <UNK> gained body organs from <UNK> and keeps an almost <UNK> of young boys one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning <UNK> brother is getting involved with said society so <UNK> himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to <UNK> into this <UNK> realm br br what's mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship <UNK> has with his nemesis wang <UNK> is a japanese born in china later moved back into japan and <UNK> for it wang is a chinese who felt <UNK> in china so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan wang also is a surprisingly <UNK> character which is weird enough as it is much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with <UNK> comes to be and <UNK> himself is a similarly tragic figure when he's forced to <UNK> with his lack of ability to control his brother while it would be rude to state that miike's movies are successful mostly on their shock value it is true that sometimes it's easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter <UNK> <UNK> characters br br <UNK>
<START> i have not yet seen anyone <UNK> this film and i think i may be the first br br it was awful i actually didn't watch the end of it it was like watching a boring soap or a really good one all <UNK> are crap the actors were poor and storyline was bad the person who rated it 10 10 has no idea what he is on about the script was awful 2 people was in an angry conversation together involving <UNK> and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no he says if you do that i will hurt you <UNK> if comedy is your thing watch away please do not watch this film because it's crap br br summary poor acting bad fights bad script br br don't watch of course this is in my opinion
<START> just the fact that the cover is a drawing like those old b movies should give you a warning about the quality of this movie this is however not a b movie it is a d movie br br there are no known actors and the animals wow it is the worst data animation ever made during the last two decades br br you hardly ever see the <UNK> <UNK> shown on the front cover you just hear people scream bleed and die and you occasionally see a teeth or a tiger <UNK> it's so amateur <UNK> worth seeing just because it's so bad give it to a friend and say this is the best movie i have ever seen and wait for their reaction he he br br the movie is to weak to give it a spoiler alert this is a spoiler
<START> this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old manic american to write a story of a moon trip absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities maybe it held some fascination in the 3d <UNK> but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while save your time and money and watch <UNK> instead br br damn not enough lines yet i feel that sums it up well i agree with an above review this is like a cold war propaganda story maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies <UNK> the <UNK> of the moon landing or if the flies had died in the first minute btw why were all the main character flies <UNK> not one had the full compliment of limbs
<START> just watched this early bugs bunny first time he's named here and elmer <UNK> cartoon on the <UNK> as linked from youtube this was chuck jones' first time directing the <UNK> <UNK> and as a result bugs has a different voice provided by mel <UNK> than the brooklyn <UNK> one we're more familiar with in fact according to <UNK> he's <UNK> jimmy stewart his shy boy type personality of that time anyway after elmer buys his pet bugs goes all obnoxious on him by turning the radio real loud pretending to die after his master repeatedly throws him out of his shower and saying turn off those lights whenever elmer catches him in his bed even with the different voice bugs is definitely his mischievous self and i laughed myself blue the whole time according to <UNK> there was an additional scene at the end of elmer just giving the house to bugs after the hell he went through but that was probably considered too sad since he suffers a mental breakdown at that point so it's just as well that cut scene is lost anyway i highly recommend <UNK> pet rabbit
<START> many neglect that this isn't just a classic due to the fact that it's the first 3d game or even the first shoot 'em up it's also one of the first stealth games one of the only and definitely the first truly claustrophobic games and just a pretty well rounded <UNK> experience in general with graphics that are terribly dated today the game <UNK> you into the role of b j don't even think i'm going to attempt spelling his last name an american p o w caught in an underground <UNK> you fight and search your way through <UNK> in order to achieve different <UNK> for the six episodes but let's face it most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders the graphics are as i mentioned before quite dated and very simple the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators if you can get over that however and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you then you've got one heck of a good <UNK> <UNK> game the game play consists of searching for keys health and <UNK> <UNK> enemies aforementioned nazis and a boss enemy per chapter of varying difficulty which of course grows as you move further in the game <UNK> doors and looking for secret rooms there is a bonus count after each level is beaten it goes by how fast you were basically if you beat the <UNK> <UNK> which is the time it took a <UNK> to go through the same level this can be quite fun to try and beat and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in they are even challenging after many play <UNK> how much nazi gold treasure you <UNK> and how many bad guys you killed basically if you got 100 of any of aforementioned you get a bonus helping you reach the <UNK> high score <UNK> the game mostly but not always allows for two <UNK> different methods of playing <UNK> or <UNK> down anything and everything you see you can either run or walk and amongst your weapons is also a knife running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard as is <UNK> many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them nearly <UNK> in your <UNK> you can get no less than four weapons and two keys more about the weapons later the keys <UNK> certain doors most doors in the game aren't locked only two kinds need keys and these keys are only introduced in later levels you <UNK> in levels <UNK> <UNK> health score and lives in each chapter much of the later game is spent looking for them now as i just <UNK> to this game like many of the period late 80's early 90's is based on collecting extra lives personally i think it's completely and utterly useless it was mercifully dropped from here on end i think from the next 3d <UNK> and <UNK> since you can save anytime you want and <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> health and <UNK> like starting on a new chapter which is a real pain in later levels where you need <UNK> <UNK> now i shall beat around the bush no longer moving on to the guns you start with aforementioned knife which is silent but only effective up close and a pistol nothing special but good for <UNK> <UNK> unlike the next two bad boys your third weapon is a german <UNK> a sub machine gun it's faster and automatic and some later enemies use it and the last one is nothing short of a <UNK> gun oh yeah think <UNK> think predator think about <UNK> massive amounts of lead into nazi <UNK> with such a gun it's every bit as entertaining as it sounds most of the boss enemies use this though so be prepared i won't reveal the identities of these boss enemies however that's for each player to discover for him or her self the sound is excellent very crisp and realistic as you hear the tear of a machine gun firing the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a door <UNK> shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german you truly feel like you are there trapped in these dark and depressing <UNK> systems that <UNK> me nicely into the level design as you run through seemingly countless nearly identical <UNK> towards the next elevator leading you further you are <UNK> by the claustrophobic mood i almost got motion sickness more than once though that might also have something to do with little sleep lots of <UNK> and unusual warmth from playing though the level of detail isn't terribly high what there is is great remains of victims <UNK> quarters and countless nazi symbols the list goes on the game also features quite a bit of gore for it's limited graphics engine john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game what is there left to say the first of its kind and it's no wonder this <UNK> countless others 3d <UNK> sure weapon <UNK> and different height levels stairs and such didn't come around until the next entry into the genre doom and it was duke <UNK> 3d that introduced the feature of switching your view so it goes beyond simply left and right adding <UNK> <UNK> to it and jumping didn't come around until a third later title the first <UNK> possibly fellow <UNK> help me out here but all of those games as well as the rest of the genre owe their existence to this one so load up the <UNK> open the door to enter the <UNK> and step into b j 's shoes he deserves the recognition even or maybe even especially nearly fifteen years after he first appeared i recommended this to all fans of 3d games 8 10
<START> an end of an era was released here in the states in spring 2002 with the rookie a disney live action film that seemed to be the best for last it took place right here in texas actually the story began in west texas as <UNK> by an area code found on a sign over there it was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional br br what i liked about this movie it was <UNK> nice it was a very good sports movie ala the mighty <UNK> trilogy it had also taken <UNK> across texas from somewhere between the <UNK> and el <UNK> all the way to the <UNK> where i live i can tell because i recognize that <UNK> was the <UNK> in <UNK> now it's <UNK> field it was nice to see disney's golden age end here in my area br br r i p br br golden age of disney br br 1920s spring 2002 br br it all started with a mouse and it ended with baseball <UNK> br br 10 10
<START> why do they insist on making re makes of great movies like high <UNK> from here to eternity and this one br br why do they think that color is more engrossing to a viewer than stark black and white br br why did <UNK> insist on wearing that dopey broad billed baseball cap it made him look like jim <UNK> br br why would anyone spend four hours suffering through this br br watch the original then you won't have to ask yourself why
<START> i caught this on showtime tonight and was amazed by how a movie with such a interesting premise could wind up being so unbelievably awful who's your daddy stars brandon davis as an adopted high school senior chris hughes a geek who <UNK> the heir to a porn empire left to him by his <UNK> parents though the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun it is ruined by inept directing from first time director andy <UNK> a clichéd and predictable screenplay and acting that is even bad by direct to video standards even the normally funny charlie <UNK> turns in a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend ali <UNK> is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud 1 10
<START> when i saw the previews for this movie i didn't expect much to begin with around a second rate teen horror movie but wow this movie was absolutely awful and that's being generous br br first of all the casting for the movie was terrible you feel no sympathy or for that matter any morbid feeling for the characters the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god awful thing to end br br secondly there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever can somebody please explain to me why the <UNK> looking boy starts screaming <UNK> at the top of his <UNK> while going into jackie chan moves i've never seen before and even further biting the guy who has the virus why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus infected guy and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud where the hell did that come from br br i just simply couldn't believe what i had seen i really thought i had seen some bad movies but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all this movie made me want to <UNK> and then <UNK> again then blow my brains out br br please save yourself an hour and a half and do something more <UNK> watching grass grow perhaps is a proper alternative
<START> where can i begin i heard this movie was coming out and i was very mad i am a huge fan of the original carlito's way and when i heard about this i thought it would be just like almost all the other sequels that come out in hollywood i thought it would be bad boy was i wrong this movie was much worse than i expected not saying all sequels are bad but thats the problem with hollywood these days they make too many sequels and remakes and rush them this was not a theater release it is a dvd release still in my opinion there was no reason at all for this to be made after i heard about this film was in progress i then later heard pacino was not in it that right away killed any chance this movie had of being good why did i check this movie out then some of you may ask well i had the opportunity to see it so i did i don't only watch movies that i have high expectations of i had low expectations on this one obviously i just wanted to see if it would have anything relevant in it now if any of you reading this are a carlito's way fan you know a lot of the story in the first one has to do with him going to jail br br very minor spoiler i wont ruin anything because this may actually make you not want to waste 2 hours watching this trash all i will say is in the end of carlito's way 2 we don't see carlito go to jail now i don't know about any of you but i would have thought a prequel to <UNK> way would show how he ended up in jail i even had some interest in actually seeing what happened br br now thats not my only problem with the film the actor who played carlito did not do too bad a job but he could not have saved this film if he tried there's not even all those little things that should be thrown in there that carlito's way fans would like you don't see any appearance of <UNK> or other key characters in the first one i would have liked to see something like that what is even worse is luis <UNK> is in this film yet he doesn't play the same character he plays in the first film big mistake on their part why cast the same actor for a different character it made the movie worse than it already was br br bottom line i am a carlito's way fan this new straight to dvd release is a disgrace if you are a fan don't watch this movie coming in with high expectations this movie did basically nothing for me and it is definitely one movie i wont be picking up on dvd or watching ever again
<START> this is a most handsome film the color photography is beautiful as it shows the <UNK> of the <UNK> opera house in brilliant color other <UNK> scenes at various <UNK> etc are equally brilliant as for the music what more can be said other than that <UNK> voice was at its' peak as he sang so many of the <UNK> best known and beloved <UNK> the marvelous dorothy kirsten is also a joy as her soprano voice <UNK> with that of lanza in delightful harmony of course hollywood took their <UNK> liberties with the life story of caruso there is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events for example the facts relating to his death are totally <UNK> and bear no relationship to the truth there are some very good web sites that tell the true story of caruso and contain several pictures of him these web sites can be located by using any good search engine there are also several books available concerning his life history but the fictional story line does nothing to <UNK> this beautiful film the voices of lanza kirsten and the chorus members are the real stars of this movie enjoy i know that i sure did
<START> a very silly movie this starts with a soft porn sequence <UNK> into <UNK> comedy in the art gallery adds a shocker of a discovery in the hotel room then introduces a random murder for no obvious reason br br what follows is bizarre and surreal the <UNK> scene in particular is <UNK> unnecessary culminating in a <UNK> twist ending which is as obvious as it is unfair on the viewer see the trivia section for precisely why it's deliberately unfair br br the movie goes out of its way to be offensive to as many groups as possible <UNK> the insane and the wonderful <UNK> bear style racial stereotyping on the subway and <UNK> treats the viewer like an idiot in the closing scenes as characters endlessly explain to one another in great detail and over and over again what just happened in the film though the background female characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch br br in fact the whole movie is a joy to watch despite its many many flaws the whole package just well works
<START> excellent movie albeit slightly predictable i have to comment on nicole <UNK> acting in this movie some of her other works haven't shown the amazing talent this woman has but birthday girl doesn't suffer from this in the slightest even without words <UNK> acting shines through
<START> sunday july 16 8 <UNK> the castro san francisco br br as a southern colonel your make up is very indiana br br the <UNK> <UNK> of hollywood have managed to <UNK> more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years that she had fame handed to her and was <UNK> is often <UNK> considering the <UNK> dramas she was so often pushed into this criticism would seem to have some <UNK> as a <UNK> however her star <UNK> very <UNK> left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have <UNK> mabel <UNK> one of her better <UNK> was king <UNK> show people <UNK> which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars davies and that notorious joe college wise cracker william haines <UNK> has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria <UNK> who began in <UNK> comedies and rose to grand drama and don't think she didn't spend the rest of her life reminding everyone with von <UNK> walsh and demille <UNK> the comedy studios used in this film are the original <UNK> <UNK> had abandoned the year before think of who worked there br br colonel <UNK> <UNK> pepper <UNK> henderson drives his daughter peggy davies from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies these two country <UNK> are unsuspecting fodder for <UNK> billy <UNK> haines  a <UNK> pie artist  who <UNK> on their <UNK> table in an outrageously funny entrance watch for the bit with the <UNK> and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball but a job is a job and billy convinces her all the stars have to take it on the <UNK>  at the preview billy and peggy <UNK> into  charlie chaplin who asks for her <UNK> she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who <UNK> just <UNK> so naturally she <UNK> it's so very funny considering davies character isn't supposed to recognize this guy peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios changes her name to <UNK> <UNK> and leaves poor billy behind davies does a wonderful send up of a serious actress with all the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> lips <UNK> throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder facing the camera that includes polly <UNK> who's also <UNK> funny playing <UNK> maid <UNK> parsons one of the friendly vampires <UNK> taylor claire <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the comedy duo of karl <UNK> with his arm in a <UNK> and george k arthur pretending he's stealing the <UNK> <UNK> joy amused by <UNK> antics <UNK> <UNK> rod eating and smoking la <UNK> mae murray john in a <UNK> gilbert who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture norma <UNK> <UNK> looking bitchy and <UNK> as usual and patricia dressed like marie <UNK> <UNK> between douglas fairbanks as he does an amusing trick and william s hart protecting her from doug billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy <UNK> <UNK> their filming with predictably nutty results <UNK> even works himself into the final scene as the director of <UNK> current production also worth noting are harry <UNK> as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie <UNK> sidney <UNK> as the dramatic director who can't get peggy to cry for her screen test and then can't stop her once she does and paul <UNK> as andre her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony when her character tries to <UNK> its as though davies is <UNK> fun at all the awful dramas she'd been forced into and she's brilliant doing it br br while it's true show people is a hokey satire of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ten years hence it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm irving <UNK> and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent what a shame so much has been lost there are also far too many examples of great films like the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year <UNK> in <UNK> when they could be seen and enjoyed
<START> perspective is a good thing since the release of star wars episode i the phantom menace claims and counter claims of just how <UNK> ii and iii will <UNK> has taken the spotlight off the <UNK> star wars films making them part of a cohesive whole rather than <UNK> the older and new films into separate <UNK> what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films this new <UNK> allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy return of the jedi often <UNK> for its overly <UNK> factor <UNK> is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect the empire strikes back indeed the <UNK> element of <UNK> namely the ewoks remains a weak link in the entire series did george lucas place the <UNK> <UNK> in the film purely for the <UNK> possibilities only he can answer that question br br this cute factor aside the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga following on from the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker mark <UNK> follows his rebel alliance friends to <UNK> his home planet to rescue han solo harrison ford the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by <UNK> the <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> br br skywalker is a changed man since leaving <UNK> with ben <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> alec <UNK> to fight the evil empire now <UNK> all in black <UNK> discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn his psychological make up is not as strong as his <UNK> appearance would suggest while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends he <UNK> for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again despite his <UNK> as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the <UNK> side br br early scenes in <UNK> are impressive from <UNK> <UNK> to his floating palace and the <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> that lives in the sand <UNK> cgi <UNK> to the film in 1997 actually <UNK> the overall effect of the <UNK> making it look fake and overdone br br the battle scene on <UNK> is outstanding and is one of the more memorable of the saga luke almost <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> proving his <UNK> as a jedi is now almost complete br br when luke returns to the <UNK> system to visit the <UNK> <UNK> one more time the viewer is let down by <UNK> distinct lack of <UNK> <UNK> the star of the empire strikes back <UNK> is all but <UNK> from the story as the progression of <UNK> destiny is played out on screen br br <UNK> really is <UNK> film perhaps even more so than the original his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow the romance between leia carrie fisher and solo is all but non <UNK> unlike in empire in fact only <UNK> character is developed in <UNK> <UNK> character seems to fade as the <UNK> of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films br br their roles are <UNK> to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that <UNK> <UNK> this time the emperor himself is <UNK> the final stages of construction the empire <UNK> to crush the rebellion once and for all while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside or is that replace darth vader the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film less cunning than <UNK> <UNK> peter cushing from star wars more deeply psychologically dark than anything else played brilliantly by ian <UNK> the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate br br all the other actors are well <UNK> in their roles <UNK> surprises as the more <UNK> luke making his character's progression from whiny teenager <UNK> student to <UNK> warrior one of the few real character developments of the series ford's role is <UNK> thin as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films he was the real star of the first film after all <UNK> leia is more of a prop at least <UNK> the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about add in favourites like alec <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> c <UNK> and <UNK> and the series resembles a family more than a cast br br despite the film's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence on <UNK> in space and on the death star each with very impressive special effects the music as always is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance just as the <UNK> <UNK> worked perfectly for 2001 a space odyssey john <UNK> score is as much a part of star wars <UNK> as light <UNK> and the force br br lucas left the ending open to interpretation meaning there could have been more episodes made indeed sci fi fans have created their own versions of episodes <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in their heads over and over again <UNK> works when given a chance and <UNK> cute animals aside is a good finish to the series br br when all six episodes get to be viewed together this saga could well be the best ever made is it already the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series this is why return of the jedi can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release
<START> i saw this movie years ago and i was impressed but then again i was only 12 years old i recently re watched it and want that time back this film is pretty bad while i like lee <UNK> chris <UNK> watch my bodyguard 1980 if you would like to see a good movie that he was in of <UNK> also starring bill murray for some laughs and burgess meredith this role does did nothing for their careers br br anyway lee <UNK> character <UNK> hart is an ex race car driver who plans on driving his race car which he had in <UNK> across the country to california one problem the government has <UNK> all private <UNK> i thought the concept was ok not the worse i've heard of but the execution failed horribly
<START> i rented this one to see <UNK> <UNK> one more time she can act but doesn't get a chance in this <UNK> the opening sequence is an elaborate <UNK> shot of mountain landscapes must have come from a stock archive because the movie is shot direct to <UNK> the production values make blair witch look professional there's a really cheesy animated statue but no other effects worth noting this movie is bad but not <UNK> so the players would do well not to mention it on their <UNK>
<START> the film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour it starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good funny story is to come well i can tell you it will not come it will <UNK> in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an <UNK> you will probably not be pleased to witness br br in an interview i heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that according to him the majority of the people in this <UNK> world experience i was amazed to hear that am i living in the same world he lives in ok a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all but that doesn't make me feel like i am losing my identity what does <UNK> think that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch am i <UNK> or is he br br well my vote the good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1 a decent 4 is my conclusion
<START> this is a really well made movie <UNK> <UNK> has always made sensible cinema and this is my favourite film by her this movie should have won the national award and would have been my pick to represent india at the oscars it is at least a thousand times better than <UNK> which is going to the oscars from india this year br br it is such a pity that the information about this and all other indian movies on imdb is lacking and sometimes even wrong <UNK> <UNK> played a very important character in this movie and he is not even credited on these pages the rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all awards and nominations for this movie are not given even when <UNK> <UNK> won the indian national award for this movie there was not even a single vote cast for <UNK> br br <UNK> is not a hindi movie it is <UNK> and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence does not get <UNK> up in <UNK> <UNK> and half witted designer <UNK> it is a real life <UNK> story that is made with a rare understanding and respect br br <UNK> which can roughly be translated as <UNK> <UNK> is a story of two sisters <UNK> and <UNK> it is actually a very simple story <UNK> <UNK> does not venture into many sub plots and that makes it a very difficult film to direct the entire movie is set in a non <UNK> remote village in <UNK> and the screen rarely <UNK> far from the house of the two female protagonists no aesthetic <UNK> in this one br br the movie opens and we are introduced to the entire house which is preparing for <UNK> wedding <UNK> and <UNK> father being a hard working farmer the house is full and happy there is nothing wanting in their simple lives however on the eve of the wedding <UNK> to be husband meets with a fatal accident <UNK> father cannot bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke without a strong working member the house could have fallen apart but <UNK> mother shoulders the responsibility she works as and when she can but cannot make ends meet but her life still is easier than <UNK> <UNK> that people half <UNK> try to forget make <UNK> an evil luck <UNK> she is <UNK> from the society br br <UNK> mother writes to her brother desperate for help she accepts his suggestion he takes <UNK> off to <UNK> where she is made to work in <UNK> <UNK> sends home the money she earns and their conditions improve <UNK> gives her life for that of her family's br br however when <UNK> returns home for <UNK> wedding her mother does not come out to meet her she does not allow <UNK> near her and does not allow <UNK> in front of the guests she loves <UNK> but fears for <UNK> life this breaks <UNK> completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life but <UNK> runs out and holds <UNK> she begs her beloved sister to return <UNK> promises to stand by her promises that they would face the world  together br br there is nothing that is not required in this movie everything is necessary and sufficient <UNK> goes off to <UNK> but what she does there is never told  the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know it just the bare story which is profound in its simplicity br br <UNK> is responsible cinema it is <UNK> to the subject it handles it is <UNK> towards its audience  it does not think them to have the mental <UNK> of a four year old br br the acting is first rate the direction is marvelous  the <UNK> carry the story forward in a way no words could have the script is well <UNK> br br anyone who <UNK> good cinema is bound to like <UNK>

<START> this movie is one of the masterpieces from mr antonioni it is about youth distraction happiness alienation <UNK> honor corruption and it is like everything else from great italian director true art br br
<START> i agree with the last reviewer that this movie had terrible acting yes there was a lot of gore and some nudity but it was overshadowed by a slow moving meaningless plot and dumb ending where was this supposed to be filmed anyway a canadian <UNK> or hong kong hostel was a much better movie and i would recommend seeing that instead a technical annoyance i had with the dvd is that if you shut off the spanish subtitles they return after a few scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again also don't waste your time on the deleted scenes because there's no audio and it just looks like tourist footage
<START> every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human lawrence <UNK> done this again i always felt <UNK> <UNK> was the <UNK> of it's age and he has managed to do it again in grand canyon every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it this is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice the <UNK> of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius i have watched this film a number of times and am <UNK> surprised at how deep the emotions run through this film danny glover and kevin kline do their roles with great <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of a movie <UNK> is priceless thank you again mr <UNK>
<START> mark <UNK> should have felt mighty embarrassed with <UNK> summer this time he uses a new kind of force to regain the possession of his dream machine a bright red <UNK> it looks like another sour teen age flick the first half hour and does a u turn in heading for the wrong direction the writing and directing jobs are dreadfully done with a few scenes you can't hardly take you're expecting this to happen anyway and you're also <UNK> the smell of late 70s <UNK> only a former newcomer like annie <UNK> would easily steal the show and save this poor movie from the <UNK> creeps her <UNK> but delightful personality holds on to your interest for good and this is the finest chance to see her in a <UNK> <UNK> for annie sorry mark i guess the force wasn't with you this time around
<START> minor spoilers br br well i just sat up late and watched this film mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of <UNK> earlier work like <UNK> n the hood however i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived clichéd so called message movies br br the acting is mainly poor pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors take note the situations hard to swallow rape victim becomes overnight lesbian please but worst of all it <UNK> every screwed up stereotype you can think of by the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one dimensional players br br not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural sexual and political ignorance as a result it merely ends up <UNK> the results of these problems it's message is <UNK> resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot <UNK> as for the films conclusion i found it predictable embarrassing exploitative and mildly offensive for a film called higher learning i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again br br if you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire american history x unless you were just watching it for <UNK> banks then go hire a life
<START> possible spoilers br br the biggest part of the movie that doesn't work is the wendigo and when your title character fails your movie usually isn't far behind it the <UNK> interpretation of the <UNK> form is interesting and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly when the fleeing killer sees the wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror for instance and the tree form was actually very good however as a monster character it never really comes to life we don't get much of an explanation for its behavior and what we do see from it doesn't <UNK> with either the story told in the movie itself or any wendigo <UNK> i've ever read br br i think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it isn't given enough to do in the movie when you <UNK> this film down to its bones what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element instead of a movie about a monster br br the cinematography is good though a little cheesy the filmmakers use scenery lighting and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well the character of <UNK> comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable making him the real monster in the film it might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the wendigo which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend br br i have heard <UNK> reports from a <UNK> that the reason the wendigo doesn't do much is that when the monster suit was built it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable in order to <UNK> the stance of it standing on <UNK> <UNK> the performer had to walk on his <UNK> that it was nearly impossible to run walk or otherwise perform in it thus the many flashes of the creature standing still and the obvious <UNK> up footage of it running i stress that these reports are <UNK>
<START> this movie is all ultra lightweight fluff predictable from beginning to end as a don <UNK> vehicle the incredible mr <UNK> was much better with <UNK> character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant his performance there was toned down with none of his trademark <UNK> eyed stare although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish <UNK> made a living of playing the likable <UNK> much as bob denver did neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles assuming they were simply <UNK> it was probably because of the <UNK> the wild stare and the high pitched voice john ritter whom <UNK> worked with in <UNK> company was able to <UNK> his genre <UNK> out successfully into dramatic roles like the <UNK> of oz but the closest <UNK> ever got was a small role in <UNK> even leslie <UNK> was a bad fit here <UNK> neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in airplane and police squad br br there's also no way the then <UNK> year old <UNK> could pass for a 35 year old as his character insisted he was it was as <UNK> unbelievable as tom hanks at <UNK> playing the college age forrest <UNK> br br the film was clearly made on a <UNK> budget very much looking like a <UNK> filmed tv episode it's especially evident in the exterior scenes of the town where roy goes after he's fired it's unlikely even a pre <UNK> would be fooled by the <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> br br even viewing this strictly as a children's movie it's very disappointing it's not because it lacks action or special effects although it does the pace is much too slow the situations repetitive how many times can you watch roy getting onto a bus a comedy for kids should at least sometimes be <UNK> with <UNK> gags otherwise you risk boring them and any adults in the theater as well movies even kid's movies have improved quite a bit in the <UNK> decades even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written disney's the love bug for instance at least had some interesting race action
<START> yes i loved this movie when i was a kid when i was growing up i saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another vhs copy because the old copy had worn out br br my family received a vhs copy of this movie when we purchased a new vhs system at first my mom wasn't sure that this was an appropriate movie for a 10 year old but because we had just bought a new vhs system she let me watch it br br like i said this movie is every little boys <UNK> the movie contains a terrific setting big <UNK> <UNK> beautiful topless women big bad monsters and jokes you'll only get when you get older so a couple of days ago i inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time at first i was bored then started thinking about how much i loved this movie when i was kid and continued watching yeah the experience wasn't as great as i <UNK> the acting is pretty bad the storyline is pretty bad the jokes weren't funny anymore but the women were still pretty yes i've grown up even though the movie experience has changed for me i still think it's worth 7 stars for the good old times you <UNK>
<START> well here i go with another b industry movie it's sad enough to see some badly made films but i don't care if a b industry or c industry produces the film show some effort in your work the characters are really bad the acting isn't in question in this one surprise but plot is how can a tight <UNK> squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered and then go on as if nothing happened what <UNK> me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctor's ass was give me a break
<START> i am <UNK> at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring film br br often with foreign films i skip over reviews that complain about slow pace and seeming absence of action as many of the best international films do not live up to the western hollywood model of cinematic storytelling br br i enjoy the frequent <UNK> and lack of cliché in the foreign film <UNK> i enjoy that many foreign films don't tie things up in a neat <UNK> little bow br br that said this particular film offered no <UNK> value for the time i wasted watching it no meaningful character development no engaging story arc no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on screen br br synopsis a bunch of emotionally immature uptight <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their slaves and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when the house boy finally gets fed up and takes his abuse out on her br br while the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic this movie will bore you while playing out the scenario i was so <UNK> that it took three <UNK> to finish it and i wouldn't have even done that were it not for the positive ratings br br unless you have an academic interest in the period i strongly suggest <UNK> clear of this one
<START> japanese <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mask 1993 is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch there are also some sequels but i haven't seen them since these films are hyper rare some kind of re releases some day would be nice since i think many trash lovers would like these films the tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to <UNK> discipline which is according to the teachers the most important thing in education the school is lead by incredibly funny looking just look at the costume human wizard whatever who is like principal in the school and it only adds to the <UNK> that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally <UNK> well the main thing about the film is its name <UNK> mask who is some beautiful and masked fairy who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers yes this <UNK> is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background the most important thing is of course that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked her identity is never revealed in these films and also the credits say <UNK> mask unknown while the actor names are listed br br the most hilarious thing in this film is how <UNK> mask kills her enemies she has a gorgeous but lethal <UNK> yes you read right she kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them <UNK> her legs and letting the enemies become <UNK> <UNK> of the view after which she flies closer and <UNK> their <UNK> with her legs the most usual last line the characters say in this film are like i've never seen such a beautiful <UNK> and now i can die in peace this film is totally fantastic br br there are also some great <UNK> towards japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films japanese censors <UNK> fog <UNK> all the <UNK> hair in any film and also about some <UNK> among school students like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc there's one great scene in which one nerd sees girl's bare you know what for the first time and says hey there's no fog in it i couldn't help but laugh during this scene as i thought what do the japanese censors think about this also one character says in the end that he will return if japan films allows to make the sequel i'm glad it allowed as i've heard the sequels are equally outrageous one sequel should include blues brothers yes those blues brothers in it etc br br this is trash in its most enjoyable funniest and also <UNK> form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find this would definitely be even greater experience if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point but fortunately those segments are very few this film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements i don't mention here and it wouldn't be even necessary to tell them all here if you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek i think you'll love this little gem as i do and the director is definitely a genius in this field 8 10 perhaps the only film in which a shining <UNK> is this lethal
<START> i have to say that this tv movie was the work that really showed how talented melissa joan hart is we are so used to now seeing her in a sitcom and i really hope that a tv station will show this tv movie again soon as it will show the sabrina fans that <UNK> shines in a drama seen as we have watched her on sabrina now for now 5 years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much <UNK> talent would be a plus melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents done away with so she can be with the guy she loves one thing that all sabrina viewers will notice melissa works with david <UNK> in this well before he took the role of josh on sabrina so it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again hopefully <UNK> gets some good roles in movies or even in more tv movies sort of like <UNK> martin who has always <UNK> in tv movies lots of <UNK> talent waiting to bust out when it comes to melissa joan hart you shine always melissa
<START> excellent p o w adventure adapted by eric williams from his own book a <UNK> copy of which forms part of my father's library that was inspired by true events it may well be the first film of its kind and therefore has a lot to answer for  not just similarly stiff upper <UNK> examples such as albert r n 1953 which i'll be watching <UNK> the <UNK> story 1955 and danger within 1959 but higher profile releases from the other side of the atlantic namely <UNK> 17 1953 and the great escape 1963 this then sets the basis pretty <UNK> british soldiers <UNK> in a german camp <UNK> an ingenious plan of escape <UNK> a page from greek legend  <UNK> from under a <UNK> horse used during physical exercise and in full view of their <UNK> actually the film is neatly split into two <UNK> the first deals with the slow process of digging the tunnel culminating in the escape itself while the latter stages depict their <UNK> outside the camp as they try to make it to neutral sweden typically of these british films the cast showcases several established leo <UNK> current anthony steel and up and coming peter <UNK> david <UNK> and bill <UNK> stars to say nothing of <UNK> reliable character actors anthony dawson bryan forbes michael <UNK> and walter <UNK> the three leads <UNK> are <UNK> steel and <UNK> while the first two stick together the latter goes his own way  only to run into the others on reaching safety as can be expected the narrative involves plenty of suspense and excitement as with most male centered p o w <UNK> too female interest is kept to the <UNK> minimum director lee didn't have a lengthy career  with this and the somewhat similar albeit with a change of both setting and viewpoint a town like alice 1956 his most noteworthy achievements  but he certainly <UNK> every gripping situation in this case even if reportedly <UNK> in filming saw lee <UNK> his post <UNK> producer ian <UNK> with the task of <UNK> up loose ends anyway worth special mention is the exquisite lighting particularly during night time sequences throughout
<START> until the 1990s there had never been a film based upon jane <UNK> emma then two came along in the same year 1996 or if you count <UNK> clueless which <UNK> <UNK> plot to a modern american high school three in two years br br the main character is emma <UNK> a young lady from a well to do family in <UNK> england she is <UNK> considerably better off than most austen <UNK> such as elizabeth bennett or <UNK> price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband instead her main <UNK> seems to be finding husbands for her friends she <UNK> her friend harriet to turn down a <UNK> of marriage from a young farmer robert martin believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious <UNK> mr <UNK> this scheme goes <UNK> wrong however as <UNK> has no interest in harriet but has fallen in love with emma herself the speed with which emma rejects his <UNK> makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an <UNK> marriage partner for herself this being a jane austen plot emma turns out to be less of a committed <UNK> than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complications br br today in 2008 kate beckinsale is a hollywood star but in 1996 despite being only a year younger was not nearly as well known <UNK> as gwyneth paltrow she is however just as convincing as <UNK> well <UNK> but often wrong headed heroine beckinsale seems to have a gift for classical roles she made a delightful hero in kenneth branagh's version of much <UNK> about nothing and i sometimes find myself wishing that hollywood could have found more suitable roles for her rather than wasting her in <UNK> like pearl harbor or underworld br br i preferred jeremy northam to mark strong as <UNK> love interest mr knightley largely because he came closer to my own conception of the character as a <UNK> <UNK> older man in some ways more of a father figure to emma than a lover his <UNK> is probably meant to indicate his <UNK> nature <UNK> century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of <UNK> knights with their elaborate <UNK> of <UNK> strong tends to <UNK> the question of the age difference he is <UNK> she 21 and makes knightley more of a passionate lover and less of a wise mentor than does northam samantha <UNK> another actress who would go on to bigger things is perhaps closer to the harriet of the novel than was toni collette br br this was the more small scale of the two versions being made for television rather than the cinema and the sets and costumes seem less lavish and there are fewer big names among the cast costume drama however is generally something that british television does well and this version can certainly hold its own with the cinema version both are entertaining and well made versions of <UNK> novel 7 10
<START> it took a long time until i could find the title in a special <UNK> in berlin and i was lucky to find an english version with <UNK> <UNK> i think it´s one of the best <UNK> ever it seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy i must admit i <UNK> able to laugh about when i saw it the first time and it was the same with the second time on the one hand <UNK> seems so nice and even cute in his shy behaviour but on the other hand he beats this boy on the <UNK> and there is no explanation for that but the most <UNK> thing is of course his transformation in <UNK> <UNK> and the fact that he <UNK> know who he really is his <UNK> are the most terrifying in this movie of course it´s all in his mind but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in i think <UNK> an interesting question his <UNK> behaviour is hard to understand and it´s horrible to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other the result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of his her window but this terrible cry does that mean that all will repeat again and again and again that his soul is in a cage or something and these egyptian <UNK> and other egyptian stuff the fact that he she looks like a mummy in the hospital <UNK> not an incident but a clue in my point of view
<START> this was a very daring film for it's day it could even be described as soft core porn for the silent era it was a <UNK> but dialog was extremely limited and in german one did not need it anyway br br the young 19 hedy <UNK> gets trapped in a <UNK> marriage to an obsessive stereotype german and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never <UNK> returns home to her father br br in a famous and funny scene she decides to go skinny <UNK> one morning when her horse is distracted by another she is then forced to run across a field chasing after it as she left her clothing on the horse an engineer <UNK> her horse and returns her clothing after getting an <UNK> br br they sit for a while and in a <UNK> moment he presents her with a flower with a <UNK> sitting on top this is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an <UNK> she knows this man is different br br she returns home and eventually seeks out our young fellow and finds the ecstasy she was denied you can use your imagine here but his head disappears from view and we see her <UNK> with pleasure since he never got <UNK> you can imagine certainly an homage to women by the director <UNK> <UNK> and a shock to 1933 audiences br br the only thing that mars this beautifully filmed movie is the excessive guilt and a strange ending
<START> i give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of africa the rest was well pretty boring for about <UNK> we have the outline of the plot in war of the worlds the <UNK> part lasted oh about <UNK> then was real action this is something like let's take a walk in the <UNK> and gasp at the beautiful <UNK> and maybe deliver a message like don't kill elephants very <UNK> i would have expected this out of a new steven segal movie not from this the leading actress makes me think about artificial sun <UNK> <UNK> hair and too much foundation and i didn't see one scene where her hair is messed up or she <UNK> or her clothes are dusty she just doesn't look like a 19 century woman and in the bar where they seek up our hero <UNK> makes a comment about the commander that he looks like dracula hmmm <UNK> <UNK> wrote his book and published it in <UNK> and it became famous in the next years <UNK> and other <UNK> went to central africa from <UNK> to <UNK> so unless the action takes place between <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> we have a problem <UNK> makes a nice impression as a nutshell hard on the outside but soft and <UNK> on the inside not that i would <UNK> with a nut but you get the point he really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions the movie <UNK> way too long and increasingly boring don't watch it don't buy it it's a waste of your money
<START> this is bar none the most hilarious movie i have ever seen beginning with the four <UNK> being sent off by their fathers to <UNK> military academy a tone is set that <UNK> continues all throughout this <UNK> film and it does not let up for a second br br it's tough trying to describe this film the humor elements are so spot on and brilliantly <UNK> that upon a first look it appears as nothing more than a stupid 80's teen lust comedy but it is oh so much more than that fresh from the minds of those folks over at mad magazine up the academy serves up a formula and style that i have never since seen <UNK> by any of the funniest offerings to come out of hollywood in years past basically the film is so full of <UNK> <UNK> material that you might guess that the writers were a couple of 14 year olds themselves see this movie if you love to act immature a classic
<START> i have no idea what idiots gave this movie a palm <UNK> at the 1999 cannes film festival because it was atrocious i actually watched the entire thing simply because i couldn't believe that someone would make such a worthless film there is nothing interesting about the plot the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects also if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand held camcorder and half the time you can't even see the main subjects this style has been used much more successfully in movies such as blair witch because it creates suspense in <UNK> there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything i should have known better when it came on at 2 <UNK> in the morning that it was going to be horrible
<START> barbra <UNK> debut television special is still a <UNK> moment in entertainment history in any media cleverly divided into three separate acts to <UNK> the <UNK> of commercial breaks streisand made the bold yet masterful decision to drop the typical variety show format of the time which is why there is no guest stars nor forced banter and carry the entire show on her shoulders alone the <UNK> move paid off enormously as my name is barbra set a new standard for musical programming on television br br filmed in glorious black and white which actually adds to the <UNK> of the show my name is barbra is <UNK> conceived and <UNK> shot however what makes the show truly <UNK> is streisand herself watching the then 23 year old performer <UNK> herself through the show's <UNK> minute runtime is nothing less than thrilling she is in fantastic voice and even performs the entire first and third acts live and gives first evidence of the immense star power that would soon follow her to the big screen br br the <UNK> biggest asset is it's <UNK> in allowing streisand to simply stand on stage and sing some great songs after the powerful opening performance of much more with a brief opening <UNK> from leonard <UNK> my name is barbara barbra proceeds to wander through a multi level studio set performing a frantic version of the disney classic i'm late in between <UNK> of i'm late streisand stops at various levels of the set to sing some terrific numbers such as the haunting make believe and the <UNK> how does the wine taste halfway through the act i barbra re enters her own childhood to the <UNK> of a kid again and then gives highly energetic performances of i'm five and sweet <UNK> while <UNK> among an over sized set the illusion is eventually <UNK> however as streisand finds herself out of the fantasy and back in the real world she then sings about this lost childhood innocence in the lovely where is the wonder streisand then <UNK> out onto a platform stage surrounded by an entire room full of musicians and performs a rousing rendition of people before the <UNK> applause of a live studio audience br br act ii of the special begins with streisand <UNK> it up for the studio audience with a campy rendition of i've got the blues before delivering a comedy monologue about pearl from <UNK> streisand then heads off to <UNK> <UNK> department store which allows her to sing a <UNK> of poverty songs while <UNK> around in some of the <UNK> elegant fashions this segment is the <UNK> highlight of the special for many fans and critics some high points of the act ii <UNK> include streisand singing a restrained version of second hand rose to the audience appearing as a latin <UNK> to the tune of nobody knows you when you're down and out and portraying a frustrated <UNK> while <UNK> to brother can you spare a dime the third act of the special is a straight concert with no set pieces or concepts streisand is a performer who really <UNK> on the concert stage and this segment is the most thrilling moment of the special streisand enters <UNK> out an almost gravity <UNK> rendition of when the sun comes out and continues to <UNK> the viewer with a lovely version of the <UNK> <UNK> why did i choose you a <UNK> performance of lover come back to me and an <UNK> <UNK> of three songs form funny girl streisand really <UNK> herself however with a phenomenal rendition of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> holiday standard my man which instantly became on of the <UNK> best loved signature songs br br streisand performs her immortal <UNK> version of happy days are here again as the closing credits roll by on the left hand side of the screen the iconic finish to the number <UNK> to the viewer that he or she has indeed seen something truly special my name is barbra was a huge rating triumph when first aired and it eventually picked up five emmy awards in addition to <UNK> two top five gold selling soundtrack albums watching it all again it's absolutely no surprise
<START> this 1997 film <UNK> classic tale of <UNK> passion has achieved its well deserved legendary status as one of the <UNK> greatest <UNK> of a doomed and hopeless love the <UNK> ongoing and <UNK> <UNK> between judge <UNK> and what's her name is sure to set many a viewer's heart a <UNK> with memories of one's own first crush the brilliant screenplay <UNK> this <UNK> affair to be in front of the <UNK> audience sitting <UNK> as the abstract almost <UNK> cinematography deep focuses on the just under the surface desires that <UNK> and flow between the principals you can cut the sexual tension with a dull tire iron br br a tiny drop of <UNK> on the end of a nose catches the bright sunshine and leaves no doubt as to its significance scenes like this abound and bear watching again and again as with jane eyre and rebecca to which this masterpiece is so often compared the closeups of the actors' faces as they experience the slow <UNK> of the great love that is not to be will haunt you forever br br the now classic <UNK> soundtrack score with its creative and unique use of solo <UNK> <UNK> the emotion that <UNK> throughout like a <UNK> <UNK> br br if i had any criticisms at all by mentioning what i consider a minor flaw and <UNK> to risk the wrath of the millions of fans who hold this classic so dear to their hearts i would say that the hallmark of runaway car its sense of <UNK> sexual tension is briefly broken by the highway scene which now after repeated viewings seems just a bit overlong and probably even unnecessary to the eternal bittersweet tale of love interrupted br br dare i advance what i perceive as the <UNK> of flaws in this <UNK> acclaimed triumph of modern cinema <UNK> <UNK> had its <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> should have its <UNK> as well perhaps the film could have opened with an extreme <UNK> of judge <UNK> saying something such as a car is an <UNK> of its owner and the rest of the storyline could then be dedicated to <UNK> every <UNK> subtlety and nuance of that phrase had that plot line been done this film could have topped titanic at the golden <UNK> that year i'm convinced br br my one regret that i didn't read the novel first
<START> spoilers <UNK> br br my high school did all they could to try and <UNK> us for <UNK> but the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest <UNK> who was none other than australian <UNK> favorite son stan the man <UNK> the first mistake they made was giving this guy a <UNK> because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him now his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail stuff but there were various instances where i got really worked up the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no one else he was offered many deals in the past to give up kick boxing but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming <UNK> greatest kick boxer he said that he wasn't a sell out he was happy and a <UNK> he wasn't ever involved in any other activity other than <UNK> then he <UNK> his film yes you heard right he <UNK> his new film as he talked about it he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it and then he showed this <UNK> 4 minute clip of this vile film called <UNK> warrior this all being before he was defeated by <UNK> <UNK> in his final career fight for now br br stan plays <UNK> a kick boxing ex special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of melbourne <UNK> cousin theo arthur angel recently sold out well at least stan didn't stray too far away from everything to the <UNK> and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime <UNK> and theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations from fighting in a <UNK> shop to posing as <UNK> at a bondage party it's all pretty ridiculous but if <UNK> was actually aiming to make a credible film here this man should never be handed a camera again br br i'll admit i was actually <UNK> to see this i love action films even if they're corny and especially if it's set in my own backyard but what i was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word go and continued to do so after the words for the love of god please make it stop subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever and the most over choreographed fight scenes that didn't even remotely reflect <UNK> actual talent in <UNK> the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous <UNK> <UNK> mark <UNK> read and greg <UNK> the whole time you're sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background too bad the movie relies heavily on split second appearances by former celebrities remember those plot holes i told you about <UNK> once upon a time was apparently locked up wrongly accused for murdering his wife now we hear that <UNK> was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film and then leave it for <UNK> this is followed by another single sentence which <UNK> <UNK> to help the same people who wrongly locked him up then get this at the end it is revealed to <UNK> that his wife isn't actually dead but was sold into prostitution do we see her no does <UNK> go off to find her as soon as he hears this no now that's a marriage br br amidst all this <UNK> <UNK> crap some website described this film as <UNK> cross between jackie chan guy <UNK> has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film chan shows more <UNK> taking a dump than stan did <UNK> well anything and guy ritchie is the crime film <UNK> and you're comparing him to <UNK> <UNK> this film is more like a mix between pizza and enter the ninja br br now where do you thing the whole <UNK> warrior title comes from <UNK> fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior no the <UNK> <UNK> to find theo like that of the <UNK> empire no it's <UNK> wait for <UNK> theo carries a <UNK> around with him yes that right because theo is always prepared with a <UNK> brand rubber in his pocket he is a <UNK> warrior br br i had the <UNK> of seeing <UNK> warrior on dvd as well as it's special features br br <UNK> video clip of chop chop a rap song by mark <UNK> read <UNK> did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap the funny thing was <UNK> just <UNK> for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two <UNK> teens from <UNK> using such words as <UNK> and <UNK> etc in their australian accents face it people rap was developed in the states leave it there the clip looked like something a channel <UNK> cameraman on ecstasy put together br br <UNK> <UNK> there was no real difference between these and the actual film br br <UNK> stan the man <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this wasn't too bad considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles i think i saw dennis <UNK> fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage br br i don't want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film but oh wait i just did my advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of <UNK> warrior tape them together and use it for a <UNK> because this movie is just that damn bad
<START> this movie was on t v the other day and i didn't enjoy it at all the first george of the jungle was a good comedy but the sequel completely awful the new actor and actress to play the lead roles weren't good at all they should of had the original actor <UNK> <UNK> and original actress i forgot her name so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought it was good to see ape the ape back but wasn't as fun as the first they should of had the new george as georges son grown up and still had <UNK> and whats her face in the film that would've been a bit better then it was
<START> there are some wonderful things about this movie marion davies could act given the right property she is wonderful in comedic roles william haines could act and you can see why he was one of the <UNK> most popular leading men until a potential scandal forced him from the business br br the story is a bit trite but handled so beautifully that you don't notice king <UNK> direction is one of the principle reasons for this the producer the boy genius irving <UNK> br br it's about movie making and you get to see the process as it was done in <UNK> the cameras sets directors directing and actors <UNK> you get to see briefly some of the major stars of the day even charlie chaplin does a turn as himself seeking an <UNK> you also catch glimpses of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> claire <UNK> king <UNK> and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographs br br please even if you're not a fan of the <UNK> take the time to catch this film when you can it's really a terrific trip back in time
<START> this movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional indian values which are being replaced by western ones its a joint family story showing all the <UNK> every person should follow while <UNK> with every single relative around shahid kapoor gives a <UNK> performance as a <UNK> about to tie <UNK> with amrita <UNK> who is also very <UNK> and she also acts pretty well the genre of the movie is the same as <UNK> and such movies deserve to be made in india for the revival of old traditional values the movies doesn't get 10 as it isn't very good at music which counts a lot in every movie besides this it is flawless
<START> ok i knew this would be a back alley f film well below b film standards going into it so i thought man i could use a good laugh so let's see some <UNK> beings kill each other well what i got could have been found at your local love toy store random lesbian scenes very little fighting and no plot br br for example one scene in particular i remember for its sheer stupidity only i've seen better porn on abc is where the two main characters i can't remember their names <UNK> great movie huh are driving along as they mostly did and the driver was tired of driving and stopped br br driver let's pull over i'm tired you want to take over passenger sure i can drive for a while once pulled over the driver starts grabbing the <UNK> boobs passenger what are you doing i'm not like that driver it's ok everyone does it sometime passenger ok then proceed to take off shirts <UNK> kiss and perform <UNK> br br now last time i checked horror films were not in the porn section of hollywood video unless you're into s m then you go elsewhere and it definitely shouldn't be in the mainstream videos at blockbuster don't get me wrong i'm definitely not one of those people who hate porn but i only watch it when appropriate and definitely don't want to watch it if i'm looking for a movie in the mainstream stores as this one i rented was at one of the two <UNK> i named and probably at the other too if i went and looked br br worst movie ever no one should rent it and it should only be bought for a public burning ceremony if i could give it a 0 i would but i can only give it a of 10
<START> i hate to sound like an <UNK> <UNK> but frankly i haven't seen too many movies that i like that were made after 1960 generally movies just seem to get worse and worse although i quite enjoyed the scott <UNK> vehicle the bread my sweet except for the <UNK> <UNK> sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie this movie makes the mother a former las vegas chorus girl seem to be incapable of surviving on her own although she is clearly in her 50s though hinted at being in her 40s i didn't buy it i'm <UNK> and like all the women i know in their 50s and 40s more than capable of surviving on my own as i have been doing since i <UNK> from high school at 13 got <UNK> <UNK> and set off on my own life's journey br br the daughter is not believable in her job role she gets a promotion she doesn't deserve a great opportunity and drops that ball too but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver the writers shoot her down as an <UNK> when she was just doing what any career oriented person would do taking advantage of a wide open opportunity created by the lack of self discipline of her <UNK> a girl who apparently doesn't understand the concept of <UNK> her promises to her boss in this case br br the daughter <UNK> <UNK> her mother to stay with her on a temporary basis but then treats her mother the woman who gave her life and raised her to <UNK> like a <UNK> apparently the <UNK> of tripe like this do not understand that it is not 'the common <UNK> for parents to act like children and then be treated as children by their children that is just more of the societal <UNK> that hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we their public were stupid for <UNK> to be entertained by their creative offerings br br this is a sad movie with a stupid ending if the young male <UNK> had been real and not a two dimensional <UNK> <UNK> he'd have stayed with the mother who was not that much older than him and quite attractive but in the end he <UNK> for the daughter a shallow rather uninteresting girl who has that <UNK> of youth but in an ordinary bland way the <UNK> young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive physically br br there was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the <UNK> preferred the daughter who was an uptight selfish self centered b <UNK> who treated her mother with unbelievable <UNK> to the mother a woman who was <UNK> sweet <UNK> humorous and had a <UNK> de <UNK> the daughter could not even begin to comprehend of course the mother had her own flaws she had <UNK> to her husband's demise by drinking herself into a <UNK> for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the <UNK> between her and her smarmy daughter br br regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed this is a <UNK> movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually like <UNK> where's the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again michael keaton is put in charge of <UNK> a japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of <UNK> what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another the two cultures clash and it is up to keaton to hold things together look for great performances from keaton <UNK> <UNK> george <UNK> <UNK> rogers john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all are perfectly cast don't be fooled by the low number rating this is a 7 5 in my book it is interesting to note that the town name of <UNK> was also used in high <UNK> yes there is a real <UNK> but in <UNK>
<START> walter matthau and george burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act lewis and clark who haven't spoken in over 10 years burns retired and matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since such is the premise of this hilarious neil simon play made into a movie of course what makes it so good is matthau and burns in their prime and the material is funnier than anything you can find today richard benjamin shines as <UNK> nephew and agent there's even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film and character actor fritz <UNK> starts it all off with a pop <UNK> <UNK> who started out in the 30s in theater with orson welles and later was grandma on family matters is great in a small role br br the only problem i had with it and maybe i'm being too <UNK> and or serious is the way matthau treats burns when they first meet granted he's had a lot of <UNK> <UNK> in all these years but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context also i'm used to seeing matthau act that way in other movies but not to george burns and <UNK> <UNK> tends to get a little old br br all in all if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles put in the sunshine boys they'll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of life br br benjamin you have to slide it br br matthau wait wait i think you have to slide it
<START> oh man is this movie bad it flows horribly the story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this doesn't love himself he tries getting out of the contract and horrible painfully unfunny gags ensue jim <UNK> seems as if he's <UNK> not acting you'll miss such burt <UNK> as dom <UNK> and jerry reed while watching this stinker <UNK> <UNK> hair is downright scary proving that tons of <UNK> didn't go out in the sixties or maybe that was a wig speaking of <UNK> wig wasn't bad in this film his worst wig day was in <UNK> and the <UNK> 2 anyhow this movie is the worst reynolds car movie ever ever right up there with <UNK> run 2 the original <UNK> and <UNK> and hooper which thankfully had no sequel are great funny films this one isn't even ned beatty who is a great actor stinks you'll long for a jackie <UNK> type villain who is fun to hate and mind you this isn't one of those fun movies to bag on it's lousy pure and simple even the <UNK> at the end were tiresome and boring and worst of all unfunny and least i forget <UNK> ace was one of the first heavy nails to seal <UNK> coffin before his somewhat revival years later in boogie nights another film that like deliverance years earlier shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so
<START> so what <UNK> a real independent film in a day and age where the latest <UNK> of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge i'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing <UNK> br br which is why we should be glad that films like hatred of a minute exist across the board this film makes a point out of <UNK> its own <UNK> indie horror film love it or hate it hatred isn't afraid of being what it is and in watching this film you get the real sense that <UNK> the director didn't just make this film to <UNK> fake blood all over the place he's in this to tell stories good ones you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store but don't be fooled this story is also about love about good people pushed over the edge and that oh so distant light at the end of the tunnel br br if you expect <UNK> or an evil dead ripoff stay away from this film but if you dig the <UNK> points of the horror suspense genres check this film out br br yes bruce campbell did produce this movie and i'm sure he's proud to tell anyone that it's not evil dead bruce has never tried to bank on his ash image and it's obvious that he didn't get involved with hatred so that it could do so either br br my advice though to all dead <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> anything <UNK> by mr campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr <UNK> and mr campbell are trying to show you br br the acting is well done although nothing about this film is oscar caliber perhaps intentionally it's good to see compassionate performances in a horror film so often actors in films such as these don't even seem to try with hatred it seemed as though all the actors took <UNK> <UNK> very seriously never <UNK> to typical horror film <UNK> br br technically hatred is about as competent as indie film gets the editing is fast paced the cinematography is good given the budget and hatred keeps a quick pace without any <UNK> down points or bad anti <UNK> br br all in all hatred may not have the <UNK> over look of all those multi million dollar fake <UNK> but personally i don't see a problem with that it's a film by folks who actually care about the medium people who reached into <UNK> broke ass <UNK> pulled out <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie br br check this one out
<START> i was raised watching the original batman animated series and am an avid batman graphic novel collector with a comic book hero as iconic as batman there are certain traits that cannot be changed creative liberties are all well and good but when it completely changes the character then it is too far i purchased one of the seasons of the batman in the hopes that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the <UNK> reasoning for making this show such an atrocity in an interview on the making of the batman one of the artists or writers i'm unsure which said that we felt we shouldn't mess with batman but we could mess with the villains so they <UNK> to make the joker into an immature little kid begging for attention the penguin into some anime <UNK> mr freeze into a super powered jewel thief poison <UNK> into a teenage hippie and countless other shameful acts which are making bob kane roll over in his grave br br to sum it all up i wish i had more hands so i could give this show four thumbs down it <UNK> by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the batman name warner bros <UNK> this please
<START> are you familiar with concept of children's artwork while it is not the greatest <UNK> any three year old has ever accomplished with their fingers you encourage them to do more if painting is what makes them happy there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child typically if a child loves to paint or draw you will immediately see the <UNK> of their future style you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive <UNK> well this concept of children's artwork is how i felt about <UNK> <UNK> cheap and <UNK> film bait while on all accounts it was a horrid film it was impressive to see <UNK> style begin <UNK> through even the <UNK> of moments if you have seen either training day or king arthur you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait while foxx gives a horrid <UNK> performance there are certain scenes which define <UNK> and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film but if you focus just on those scenes you will see why <UNK> name appears on so many best <UNK> film lists br br i will never disagree with someone that <UNK> eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the <UNK> of emotions is shocking i am surprised that more of hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this <UNK> even in the silly feature bait you are witness to <UNK> greatness two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end in both of these scenes i saw the director <UNK> at work alas in the rest of this film all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood we have seen this two often and no matter who you are unless you are charlie <UNK> you cannot recreate the wheel it is just impossible with this genre and it is proved with bait i was annoyed with <UNK> for just sitting back and allowing this to happen which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film i was just tired of the structure and while i hoped that <UNK> would <UNK> it he did not br br then there was the acting while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor i was willing to give this <UNK> vehicle a try i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to <UNK> i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in <UNK> again i was disappointed foxx was annoying not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be but in the sense that it felt as if neither <UNK> nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be ad <UNK> and what should be used to further the plot instead we are <UNK> with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh adding second long <UNK> and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first an actor second <UNK> should have stopped this immediately <UNK> jokes destroyed his character which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp <UNK> of instead of character development he would crack a joke neither style worked no joke was funny the rest of the cast was average by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles they were <UNK> nothing new to the table nothing solid to the story and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film they were <UNK> filling in dead air space <UNK> had no control over this mess and the final verdict only supports that <UNK> br br overall this was a sad film with no creativity in sight and <UNK> actors just trying to <UNK> themselves what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic <UNK> foxx was annoying without character lines and a complete bag of cheese in each scene i saw no emotion and when emotion was needed to convey a message he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues are my words harsh i don't think so when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity some <UNK> characters and themes that seem to hit close to home bait contained none of these while i will give <UNK> some credit for two of the scenes in this film the remaining five hundred were disastrous apparently i took the bait when renting this film but now having seen it hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious <UNK> br br grade out of for his two scenes that were fun to watch
<START> there is a scene in dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the <UNK> puzzle first the answer to one of the clues is murphy's law anything that can go wrong will go wrong this is exactly the case for dan burns steve carell the office a <UNK> for the local newspaper dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own dan in real life is amazing at capturing these <UNK> of everyday life and is successful at <UNK> the comedy tragedy and beauty of them all besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious br br the death of his wife forces dan to raise his three daughters all on his own each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life the first one anxious to try out her drivers license the middle one well into her teenage angst phase and the youngest one <UNK> away from early childhood things take a turn for dan when he goes to <UNK> island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a <UNK> br br her name is marie juliette <UNK> <UNK> and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the burns family household br br if you've seen steve carell in the office or little miss sunshine you'd know that he is <UNK> with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well steve carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life the frustration and sincere compassion the family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that <UNK> the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax the movie only falls short in some of the predictable <UNK> yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability which is an irony within itself br br dan in real life is definitely worth seeing for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life and i'll most likely enjoy it a second time or even a third just put it on my <UNK>
<START> i couldn't believe my eyes once i've watched this movie there's no point in it either then blood and violence unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood gore and killing one after another this movie isn't interesting at all has no meaningful plot or story line nor does it have an intelligence in it the blood looks very fake and this movie overall is pointless don't even waste your time with it it's just an hour or two of mindless violence it has many bloody scenes that aren't scary but just plain revolting this is probably the worst horror film i have ever watched out of all the horror films i ever saw
<START> when i bought this dvd i though it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese <UNK> let's give it a <UNK> i was totally wrong what a disappointing movie first it's not a comedy it's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many portuguese soap operas second the plot is so boring and leads <UNK> it has no structure it just flows like the wind in one or another <UNK> the production is also bad the sound mixing is horrible because sometimes the voices are <UNK> it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the <UNK> the acting should have been better <UNK> well to sum up it's not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve in fact it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years bad argument bad acting bad <UNK> i had no high hopes for this movie but it was much worse than i've ever imagined just forget about it
<START> this isn't a bad movie but it's the type your girlfriend makes you watch the story isn't bad it just makes the hour and a half seem so long it's hard for me to trash this movie because i really do like the idea of it but it was just to long and thin on story too bad the main character never really seems to change all that much from beginning to end i mean goes through something life changing and he can barely break a smile i really thought mac was really good his weird <UNK> kept the movie from being a complete disaster maybe i just don't get this film if anyone can explain it to me i'd love to be informed
<START> these are one of the movies that don't require any brain or thinking it's a very funny time pass which you forgot in the next hour or so i was really surprised with john <UNK> acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the <UNK> face so from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfully by managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> kumar i was also quite surprised with the <UNK> 3 girls because there roles don't require much talent but mostly <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> to the other girls i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could <UNK> between them which is a good thing also majority of songs are good it is colourful and fun so on a boring sunday evening this will sure <UNK> your mood
<START> this is a very amusing and sometimes quite creepy anthology that if a bit short in the <UNK> department more than makes up for the <UNK> in the acting location work and overall <UNK> the best episodes of this are the first with <UNK> elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian the third with christopher lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final episode with the late great jon pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project the dialogue between pertwee and ingrid pitt is <UNK> and inspired both obviously <UNK> the opportunity to really ham it up cushing is typically good in the weakest segment which certainly isn't helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he's obsessed with down at the local wax museum is anything but beautiful as we are told to believe she is someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we're given a woman with a jaw of a turtle minor <UNK> aside this movie and it's wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can
<START> i have seen the recent region 2 dvd of this movie displayed in the horror section in an <UNK> street store and also advertised as a classic thriller in reality it is almost solely a vehicle for arthur <UNK> one of the most popular names in british comedy and light entertainment for over four decades br br perhaps his <UNK> cheerful <UNK> and essentially good natured humour comes as a bit of a culture shock to many <UNK> to the sour and cynical <UNK> of much british comedy of the past twenty five years however there are still those who appreciate his lively and <UNK> persona and total <UNK> of pathos <UNK> was an idol of the great tommy cooper who frequently borrowed the self <UNK> gag that arthur attempts to entertain the stranded passengers with br br there is a striking rare appearance by the under rated <UNK> <UNK> who makes an impact as the mysterious julie
<START> this show is wonderful it has some of the best writing i ever seen it has brilliant directing by <UNK> <UNK> who also directed another smart television series called boy meets world br br this show is with out a <UNK> one of the greatest like <UNK> company <UNK> and the famous <UNK> show this will be on television for a long time to come br br from it's perfectly crafted jokes to the great performances you would only dream of this is a wonderful show for people who lived in the seventies and the people who didn't this show appeals to the young and the young at heart a perfect show
<START> just <UNK> a friend who's in film school about this flick something to avoid when making a film characters <UNK> senseless overwrought convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing if the film is an attempt at social realism these verbal <UNK> are so over the top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively <UNK> that intent is it the acting or the script that is bad or both br br the protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> english literature and the bible while high or <UNK> and able to produce such profoundly <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> and how is such an unattractive <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of <UNK> them i had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street despite his whining and self <UNK> banter br br the viewer encounters pretentious references to ancient greek literature <UNK> and the book of revelations the impending doom of mankind in the form of bar <UNK> <UNK> on our <UNK> or right hands in spooky biblical fashion is presented to a character who is oh so cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space br br this flick is over scripted and over the top a melodrama clumsily <UNK> with pedestrian philosophy about the meaning of mankind life etc it is trite overwrought and tedious br br there are some very fine english films available with content similar to this film <UNK> by mouth is an excellent far more interesting <UNK> into the lives of individuals in a similar social <UNK> <UNK> for in the <UNK> and although the comparison is not even <UNK> check out anything by peter <UNK> who far more <UNK> handles dialogue wit and absurd characters and situations
<START> if only eddie murphy were born 10 years later then we'd all remember it but even i was only 4 when it came out if you haven't seen it yet rent dr <UNK> showtime i spy <UNK> <UNK> and all <UNK> family comedy movies then watch this hands down you'll laugh 90 of the time the other 10 you'll be <UNK> the tears from your eyes br br it really needs to be watched more then once to understand all the jokes from crude humor to a joke for kids if you've seen it you'll laugh here you'll love his stuff if you can or are a big fan try to <UNK> clips from <UNK> acts <UNK> of the shows are different as you'd imagine and he has even more funny jokes br br but this is like the best of eddie murphy <UNK> <UNK> if you will br br and all i can say is please don't watch delirious if you don't like comedy don't have a sense of humor or are not fun to hang out with you will only put down this great eddie murphy classic and possibly make someone miss out on it br br if you wanna know how eddie got beverly hills cop and got famous from it delirious is it
<START> i couldn't agree more with the other comment it's like falling down peter <UNK> is ok and william hurt great as always except in lost in space this is a good movie with pretty good performances very <UNK> if you like falling down you're going to enjoy this one 8 of 10
<START> i was expecting to love this movie film noir serial killer dark irony i was <UNK> by many choices the characters made hey i know they're creepy looking but let's hook up for a cross country road trip anyway found the pacing to be <UNK> and the emphasis on moody lighting to take the place of original thought by the director and cinematographer br br thinking about it now this would have been a much better movie if someone had just run the script through the common sense o <UNK> 1992 model before starting to film
<START> despite having known people who are either great fans of noam <UNK> or think he's a tired <UNK> from the 1960s i really had no opinion of the man save that i knew he gained fame as a <UNK> although i could not <UNK> any of his theories and that he was a liberal <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> so stumbling across the dvd of the 2003 documentary noam <UNK> rebel without a pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 11 i decided to get it just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him while glad i got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited <UNK> was so what's all the fuss about br br for a man with so many degrees <UNK> as 'the most important intellectual <UNK> by the new york times according to the dvd's case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and i wouldn't even want to watch what a william f <UNK> could do to him granted the whole film was seemingly about <UNK> seeing <UNK> everywhere and having <UNK> eyed <UNK> nod in <UNK> <UNK> of the most inane and outrageous things he'd say rather than being on <UNK> so maybe that's the reason he came off so badly but again if he is a <UNK> and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise  even worse are his <UNK> who seem to further <UNK> the man from reality by <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> is a target for <UNK> <UNK> what little i knew of <UNK> before watching this film this much i knew he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the soviet empire the film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that it's difficult to separate all of the <UNK> his wife carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film she seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 11 was a great thing for the <UNK> for he has <UNK> a great deal of money in speaking <UNK> since then br br not surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no <UNK> background it's assumed that all viewers must know all the <UNK> this <UNK> man' bears <UNK> is rarely interviewed one on one <UNK> there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> on this or that and slack <UNK> and <UNK> students looking at him as if he were <UNK> that is when <UNK> <UNK> are not asking barely <UNK> and ridiculously simplistic questions to him this is really poor film making by director and editor will <UNK> who in the dvd's filmmaker statement shows he's yet another <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> other than that one of the <UNK> signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere <UNK> and a vanity piece of <UNK> at that is that not a single time is <UNK> shown struggling with an answer he seems to be a <UNK> of knowledge that has no <UNK> br br given that much of this dreck was filmed during <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> university in <UNK> canada prior to the american invasion of iraq in 2003 much of what <UNK> says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era yes he makes some good points here and there on american media <UNK> before the war but he follows them up with sheer <UNK> for he seems to not realize that most <UNK> are ad <UNK> and not fully plotted out <UNK> as example he claims that the advertising industry is a <UNK> that mercilessly controls the <UNK> but says not a word about the <UNK> <UNK> that lets itself be so controlled similarly he claims <UNK> run the world and that people's fear of crime is yet another <UNK> result of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when castro and company were great <UNK> of it in latin america asia and africa until the soviet union fell i can only guess that the <UNK> <UNK> are just waiting for <UNK> to <UNK> that gray aliens have set up species mixing <UNK> centers up in <UNK> br br in his <UNK> world without <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> as dense as the members of <UNK> whom he <UNK> are even more so since they lay no claim to being <UNK> in short <UNK> is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually near this film's end he warns <UNK> <UNK> when you hear about <UNK> being fighters for justice ' yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn't like no matter how <UNK> their crimes and anti intellectual their <UNK> please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant dvd
<START> i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic <UNK> the way it shows the various <UNK> leaving together in thailand is very interesting the portuguese the japanese and the various <UNK> being managed by the king the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of <UNK> the wardrobe is fine the film is also done <UNK> in thailand in a reasonable production the scene with the <UNK> as <UNK> is very interesting it is fun and i think that is also <UNK> in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective
<START> i just rented creep and was not at all impressed i didn't feel anything in this film i felt sick because the gore alone was shocking br br i walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film haven't we seen this all before i didn't like any of the characters <UNK> the guy in the <UNK> cage i felt bad for him but then again i couldn't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep so many questions need to be answered br br someone mentioned references to the <UNK> game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguely br br not a bad film not a good one judge for yourself
<START> in life we first <UNK> stones <UNK> in spanish such as a career family friendship and love in this way we shall find space between these to fit smaller stones our small <UNK> if you act in an <UNK> way you will not have enough room for larger stones the five protagonists in this film are women who have not been able to <UNK> the large stones in their lives <UNK> <UNK> a spanish motion picture director <UNK> his first feature stones in this way the film tells the parallel <UNK> <UNK> of five women anita monica <UNK> 1975 <UNK> angela <UNK> 1955 <UNK> <UNK> san juan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1972 and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1954 all are <UNK> to remove the stones that <UNK> appear in their path or worst that are in their shoes they are five <UNK> in search of prince charming and a new chance in life the best story of these five <UNK> is that of anita monica <UNK> who also stars in 20 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> y <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> booker of <UNK> california
<START> holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people one of them i will name the other two are mysteries and will remain so holes is a story about stanley <UNK> iv he is unlucky in life unlucky in fact <UNK> the <UNK> of most of the <UNK> men and has been since exploits of stanley <UNK> no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather ' those particular exploits cursed the family's men to many an ill <UNK> turn it is during just such a turn that we meet stanley iv he has been accused <UNK> of stealing a pair of baseball shoes <UNK> <UNK> to a homeless shelter <UNK> by a famous baseball player he is given the option of jail or he can go to a character building camp i've never been to camp before ' says stanley with that the judge <UNK> sends him off to camp green lake br br camp green lake is an odd place with an odd philosophy if you take a bad boy make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun it will turn him into a good boy ' we learn this little pearl of wisdom from mr sir john voight one of the <UNK> <UNK> ' we get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man he at least wears his attitude honestly he doesn't think he is nice the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mr <UNK> tim blake nelson is a different matter entirely he acts the part of the caring sensitive <UNK> but he quick <UNK> than anyone else in authority to <UNK> the most cruel verbal <UNK> at his charges the warden has a decided capacity for <UNK> but other than that she is a mystery these three rule camp green lake a place that has no lake it is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes five feet deep and five feet wide its local <UNK> seem only to be the <UNK> and dangerous <UNK> yellow spotted <UNK> green lake seems is in many ways a haunted place br br holes works in spite of the strange setting and the strange story because it understands people specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of camp green lake the movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly it captures the way boys can bully each other they way they can win admiration the way they fight with one another and the way boys ally themselves along the age line it is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable what is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character he does not believe in a family curse he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather ' in fact he loves hearing the story stanley iv is not bitter about the past and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather there is at times a lot of sadness in the film but not a lot <UNK> <UNK> silliness and that is refreshing br br holes is an intelligent insightful and witty family movie it entertains and not in any cheap way it is not a comedy though it has its laughs it <UNK> to be compelling where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional as such it <UNK> the family movie <UNK> and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy i give it a 10
<START> apparently hollywood is just <UNK> out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak this movie was mind numbingly bad the casting was terrible the acting <UNK> and the story filled with holes script who needs script i was surprised that the movie wasn't as <UNK> vulgar as i thought it would be however i got enough shots of t a to last me a lifetime the movie was like listening to a 19 year old street <UNK> with add who decided to buy a car instead of go to college tell a story being so poorly scripted i thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first the scenes at the <UNK> along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of <UNK> fully loaded this is the kind of film is what <UNK> <UNK> itself after only the writers thought they were being serious
<START> love the characters and the story line very funny with plenty of action thomas ian griffith and <UNK> <UNK> give great performances i enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of griffith and career donald <UNK> plays a very likable and surprisingly sympathetic burnt out hit man all three actors are among my favorites and having them in this movie made for a special treat a nice addition to my extensive dvd collection i highly recommend this movie if you like mr and mrs smith the replacement killers l a <UNK> the long kiss <UNK> the <UNK> and the whole nine <UNK> you will love this movie
<START> i happened across bait on cable one night just as it started and thought eh why not i'm glad i gave it a chance br br bait ain't perfect it suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional <UNK> but overall this movie worked all the elements <UNK> just right and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film br br most of that i think is due to jamie foxx i don't know who <UNK> foxx for the lead but whoever it was did this movie a big favor believable and amazingly likeable foxx <UNK> through the movie smooth as <UNK> and funnier than hell you can tell he's working on instinct and instinct doesn't fail him br br the plot while <UNK> actually ties together pretty well and there's even a character arc through which <UNK> character grows as a person again they could've slipped by without any of this but it just makes things that much better br br i'm surprised at the low rating for this maybe i just caught this move on the right night or vice versa but i'd give it a 7 10 bravo <UNK> foxx
<START> my name is modesty is a low budget film that tells the story of the origins of modesty blaise it's not that the movie is terrible it's just not what i was expecting or hoping for while i've been aware of the modesty blaise character for years i'm not overly familiar with the comic <UNK> or the graphic novels so i'm coming into this movie as something as an <UNK> that may be part of the reason for my disappointment i was expecting more action and more comedy the film is dialogue driven i suppose i was looking for something with a little more camp value as it is my name is modesty is a <UNK> serious film there are very few if any light moments the acting at least from alexandra <UNK> is acceptable but nothing outstanding as others have commented she does appear a little too <UNK> to be completely believable in the title role what action scenes there are in my name is modesty are one of the films weakest points i never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers br br i really hope quentin tarantino goes ahead and makes the <UNK> a big budget film based on the modesty blaise character i'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and i would very much look forward to it
<START> when anti bush jokes get really easy to do a show like this had better make sure it has something extra when that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don't have yet it's just plain nonsense dick <UNK> and george bush are done well but dick <UNK> <UNK> mostly there's also <UNK> rice who has a crush on bush for some reason and donald <UNK> who isn't really that similar to donald <UNK> at all the <UNK> characters rarely give their names so it's a mystery as to who could be who aside from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br the episodes have coherent stories but that's not nearly enough to keep this from sinking
<START> ho ho homicidal maniac this spirited tour de force adaptation of a great <UNK> comics horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable tv series ever made director robert back to the future <UNK> makes the most out of a witty script by fred night of the creeps the monster squad <UNK> which centers on a ruthless two timing housewife well played by mary ellen <UNK> who was married to <UNK> when she starred in this episode who kills her <UNK> jerk of a husband a nice cameo by marshall bell on christmas eve by <UNK> him upside the head with a fire poker complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly kris <UNK> escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay <UNK> a decidedly <UNK> visit alan <UNK> spooky stirring score and dean <UNK> typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun and larry drake the sweet gentle giant benny on l a law with his creepy <UNK> <UNK> a demented <UNK> in his bright green eyes and a <UNK> truly wicked grin makes for a sensational <UNK> saint nick
<START> full house is a wonderful sitcom that is about a dad danny <UNK> whose wife had just died in a car crash so danny asks his brother in law jesse <UNK> and best friend joey <UNK> to help raise his three girls donna jo <UNK> <UNK> stephanie <UNK> and michelle <UNK> this is my favorite show ever and i can watch it all day long and something on full house is always making me laugh and there are sad parts also there is never a dull moment in full house the main characters are played by bob <UNK> danny <UNK> john <UNK> jesse <UNK> dave <UNK> joey <UNK> <UNK> cameron dj <UNK> jodie <UNK> stephanie <UNK> and mary kate ashley olsen michelle <UNK>
<START> highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent spanish production about well let me see just how close i can get to it the film opens with a woman having one of her <UNK> killed by a young girl she then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this what relevance this plays out to is <UNK> guess at the film's end because the guy a <UNK> photographer spies a beautiful patty shepard queen of spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off <UNK> so he can snap a picture ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment to witches mountain for reasons again we are never <UNK> to before they go patty must stop by the house and loud eerie <UNK> echoes in our hero's ears again this is never explained the film goes on with these two stopping at an <UNK> going on to the mountain and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film it has some atmosphere some of the character actors are really quite good especially the deaf <UNK> and the old woman the leads are at least adequate and the climax though it makes absolutely no sense at all is well choreographed literally with the witches in white <UNK> and long black hair it just doesn't make any sense though and that is a huge <UNK> to me i could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing that is a major problem the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap atmospheric european horror films that <UNK> that decade if you can get more out of it than me better power to you
<START> i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released many reviewers out there aren't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king the enormously popular novel had <UNK> of fans eager to see a supposed master director put this multi layered supernatural story on the screen <UNK> lot had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv mini series directed by tobe hooper he of texas chainsaw massacre fame and was badly handled turning the major villain of the book into a <UNK> theatre vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise fans hoped that a director of kubrick's stature would succeed where hooper had failed it didn't happen br br sure this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few <UNK> it's all downhill jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson he's always crazy and didn't bring anything to his role here i don't care that many reviewers here think he's all that in this <UNK> the here's johnny bit notwithstanding he's just awful in this movie so is everyone else for that matter <UNK> <UNK> character dick <UNK> was essential to the plot of the book yet kubrick kills him off in one of the <UNK> shock sequences ever put on film i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at <UNK> repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick those that stayed that is many left king's books really never translate well to film since so much of the <UNK> occur <UNK> to his characters and often <UNK> kubrick <UNK> the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don't really care what happens to whom br br this movie still stinks and why so many think it's a horror masterpiece is beyond me
<START> this film contains the one <UNK> that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion sorrow love laughter anger there are so many emotions thrown into this film from start to finish this film is immensely captivating the plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown in the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken this film is powerful washington as always puts on a great performance br br the plot in a nutshell man suffers from depression a young girl brings life into him kids gets kidnap man wants revenge doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there for instant taken is a similar film but when you compare them both man on fire wins hands down the characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great mexico city feels alive it looks like mexico city it <UNK> like mexico city everything is portrayed brilliantly the style of direction was something i enjoyed and brought the best out of mexico city br br this is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch from start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist making it a roller coaster journey there enough action to keep you happy there enough character development to please you and then there's washington to bring a smile to your face watch this film you won't be disappointed
<START> this movie does <UNK> the first one as far as the origins of the care bears and the care bear cousins goes i won't deny that however if you look at part ii as a separate film then it's a very good movie i remember watching this in the early 80's and fitting into its targeted <UNK> audience then and absolutely loving it much more than the first movie not that i didn't enjoy that one too it's just that this one seemed to have a little something extra to it sure it's darker than the first one too but perhaps maybe that's why it's so good and it's dark in deeper kind of subtle way too that kids may not fully understand but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off and adults watching will surely get <UNK> as i have now watching this film again now in my mid <UNK> where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit demon in exchange for something else get the picture but simply watching that as a child sure as i said it may have been a little scary but nothing <UNK> in fact if anything it gave me another fantasy game i could play when i was that age i can't tell you the number of times i used to pretend dark heart wanted to <UNK> me have me help him capture the care bears tried to make me turn over to his dark side and other things like that etc so this movie was also good for my imagination and it's also got great emotional depth to it too i used to watch it at least once a week br br also hadley kay was the perfect choice for the voice of dark heart i always thought so and i always will br br now it's just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available sometimes i just want to hear growing up without watching the movie as good as it is br br what good is love and caring if it can't save her
<START> with the releasing of <UNK> <UNK> swedish film industry has truly hit rock bottom <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife marie <UNK> <UNK> one day an old friend of <UNK> arrives with a favor to ask him <UNK> is to do a small <UNK> job he is supposed to bring a <UNK> filled with heroine through the sweden germany customs unfortunately things in germany <UNK> work out as planned and <UNK> is now in big trouble it is always nice to see a swedish film that breaks the traditional family drama pattern unfortunately if the people involved in the production have no clue of how a movie is supposed to be written filmed or cut the result can only be <UNK> the content can be <UNK> with bad acting an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogs the only highlight in the movie is the <UNK> sex scene wit the incredibly beautiful <UNK> <UNK> this lasts for only a few seconds leaving <UNK> 90 minutes of pure <UNK> say what it truly is crap
<START> okay when i came on the board for this movie i was really expecting people to be making fun of it i was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it i enjoyed the movie but only b c me and my little sister who is in fact only 10 made fun of the whole thing br br i am sorry jordan but that acting was awful you know a movie is headed for the toilet when the lead cannot act and it didn't even have a good script or plot to redeem it i also thought that the character of pamela was very very lame border <UNK> pathetic br br even with that being said i thought there were a few good actors such as gorgeous spencer hollywood and <UNK> still not enough to redeem the movie br br two things about this movie that i just can't get over br br 1 that that spencer guy would fall for her okay <UNK> i looked up the dates and while in reality he is only about four years older than her the difference in go figure seemed much larger jordan is a very pretty girl but in <UNK> she seemed like 10 or 12 she seemed like a little kid jake <UNK> spencer seemed like a college student br br 2 that there is any way that <UNK> <UNK> would come just to <UNK> for one girl i mean i know that <UNK> is good and everything but it still just seemed kinda unlikely that <UNK> would go to a <UNK> school that didn't even have <UNK> for <UNK> or that a school would have employed a <UNK> coach with such connections br br that all being said it wasn't the worst movie ever known but it wasn't very good even by <UNK> standards which i consider quite low
<START> kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any shakespearean drama and the acting is true to the story with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale it is touching funny and intriguing in all parts the character development is near perfect the cinematography is vivid and engaging and the story draws you in br br i would like to say that the samurai freaks and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century <UNK> tales of japan may <UNK> this film as not <UNK> best work perhaps not his best but even at his worst kurosawa is better than many of the best this story is so based in <UNK> the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change that it is timeless despite being set in the not so distant past br br i would <UNK> recommend this to any movie buff and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based
<START> while i was the video store i was <UNK> through the one dollar <UNK> and came upon this little gem i don't know what it was about it but i just had a gut <UNK> about it and wow was i ever right br br the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting one of the girls is alicia a teenage <UNK> who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle thrown together by fate they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on br br i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks because wow what a performance by busy phillips and <UNK> christensen not to mention the rest of the cast my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring but all in all a excellent movie
<START> what a delightful film br br accompanied by oscar winning composer rachel <UNK> lush emotional and dreamy music this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year br br incredible casting br br gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma toni collette was great as <UNK> smith br br the character who stole the film was miss bates she was mesmerizing to watch one finds <UNK> on the edge of <UNK> seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages from one of the opening scenes when she is <UNK> mr <UNK> for sending that lovely quarter <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> mother she shouts into her <UNK> and clearly hearing <UNK> mother mrs bates played by emma <UNK> mother <UNK> law who looks <UNK> and lost br br the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut wrenching scene at the <UNK> when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart we then see poor miss bates <UNK> and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one's heart ripped out to her on her behalf it is a classic scene one to be <UNK> and played over over br br the ending is right up there with sense sensibility and provides one of life's greatest lessons about how one should marry one's best friend br br i hope that this film <UNK> you all as much as it has myself br br i <UNK> it
<START> i had watched as much of the series as i could manage to watch on television but unfortunately started a job that got me working <UNK> i managed to catch some <UNK> of it at least and of course purchased the recently released dvd of the complete series watching the dvd you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first but they <UNK> out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done the voices are well suited to the characters and the writing is excellent it's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it's roots by <UNK> adult themes thing is with the way society has come in the last century you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today's standards in order to be <UNK> as an adult oriented show the characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life it's your typical sitcom in that regard but the humor is more like what you'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or saturday night live back when snl was actually funny good job <UNK> perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going and also improve the marketing of <UNK> for the series to help <UNK> it's high costs it's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though hmm
<START> i'm both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so accurate about vietnam and were never there this movie is about as true about the whole vietnam war as the rodney king beating is true about all police officers yes bad things do and did happen but in general the people there are just like you and me they have morals they are not killing machines they do not all do drugs atrocities were the exception in vietnam not the rule they happened far more <UNK> than the hype would lead you believe oliver stone has a knack for making movies that show the vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath but are based as much in reality as star wars if you honestly believe the stereotypes of vietnam do yourself a favour and learn the truth fact the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> did far worse things to the south <UNK> than any soldier in the us armed forces ever did fact the soldiers in world war ii treated the enemy far worse in general than the soldiers in vietnam did and they were welcomed when they came home the fine americans who served this country in vietnam deserve our respect though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint no one could have asked for more from our soldiers and it is a great <UNK> to <UNK> that this kind of mostly true fiction is the way things really were there
<START> well i saw this movie yesterday and it's unfortunately worse than you could think first of all the plot is idiotic it has no sense at all the screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues the audience was laughing many times and the suspense is very low actors play so so with an exception of sharon stone who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments the saddest parts are when she tries to be <UNK> sexy and says things like i want to <UNK> you and it looks like let's say it gently a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all that erotic tension from <UNK> is totally gone from the technical point of basic instinct 2 is a mediocre movie better than typical straight to dvd but on a far lower <UNK> than the original movie for instance the scene of crazy <UNK> is done poorly the director of basic instinct 2 is no paul verhoeven and it shows the new composer is no jerry <UNK> and its shows the script is done by people who are no match for joe <UNK> there's no substitute for michael douglas in it the film looks cheap and badly edited at times i'm sorry but my first thought after i left the theater was why <UNK> they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie all to all the original movie is like citizen kane compared to this the first basic instinct is a classic and was a kind of break thru in the popular cinema it was provoking sexy and controversial it had the best sharon <UNK> performance in her career it had this specific paul verhoeven's style unfortunately basic instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie badly directed and a sure <UNK> award winner in many categories it's a pity that they made this film
<START> this movie took the jerry springer approach to super human power wilder <UNK> is the kind of theme based movie that i love addressing the idea that <UNK> in america are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them at the same time the movie points out that every <UNK> is only human and no more to be feared or <UNK> than any other human being this was a great comedy fun and human with that slight <UNK> edge
<START> predictable told a thousand times story with the usual drama in between a couple of pretty raunchy sex scenes <UNK> with some character paranoia 70's style incidental <UNK> horror music that is comical at times i couldn't help <UNK> to myself br br i usually like <UNK> and it has to be said that the acting is not all that bad the plot develops at a reasonable pace and does keep you guessing from time to time its just that it's all too predictable i felt like i was watching a made for tv drama instead of a new movie maybe thats the style the directors wanted but it has to be said that the review i read on here before i saw the movie could only have been written by someone involved in its production br br don't expect too much and if i could wind the clock back i wouldn't have gone to see it at the cinema i would wait for the bargain <UNK> at your video shop i'm sure it wont take long
<START> no this isn't a sequel to the fabulous <UNK> series but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of <UNK> and the disappearance of <UNK> it is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series which is why characters namely orson and <UNK> are <UNK> and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the <UNK> the <UNK> included in the set provides excellent answers to such questions as do various online sites the first eight episodes of this 27 part tv series focus on the <UNK> battle at demon dragon mountain the remaining 19 episodes introduce us to spark a blue haired knight wannabe who <UNK> with <UNK> and his <UNK> team of <UNK> as they attempt to stop the dark wizard <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> br br while it isn't quite the equivalent of the original <UNK> war we all love the finale where <UNK> saves <UNK> from <UNK> don't we this tv follow up is still great fun for fantasy fans even if the animation is limited and a step down from the artistic streak of the first <UNK> this 27 part series has its elements of appeal the fully realized characters engaging storyline magic romance and a superb soundtrack scored by <UNK> <UNK> of ninja <UNK> all give this uneven spin off some punch br br while the <UNK> dub of <UNK> has been criticized for one reason or another i generally liked it and still consider it one of my favorite <UNK> so i had significant hopes for the dub for chronicles made in 1999 2000 for the most part the <UNK> tv english track is of passable if not stellar quality it does however have its share of problems much of the original cast who <UNK> their english voices to the characters of <UNK> return including lisa <UNK> as <UNK> which is a nice bonus on the other hand billy <UNK> more mature sounding <UNK> is a bit <UNK> he doesn't do a bad job but his voice came across as grating for the first eight episodes causing some anti dub fans to instantly <UNK> the dub but by the time spark and company take the stage i found it less <UNK> i don't know if it's because he improved or if it just grew on me also not everyone from the <UNK> dub returns <UNK> reeves only voices <UNK> <UNK> for one episode he's replaced by pete <UNK> for the whole show who gives a <UNK> but still <UNK> turn as well as the expected evil laughter anthony <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his <UNK> oliver gregory is probably the most effective as orson especially during his final dramatic scenes br br aside from lisa <UNK> <UNK> karen smith <UNK> john knox <UNK> and al <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> best voices come from some of the newer characters including <UNK> freeman spark <UNK> <UNK> episodes 16 27 <UNK> <UNK> little <UNK> meg frances who voices <UNK> in the <UNK> but also voices <UNK> with vulnerability and <UNK> as well as <UNK> and especially <UNK> <UNK> who steals every scene she's in as <UNK> the half <UNK> the rest of the cast isn't terrible by any means but a little more uneven than the <UNK> dub some are all right <UNK> <UNK> while others are lackluster <UNK> palace guards dragons etc and few were awful in particular prince <UNK> <UNK> is too harsh and <UNK> for a fighter of justice br br in fact the lack of <UNK> continuity some cast members get new voices for some unexplained reason by the time we get to some of the later episodes is one of the problems of the dub others include less memorable and more awkward sounding dialogue uneven <UNK> and finally i apologize in advance to the fans of this the <UNK> island segments these offbeat super <UNK> <UNK> at the end of each episode will either <UNK> or drive you <UNK> <UNK> i at first found them to be a major <UNK> but they sorta grew on me after a while besides there are some <UNK> hilarious lines such as i'm king <UNK> and this is my <UNK> i'm really quite a nut these flaws rank the dub for chronicles just a notch just below that for the <UNK> resulting in an uneven english track summed up best as ok br br if one wonders if the japanese language track is the preferred listening choice well guess what the japanese version has its good and bad points too while some voices are less annoying than the english language track i found others to be less appealing than the english <UNK> in particular the actress who does <UNK> is nowhere nearly as good as lisa <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> plus i should mention that the japanese cast is not the same as the <UNK> because the series was made seven years after the original all but one sho <UNK> of the cast members are replaced by new ones although they do a <UNK> good job it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the japanese <UNK> cast shows that not everything in japanese is better than english eh despite its flaws chronicles of the heroic knight is still a fine series which deserves to hold its own ground its not without its rough spots and doesn't always live up to its predecessor yet there's enough good points to counter the bad making this a moderately enjoyable fantasy anime
<START> i was absolutely <UNK> by this series from the moment tom long walked into shot the whole <UNK> <UNK> thing it was just <UNK> br br the story has you hooked what will happen next will joey get the girl in the end after doing 5 years in prison and all that time thinking about his lost love crossing paths with her again finding he has a son although he is a violent bad guy you still want him to find happiness br br a truly captivating two <UNK> please bring it out on video
<START> it took me time to really appreciate john carpenter's halloween as a kid i remember i really enjoyed the sequels especially the return of michael myers which i still think is the best halloween sequel but i thought the first one was slow and took way too much time to get to the <UNK> i watched it a couple of times recently and i know now i was wrong today i truly understand this film the meaning it has the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece it's not about blood and gore it's not about naked chicks and lame jokes it's about the worst night in laurie <UNK> short life it's about the night his demented brother comes back home to finish what he started 15 years ago this movie is meant to be scary and i think it succeeds very well it's also one of the first slasher movies a horror sub genre that i always loved halloween has a very dark atmosphere creepy music and talented young actors such as jamie lee curtis in her first role need i say more anyone who's never seen it horror fan or not should do his cinematic <UNK> right now very highly recommended
<START> <UNK> this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever ever seen to say that i love horror movies would be an understatement and i have seen <UNK> considering the limited <UNK> in new zealand that's quite a lot but never before have i had to sleep with the light on until i saw the grudge br br some may say that it is a rip off of the ring both based on japanese horror movies both similar yet different story lines but the grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie seeing at at the cinema i even screamed at a certain point in the movie br br the acting is great particularly from the supporting characters <UNK> <UNK> is fantastic and steals the show she is such an enthusiastic person jason <UNK> is a real <UNK> and william <UNK> looks like he is having fun however while i am normally a fan of <UNK> <UNK> she doesn't really seem into this movie of the supporting characters hers probably got the most depth and back story but she doesn't seem like she is all there as for sarah michelle <UNK> well she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesn't she the ghosts were genuinely scary the music and sound effects were chilling particularly the noise being made when <UNK> <UNK> character answered the phone in her apartment the ending was cool too br br super highly recommended 9 10
<START> just had to write that one liner but it really is i love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry i've seen in recent years i have <UNK> for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important one the script it is a weak story about a petty criminal no amount of fine acting or black and white film <UNK> can make up for a total lack of substance i love kevin spacey and i hear he's gonna do another film about the general my advice is don't waste your time
<START> this film is one of those that has a <UNK> <UNK> to it it is <UNK> grounded and a film that will make you think and smile paul reiser and peter falk take you on a journey that you will not forget the soundtrack is beautifully varied and fitting and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air this surely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors finally a piece of art that <UNK> from the obvious love story and the frequent special affects that are seen today never have i walked out from a movie with such deep warmth and feeling of <UNK> in my heart for it felt as if someone had just wrapped it in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to see this film is to find a real treasure and delight in it
<START> this is another north east florida production filmed mainly in and near by to <UNK> beach and the kingsley plantation i was rather surprised the company was able to take over the main street of <UNK> beach as long as was necessary to achieve the street scenes the film is pretty and pretty bad <UNK> <UNK> is cute but overacts <UNK> brennan overacts even more good for small kids or for those who like fluff in large doses a 4 from the miller movies formula
<START> i thought i'd be locked away in a padded cell and they'd throw away the key thus is a <UNK> snatch of dialogue from state of mind br br one wonders in what <UNK> forest paula <UNK> and her co writer found the magic <UNK> they must have eaten to create this feeble <UNK> and bring such rubbish to our screens a padded cell should indeed be left available br br <UNK> cusack did her best as did the other actors but surely her talent deserves a better vehicle than this the height of absurdity has been reached and this particular state of mind is best buried and forgotten and certainly not just placed in a box and locked away in a <UNK>
<START> red rock west 1993 br br nicolas cage gets <UNK> in a deadly crime without at first knowing it and the <UNK> lead to increasing peril adventure and <UNK> in the wild <UNK> american west of the 1990s red rock west is often brutal and sometimes hilarious and cage pulls off the mixture with his usual <UNK> wit and <UNK> ease br br is the plot over the top yes is dennis hopper perfect as a crazed almost likable killer yes does cage stand a chance well you have to watch and see it never lets up and it took me by surprise the first time i saw it on second viewing yesterday i was surprised at how well it held up how well constructed it was and how macabre and funny it was at the same time br br director ron <UNK> who also helped write is known more for his tv work but with <UNK> and this film he shows a <UNK> hand with sensational plots it's saved by its humor by the way and by the caricatures the bar is sleazy the cops questionable and don't miss a really inspired cameo by dwight <UNK> as a truck driver
<START> stephen <UNK> who played the <UNK> and was one of the writers of the movie passed away in early 2006 i met steve in <UNK> in 1993 it was a year latter when he told me that he had been a writer in hollywood years earlier working mostly on tv <UNK> he asked me not to see <UNK> <UNK> but it was too late i had seen it already actually i had seen it years before when it was released at that time i didn't think it was that bad a movie however seeing it as an adult my opinion was somewhat different yes is is a bit <UNK> as well as dated steve admitted it was not a very good movie that said he was just a little proud of 'the <UNK> sketch
<START> while watching this piece of crap the day after i saw a <UNK> trailer that one minute included all all what was at least not boring to watch br br so don't waste money or time on this one get the original it's much better though the effects might not be up to date
<START> <UNK> is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of <UNK> or emotion to the story unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence the problem is especially <UNK> when you have tons of characters all of whom die br br ok so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible right nope here we have a war between two ninja <UNK> with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other they kill each other because the emperor says so yet even well after it becomes <UNK> obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions that's not <UNK> that's just plain dumb br br fine fine there is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable <UNK> for fighting at least they die fighting in cool action scenes right yet again no in fact many of the fights aren't even fights at all super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly and <UNK> in my opinion i'm talking about things like <UNK> i'm walking along and i neck gets <UNK> the end for that character not even halfway through the film i threw my hands up in frustration at the <UNK> of it
<START> <UNK> br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format <UNK> br br a woman turns the tables on a would be rapist when he <UNK> an assault in her home and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police in which case he could be released and attack her again br br exploitation fans who might be expecting another rough <UNK> ready rape fantasy in the style of day of the woman 1978 will almost certainly be disappointed by <UNK> true farrah <UNK> character is subjected to two <UNK> prolonged <UNK> before gaining the upper hand on her <UNK> a suitably slimy james russo but scriptwriter william <UNK> and director robert m young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before <UNK> the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production would their final solution hold up in a court of law maybe br br based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors <UNK> and <UNK> after every performance the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action <UNK> and technical credits are fine though <UNK> overly subdued performance won't play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an <UNK> for their <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today's more <UNK> and loud films it is another solid based on a true store which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes frankly i don't know but i liked the story br br the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in <UNK> and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else including his father does in this west virginia town the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father which i think was overdone i would like to have a little less tension between the two br br the young man still a boy is played by jake <UNK> one of his first staring <UNK> i think he's likable as are his school buddies in here it's nice to see nice kids in a modern day film the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper the dad and laura dern the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time br br the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear once again i wish there more of these kind of films made today
<START> a <UNK> of youth short subject br br a teenager embarrassed by his fear of dogs runs away from home the abandoned <UNK> he finds helps to change his mind br br <UNK> my <UNK> is an enjoyable little film with shirley temple stealing all her scenes as the hero's lively kid sister the opening gag dealing with <UNK> is in poor taste but is quickly forgotten highlight the climactic <UNK> which look <UNK> realistic br br often overlooked or neglected today the one and two reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or <UNK> talents both in front behind the camera the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something akin to writing a <UNK> short story rather than a novel <UNK> to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect <UNK> to the <UNK> feature films
<START> the <UNK> <UNK> of four <UNK> <UNK> who arrive in london on the same day in the early 1970s there's a swedish girl a danish a german and a chinese the story <UNK> to get the clothes off all of them involve them in some carry on type humour and couple them with various <UNK> from the british film and tv culture of the time including man about the house star richard <UNK> future <UNK> street rogue johnny <UNK> and horror film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> playing a <UNK> there's a pretty <UNK> amount of female nudity on display for those who like that kind of thing but obviously nothing hardcore br br most of the film is pretty thin and <UNK> the girls are stereotypes and german anita especially suffers from some kind of <UNK> disorder she's a moron obsessed with colour tv who acts like a kind of <UNK> child dresses to deliberately show her private parts in another more serious film she would be a psychiatric case the most interesting section of the film involves the swedish girl being taken to a club in london where some dodgy types are still trying to swing being <UNK> by a middle aged rocker losing her virginity and <UNK> that the scene is not for her these sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with in which <UNK> and the <UNK> of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives there's a fine turn by john standing as an <UNK> public school <UNK> the strangest of the stories has the chinese girl future cannibal film veteran me me lay getting off with her childish piano <UNK> <UNK> falling <UNK> in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all except some <UNK> notion that chinese birds are <UNK> ain't they the film is pretty <UNK> to its women characters and there's a <UNK> of <UNK> in the dialogue and one of the <UNK> the end is striking as <UNK> <UNK> for no <UNK> reason except they have to end the film somehow <UNK> all of the girls away to his arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade which they are all delighted about br br stuff and nonsense for the most part then but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran val guest which puts it as a piece of film making a notch above most of the 70s brit <UNK> flicks
<START> kudos to the writers of this film for creating a <UNK> engaging drama the curious character development is <UNK> of a nuanced and well <UNK> writing team the audience member cannot but help but to feel that s he must make wrenching emotional decisions <UNK> the cerebral against the <UNK> the viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself though her <UNK> are rarely <UNK> br br credit is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting the wood shop is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds with its own traits faults a variety of highly charged relationships and of course a fate <UNK> tied to that of the other principals br br make sure to catch this one at your local art house
<START> whoopi was the only reason i watched the oscars that year she is hilarious of course there was a major serious side to the show she was great not only because she's funny but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum white folks need to be reminded that hollywood <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and representation are way out of balance <UNK> there should be no need for black awards shows the white bread <UNK> <UNK> and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to white directors producers actors etc allowing woody allen on the air was the depth of poor taste he had no business being there the fact of the matter is this is the first oscar presentation i've watched since the color purple was up for awards that <UNK> of voting <UNK> me on watching the shows until 2002 which is not to <UNK> other <UNK> billy crystal is a riot
<START> the nearest i ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a gerard <UNK> exposition in paris about two years ago i had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made i can only conclude that the inept <UNK> was intentional aimed at a long <UNK> target hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 30s when the greatest of them all basil <UNK> crossed <UNK> with errol flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire after a while you don't notice and <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> dialogue reminiscent of the prisoner of <UNK> both versions gerard <UNK> certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and gina <UNK> was probably a tad better than <UNK> carol the other obvious candidate at the time the print i saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a dvd version would enhance it
<START> i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and <UNK> are so earnest about it in the dvd comments it's not a bad movie exactly but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre plus it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways and the characters' behavior often <UNK> belief i'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of film tv literature life behind you to be honest i've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even otherwise its point has been made before and more <UNK> and that gets to the big problem which is that it really doesn't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that <UNK> everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling and it doesn't really pay off
<START> return to the <UNK> chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic <UNK> chamber of shaolin in which gordon liu played <UNK> <UNK> a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter in this sequel liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten he <UNK> the original <UNK> <UNK> tries all manner of tricks to get into shaolin temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses its a classic light hearted martial arts tale with the ace production values of the shaw brothers and the sure <UNK> direction of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the choreography is fantastic throughout whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and gordon <UNK> performance as are the others particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material the film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly <UNK> more violent and sweeping shaw brothers films but few have such a magical blend of slapstick unique training and fighting with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good full of light hearted joy its impossible not to give this the highest score
<START> scott henderson the engineer that employs carol <UNK> as his assistant makes a point to call her kansas whenever he speaks to her it shows us that carol effectively played by ella raines is supposed to be a babe in the woods as far as the manhattan of the 40s was concerned only a woman from out of town would follow the shady bartender to a <UNK> <UNK> subway even then only a naive girl could <UNK> such an adventure br br robert <UNK> directed this film noir very well he shows a flair for <UNK> the story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising for those days how else could we justify the way the drummer in the orchestra of the musical where scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat makes such an overt pass at a lady on a date the drummer played with high <UNK> by elisha cook jr doesn't hide his desires for any of the ladies who sat in the front row of the hit musical where he plays it was a real explicit <UNK> first to the phantom woman of the story fay <UNK> afterward cliff the drummer <UNK> himself very openly to ella raines who goes to the theater disguised as the mystery dame her boss had taken originally br br this is a film that will hook any viewer from the beginning there are things not explained in it but it holds the one's interest throughout the killer is not revealed until the end br br ella raines with her <UNK> eyes was an under <UNK> actress she holds her own against much more experienced actors <UNK> tone a new york stage actor working in hollywood never found in this medium the fame he deserved he is effective as the accused man's best friend on the other hand alan curtis comes across as a man who when framed accepts his fate and is saved only by the <UNK> of the woman who secretly loved him thomas <UNK> as the inspector burgess is an asset to the film as a detective who has his doubts the police had caught the man who committed the crime br br this movie will not disappoint
<START> extremely poor action film starring the ever wooden dolph lundgren and brandon lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems to <UNK> the action is at best average a bit of nudity <UNK> in and yes <UNK> <UNK> does use a body double br br the set up is the usual <UNK> cop forced to break in a new partner on a big case the makers at least try to give the formula a twist making lundgren the cop with oriental values and lee the modern city <UNK> but there is zero character development making it almost comical <UNK> oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed the action sequences are by the numbers and lee who would go on to make the excellent the crow is never given the scope to show off any particular martial arts brilliance but given his <UNK> <UNK> he must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served not having to live up to his father by taking on a very different role in the crow which showed what a unique actor he may have become if not for his tragic and early death br br unless your a hardcore lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80's style action movies think <UNK> etc then avoid br br poor 3 10
<START> movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining so can whoopi goldberg movies but whoopi and dinosaurs br br after the first 20 minutes of theodore rex i had come to one conclusion this movie is evil evil vile wicked and <UNK> in its spite for the audience nothing this bad is made by accident this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber br br first of all whoopi does not make good action movies watch fatal beauty if you think i'm lying but the film makers don't care she's a tough cop here yet again br br seen a million cop buddy flicks this week well here's number one million and one pal br br don't like cute <UNK> animated dinosaurs since that spielberg tv show about them too bad here's another one and he's a cop too br br you one of those people that hates car chases shoot outs sloppy dialogue boring futuristic fx and seeing talented people goldberg <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write off a big tax write off br br and you read this review all the way to the end you deserve a sequel seriously br br no stars not a one and if they really make a sequel to theodore rex hollywood deserves to be attacked a whole herd of wise cracking <UNK> rubber dinosaurs br br now i'd pay to see that
<START> it really was that bad on a par with the mercifully short lived dirty dozen tv series that starred ben murphy and was made at around the same time also on the cheap in <UNK> br br i was embarrassed for the cast members of this film and for telly <UNK> in particular he was <UNK> too old and fat for the role pushing 70 when he made this garbage and the reviewer who draws parallels with telly the greek in this and john wayne in the green <UNK> pretty much sums it up br br other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable <UNK> that this crime against celluloid contains so i won't repeat them here but i will add that i'm amazed that no one's yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny looking helmet that <UNK> wears on his big <UNK> head br br i'm also <UNK> that this <UNK> of a film has a rating as high as 4 7 here at imdb br br as far as i'm concerned it's a 1 right across the board if you want a good example of why <UNK> a franchise to death really is a bad idea especially 20 plus years after the original look no further than the dirty dozen the fatal mission br br awful avoid
<START> first let me say i am not from the south but i am an american i don't love country music but i can stomach it i would never wear a cowboy hat but i wear hats i don't live in a trailer but i do eat <UNK> <UNK> and own a home what does that have to do with this comment a lot if you are one of those people who say only country people love this movie this movie is loosely based on the they loved and lost premise james bridges directs an american love story as real as it gets in an era of jerry springer and lets put it out there mentality this film rings <UNK> than ever br br bud is coming of age and <UNK> on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them bud finds himself drawn into the local <UNK> <UNK> world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford he quickly meets sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a <UNK> romance filled with painful ups and downs br br this plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked marriage is a focus here that is often missed early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married the film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man it also brings into view the male ego with women and competition br br bud is challenged and is excited when <UNK> puts in an electronic bull sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start acting like it the emotion between the two characters is raw and <UNK> and the plot continues from there especially when they note this is giving some of the storyline away split and sissy falls for an ex con with a <UNK> for abuse and cruelty she soon realizes that the grass is not always <UNK> on the other side br br how anyone can compare bud to <UNK> <UNK> is shocking to me john travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition he was believable and real the scene where he <UNK> his beard and you first see him at the bar still gives me <UNK> mind you i am not a huge travolta fan but come on i see why sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film <UNK> <UNK> was so real that you found yourself <UNK> with her as she <UNK> a note of emotions to bud after <UNK> in to clean his house during their break up br br the supporting cast was incredible wes played by scott glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused sissy <UNK> smith <UNK> as <UNK> mistress girlfriend was so authentic that large <UNK> girls across the u s <UNK> to wake up flat <UNK> to wear the clothes she <UNK> in the film my biggest <UNK> go to barry corbin and brooke anderson as <UNK> aunt and uncle they seemed like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in texas and however small their role they made the film so much bigger and <UNK> two memorable scenes were the <UNK> <UNK> contest and the unforgettable scene where bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death the dialog between them is touching br br if you can watch this for what it is a true american love story then i recommend that you take it for what it is a film before it's time that gave us <UNK> into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment if this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more lastly the music however dated is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age
<START> bob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise elmer <UNK> tells his dog that if he <UNK> himself just once more that he will be given a <UNK> bath unfortunately for the dog a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching the cartoon switches between the <UNK> progress inside the <UNK> fur and the <UNK> desperate attempts to cope with it in a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an <UNK> that can't be <UNK> the dog changes colour from brown to blue to red to <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> it sounds <UNK> surreal but it perfectly evokes the <UNK> feeling of an <UNK> in a way only <UNK> could there are several other elements which make <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> pure <UNK> there's the grotesque concept itself which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea <UNK> on the <UNK> flesh there's the <UNK> violence that <UNK> its head in any scene featuring the cat most notably there's the dirty jokes including a huge shot of the <UNK> behind which causes the flea to wolf <UNK> and a hysterical sequence in which the dog attempts to scratch himself by dragging his <UNK> along the floor he <UNK> breaks off to address the audience hey i better cut this out i may get to like it with a very limited concept <UNK> manages to make <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> a unique <UNK> based cartoon like an early episode of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> is practically about nothing but very funny with it
<START> i look around in the video store still in shock how steven seagal with his track record of bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a year attack force being the 3rd no less promised the first time entrance into the sci fi genre for our ever <UNK> seagal visions of bad movie entertainment <UNK> before my <UNK> eyes sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come br br seagal <UNK> a tiny bit with the trashy but enjoyable shadow man last time we saw him however attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever don't argue for out for a kill <UNK> or even black dawn folks this is the bottom of the <UNK> tank here br br anyone who says this is steven <UNK> return to form should be forced to write a 100 page <UNK> on the word taste br br seagal is yet another agent i'm a supreme bad ass yet again named <UNK> wants revenge for the killing of his team that leads him to a <UNK> plot to <UNK> a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public not to mention the dealers are not from around here br br the whole production from directing to the acting is poor was this movie shot in the dark its gotta be the most poorly <UNK> movie since howling 2 the action is terrible and very badly done br br the producers have also <UNK> decided to do what the fans hate the most throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed steven seagal who seems to show little enthusiasm here can ya blame him br br while it has been said that attack force was not the movie <UNK> signed on for originally <UNK> and surely has to be better than attack force the post production <UNK> has not made it more coherent and made seagal look worse i feel bad for <UNK> michael <UNK> and writer joe <UNK> as they are gonna be judged forever for the ill advised production re shoots br br so now this leaves seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to <UNK> for this mess but after seeing how bad attack force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie
<START> fire and ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world the film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant <UNK> which is the home of the evil ice lord named <UNK> the only survivor of the village is a young man named <UNK> who sets out to avenge those who were killed by the <UNK> the ice <UNK> moves through the land of fire and the princess of the land named <UNK> is kidnapped by evil creatures <UNK> sets out to find her and also sets out to find and kill <UNK> fire and ice is directed by ralph bakshi who is one of my favourite adult animators he has brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of fritz the cat and some films he has written himself like the great film heavy traffic i didn't like fire and ice nearly as much as i have ralph bakshi's other work but i still found the film to be enjoyable it had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough the only basic complaints i have is that i wish that there was more of a story to the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not a lot to it i also wish the film was a bit longer because it is under 80 minutes in running time still it's an entertaining action adventure films that unlike fritz the cat or heavy traffic is appropriate for kids 8 and older i only wish that there was a more developed story and it went on a bit longer than it did
<START> some people have stated that as of the <UNK> season south park has started a trend of leaving behind their politically biting satire for shallow spoofs but this could not be further from the truth br br while this episode does spoof the living dead series there is more it is a satire of how people treat the homeless characters say things like they're pretending to be just like us or they want to be human this episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often just down on their luck br br so yes it is still a satire and also a wonderful spoof what more could you want
<START> nothing revolutionary here just <UNK> elegant restrained cinema br br garde a <UNK> is confined almost exclusively to a drab police station and mostly to one <UNK> room but director claude miller who made the wonderful film this sweet sickness among others <UNK> spare glimpses of exterior <UNK> as <UNK> locale <UNK> <UNK> restraint especially early on is breathtaking and his exquisite handling of the consequently pivotal interior <UNK> en scene makes for captivating viewing br br <UNK> <UNK> is superb as usual <UNK> to <UNK> a character that on paper is cliche the <UNK> hard <UNK> world weary homicide detective <UNK> lives the role making it completely believable even though the script allows us little access to his inner <UNK> the film ends at the very moment it appears he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time br br michel <UNK> is equal to the task as the suspected child killer who <UNK> <UNK> with the single minded <UNK> the <UNK> between the two are more often than not pregnant with tension and the aura of a constantly <UNK> playing field for a battle of wits <UNK> character is by turns <UNK> <UNK> and cunning and <UNK> then later br br the message of garde a <UNK> if one were to search for one is a <UNK> of police <UNK> and the kind of <UNK> that make a cop over <UNK> to if necessary close cases at the expense of justice for most of its length though the film shines as nothing more than an <UNK> of how to turn a potentially <UNK> set bound scenario into a suspenseful drama of the <UNK> cinematic economy br br
<START> what's the point of reviewing a movie like this it's painfully and embarrassingly bad not even in a way that allows you to make fun of it br br movies like little man <UNK> me they represent film at its most <UNK> this movie was made for a bunch of 18 24 year old <UNK> t frat boys who the studio was hoping would come out and see it on opening night before word <UNK> out about how bad it was so that the film could quickly <UNK> its investment br br a hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably couldn't get their films made because resources were going toward making this <UNK> of vomit br br grade f
<START> i just saw this movie and i have to say that it was a big waste of time the girl who played eva ellen <UNK> can't act at all she read her lines very un naturally and she had a very un natural facial expression through the entire movie <UNK> <UNK> who played <UNK> on the other hand is a natural she played her part with great perfection br br spoilers the story was simple we've seen it many many times before she breaks up he finds another she get jealous he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end there were no surprises at all one knew that eva would break up and that adam would hook up with <UNK> the only thing that nobody saw coming was that <UNK> told adam to go after eva at the party she became all serious which is a side of <UNK> the viewers hadn't seen earlier in the movie and told him to win <UNK> heart back which was really cute br br besides <UNK> <UNK> there isn't a single actor who gives a memorable performance br br this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors so i don't recommend it
<START> 1st watched 4 <UNK> 2007 4 out of 10 <UNK> mick <UNK> campy vampire like stephen king movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3 4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for king fans it's the story of a mother and son who are <UNK> a shape shifting <UNK> like flesh eating life needing near <UNK> breed of <UNK> who move from town to town searching for <UNK> to feed on to keep themselves alive they come across as pretty normal upper class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home day and night cats are deadly to them so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down we get to see them break a couple of their <UNK> when they attack which is also a first in my movie going experience hopefully no real cats were <UNK> in the making of the film the boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a <UNK> and then he just wants her body there is so much campy <UNK> to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all out satirical comedy on suburban life but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish he'd just get over it and bring out the gore eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it's typical stephen king downbeat ending the movie is interesting because king's humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesn't cut it
<START> this one of the best <UNK> reality shows a ever saw we can see the <UNK> we can see the life of britney i love the five episodes i was always being surprised by britney and the subjects of the show i think that some people don't watch the show at all we can how a great person she his she his really funny really gentle and she loves her fans and we can see how she loves her work i just don't give a 10 because of k fed he his a real jerk he doesn't seem to like britney at all i they make a second season of this great show because it shows at some people how britney really is go britney your the best and you will never leave our hearts
<START> my first opinions on this movie were of course bad i was expecting a horrible crappy acting bad entertainment ridiculous special effects movie what i got was actually not that bad the special effects were absolutely horrible but i found the movie itself quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decent the acting wasn't that bad and overall i had fun watching this movie it's still a pretty bad film but it's not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be and i'm pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me even when it wasn't that good overall it's a film that should be avoided but to me it wasn't as bad as i was expecting it to be
<START> those who have given this production such a low rating probably have never seen the celebrated george <UNK> production live <UNK> or are letting their disdain for the star casting of <UNK> culkin influence their judgement the <UNK> ballet was fortunate enough from the 1960's to the 1980's to be the first ballet company <UNK> to stage this production other than the new york city ballet and i have seen it live <UNK> several times i can assure readers that the film is a quite accurate rendering of this production and that the use of a child with limited dancing abilities in the title role is not a cheap stunt <UNK> up to showcase culkin it was <UNK> idea to use a child in this role just as it was his idea to use a child for the role of marie the heavy dancing is left to the adults in the story br br this is deliberately a <UNK> film in a way it resembles laurence <UNK> othello exactly as in that film the sets of the stage production have been <UNK> to the size of a movie <UNK> but not made any less artificial and the ballet is <UNK> photographed with <UNK> closeups and without the distracting music video quick cuts featured in the 1986 overrated maurice <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> version there are only two false steps in this 1993 film one is the addition of distracting and completely unnecessary sound effects mouse <UNK> the children <UNK> ma <UNK> to <UNK> etc those sound effects are never heard in any stage production of any <UNK> and they have been put in as a cheap <UNK> simply to <UNK> <UNK> audiences who may not <UNK> the idea of watching a ballet on film br br the other false step is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> make up which looks absolutely ridiculous when he is on screen as the <UNK> rather than wearing a huge mask as is always done when the <UNK> production is performed <UNK> culkin is actually made up as the toy he wears what looks like a bald cap as well as a white wig <UNK> and a beard he also has his face <UNK> up somewhat and the worst aspect of his make up is that it is still <UNK> his face <UNK> transformed in a manner similar to ray <UNK> jack <UNK> and bert <UNK> <UNK> in the wizard of oz that film's makeup results though worked spectacularly as this one's does not and a comparison with <UNK> <UNK> in his production shows how wonderfully creative <UNK> <UNK> mask was the jaws actually seemed to move whenever <UNK> <UNK> his head back br br the dancing itself in the <UNK> culkin version is excellent of course except for culkin himself whose dancing as i said isn't meant to even be spectacular the sugar <UNK> fairy and her <UNK> are the prominent dancing roles in <UNK> production of the <UNK> the film's colors though could be a bit <UNK> since this is a fantasy the choreography is also brilliant and the adaptation of it is so faithful as to include the sequence that features additional music from <UNK> ballet the sleeping beauty as marie <UNK> <UNK> falls asleep on the <UNK> and dreams that <UNK> is <UNK> the broken <UNK> this sequence was of course never included in <UNK> original ballet it is the only sequence in this production which features music from a work other than the <UNK> br br those who have missed out on this film or those who despise or <UNK> it should give it a chance despite its two big <UNK> it is far better than it seems when one first hears that culkin is in it
<START> when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended i on the other hand felt completely the opposite i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else people i talked to said there was too much talking plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie going public seems to have a tendency to want easy to follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue <UNK> they get confused they also like to be <UNK> fed <UNK> endings happy or sad this <UNK> me nobody wants to be challenged anymore and as for the ending and i don't want to be a spoiler i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again it's all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny it's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people but it certainly spoke to me give it a chance be patient with it richard <UNK> has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are <UNK> through the city streets along with the characters as if you yourself were <UNK> through europe on a <UNK> pass it's very intimate plus ethan hawke and julie <UNK> do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life they must have improvised during some parts and it works well they have a great chemistry in their roles their <UNK> as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr <UNK> and i deeply respect him for getting this film made it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much bravo for romance
<START> i will keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely <UNK> a mention zombie 90 is one of the worst films ever made right up there with <UNK> other horrible zombie entry zombie doom aka violent sh t 3 these films suck so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot i somehow managed barely to sit through zombie doom but zombie 90 is so horribly inept even when compared to <UNK> other horrible film that i had to fast forward through everything after the first 10 minutes zero acting skills inept gore horrible camcorder style camera work ridiculous dubbing it just goes on and on i really can't find a single thing redeeming about this garbage and i can usually find something redeeming in just about any film this truly is one of the worst films ever made you've been warned 1 10
<START> terrific film with a slightly slow start give it a chance to get cooking story builds in interest and complexity characters and story line <UNK> expectation and cliche at all the right moments superb new york city locations gritty real are a fantastic <UNK> to the commercial <UNK> of sex in the city in fact the entire film is an <UNK> to the hbo hollywood notion of new york city sex and relationships it's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and <UNK> loved it great cast with notable performances by steve <UNK> rosario dawson and her love interest forgot his name
<START> i've come to realise from watching euro horror especially films made by cult <UNK> jess franco that you can't expect a plot that makes much sense however franco has gone overboard with this film and despite a surreal atmosphere and the film's reputation as one of the director's best <UNK> is unfortunately is a truly awful film i've got to admit that i saw the american cut version which runs at about <UNK> minutes but unless it was just the logic that was cut i'm sure the longer european version is just as boring the plot has something to do with a woman <UNK> around practicing s m and talking rubbish and it's all really boring there's no gore and the sex is dull and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film i had difficulty making it all the way to the end i have to say that the locations look good and franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere but the positive elements end there jess franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films but this looks like it was one he made for the money and overall i recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's more interesting works
<START> this is an amateur movie shot on video not an <UNK> drama as the dvd liner notes <UNK> <UNK> i have seen much better stuff from <UNK> film students the bulk of the story unfolds with an all <UNK> taxi ride around <UNK> this movie could have been made using a single video camera but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was <UNK> together later the editing is extremely rough the final edit was probably done with two cameras <UNK> content back and forth instead of with a proper editor perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too the english subtitles were written by someone not <UNK> in english e g where you go now to say the production quality is on a par with blair witch is generous if you're not scared away yet this film was an ambitious and creative <UNK> with lots of cool and funky images from all over <UNK>
<START> life begins and ends in a typical 1930's <UNK> <UNK> ward where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women played by loretta young glenda farrell clara <UNK> <UNK> em <UNK> <UNK> dorothy tree and gloria <UNK> as they <UNK> to give birth while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when <UNK> <UNK> are much more controlled and <UNK> it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our <UNK> and great <UNK> i found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving br br oddly enough the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member young eric <UNK> as jed <UNK> <UNK> loretta young husband what an actor as a first time father jed is <UNK> and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush <UNK> off a <UNK> table i felt his every concern <UNK> i'd like to see more of this actor's work he had a very emotional voice which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was <UNK> without <UNK> who screamed don't cut don't cut as scarlett <UNK> the hospital in horror chilling another great performance is from <UNK> <UNK> who plays miss <UNK> the nurse her character is a salt of the earth type the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more <UNK> side of the medical profession br br loretta young did another superb acting job here as well a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace my she is great in these <UNK> i've really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months br br glenda farrell played her role of a shrill <UNK> mother a little over the top for my taste didn't anyone know back in 1932 that <UNK> <UNK> from a hot water bottle might be <UNK> to unborn <UNK> health but her character <UNK> herself in the end br br also in the cast was an uncredited gilbert <UNK> silent movie star as a <UNK> italian husband his screen time was brief but notable br br life begins is a must see <UNK> try to catch it sometime on tcm but remember to bring a few <UNK> to cry into 9 out of 10
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br ray ray <UNK> has a criminal past has had problems with alcohol and is now <UNK> a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife valerie kathy burke who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a <UNK> meanwhile her mother janet <UNK> morse is aware of <UNK> son billy charlie <UNK> miles and his <UNK> drug habit that is sending him off the <UNK> the film follows these <UNK> characters as they <UNK> along with their lives br br it is said that the british seem to enjoy being miserable and that would include watching films that entertain them this way films like <UNK> by mouth highlight this it's a tale of a broken family torn apart by crime poverty booze and drugs the kind jeremy kyle would lap up like a three course meal it is also essentially a tale of self destructive men three generations apart and each <UNK> the other <UNK> a family apart and women trying to hold it together despite not being strong enough if you pick up a little of what it's about from the off set you can see it doesn't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn't disappoint in this br br it's true what everyone said about the performances and the lead stars <UNK> and burke do deliver some great acting we see <UNK> lose it with his wife beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia breaking down during a phone conversation with her and <UNK> a typical <UNK> of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid likewise in a private moment we see burke <UNK> lose her <UNK> on a <UNK> the full impact of the night before kicking in br br this is another of those films where there's no <UNK> to follow as such just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next it's been acclaimed by many including the <UNK> but it really was just too grim and bleak for me i have no right to criticize it for this knowing what i knew about it from the off set but sadly this is how i found it
<START> any way the wind blows is tom <UNK> who is also know as front man of the rock <UNK> <UNK> debut movie entirely shot in <UNK> <UNK> the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and <UNK> rather <UNK> between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters when the movie ends you have a lot of stuff to think about because most of the different story lines are left wide open br br the movie has a purely <UNK> sound track that will rock your <UNK> off in most scenes the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel really making the movie <UNK> to watch at certain points of time the main scene in the film the party is very well shot br br the director didn't hesitate to use video clip techniques having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks i've heard lately br br the screenplay is great stuff camera angles and colors are very well chosen the <UNK> are very hot and very <UNK> too and i loved most of the acting br br the thing i liked most about the movie are the subtle touches of absurd surreal very dry or even cynical humor that <UNK> br br without claiming to be a comedy this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art it still manages to have its audience <UNK> and even burst into laughter at some times br br this is one more <UNK> debut that shouldn't be an ending i hope to see more tom <UNK> movies in the future because i had a good time cheers
<START> the script was very weak w o enough character <UNK> to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them the script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced the story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don't have to listen to them talk this very muted stiff dialogue on a technical note the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times then again this could be called a <UNK> overall this same story could have better been told in a short film w a running time under 30 minutes the obvious in your face <UNK> to sam <UNK> and evil dead would have been good had they been more subtle but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off c'mon this kind of <UNK> budget and this is the best that could be done still the cinematography lighting design and shots were very well done indeed
<START> based on fact this is the story of a teenager named homer <UNK> jake <UNK> growing up in a coal town in west virginia where a boy's usual destiny was to end up in the mines but homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets to the <UNK> of his mine <UNK> father and the <UNK> of the <UNK> generally a <UNK> for sure he and three of his equally <UNK> buddies begin making rockets which they fly from a <UNK> of <UNK> land eight miles out of town so as to no longer <UNK> the community with their <UNK> times <UNK> rockets unfortunately most of the town and especially <UNK> father chris cooper thinks that they are wasting their time however the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in <UNK> to watch the <UNK> send off their <UNK> <UNK> only one teacher laura dern in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become <UNK> in the national science fair with college <UNK> being the prize now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars director joe <UNK> has always been a famous name for his movies such as <UNK> jurassic park 3 october sky surely stands above all of his other films without any doubts october sky is his best effort obviously his best film it's not only a true story filmed extremely well but even as a movie it has every single thing which is required for a top level cinema and along with <UNK> extra ordinary direction are some exceptional performances jake <UNK> was around 19 when this movie was released he gives a beautiful natural performance he is a perfect actor chris cooper as his father also gives a very fine performance the same goes for laura dern also she looks beautiful even the rest of the performances are extremely well the background score was fine highly inspiring movie which lifts up your spirit sky high one of those movies which definitely <UNK> you for all of your life an amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment not to be missed
<START> hello this little film is interesting especially for an artist film maker or music creator or a visual artist for br br one can feel and examine david's touch style straight out of a short piece of relative simplicity br br you can see the <UNK> <UNK> of the shots the pans and the sound elements br br even as simple film this creation is <UNK> <UNK> for example there are some sounds that <UNK> all along while others appear though subtle at certain points to support certain shots br br one can see also several types of pans some go up and down in a gentle back forth way there is <UNK> pan <UNK> also go back and forth sometimes br br the lightning and the composition <UNK> of elements in the space is as usual and obviously work of a <UNK> artist this can be felt even in this crappy room this is to say one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look view and <UNK> the scene then comes the <UNK> of the visuals like <UNK> parallels etc the <UNK> <UNK> and the colours although without too much research for <UNK> as in big productions are fine too this is an <UNK> sketch of a sort br br all this is not <UNK> but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the david's touch feel to it as with any true artist
<START> you'll notice by the stars i've given this great film that ' before you see it the first time ' is implied i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week and last was a very slow rental experience not much great coming in i'm not sure how this movie slipped past me i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too still it did br br this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark just enough the entire film is you the viewer trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns i would have given this film 10 10 however some of the shots were pretty fake looking i don't hold that against this film too much but i don't think it deserves a perfect score br br lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious as always i think she's pretty underrated as a serious talent <UNK> her beauty which is difficult she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed as well br br jeremy northam does really well at first as quite a geeky corporate rat willing to run through any <UNK> to prove himself however as he changes throughout the film it's like night and day i know some fans of clive owen jude law or other <UNK> to become the next james bond will hate me for this but northam would could should fit that bill he's suave and <UNK> he's got a great bond <UNK> and voice i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it and rather down to earth as well br br great film and definitely this movie buff <UNK> it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films
<START> this is apparently one of <UNK> first shorts with the stooges this <UNK> his much earlier vaudeville years with the team but the <UNK> comedic timing is at its <UNK> best here aside from the intense slapstick scenes there are others more subtle but just as funny watch larry when <UNK> asks him to look at the camera for a <UNK> or watch the real object <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> oh highly polished <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> is at his <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> may look scary but he's somehow funny he seems as frustrated and <UNK> with the stooges as are regular people in other shorts br br for <UNK> <UNK> this is a must have episode it won't disappoint
<START> when this movie first came out back in 1984 prince was one of the <UNK> acts around everyone wanted to see this movie which was not much more than a extended music video the acting was pretty bad but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time despite that it was still a very entertaining film morris day and <UNK> <UNK> provide some all time classic comedy especially their rendition of the <UNK> which will make you think of <UNK> <UNK> doing their who's on first baseball routine br br <UNK> who went by a single name then provided some beautiful breasts so you had the brief nudity covered plus she is very attractive and of course the soundtrack of the album is one of the best prince ever recorded prince later on had a <UNK> with warner bros and changed his name but at this particular time in his career he was at the top of his game br br this movie doesn't rank in the all time great category but it is pretty entertaining
<START> for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to <UNK> in the original movie <UNK> your chance and then get back to the real world br br the guy who <UNK> the gold in the first movie told <UNK> so he gets transferred to another prison where wrestling <UNK> hang around looking <UNK> <UNK> plans to leave the jail in a month to get the gold to start a life with his woman br br then something happens and someone gets shot and the film turns into die hard in another prison but the <UNK> daughter is caught up in it all so he and <UNK> go to find her and <UNK> woman br br as you can imagine the acting is below par it features a lot of really annoying rap music and poorly edited fight scenes on the plus side it's got that hispanic bloke in it who stars in every prison action thriller ever made and he <UNK> a door in this br br it's not very <UNK> but at least it's harmless br br if you were a massive fan of the original it's okay ish stuff br br if not you have been warned
<START> i simply can't get over how brilliant the pairing of walter matthau and jack lemmon is it's like the movie doesn't even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two br br lemmon had already been in several well known films like mr roberts and the apartment and matthau was fresh off his oscar win for the fortune cookie another billy wilder film also with lemmon that particular movie wasn't as great as this one because the story couldn't sustain such a long running time i think it was almost 2 hours however this goes by at a <UNK> hour and a half even though the introduction of the events leading up to lemmon ending up at <UNK> apartment is a tad long so was this sentence that's a minor <UNK> though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time br br i have already written a comment about how the follow up to this film sucked and i won't go deeper into that the reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of american movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion there are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldn't even get a well i never out of the most <UNK> person out there it is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didn't work because you had matthau and lemmon say quite a few f words and that just doesn't fit them br br of course now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this i think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is john <UNK> <UNK> died recently so there you have it simply one of the best comedies and films ever br br add i have just learned recently that john <UNK> has died so to all the fans of him i am deeply sorry i didn't mean any <UNK> and i will try to be more careful of what i am blah blah <UNK> next time
<START> <UNK> ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a <UNK> comedy at the same time the result is uneven but generally entertaining keaton <UNK> all three aspects of his lead character quite well <UNK> is even better one warning george <UNK> is very poor in his supporting role otherwise this is quite enjoyable time capsule
<START> this is the worst imaginable crap the novel by h rider <UNK> is very entertaining and dramatic the makers of this worthless movie don't follow it closely well old novels aren't sacred and making free versions of them is fine with me if one has ideas of one's own if all one can do is changing things and replace them with uninteresting and watered down clichés one should stick to the original if they had done that this film would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed inside a studio with <UNK> made of cardboard but there's no imagination at all only <UNK> this should be bought or watched only by <UNK> of victorian novels made into movies br br just a hint and not a spoiler i think to make those of you who have read the novel understand what has taken place and what you may expect if you decide to watch this on tv or god <UNK> waste money on buying this <UNK> an old baddie witch in the book and some <UNK> to <UNK> has been turned into a nice gal
<START> i have yet to see a film with nolte in it that i did not like however this being said he's made a lot of films and i've seen just a few in my minds eye i am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in the thin red line nolte has a a full range of acting talents when it's necessary to shout he <UNK> like a wounded lion his best moments are the ones i treasure in actors when he just <UNK> through facial hand and body gestures without saying anything having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors by and large have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking having no conscious appreciation of the <UNK> of keaton and chaplin this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical <UNK> of computers of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in had chaplin lived in our times who knows he just might as well have become an <UNK> of cgi tools br br i have not read the <UNK> novel from which this film comes to the screen however the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we cannot follow the path laid even with all its surprises of course on the outset it appears preposterous however it is also not impossible br br consider these for starters a spy at the heart of the third <UNK> he extraordinary life of fritz <UNK> america's most important spy in world war ii by <UNK> and <UNK> look at amazon for more details consider history undercover <UNK> the <UNK> american spies inside nazi germany dvd i saw this here http store <UNK> com <UNK> product <UNK> <UNK> id <UNK> seems to be a history channel production br br so is the story ridiculous far fetched yes impossible no back to the plot <UNK> character is <UNK> and accepts an <UNK> dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts was it a type of <UNK> that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part that's a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp but it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things br br the acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out alan arkin always fantastic is very good in a small role br br i was really shocked by the ending of the film no i won't spoil it and it made me feel terrible about the choice did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages hard to say but it really <UNK> br br nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expect the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things it's very entertaining and provoking what great movies should be a bit long but worth it by the way the movie music has <UNK> from one of the best living <UNK> <UNK> part
<START> bottom of the barrel unimaginative and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior this film follows the exact plot as the <UNK> film <UNK> and is worse by far bad acting dialog effects dubbing pacing action sequences the list goes on and on italy made literally dozens of road warrior rip offs in the early 80's some good some bad this is the worst by far no contest not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half there was 1 one good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie and a cool shot of a man holding a hand <UNK> exploding but everything else about this movie seriously <UNK> for actual post <UNK> fun go track down a copy of <UNK> after the fall of new york or escape from the <UNK> instead they're much more enjoyable than this rubbish
<START> i'm a big <UNK> fan and the car was the best star in this film br br <UNK> the now <UNK> up drug <UNK> child star of the 80's is bland as per usual and commenting on back up from minor characters actors would be pointless needless to say they were all very average it's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's with some weird clothes some good shots of the <UNK> backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot br br all in all please don't waste your time watching this unless you love 80's movies corey <UNK> or like myself love old school <UNK> this one in particular looks great because life's too short to watch crappy movies
<START> went to see the movie <UNK> this afternoon here's what i learned br br contrary to popular opinion and history in general greek men were not gay ever this was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and <UNK> every five minutes or so thereafter so it is safe for american <UNK> to see this movie br br helen of <UNK> always had impeccable hair and makeup she looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which though numerous were probably all filmed on the same day one after the other with the director saying alright now look beautiful good ok now look frightened good now look depressed good now look interested good now look beautiful again good br br most greek and <UNK> men had british accents those with american accents couldn't act br br <UNK> looked just like <UNK> but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen br br brad pitt does not blink on camera br br helen of <UNK> biggest line was they're coming for me br br <UNK> music sounded remarkably like modern <UNK> music br br brad <UNK> <UNK> go all the way up br br <UNK> had a young male friend with whom he was very close but it's ok they were cousins never mind what history says br br peter o'toole can tell an entire story with just an expression br br <UNK> gods apparently all had greek names but their <UNK> either looked egyptian or like peter o'toole in drag br br greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting much like american men br br all of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color light egyptian by max factor br br <UNK> had only three women br br there were lots of blond <UNK> which is good news for brad pitt who would otherwise have really stuck out br br despite their <UNK> desert locale <UNK> had the uncanny ability to find <UNK> amounts of <UNK> to build fires funeral <UNK> <UNK> horses and the like br br british actors look silly with greek <UNK> br br brad pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes br br greek soldiers fought constantly but their outfits always looked impeccable br br greek soldiers wore underwear under their <UNK> br br apparently greek <UNK> were always in ruins even back when they were all new
<START> if you were born around the time this movie was finished and had a liberal open minded household that i had i'm sure during the early 80's you'd be first introduced to walking in on your parents watching dirty movies or extreme dirty movies you know not 100 pornographic but rather an <UNK> mixture of actual drama and pornography or that you'd sneak into their collection and pop in the plastic <UNK> representation of such a film in a big <UNK> machine called a vhs you had to be very quiet and ninja like but still having minor heart failure when huge pop noises were made when <UNK> the <UNK> like buttons out of fear of being discovered whatever the case such films were sent into the back of your mind waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual art needless to say this movie fits into the aforementioned description to a t many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps due to me being <UNK> i am more disturbed by the subtleties was the creator speaking to us on deeper levels of human <UNK> and or what could be considered a true abomination <UNK> relations bed frame masturbation <UNK> or could it be desperation for social status to the point of murder <UNK> homosexuality or the repressed sexual nature of social <UNK> females in 18th century france who can say but despite mr <UNK> taste for vivid raw sexuality being the norm for his works i'd say that indeed this movie does speak to the viewer on a deeper level concerning <UNK> <UNK> once i have learned this the story became much more interesting beyond the <UNK> of shock value and there <UNK> it is well worth checking out
<START> one question why first off the premise is not funny or engaging at all they use taped interviews and take the audio to <UNK> <UNK> with animals speaking the parts first off the interviews aren't funny or entertaining to begin with and even if they were i am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally without being turned into cartoons how does that add any hilarity to it i turned on <UNK> monday night sitcom line up which has become a regular way for me to relax after <UNK> monday <UNK> and found this on of course the sitcom line up would be reruns anyway being summer but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining i tried to give <UNK> a chance i really did when it started i figured well maybe it will be funny nope and then it kept going it was a long half hour br br and i can almost see if there was a purpose if the interviews were shown in their entirety and had points to them but no it was just one line clips cut and <UNK> together really quick it was like a horrible dreadful version of cartoon <UNK> robot chicken i wasn't a fan of <UNK> now cancelled sitcom the class while that was on it was one half hour of the line up i would struggle through but if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of creatures let's just say i'd take the class considering it's been a couple hours since it aired and i come on here to see i am the first to comment i guess that's a good sign that nobody watched it and that it won't last much longer cartoon <UNK>
<START> <UNK> action movie starring dolph <UNK> <UNK> is a one time military man who has <UNK> into a teaching job but the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides that he s going to hang it up things get <UNK> when while watching over a bunch of students in <UNK> some robbers take over the school as a base of operation for an <UNK> car robbery its dolph versus the baddies in a fight to the death jaw dropping throw back to the exploitation films of the late <UNK> era where bad guys dressed as <UNK> and some of the bad women had day glow hair what a stupid movie watchable in a i can t believe people made this sort of way this is an action film that was probably doomed from the get go before the low budget fake <UNK> sets and poor action direction were even a <UNK> in a producers eye watch how late in the film as cars drive through the school don t ask they crash into the security <UNK> don t ask since it looks more like a prison then a high school and smash its barely constructed form apart it doesn't look like it did in earlier shots what <UNK> the gods of bad movies <UNK> actually i m <UNK> since this was directed by sydney j <UNK> a really good director who made films like the boys in company c has his ability failed him or was this hopeless from the get go and he didn't even bother it s a turkey a watchable one but a turkey none the less
<START> fascinating yet unsettling look at edith <UNK> <UNK> big edie and her daughter little edie aunt and first cousin to the late <UNK> kennedy <UNK> they live in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mansion which was considered a health <UNK> by the city it becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric little edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually <UNK> the content is pretty much made up of two things the first are the conversations were little edie <UNK> big edie for driving away all her potential <UNK> and ruining her aspiring career as writer actress and dancer these discussions usually become very <UNK> nonsensical and often times amusing the second part consists of long <UNK> of attempted singing by both parties each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad in one amazing scene big edie actually physically attacks little edie with her <UNK> just to get her to stop her <UNK> very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it the filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus coming each day to record and chuckle at whatever bizarre behavior may come about ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by their hopes and dreams as <UNK> as the mansion they live in despite their <UNK> these two need each other more than ever for without the other there would be no <UNK> from the loneliness most amazing line comes from big edie whose many cats <UNK> themselves throughout her bedroom her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable
<START> i had seen lady with red hair back when it appeared and didn't remember it as something to <UNK> the truth is that notwithstanding its base in a true story its screen play is silly and unbelievable the real merit of the picture is the cast a <UNK> of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's make a background for the delicate intelligent work of the always underrated <UNK> hopkins and the wonderful spectacular performance of claude <UNK> who as usual is the best thing in the picture what an actor he never won an oscar but he is in the good company of chaplin garbo and hitchcock perhaps lady with red hair contains his best work in films see it and enjoy him br br
<START> this was an excellent film i don't understand why so many people don't like it there was so much in it to connect with so many beautiful images and so much compassion in the things that weren't said i was thoroughly entertained and was left with a feeling of <UNK> <UNK> just as i am when i finish most any tom robbins story now i haven't read this particular book of <UNK> so i don't now how this matched up but i can't imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation the movie left a lot for you to define yourself which is the best part of any tom robbins novel dreaming up the details br br to all of you who said this was the worst movie ever i pity what little must be left of the <UNK> light in your hearts far from the worst ever this movie was glorious long live the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> heather graham couldn't play a convincing lesbian if her life <UNK> on it who do the producers of the movie think they are the absolute worst most unrealistic movie i've seen in as long as i can remember this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign up on imdb and make sure the rating of this film drops br br <UNK> i'm heather graham i just <UNK> a drunk chick so while she's passed out i'm really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself <UNK> what have i done jesus heather get over it and grow up and i'd like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers and while i'm at it instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who's mentally unstable like your so called lesbian character after all i know the first time i had gay sex when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street honestly b <UNK> get a grip br br what a joke and please note there are many many many more flaws and <UNK> stupid aspects to this lame flick but i'm so sick of even thinking about it anymore bottom line if you're a smart person you'll hate this movie and if you're not a smart person then you'll love it it's as simple as that
<START> i'm in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of <UNK> movies this gem came along with 11 other movies and this is easily the worst i've seen in a long time i've seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn't take itself too seriously but really i think that's a cover up for the fact that its horrible it's not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were <UNK> on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you haven't seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you'll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that <UNK> of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to cliché visual ie opening credits to the <UNK> <UNK> special effects they couldn't even get <UNK> for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if you're going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a <UNK> bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin don't let stunt folk act they can't also the comment about this being a return of old vampire movies no it's not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire <UNK> blade underworld they're all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the <UNK> vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid 33 cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first <UNK> of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because it's better than i could do of course i also know i can't make movies so i don't try i do know how to watch movies though i work 12 hour nights 6 days a week i've seen several thousand in the year i've been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a <UNK> attack
<START> hollywood hotel was the last movie musical that busby berkeley directed for warner bros his directing style had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signature <UNK> shots or huge production numbers with thousands of extras by the last few years of the thirties swing style big bands were recording the year's biggest popular hits the swing era also called the big band era has been dated <UNK> from <UNK> to 1944 or 1939 to 1949 although it is impossible to exactly <UNK> the moment that the swing era began benny <UNK> engagement at the <UNK> ballroom in los angeles in the late summer of <UNK> was certainly one of the early <UNK> that swing was entering the consciousness of mainstream america's youth when goodman featured his swing <UNK> rather than the society style dance music that his band had been playing the youth in the audience went wild that was the beginning but since radio live <UNK> and word of mouth were the primary methods available to spread the <UNK> it took some time before swing made enough <UNK> to produce big hits that showed up on the pop <UNK> in hollywood hotel the appearance of benny goodman and his orchestra and raymond <UNK> and his orchestra in the film <UNK> that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the shift in musical taste the film was in production only a year and a half or so after <UNK> <UNK> ballroom engagement there are a few interesting musical moments here and there in hollywood hotel but except for benny goodman and his <UNK> sing sing sing there isn't a lot to <UNK> otherwise the most interesting musical sequences are the opening <UNK> for hollywood parade and let that be a lesson to you production number at the drive in restaurant the film is most interesting to see and hear benny goodman and his orchestra play and dick powell and frances <UNK> sing
<START> the <UNK> of bill <UNK> robert armstrong and james <UNK> play <UNK> island <UNK> <UNK> for the hand of ginger rogers a working gal who sells salt water <UNK> with the <UNK> of world war i the <UNK> <UNK> and pursue ginger from <UNK> the first half of this rko <UNK> production is hard going with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with <UNK> one liners and <UNK> dialogue that quickly grows tiresome the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy <UNK> both a german <UNK> <UNK> and a u boat these sequences are lively and well filmed but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy drama with a flat ending for fans of the stars only
<START> this film seems to be well remembered as the time tom jerry signed a peace <UNK> things are <UNK> for a time but predictably it goes sour probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a <UNK> a <UNK> pan and a baseball bat that the two plus butch the dog engage in at the beginning and end of the short i enjoyed one a bunch and you should try to catch it on cartoon network
<START> saving grace is never <UNK> funny but it delivers quite a few good laughs and i enjoyed it to a significant degree brenda <UNK> is a fine actress and does a good job at portraying widower grace who <UNK> to growing marijuana to pay off her massive <UNK> the supporting cast also does a fine job french actor <UNK> <UNK> has a funny little role the premise alone is appealing the idea of an over the hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough and the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then of course there are flat moments like one where two elderly women mistaken <UNK> marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work that was a mindless gag that didn't quite take off the film's tone is downbeat and occasionally dull but i got enough laughs to give this english <UNK> a recommendation br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> having lived in japan for several years this movie does not reflect the japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a geisha is all about unfortunately a great opportunity has been missed to bring the japanese culture a bit closer to the broad western audience and help <UNK> the country where <UNK> samurai the geisha world of <UNK> <UNK> from some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the americans are shown in japanese surroundings the geisha dances were not authentic there was far too much use of chinese music a minor but essential detail proper use of the <UNK> sticks was nowhere to be seen the <UNK> scenes were almost <UNK> <UNK> interestingly some of the chinese actors were quite convincing as japanese persons
<START> this movie is a true reflection of the australian <UNK> that has been required to make this country what it is over the last 200 years not pompous like the british not <UNK> ho like the americans if either of those countries had attempted what this crew did it would have failed <UNK> either due to ignorance on the british part or too much faith in superior <UNK> on the american side true <UNK> i e non <UNK> are the only ones who can <UNK> in modern military conflicts because they have had to <UNK> most of their adult lives just look at examples like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> new guinea and vietnam
<START> like his earlier film in a glass cage <UNK> <UNK> achieves an intense and highly poetic <UNK> that is even more <UNK> visually than its predecessor this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see the <UNK> drama intensity and <UNK> of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or <UNK> yet never steps into it in that way it pulls off an almost impossible feat to be so over the top and yet so painfully restrained to be so charged and yet so understated and even the <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> of the eye <UNK> gorgeous and highly tense this film is simply superb
<START> i saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy way br br <UNK> is absolutely terrible i mean he just cannot act period he should give up now as acting is clearly not his thing his co stars are about the same caliber i'm sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them the director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous somehow i don't think an oscar is on the cards for this guy br br i have never written a comment on imdb but this movie was so bad i felt compelled to do so br br if you get the chance to see this film don't 0 10 if there was a 0
<START> you should know that i am the type of person that watches even the worst of movies to the finish often out of sheer morbid curiosity i even watched <UNK> to the end before giving in to the temptation of <UNK> out my eyes and <UNK> on them you should also know that this movie was in my vcr for less than half an hour before i made a frantic leap for the stop button and <UNK> back the rental store just to put as much distance between me and it as possible
<START> the thief of <UNK> is one of my ten all time favorite movies it is exciting without gore it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless the casting couldn't have been better rex <UNK> made me believe in <UNK> and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad <UNK> as <UNK> he set the bar very high br br i watch this movie at least twice a year and never tire of it this film is an adventure for all ages no one too old to enjoy it the thief of <UNK> <UNK> my memories to a more innocent time i was ten years old the first time i saw it and the u s was just about to enter wwii conrad <UNK> was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying <UNK> a few years later in casablanca and <UNK> teamed up i believe with justin and <UNK> again in the four <UNK> great film making
<START> i watched this film because i'm a big fan of river phoenix and <UNK> phoenix i thought i would give their sister a try rain phoenix i regret checking it out she was <UNK> and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it sissy was just weird and <UNK> just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains whats going on i have never been so <UNK> in my life it was just total rubbish i can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film money time and space have sissy being <UNK> didnt get to me i thought she was everything but that those thumbs were just stupid and why do we care if she can <UNK> whats the point 0 out of 10 shame the <UNK> <UNK> have a 0 <UNK> even deserve a 1 hopefully rain is better in other films i forgive her for this one performance i mean i <UNK> do much better with that film
<START> i watched the film recently and it poorly resembles the book is based on i blame this on poor screenplay and direction some parts were <UNK> introduced the gay rape scene for no apparent reason i actually read the book after watching the movie and some 20 years or so after reading it for the first time i found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy too many <UNK> ideas introduced for no benefit at all other than sensational parts for the time as it covers stuff that was deemed <UNK> to say the least during communism i can see the fascination it produced at the time that isn't the case anymore though or maybe i see things differently now or a bit of both the film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book the result being a <UNK> of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made
<START> this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year i didn't see any cameos in the movie but it is still pretty good it is similar to anchorman in the humor department but i think this is a better put together movie it actually has a point if you are going to see a whole bunch of t a you will be disappointed just a well put together movie if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor you will find this to be a really good movie i definitely think that ebert and <UNK> review of this movie is right on i mean i don't really like ebert on most movies but this is the movie that i will agree about the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie <UNK> sure you get laughed at when it is found out about but it still suggests that you wait steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet it is still funny
<START> i think the biggest failing something can have is to be boring bad is actually better than boring this thing has no breath it does have the interesting fact of taking place in cambodia how many american made films of the 30's take place in cambodia nevertheless the conflict there is a little hard to figure out even the <UNK> movements are a little confusing what drags it to a <UNK> halt is the love story why those two guys are so totally <UNK> on the <UNK> blonde i don't know i thought he should continue to use his zombies such as they are and forget all about her the movie just <UNK> along the perfect <UNK> is where one of the principle characters follows a <UNK> priest through the water to get to the secret place where the <UNK> or whatever that explain how to turn people into zombies is kept i thought they would never get there one guy takes two steps he stops he looks around the other guy hides behind some <UNK> he takes two steps he stops he looks around the other guy hides behind some <UNK> this is the movie in a nutshell then there is the bad acting and insipid dialogue i actually have a lot of patience when it comes to b movies this one is <UNK> by the way a more apt title would be revolt of the <UNK>
<START> this is my all time favorite fred astaire and ginger rogers film the dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two like i'm putting all my eggs in one basket and let's face the music and dance if i remember correctly this was the film that introduced me to fred astaire so i suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart sorry for the sentimental <UNK> p but i'm woman so get over it all in all this film gets an 8 10 from me the choreography was superb and also the fact that lucille ball is in it makes it even more awesome
<START> i recently <UNK> the very underrated <UNK> and went off into town to find some games to use them on i bought soul <UNK> a classic and then i stepped across the <UNK> of resident evil code <UNK> i have resident evil 1 2 and have played <UNK> evil 3 numerous occasions and i have been impressed with all of them especially no 1 which has to go down in history has a classic br br but none of them 3 come anywhere near to the <UNK> attempt of brilliant gory <UNK> if its just for the sake of buying a <UNK> for this game it is worth every moment of your time and effort <UNK> never been so enthralled over a computer game in the way this has enthralled me br br anyway the story <UNK> on from the 2nd story in which claire <UNK> <UNK> for her brother chris from the 1st story who is presumed missing under the conspiracy of the <UNK> <UNK> corporation little is known about this corporation except the fact that you though you destroyed them 3 times in the previous <UNK> br br so <UNK> claire with the assistant of super brat steve u must <UNK> the truth of the real location of your brother the 2nd cd <UNK> you to control chris thats if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear br br the control are very slick and the movement of the characters are <UNK> realistic when the character notices danger he she faces the direction it is coming from pure genius br br overall i gave this game 10 10 because it is simply the game of the year game of the decade and the best game in the world full stop please purchase this game as soon as possible
<START> the rookie suffers from so much there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> just don't know when to quit it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are <UNK> then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when <UNK> and <UNK> are playing the stupid stereotyped japanese guys but it gets pretty <UNK> after switching back and forth between two sets of characters then it just abruptly ends even a naked julie <UNK> in a <UNK> can't save this one br br there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long the story just <UNK> along trying to set up funny situations and failing stick to martin lewis at least <UNK> had charm and jerry had that animated face
<START> it's terrible how some people can get away with such things this is one of those overrated things again and i hate things that are overrated that are no good why can't we have more tv shows and movies that actually have a story and excellent music and that are well written and are actually about something it takes many people to make this movie the series and the band all possible and those people are all wasting their time it seems that the bands are getting younger and younger i looked at how small that they were and i thought that they were 5 or 6 it's sad that kids are performing that young they are still too young performing takes a lot of work and they have many other things that they need to do with their lives the idea about having a very young band is horrible they need to stop having bands like this and i don't like the idea at all nor the kids themselves they are very annoying very young and their name is the naked brothers band the people that are involved in this and the people that are supporting this have all lost their minds whenever this band is shown on tv change the channel and <UNK> to get it banned br br and i know that this is a very boring comment thing but you get the point br br this band sucks get rid of it
<START> this does give away some of the plot by the way a charlie brown christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value christmas and just enjoying the holiday this however does not it tries to capture the emotion of a charlie brown christmas there even is another christmas play but fails with lackluster and easy jokes charlie brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of christmas but is instead wants to buy a present for peggy jean 25 <UNK> what his sister sally is the most annoying character in the movie here is one of her jokes sally wants to write a letter to santa but doesn't know how to spell charlie for some reason he needs to be in her letter so instead decides to name him sam because she knows how to spell sam also sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day <UNK> she instead says hockey stick <UNK> <UNK> if sally saying <UNK> 12 times all oddly sounding exactly the same doesn't kill you nothing will <UNK> patty and <UNK> are a large <UNK> point but that hardly makes it better <UNK> is funny with her <UNK> to patty but patty is another story she sounds like a boy which doesn't <UNK> the rumors and gets mad when she has to be the sheep in the play terrible <UNK> and all apparently she is the sheep every year and is worried she will forget her lines lines she doesn't have she is so worried she mentions it twice one right after the other and gets the same response i'm assuming she must have short term memory loss or something lucy and <UNK> are more welcome although <UNK> still has annoying advice but hardly amount to much air time i'm sure <UNK> isn't even in this one all in all it tries to be a <UNK> to the original but <UNK> the message for a few quick laughs
<START> both visually and <UNK> stunning a treat for both the eye and the ear the quintessential victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting helping to create a christmas scene of which dickens himself would have been <UNK> proud technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> achieved in a traditional stage setting the dancing of many of the lead <UNK> is <UNK> good the photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed a great film for all the family at christmas time and a most delightful discovery which will <UNK> multiple viewing
<START> i am sure there is some sort of imdb cult that likes movies that mst3k made fun of after seeing both this and werewolf and reading dozens of comments about how <UNK> they are i became convinced that there is some <UNK> going on here alot of people are saying that people who hate it are only scared by gore don't know good horror or stuff like that well i don't really care for gore but i do want something to happen in a movie most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around or walking around the house garden a movie requires something to give it <UNK> you don't get it by just have pointless scenes were someone walks around and stares oh and makes you think yeah i was thinking move you 0 one of the worst horror movie i have ever scene br br p s for the record i am a big fan of the old style of horror dracula frankenstein that kind of stuff
<START> can such an <UNK> production have failed its primary goal which was to correctly adapt <UNK> novel obviously yes <UNK> august managed to make a superficial shallow film where basic elements of south american mentality are presented simply as side events resulting in total <UNK> i can't believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book there is of course technical quality in this film and i think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands but something is missing and this something was the most important part
<START> the original <UNK> point was a great flick subtle motives characters that seemed real and spontaneous the remake was terrible preachy overtly obvious it missed the point as to why the original was a classic the black <UNK> was cool but even that couldn't rescue this flick why stick with a white <UNK> i didn't think that was the best choice back in <UNK> some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious like when <UNK> was standing on a cliff <UNK> the canyon after his dream quest his indian pal was standing next to him <UNK> was only wearing his white <UNK> i'm sorry it just looked silly him <UNK> the <UNK> in his fruit of the <UNK> another scene was at the end after the explosive crash into the <UNK> the <UNK> said that the impact was <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren't found because he <UNK> but some people believe he <UNK> out and was hidden by friends in the crowd then it shows him rolling out of the car at <UNK> <UNK> first of all you couldn't open the car door at <UNK> <UNK> secondly the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 <UNK> with nobody to steer it it would promptly roll over about 30 times <UNK> if you hit the <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> you would wind up in various <UNK> pieces no matter we see him at the end standing with his daughter all in all a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence
<START> this is by far the worst film i have seen in my entire life the acting is poor and the storyline is almost incomprehensible whether or not you like <UNK> or any ships for that matter is irrelevant as for special effects the film has none the whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough <UNK> rather than in a studio and when some of the men are stabbed if you can even call it that their reactions are totally unreal the guns are more quiet than a mute how this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind well thats about it this review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch if anyone is considering watching it or buying it i would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons i have said that it includes a spoiler if the fact that some people get stabbed and a gun gets fired is a plot <UNK> i suppose it is because they are the only good parts of the film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was the second cartoon to feature the title character after robert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> in that cartoon <UNK> has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted despite looking significantly more handsome <UNK> never developed into much of a character a big hat tremendous speed and a bad mexican accent do not a classic character make and that's pretty much all <UNK> ever had going for him nevertheless the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the <UNK> latter days while these early <UNK> shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently rather oddly paired up with <UNK> duck they still leave much to be desired relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula in this self titled episode <UNK> is <UNK> by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be <UNK> by <UNK> the cat although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon <UNK> role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat his personality is <UNK> by his being forced into the predictable <UNK> role of <UNK> this was always a problem in the <UNK> cartoons too but <UNK> makes an even <UNK> <UNK> thanks to his <UNK> <UNK> and the blatant <UNK> of his capture poor old <UNK> would be forced to appear alongside <UNK> for many years to come despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs <UNK> <UNK> won an oscar and a thoroughly <UNK> star was born
<START> this will be somewhat short first don't listen to the critics as it is not as bad as most say it is sniper uses a classic movie formula which many dismiss immediately as <UNK> the movie while sniper does not reflect the 100 truth about how our country's military <UNK> work it does give those who know nothing about the professional sniper a glimpse into the world of the sniper and yes the movie has many flaws but what movie doesn't there are many good scenes and good acting by tom berenger i have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with billy zane in the helicopter followed by zane in the <UNK> bar scene the best scene in sniper is with berenger in the middle of a field with the <UNK> force sweeping it also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a <UNK> and yes the sniper <UNK> is one shot one <UNK> judge sniper for yourself br br
<START> what do you expect when there is no script to begin with and therefore nothing that the director can work with <UNK> and farrell and <UNK> and <UNK> are good actors they just don't have anything to say or anything to react to even the <UNK> was pretty poor and i don't know how closely the movie follows the novel but two have the jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that <UNK> has a nice warm heart but some stereotypes don't amount to anything and he even <UNK> <UNK> out in the desert instead of bringing her back to l a for a nice catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while pathetic and the l a set was ridiculously <UNK> created anything good the window to his apartment felt real the <UNK> the sounds the wind and <UNK> is always great has been since the body <UNK> or night of the living dead <UNK> it was
<START> dick tracy wasn't the best for many comic book fans because they wanted something with blood like batman dick tracy plays the innocence of just being a comic book with villains that have severe appearance disorder and being fun warren beatty directs and stars as the main character that fights crime without even using super powers i have liked dick tracy since i was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors red blue orange yellow green and black this is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children al pacino is like the jack nicholson in batman and plays big boy <UNK> with <UNK> madonna as the babe who is the second villain in this film doesn't play the same boy toy she represents like i said no blood <UNK> sexually innuendo or anything to offend anybody
<START> brian de palma's <UNK> <UNK> can't really <UNK> the fact that his plot here is a <UNK> disguised psycho <UNK> copy but he does provide a genuinely terrifying climax his blow out made the next year was an improvement
<START> dog days is one of most accurate films i've ever seen describing life in modern cities it's very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly it's very close to reality isolation desperation deep emotional dead ends <UNK> affairs <UNK> <UNK> madness all the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today it makes you realize once again the <UNK> state in which people have lead society br br the negative side of life in the city was never <UNK> on screen so properly i only wish it was a lie unfortunately it isn't therefore 10 10
<START> i'm sure this is a show no one is that familiar of and might not think good of it after all it is almost close to <UNK> hawaii with the cast the location style of the directing and its publicity  shows women walking around on the beach and all that no wonder people have <UNK> and decide not to watch it br br it was wrong of them to do that cause after i decide to watch the show there are actually more thing going on real <UNK> story and conflict turn out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much  <UNK> br br the story of the hotel <UNK> the manager the owner and their complicated love life also enter the <UNK> <UNK> visitor and powerful man trying to steal the hotel it actually more exciting than it sounds here br br i won't deny that the acting suck but it ain't that bad that you'll look away the story is not so <UNK> but good enough the soundtrack is fitting pretty well with the scenario and the action is all the time i took me couple of episode before there is actually anything happen <UNK> so be patience br br recommendation i really do enjoy watching this <UNK> times better than expected br br rating 7 5 10 grade b br br please rate my review after reading it thanks
<START> stewart is a distinguished bachelor and a successful executive who is about to marry his fiancée <UNK> rule but instead gets involved with a <UNK> sensual art dealer kim novak who turns out to be a <UNK> village <UNK> novak desires <UNK> and intensely to love but is unable to feel it br br stewart slowly falls in love with her and looks for a way to free her from her witch spell novak <UNK> his well <UNK> concern as does her <UNK> cat <UNK> still stewart continues in his attempts to change her into a loving feeling woman as he <UNK> to marry her br br also <UNK> his way are such talented supporting actors as <UNK> brother jack lemmon a silly charming <UNK> who can walk <UNK> through walls a terrible author who is writing a book about witchcraft and the head of the association of manhattan witches none other than the incredible <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> aunt <UNK> elsa <UNK> unlike her other relatives is a tender witch who accepts that nothing should prevent the course of true love she aids and <UNK> them in turning novak into the woman of stewart's dreams for a happy ending br br if you like to see a lightweight comedy about magic fantasy and love beautiful cinematography stunning use of color and with an exceptional cast don't miss this enjoyable and amusing <UNK>
<START> that is the only question i am left with why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast why was the writing so bad it left the audience completely <UNK> with the characters why did it not make any sense at all why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and hollywood the hell out of it when all it needed was good smart story telling why i never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they're released i hope for the sake of freeman an spacey who are oscar winners that this never is released to the big screens in america br br as someone that holds a <UNK> degree in <UNK> the whole story is just utterly laughable i just think the script had potential but the execution turned it into a cliché and an awful one at that just no
<START> i'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching but this is certainly an <UNK> <UNK> the only true upside to this film is <UNK> <UNK> looking rather attractive and the fact that this film is really short br br the plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film none of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone i'm not sure why on earth sean connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this one br br the only reason i could see for seeing this film is if you are a die hard sean connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done save this one for last though br br well if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thanks for reading
<START> i love this movie 10 out of 10 hands down it is that damn good i am not much of a fan of movies but i gotta tell you this one opened my eyes astounding color and fast energy i was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the <UNK> film festival in boston and the story really <UNK> me from the start it had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended i wanted more i hope they make a sequel that would be fun my only problem with it is the performance of melissa connor as <UNK> ugh she sucks i've seen a block of wood pull out a better performance i don't what the director was thinking when he cast her but if you ignore her you can't help but give this movie a big ten
<START> one of the things that makes this ealing comedy so outrageously funny is the clever editing shots that would be considered absolutely essential to most modern comedies are deliberately left out this is what was known as british understatement br br three instances a comic fight is edited like this alec <UNK> has invented a new cloth that will ruin the industry half a dozen <UNK> invite him to their office to try to get him to sign a contract <UNK> his control of the cloth so that production can be <UNK> when he catches on to this <UNK> stands up and turns to walk to the door two men block his way excuse me he says quietly taking a step forward the two men move between <UNK> and the camera cut a secretary is sitting outside at her desk there is silence until the <UNK> begins <UNK> her <UNK> she takes up her <UNK> and opens the door to the inner office where a full <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is in progress and the room is half <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out the open door br br the following example would be <UNK> today during the research phase of his invention <UNK> sets up an elaborate chemical <UNK> but instead of <UNK> the experimental <UNK> into the new cloth the device explodes again and again it explodes the laboratory is <UNK> of all other work the <UNK> continue <UNK> fall down windows are blown out the director of research is <UNK> at his desk in a tiny office <UNK> with <UNK> a <UNK> on his head when the door behind him opens he jumps a foot in the air sit down he tells his visitor there's another one due at any moment it is excruciatingly amusing and there is not a single shot of any explosions this would be <UNK> now without a <UNK> and maybe a building <UNK> in slow motion br br last example <UNK> of a series of quick relentless cuts put together precisely <UNK> is being pursued and is <UNK> in the <UNK> of an office building by people who want him to sign the contract faced with two men about to <UNK> with him <UNK> backs up with a determined expression he <UNK> against a <UNK> with an iron bust on it the bust <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> against the wall there is a shot lasting about one second of the bust hitting the wall another brief shot of a metal shield hung above the bust being <UNK> loose and falling down quick cut to <UNK> head rising into the frame cut to the two men staring into the camera while horrible <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> sounds are heard off screen cut to <UNK> flat on his back nobody today would have the <UNK> to not show <UNK> being <UNK> by that shield br br i won't go on with this it's a comedy alright but a pretty bitter one underneath all the hilarity in solving one set of problems <UNK> has created dozens of others he is opposed both by management and labor neither of which is shown to much advantage and of course the economic <UNK> have to do with more than cloth what about that car that runs on water with a <UNK> of something or other in it one of the workers asks <UNK> interests comments another worker as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in his grave what would happen if our problems with energy were solved overnight if i owned shares of <UNK> and i think i do i'd <UNK> at the thought where would the oil industry be if there were no more need for oil for that matter where would the police force and the fbi be if crime were to suddenly disappear this is a thoughtful and very amusing movie superbly directed and edited the <UNK> of performers is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with that <UNK> voice the <UNK> cecil parker the <UNK> <UNK> ernest <UNK> br br a first rate job all around
<START> it's rare nowadays to find a romantic comedy that isn't incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie <UNK> big fat greek wedding me myself irene there were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie nothing <UNK> <UNK> all around it was a cute movie with likable characters i thought the ending was a little abrupt it feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish the acting left a little to be desired but was made up for by the pace of the story if i'd known it was a <UNK> brothers movie i would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie good for them i hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films
<START> i don't want to bore everyone by <UNK> what has already been said but this is one of the best series ever it was a great shame when it was canceled and i hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again the good news is that it is out on dvd i rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as i remembered it gary cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character and all actors were very good it is a shame that the network did not continue it shaun cassidy this is a masterpiece anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it must do so you will not be disappointed my daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television she is 20 is becoming very interested and will soon be a fan she finds it very twisted and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen i cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired br br this show rocks
<START> i found this movie thought provoking and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of quick fix films where we are manipulated into loving the good guy and hating the bad guy scott cohen a very handsome television actor does a great job of portraying the family black sheep lost child who <UNK> to gain his father's love and respect as well as that of his widowed sister in law with whom he apparently has a history judd <UNK> plays against his usual good guy image as a father who <UNK> his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected br br when i saw this at the <UNK> film festival i was enchanted by the lovely way the <UNK> was used to portray a family tradition as explained by the director br br this is a fitting <UNK> to the classic ordinary people i just realized judd <UNK> was in that too
<START> unbelievably bad acting a no good unclear story and flashy images and slow motions where they are needed the least <UNK> is everything a movie should not be br br <UNK> <UNK> a so and so dutch soap actress who hasn't attended her english classes plays rich girl <UNK> who has the habit of <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> is doing dangerous stunts break stuff and annoy people and not in a fun jackass way then there's <UNK> <UNK> he kinda leads the bunch but has other illegal activities on the side then there's <UNK> dad <UNK> who plays a dubious role as well and in the end we got jason <UNK> <UNK> the boyfriend of <UNK> br br one day <UNK> gets disappeared and everybody seems involved but we the viewer really don't care as nobody of the cast is either likable or believable and the story doesn't make any sense br br why was this even made 2 10
<START> been lurking for a couple of years or so i have never been moved to post on here before so perhaps this movie is worth a star for that but i doubt it i just watched it on dvd having missed it in the movies due to illness and never got around to watching it till now i had not read <UNK> about it certainly not even thought about the movie in some months it was just what the buddy picked up in the store so it got watched br br bad mistake br br the shot i spoke of in the the summary up top is in the trailer and on the poster right from the off jason <UNK> has hair like in no other <UNK> movie or any <UNK> movie that i've seen at least not in the <UNK> on display here and ray liotta in <UNK> should be advance warned it's scary and funny but not in a ha ha humour way its more in an almost <UNK> but slightly mutated and so failing sort of humour way they each say the same thing this movie is not like anything you expect this movie to be br br now based on previous extensive movie watching experience i expected this movie to be a few things like br br coherent br br interesting or engaging br br not a complete and utter <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> br br something more <UNK> than a <UNK> bunch of badly realised <UNK> from what is just a standard eastern <UNK> ideology dressed up as a cool modern self aware art form br br hopefully better than the idiots br br as you may have guessed by my tone it thoroughly failed to check any box above instead it was br br x badly edited pace all over the shop 70s amateur high 8 style jump cuts incomprehensible plot twists delivered through hackneyed flash back montages i could go on br br x shot as if by a depressed <UNK> old <UNK> who'd just spent the weekend watching <UNK> and godard with the <UNK> drawn br br x so up its own behind with the whole i'm really smart me <UNK> message that it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so just to make sure the dumb people ie everyone who doesn't like it in the audience make sure they get the point br br x a genuine waste of my time br br as for the <UNK> ability of some people to get something from this fine i'm glad you enjoyed it one poster said something that caught my attention under <UNK> probably understood it better because of the editing maybe but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible not less as for the genius is only <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> out there go suck an <UNK> and grow up there is nothing more <UNK> and self serving than people who say the reason another person doesn't know great art is because they don't understand the <UNK> <UNK> moon cycle <UNK> of supreme rational <UNK> which the <UNK> poet artist palm reader idiot <UNK> is using to explain his or her <UNK> grand scheme <UNK> with <UNK> great big bucket of dog <UNK> br br for me and many many more people its garbage br br movies art stories poetry anything designed to be viewed by another human is supposed to be engaging and moving in some direction be it <UNK> spiritual emotional or whatever you're having yourself br br the only way this moved me was forward in time two hours closer to my own inevitable demise the greatest trick he ever pulled was making you believe any part of this movie meant anything at all br br and now please by all means <UNK> my <UNK> for me
<START> very interesting the big twist wasn't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working it really got me thinking about a world without <UNK> or <UNK> and made me appreciate the world i live in a lot more charlton heston does a good job as do all the supporting characters and it was a very realistic film which was surprising it lacked direction at times and a lot of the settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie the main fault that i could find was that i didn't want the film to end when it did i would have liked to see what happened next br br 7 10
<START> why review good movies when you can review <UNK> ii br br <UNK> this film is <UNK> lame i can just picture the cast and crew driving around l a with a camcorder <UNK> extras in silly monster make up at poor long suffering tim <UNK> the <UNK> families actually turn up to play cameos probably because full moon couldn't afford real extras lame effects lame sets and a script so convoluted it would take <UNK> to <UNK> all the <UNK> this must be classic <UNK> br br and yet and yet it rules note this is the same thing i say about <UNK> iv i say it because it's true what can beat watching an old guy in a <UNK> coat <UNK> down zombies then bust out with <UNK> like don't worry ladies they're bio <UNK> well lots of things could be better but anyway this is still good stuff br br my only significant <UNK> is <UNK> ward who really stinks up the joint she's a lousy rival for helen <UNK> character they're both young pieces of eye candy and it would've been more effective if they actually <UNK> a bit more oh well you can't have everything at least the wonderful plot device of the long second watch is back in place and we've got more of <UNK> <UNK> the least convincing <UNK> in the history of cinema oh wait a minute he's got a rival in the form of david <UNK> <UNK> in creator br br i haven't seen this lately but i do seem to remember that <UNK> <UNK> runs away twice during the final battle <UNK> for lousy continuity just one of the many highlights in this fine film
<START> given the opposite <UNK> of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and <UNK> i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time but also found the music and dancing incredible also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor he plays <UNK> jones a young boy who is being <UNK> by his <UNK> he is told <UNK> some day you could be <UNK> this was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was <UNK> and thought to be endearing charming and funny the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man they depict the seats of government as being like a <UNK> <UNK> church br br the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in it is really well done and very entertaining i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president but that it is normal just makes this movie that much more relevant it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness
<START> this movie blows you off your feet this debut movie from tom <UNK> known from the <UNK> rock band <UNK> introduces you to 8 intriguing people building <UNK> of a compelling movie <UNK> they each survive one day and one night in the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> paints his characters with great deal of <UNK> and competently <UNK> their individual stories a tour the force that reminds of the best work of robert altman and paul thomas anderson the <UNK> of <UNK> surprises moves <UNK> the dialogues are so natural they seem to be improvised some great performances by <UNK> <UNK> natali <UNK> and the extremely funny duo from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> de <UNK> sam <UNK> is the memorable <UNK> a bizarre guy dancing throughout the movie sam is also responsible for the stunning choreography and of course tom <UNK> himself took care of the ultra cool sound track we were seriously impressed any way the wind blows is a movie that blows you off your feet
<START> this really is a great movie some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever but basically all of fred and <UNK> movies are the same after the singing and dancing is over it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott his romance with harriet <UNK> and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again he adds to this movie he doesn't detract from it he has a winning personality and a great smile randy is in my top ten all time favorites list it's great to see him as something other than a cowboy ok so he isn't really a great actor but like so many other stars errol flynn alan <UNK> victor mature etc he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions all of fred and <UNK> movies had sub plots that <UNK> on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers otherwise the movie would have to be <UNK> by about a half hour i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him
<START> for the life of me why did this film receive an r rating while it is about flesh eating zombies believe it or not it's actually a pretty good family friendly film at least if your kids are age 10 and older unlike the traditional zombie films this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values albeit a bit twisted the language isn't a serious problem there is no nudity and the film style is definitely <UNK> towards kids much like the old tv show eerie indiana yet some <UNK> slapped an r rating one it believe me most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film br br the story is set in a parallel type world while the fashions cars and <UNK> appear circa 1953 in this <UNK> world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the zombie war and massive changes in everyday life at school kids are trained in armed combat and there's a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a <UNK> and tells him to keep it in his <UNK> just in case as for life outside of school it's pretty weird as well as people now have learned that zombies aren't such a bad thing heck using shock <UNK> and training they can be made into slaves who can do your <UNK> clean streets deliver milk or in the case of a really sick guy be your special friend br br this film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave played by billy <UNK> mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the <UNK> friend dad on the other hand isn't convinced as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasn't yet gotten over this funny <UNK> and unique this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience
<START> the first side story in the universal century gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space <UNK> the focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict but on the everyday <UNK> population and how the war is seen through their eyes br br the story does contain some gundam <UNK> its premise being the attempts by a <UNK> squad to capture an experimental gundam but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch this series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named alfred and the relationship between his neighbor christina <UNK> who is secretly a <UNK> pilot and a <UNK> <UNK> pilot named <UNK> <UNK> alfred develops a sort of <UNK> love for <UNK> while our young <UNK> pilot also falls for christina br br war in the pocket proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story there are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here this short 6 episode <UNK> focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool he is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war the unlikely friendship and bonding between <UNK> and christina each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff same goes for the endearing relationship between alfred and <UNK> that being said i would not want to spoil much of the story here but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the <UNK> that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending br br despite its lack of action this show never falls into the category of boring the characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an <UNK> and are sure to satisfy the <UNK> for some mandatory mobile suit battles in a gundam series br br normally watching anime in japanese or english i would leave up to personal <UNK> but in this case i strongly recommend the english voice track over the japanese one not only do the characters whom all except alfred are <UNK> sound more believable in english but the performances of the english voice cast are on par and even <UNK> the japanese one <UNK> each character with such realistic emotions and <UNK> that they sound just the acting in some live action tv dramas br br in short this show does not try to impress the audience what it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child a truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given
<START> i usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film there's really not much to talk of just a <UNK> mash of other far better sword <UNK> epics lack of <UNK> runs rampant as does <UNK> even the main <UNK> <UNK> to wear clothing other then a <UNK> is pretty boring as she pretty much has a chest of a young boy mildly amusing in it's <UNK> at best and severely retarded at it's worst lucio fulci was <UNK> the bottom of the barrel here and it shows br br my grade d br br dvd extras posters stills <UNK> lucio fulci bio and us international theatrical trailers br br eye candy sabrina <UNK> is topless throughout some may consider that appealing i did not various extras are topless as well
<START> this movie is my all time favorite you really have to see michael jackson in this wonderful film i'm always over the moon watching it this is a film that you really have to see also if you aren't a <UNK> fan cause this film writes like captain <UNK> e t and ghosts a bit of film and music history this wonderful film out of michael's <UNK> is a must have and smooth criminal is really the most wonderful exciting and amazing song i've ever heard in my life thank you michael for this film and i love you <UNK> the best musician to hit this planet he's a fine man and he always brings <UNK> in your eyes when you listen to his music please if you don't know this film watch it and don't miss it because would be too bad for yourself if you'd miss it highly <UNK> film for every movie lover
<START> well it definitely is unlike anything else directed by lynch no supernatural stuff no violence no profanity nevertheless it is a beautiful flick it's a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because it's the story of an old man's 6 week that's my best guess for its duration journey the characters are everyday people and thus they are believable the performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching everyone who has a sibling can relate to it <UNK> and alvin don't even have to say anything for a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten
<START> well i guess i'm emotionally attached to this movie since it's the first one i went to see more than 10 times in the cinema helping me through my <UNK> <UNK> or rather keeping me from working on it br br but on watching it again several years and many many movies later what a well crafted little gem this is i've never seen gwyneth paltrow in a more convincing performance and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley where does one meet such a man sigh sophie <UNK> turn as ms bates is <UNK> acting of the finest oh <UNK> sorry and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either toni <UNK> brings a lot of muriel to her harriet and ewan <UNK> is convincingly charming and alan <UNK> and juliet stevenson are the perfect impossible couple br br of course the sets and costumes and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the <UNK> almost <UNK> like atmosphere of the movie although as far as cinematography and art decoration go it's almost a case of visual <UNK> very very pretty but a little more <UNK> might have conveyed a better sense of period but the good thing is the movie doesn't take itself too seriously and there is plenty of fun and some pretty cool editing that keep it from sinking into <UNK> merry old england mode br br my particular favorite is the ball scene some beautiful acting and directing here and the <UNK> dance <UNK> the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully pity that the final <UNK> scene goes on for just a little too long cut two shots i can think of exactly which ones and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the movie br br gosh i just realize by reading the imdb <UNK> that i've seen jeremy northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him seems he's got a lot more going for him as an actor than just being a <UNK> english <UNK> hmm guess i need to pay my video store a visit br br lovely movie my favorite jane austen adaptation so far though perhaps ang lee's sense and sensibility is strictly speaking the better movie this one is closest to my heart and i've certainly seen it many more times watch it if you can and don't be too hard on its little <UNK> br br
<START> i am a huge john denver fan i have a large collection of his music on <UNK> i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it i have the original <UNK> album and cd i have the original cd and later release the later release is missing several songs though i see that it has been released this year with all original songs to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at 75 00 wow to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much to me no amount is worth selling this treasure it is my favorite christmas cd i have never been able to find it on vhs or dvd i would love to have either version if anyone has one available please let me know thanks
<START> it has been so many years since i saw this but i do feel compelled to defend this gem against those who <UNK> it br br it is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinion here that is what humour does i suppose it is <UNK> it either charges through your funny bone at 60 000 <UNK> or it leaves you cold and wondering why you gave it the time br br this show has some of <UNK> best comic actors put together in a story that is silly and <UNK> and the outcome is hilarious the dialogue and visual comedy is beautifully delivered and the two leads <UNK> and lowe are superb together this was made for them br br i can't really say anymore other than to <UNK> you to find this and watch it you won't be disappointed and in a world devoid of <UNK> humour this is a classic inane and harmless piece of comedic brilliance
<START> i admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film i wasn't entirely sure i was going to sit through the whole thing like many other people i found it pretty boring and i wasn't entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite <UNK> and stick them together however if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is i really think it's sad that so many people found this <UNK> boring or a <UNK> of ideas done by other artists br br rivers and <UNK> is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of andy goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of <UNK> it is slow moving and <UNK> but i think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that <UNK> art does not need any <UNK> in order for it to be appreciated i've even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which i just think is madness br br on the other hand lots of people complain about <UNK> coming with the lyrics written out inside them a lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the <UNK> wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics i guess i'm just the kind of person that believes that i'd like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork i can still take it how i want to even if i know what it was meant to do i can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie he does after all lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you don't want goldsworthy talk about his art while you're watching the film feel free to turn the sound off that's like not reading the lyrics if you don't want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourself br br i think that andy <UNK> work which i had no idea existed before i watched this movie is incredibly impressive and i'm glad that this film was made in order to showcase it indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and i really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented <UNK> work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is not the star <UNK> art is and given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slow moving nature of the film it seems to me that director thomas <UNK> knows that
<START> thank god this wasn't based on a true story because what a story it is populated by despicable characters whose <UNK> knows no <UNK> before the devil is a mesmerizing jaw dropping <UNK> into <UNK> which would be laughable and sometimes is even with or perhaps because of the <UNK> tragic <UNK> of human <UNK> throughout if it weren't carried out with such magnificent overwhelming conviction by its stars the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn't hurt either br br the main <UNK> here is of a family nature with the two <UNK> screwed up brothers brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store an attempt that goes <UNK> awry br br the story is told with time shifts which are noted on screen such as charlie two days before the robbery so no one should be confused some people have said they didn't like this device but i thought it worked perfectly adding to the <UNK> of the whole affair considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full <UNK> between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life throw in these cheesy extra <UNK> one of the brothers is a drug addict married to gina marisa tomei also excellent who is having an affair with the other brother toss in some monumental sibling rivalry along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father a wrenching performance from albert finney who has apparently caused him serious past pain and you've got a shakespearean greek tragedy on your hands proceed with caution
<START> this is one of the best episode from the second season of <UNK> i think mick <UNK> has a problem with women he <UNK> all they are often the victims <UNK> solution pro life valerie on the stairs i don't remember the <UNK> episode in season 1 etc obviously <UNK> i think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture <UNK> and i don't know never least right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful the acting is like the entire series regular i could be worst like pro life or we scream for ice cream also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode the ideology of the series is horrible killing and <UNK> women <UNK> animals and on and on the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like <UNK> burns the best of all <UNK> the most funny <UNK> really shocking
<START> first saw this gem from joe <UNK> way back when and i must say that after seeing it i could never forget jennifer welles at first i thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a <UNK> film but when jennifer made her entrance the first time i ever saw her anywhere i was sat up and took notice her presence in this film is hard to avoid and <UNK> up every scene she's involved in i've seen most of the rest of <UNK> films and the other films starring or featuring jennifer welles and i must say that this was both <UNK> and jennifer at their collective best <UNK> direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb and jennifer showed <UNK> and literally an acting <UNK> that make this a must see co stars rebecca brooke aka mary <UNK> and chris jordan both frequent co stars of ms welles and also frequent stars of <UNK> work turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous yet normal <UNK> this film is <UNK> classic
<START> unfortunately this movie is so bad the original out of <UNK> was manic and very funny of course they used the script written by neil simon for some reason neil <UNK> script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again even the audience i was with never laughed the direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i e the couple having sex in the park they <UNK> it is a lighting ceremony for new york well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and <UNK> goldie steve do a bit of slap stick the whole movie winds up being like this a joke is set up and given away why isn't <UNK> hair ever even messed up in the movie you will also notice every close up of goldie they use a very intense soft lens i suggest you rent the original with jack lemmon and sandy dennis that's if you want to laugh
<START> after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then <UNK> the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca <UNK> and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a <UNK> for a <UNK> upper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical <UNK> is not the only problem with their new home it just may be haunted br br 13 <UNK> row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by catherine <UNK> into a slightly above average shocker br br the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly <UNK> to that <UNK> a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some <UNK> editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing <UNK> the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer <UNK> and better <UNK> as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that br br after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly <UNK> the story has a lot of similarities to the <UNK> horror 1979 though the budget forces a much <UNK> approach <UNK> and scriptwriter tony <UNK> effectively create a lot of <UNK> creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old <UNK> of iron which had been <UNK> <UNK> to an interior wall br br for some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on <UNK> drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to <UNK> <UNK> for the house and then trying to settle in but <UNK> writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that <UNK> later especially if you've gone through similar <UNK> while trying to buy your own house br br once they get settled and things begin to get <UNK> even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film there's more of an abundance of home <UNK> nightmares but neither menace is really the point br br the point is human relationships there are a number of character <UNK> that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a <UNK> for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it that it's in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful <UNK> shows that these problems do not only <UNK> those who can place blame with some <UNK> <UNK> such as money or health problems <UNK> character <UNK> from a <UNK> corporate employee with normal work based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes <UNK> scheming to <UNK> something more <UNK> and meaningful at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds <UNK> when she <UNK> herself from her failing romantic relationship br br although 13 <UNK> row never quite <UNK> its made for television <UNK> as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horror thrillers with a bit more <UNK> depth should find plenty to enjoy it certainly isn't worth spending 30 for a dvd that was the price my local <UNK> station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it <UNK> in <UNK> and handling but it's worth a rental and it's definitely worth watching for free
<START> i used to review videos for joe bob <UNK> legendary we are the weird <UNK> i saw a lot of <UNK> but this by far was the worst and the years have not been kind it remains the most <UNK> crime against cinema i have ever witnessed don't get me wrong <UNK> terror is <UNK> more technically competent than say monster a go go or the guy from harlem or something of that <UNK> what <UNK> its claim as worst movie of all time for me is its unique blend of bare <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> is it a vietnam commentary an <UNK> protest an <UNK> to race riot a study of man's <UNK> to man a novel exercise in padding nature footage out to nearly feature length in short a <UNK> young urban professional possibly the most <UNK> screen character ever somehow <UNK> a <UNK> asian american associate into camping in the woods with him after brow beating her with quasi philosophical <UNK> for the better part of an hour they run across two wandering veterans the unforgettable <UNK> a righteous brother and the <UNK> guitar <UNK> <UNK> family reject hey a plot twist tension action suspense well no just a climactic getting locked in a <UNK> wire chicken coop and lightly <UNK> scene the victim in question stares <UNK> at the <UNK> and <UNK> no no please don't meanwhile <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> as <UNK> once every two minutes bringing to mind nothing so much as the alien star of juan <UNK> <UNK> people that's about all that happens in <UNK> terror and such a synopsis perhaps makes it seem almost tolerable but trust me i've seen thousands of movies in my life and this one has remained for the past eight years since i first saw it the absolute worst i pop it in the old vcr once every two years or so just to <UNK> myself and <UNK> myself i certainly do i think the element which makes <UNK> terror so particularly hateful is this very little happens and although what little does happen happens quite poorly and quite slowly what truly makes it <UNK> unwatchable is the <UNK> sense that the filmmakers really really want to <UNK> some kind of message down your throat but because <UNK> terror is so incompetent and <UNK> what was intended as a <UNK> lesson becomes a crash course in intense viewing <UNK> this film is 75 minutes long and feels like three and a half hours it's terrible truly truly terrible folks trust me i saw ghosts that still walk and this one is worse go see it you'll thank me and curse me just for the record my favorite line in <UNK> terror but perhaps ever yeah well you probably think the song of <UNK> was an allegory for <UNK> love for the church note must be delivered in a tone of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> how rick sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold <UNK> this film is absolutely criminal before watching this movie i thought <UNK> hands of fate was the worse piece of crap i ever saw but at least <UNK> moves so slowly you might fall asleep thereby <UNK> your eyes from the pain it will suffer the greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the hobgoblins locked up makes it to the final scene the time i spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life
<START> burt kennedy used to be a very good director but you'd never know it by this <UNK> mess not only does this film look cheap it is cheap most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior the last command from 1955 and that footage shot <UNK> years previously looks more contemporary than anything in this picture the few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are <UNK> confused and incompetent looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture this has the look and feel of a bad student film and the budget didn't seem to be a whole lot more it moves like <UNK> the acting for the most part is either over the top ham or under the top <UNK> although <UNK> julia comes off better than most of the rest of the cast and it's chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies on top of that it's way too long if you're going to make a boring film do it in an hour or so and get it over with don't stretch it out over three hours like this one does if you want to see a good movie about the <UNK> check out john wayne's 1960 version or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy skip it
<START> this has to be the all time best computer animation classic even though most of the animations where experiments they have an artistic quality that has stood the test of time twelve years after it's release i have gone back to watch this video and found some inspiration for new types of computer graphics some of the techniques used in this video have never been full explored
<START> the quintessential road movie if your idea of a road movie involves three would be <UNK> with eastern european accents and claire <UNK> well one out of four ain't bad a no talent magician with an eye for <UNK> max watches a very skilled <UNK> hugo <UNK> his trade in new york after convincing hugo that he max is a mental and b desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive the not so dynamic duo <UNK> the <UNK> expertise of an <UNK> of <UNK> milo and the ah <UNK> attributes of a lovely waitress <UNK> the unlikely four pile into a van <UNK> by hugo you guess where it came from and head to vegas havoc ensues anyhow it's funny it's well written and the ending is surprisingly good a solid comedy with a warm heart and all the better that it was totally unexpected
<START> the supernatural vengeful police officer is back for a third installment this time acting as guardian angel for a <UNK> accused female cop standard stalk and slash picture yet well acted and directed thus making it oddly interesting and watchable though the violence isn't for the <UNK> especially the director's cut which was originally given an <UNK> 17 rating br br 1 2 out of
<START> first to die 2003 br br i'll admit my mistake first i didn't realize this was a made for tv movie i was thrown off by the r <UNK> the plot is strong but the movie is about 40 minutes too long the direction and continuity were excellent for the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters the down side of the movie is that it definitely falls into the chick flick genre although there are some violent scenes none of the violence should call for an r rating there is no nudity or gratuitous sex scenes actually there are no sex scenes <UNK> <UNK> who is absolutely beautiful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> davies were all guests on the sg 1 series but this movie did nothing to advance their careers since they were all used as low level supporting actresses robert patrick was fantastic as he usually is and mitch <UNK> made me think of a modern day lee marvin the very talented <UNK> <UNK> who i came to respect as an actor during the millennium series was given nothing challenging to show her range of abilities the greatest disappointment with regard to the cast was tracy <UNK> aside from being a below average actress and not particularly attractive her voice is absolutely annoying i found myself <UNK> the tv during her dialogue i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the lifetime tv type of programs i would not recommend paying any money to see this movie however considering i found nothing that would cause censorship this is a movie that is worthy for only watching on tv since nothing will be cut out as a tv movie i would rate this as a 5 out 10 as a feature film with an r <UNK> and such as strong cast i rate it as a 2 out of ten
<START> you know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably when you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash <UNK> your screen house of the dead struggles to achieve even this low <UNK> level of cinema br br from start to end house of the dead manages to recreate the feeling like you've just <UNK> up to find out that the cat has laid it's <UNK> business neatly on your <UNK> while you slept it is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their <UNK> size which they exploit shamelessly whereas the males for their hardcore kick ass attitude i honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture uwe boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie at least then we'll get better <UNK> however not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film it is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as these are zombies pure and simple and no <UNK> we must not go there it's evil br br we all know that zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning at best they are a harmless two hours of action blood and closet terror trash yes but entertaining trash not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you <UNK> it across the room and <UNK> your shoes in sour milk <UNK> and <UNK> banana <UNK> according to imdb house of the dead received such bad reviews that no danish cinemas bought the movie if only we could have had the same <UNK> br br final score 1 10
<START> i watched this movie and hoped for something to get better the entire time what is so great about a guy with no emotion yawn br br you never see alex show emotion for anyone other than his son yeah i know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper if you can call it that i get it br br characters are undeveloped relationships aren't given enough time to be understood in one scene sarah says they won't fall in love and the next time we see her she's talking about how his death really <UNK> her up because they were so close logic <UNK> abound in this film br br it's like someone watched boogie nights and wrote this part to <UNK> little bill even the scene where he loses his temper is the same as when little bill shoots his wife down to the facial expression or lack thereof yes william h macy is good at portraying a man without emotion been there done that can you say <UNK> br br this movie didn't only lack emotion it lacked substance a good script developed characters and a plot and it certainly lacks my recommendation br br a
<START> how can a director that makes such great films as <UNK> and the texas chainsaw massacre make such rubbish as this i got this film off a friend and he didnt want it back its so bad how this can be <UNK> as horror i will never know br br 2 10
<START> the secret of kells may be the most exquisite film i have seen since the <UNK> of <UNK> although <UNK> very different kells shares with <UNK> and the jaw dropping opening <UNK> sequence of kung fu <UNK> incredible art direction production design background <UNK> and a <UNK> in color that is a feast for one's senses kells is so lavish almost gothic in its <UNK> somewhat reminiscent of <UNK> wonderfully flat in general overall perspective <UNK> in its <UNK> <UNK> design yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing and it all works together beautifully you fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them you are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the <UNK> brush what <UNK> nora ross paul and all at cartoon saloon their extended <UNK> have achieved with this small budget very small <UNK> film is absolutely astounding the <UNK> of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal this film is breathtaking and the buzz amongst our colleagues in <UNK> this film is <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> to kells on its many <UNK> its annie nomination as well as its current oscar <UNK> run they are all very well deserved <UNK> indeed
<START> star wars episode 4 br br the best star wars ever its the first movie i ever sean were the bad guys win and its a very good ending it really had me wait <UNK> for the next star wars because so match stuff comes along in this movie that you just got to find out more in the last one <UNK> al lot of movies i always get the feeling that it could be don <UNK> but not <UNK> this one and i will never ever forget the part were <UNK> <UNK> luke he is his father way too cool also love the bob feat figure a do hes a back ground player if you never ever saw a star wars movie you go to she this one its the best br br thanks lucas
<START> i am amazed that movies like this can still be made i watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen never <UNK> that a movie of <UNK> minutes can make me think about it on and on br br washington charismatic and intense as ever plays creasy a washed up ex counter terrorist agent who's taken to the bottle once he's assigned to protect young pita <UNK> fanning in mexico city his emotional and <UNK> arc is jump started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide inevitably pita is kidnapped by thugs and creasy decides that most of mexico city must pay the price for daring to take away his character's teddy bear <UNK> <UNK> yes he has become a man on fire br br you must see this movie
<START> in an attempt to cash in on the success of <UNK> horror films <UNK> pictures hired several popular actors from the current genre and put them in this effort that realistically speaking is nowhere near as good with that this is still worth everyone's time and it's a heck of a lot of fun to view and in my opinion it's better than most of what is supposed to pass nowadays as horror story takes place in the small german town of <UNK> where the bodies have been <UNK> up completely <UNK> of blood and with suspicious <UNK> marks <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lionel <UNK> shouts it's vampires but the local police chief karl <UNK> melvyn douglas thinks it's a madman who's responsible and he <UNK> to catch him br br spoiler alert the <UNK> and most of the towns folk think that the local <UNK> herman <UNK> dwight frye who loves bats and frequently talks to them is the one they are looking for and they chase him until he falls to his death in a cave the one who is responsible for the killings is dr otto von <UNK> lionel <UNK> who has created a new form of <UNK> mass that <UNK> on blood and he <UNK> this by having some sort of mind control over his servant <UNK> robert <UNK> who goes out at night to collect the blood dr otto has a pretty assistant named ruth <UNK> fay <UNK> and an annoying aunt named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but they have no clue what he's up to but karl eventually become suspicious when one of the murders takes place after <UNK> death br br frank r <UNK> was never confused with being james whale but he was a pretty competent director who ended up directing most of the <UNK> films in that series and with this film he uses the same sets from the old dark house which was also filmed at universal i'm the first to admit that this film is downright clumsy at times but it's practically impossible to resist a film that has a cast like this including frye who is pretty much doing his <UNK> role only this time he befriends bats and <UNK> them and keeps them in his pocket for safe keeping one thing that just doesn't make sense is the mind control that dr otto has over <UNK> as the film never explains this and i had a strong sense that this was some sort of nod to the <UNK> of dr <UNK> but on the other hand it's probably just the weakest part of the script there are a few other <UNK> that i noticed including the chase of frye to the big <UNK> which is obviously an early shot of the infamous bronson canyon where numerous other films have been made and also <UNK> brown hair which is her true color true horror film fans will appreciate this more than others but i think this is a fun film to view for everyone and with a cast as attractive as this it's well worth a look
<START> when i first saw the preview for this movie i really couldn't wait to see it the plot seemed good and the setting was great i mean a slasher movie that takes place on prom night great idea and the plot a high school teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students goes crazy gets arrested and escapes three years later on prom night prom night a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable turns into hell however i saw it and was extremely disappointed it was not only the worst horror movie i have ever seen but it was one of the worst movie in general that i have ever seen first of all it wasn't even scary there was not one moment in that movie when i jumped out of my seat also the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull all the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats also there was absolutely no gore its rated pg 13 the scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl he <UNK> her throat and blood <UNK> on the sheets hanging around them they don't actually show him cutting her throat br br next you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie he isn't mysterious creepy or scary he's just this guy who kills people br br also everything in the movie was so cliché an example is when at the end the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment the detective shoots and kills him also every single thing in this movie was so predictable the victim after seeing the guy with a knife runs for her life hides thinks she gets away and then the killer just pops out and kills her br br finally the sequence of the movie was extremely bad the guy goes into the hotel kills a few people the bodies are discovered someone pulls the fire alarm and everyone <UNK> the main character forgets something in her room has an encounter with the killer runs and escapes thats it she and her boyfriend go home the slasher kills the guards <UNK> the house finds the girl then gets killed by the detective the movie sequence was so stupid and cliché br br if your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good trust me don't waste your time or money no wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater my friend and i along with these two girls sitting in the back were the only ones in the theater that should have told me something about the movie beforehand
<START> according to john ford's <UNK> shot fictional biopic of abraham <UNK> life his greatest faults may have been an <UNK> with woman and an ability to dance in the worst way ford's camera has only <UNK> views to reveal of mr <UNK> early life but for what the film lacks in character <UNK> it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision <UNK> beautiful compositions of early film what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames ford has a unique eye for telling a story the film sings of the life of a hopeful young man henry fonda plays the <UNK> and <UNK> clever lincoln to a <UNK> one of his best roles br br the film concerns two young men brothers on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed in classic angry mob style the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them until honest <UNK> steps into the <UNK> he charms them with his humor telling them not to rob him of his first big case and that they are as good as <UNK> with him as the boys lawyer what follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom murder dramas thereafter as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing <UNK> br br the film plays out like many john ford movies do a <UNK> of <UNK> a dash of <UNK> predictability a hint of sarcasm that you aren't sure if you put in the recipe or if ford did it himself despite the overtly <UNK> feel of the film and overly patriotic banter <UNK> to <UNK> future <UNK> the film is entirely enjoyable and <UNK> well constructed if you can take your drama with a grain of salt
<START> a concept with potential and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together but br br <UNK> glowing nose didn't require the explanation offered in this film much like the force in the star wars films didn't need the explanation of <UNK> in the <UNK> but mainly the film left me cold because of <UNK> over complicated plot to destroy santa he's got the power to put <UNK> into people's minds so why does he do things in such a <UNK> way breaking the magic of <UNK> nose framing <UNK> threatening to melt the <UNK> family the <UNK> exaggerated plots of <UNK> and the brain and <UNK> and <UNK> dr <UNK> which are done that way on purpose and played for laughs seem simple and straightforward compared to <UNK> which we're expected to take somewhat seriously br br there is a particularly and <UNK> strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy like <UNK> i understand if they don't want to have guns being shot in a family film but then why have guns in the first place
<START> i've bought the feast of all saints and it's not truly a horrible movie but a lot of things could have been better it had a lot of historical value played out by very talented actress actors and it's not an everyday <UNK> that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat believable there were some parts that were a little mediocre and confusing but i wouldn't say that the entire movie was horrible once you think about that capturing <UNK> new orleans and making something out of it it pretty hard and much harder to get actors who can strongly <UNK> those parts but the only big problem i had with the movie was that most of the actors who did play the free people of color were mostly light skinned <UNK> not very universal in casting others who weren't light skinned one of the old <UNK> stereotypes that still exists <UNK> did the casting could have picked a wider variety when it came to <UNK> despite many <UNK> are color conscious rather picking actors that looked near white in a sense could have been more thought out the actors did a great job the script could have better written and overall i found the performances were very believable
<START> i think it is a nice movie i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and <UNK> i think it was not intended to be sensual <UNK> is a result not a purpose i think it is very natural i think it is <UNK> i think it was interesting i think the actors never made me think <UNK> lame acting they are not sean <UNK> co neither is the film a block buster they are like the movie normal <UNK> that can act i think the movie reached its intention i think it made me feel things or feel them again i think i'm not objective br br i really enjoyed it that i know
<START> when it comes to movies i can be pretty <UNK> and i'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong while every movie has its flaws the night <UNK> had an exceptionally low count br br if you read the last review it was hard since half of it was written in <UNK> and it contained no actual information about the movie you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done unfortunately if you read more than 3 lines into that same review you discovered the <UNK> reason for disdain he she does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team <UNK> crack apparently br br so despite the fact that i have never written a review before i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits not the sexual <UNK> of its director let's go over a quick <UNK> first 1 great plot absolutely i won't give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials this is a thriller not a horror and it should be approached as such the story really will <UNK> you even more so because it's true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events br br 2 wonderful acting oh yes robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type cast and he has since <UNK> in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago he once again achieves high form in his role in the night <UNK> playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and <UNK> in a case of well i'll let you see for yourself br br 3 excellent direction certainly now unlike the other poster to which i referred i actually know something about direction i've been <UNK> the art of direction at school now for 3 years of course i really don't think that makes a <UNK> of difference the only thing that matters is if you like the direction but i thought i should simply establish once again that i'm <UNK> my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant for example not the sexual <UNK> of the director or the alleged drug <UNK> of the production team lol br br patrick <UNK> direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so sought after feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fast paced camera work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today some people can truly show you a story through their camera while other's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be <UNK> which is as an <UNK> through which we all see br br 4 lighting cinematography and editing great all around i've already wrote so much and i could go on about these last three things for another ten <UNK> so i'll just wrap it up br br in short go see this movie don't listen to people who have <UNK> motives for <UNK> it especially if they're so stupid that they <UNK> reveal that motive 1 4 of the way through their post enjoy the show ben
<START> it is difficult to find any <UNK> in this movie seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort hence we are treated to a full showing of galaxy which is the <UNK> excuse for a movie in history the police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms more action shots of the two cops a lot less of galaxy would have been the way to go of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched <UNK> ms <UNK> does excellent looking sexy her acting is first rate ms stabs whom i had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very <UNK> but seems to lack basic acting talent apart from ms <UNK> this is real garbage
<START> this film came out 12 years years ago and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in new york the <UNK> on drag performance say nothing of these <UNK> houses anthony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> says nothing julian <UNK> the drag queens of new york an illustrated field guide with its flow <UNK> of influence that pulls together julian <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> queens and the 90s club scene and <UNK> the film ignores the houses completely even laurence <UNK> the changing room the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it br br i understand from the film itself and various <UNK> i found on the web that this house system goes back decades the major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be <UNK> la <UNK> in the queen 1968 the historical context is the biggest missing part of paris is burning br br the film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored it is a valuable <UNK> of life in 1989 the unfortunate fact that <UNK> <UNK> was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending but this is not the only film about <UNK> to include a real life murder as we now know <UNK> corey had a <UNK> corpse in her literal closet but this did not come out until three years later br br of historical importance but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context
<START> overall the film is ok i think it's better than <UNK> and much better than <UNK> in term of its story its sentimental value br br there are a few scenes that makes me touched yes i agree that the boy <UNK> did his acting very good brilliant i can say that his acting is almost natural br br however the song <UNK> me <UNK> <UNK> by nina <UNK> really <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> br br i love the song both the song <UNK> me <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i just <UNK> the song beautiful br br and <UNK> to <UNK> the movie's ending credit makes me touched again we can see how <UNK> really appreciated her parents in an unique way br br i think the movie deserves that grand <UNK> of international jury at berlin film festival br br i give 8 5 out of <UNK> stars
<START> this film needs to be seen the <UNK> picture of what is going on in the world that i've seen since <UNK> nightmare go see it and if you're lucky enough to have it open in your city be sure to see it on the big screen instead of dvd the writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through though hardly perfect joan cusack is amazing and the rest of the cast is good too it's inspiring that john cusack got this movie made and i believe he had to use some of his own money to do it it's a wild absurd ride obviously made without the resources it needed but still succeeds jon stewart steven <UNK> snl even bill <UNK> haven't shown the guts to say what this film says
<START> saw it at the philadelphia gay and lesbian film fest br br what can i say against my better judgment i liked it but it seemed to me that that acting was a little weak mostly i noticed this from the family of the teen boy i mean the script wasn't stellar to begin with but the actors didn't make me believe the relationships br br the plot is also predictable br br <UNK> i liked it the characters are likable and the plot is not challenging or <UNK> it's sweet the characters care about each other and i don't count it as fifty minutes ill spent br br but i don't recommend it
<START> this is my first comment on imdb website and the reason i'm writing it is that we're talking about one of the best films ever <UNK> <UNK> ' will make you laugh and cry at the same time you will fall in love if you're not a fan yet with <UNK> choir singing tradition and possibly you will accept the <UNK> of your own existence and just feel good after watching it what i like a lot about this film is that actors in the non leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character the film is starring <UNK> <UNK> who is great but you will remember every single face around him in the film you will find yourself <UNK> their lines that have become household names for so many russian speaking people a film to live with simple yet deep you will want to watch it again and again
<START> the marquis de <UNK> egypt ancient <UNK> <UNK> robert englund in a <UNK> role gratuitous sex and nudity murder and mayhem on paper tobe <UNK> night <UNK> sounds like it should be at least a fun entertaining flick given the ingredients it's not it is a plot less incoherent <UNK> that brings little entertainment there is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of de <UNK> who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local christian <UNK> and kill her that is pretty much it i think it has something to with the <UNK> but who knows what the writers were thinking most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness dream sequences and erotic encounters <UNK> with scenes of englund as the imprisoned de <UNK> in the 19th century chewing the scenery it seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their <UNK> were they are buried in the cheesiness bad acting sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads br br there aren't too many good points robert englund is fun to watch as always and the lead actress <UNK> <UNK> whilst not very talented is attractive and in various stages of <UNK> through the movie but watching night <UNK> is a chore at least i got to see the movie from which the when you're as criminal as i bit from the australian film <UNK> ratings guide that was on the front of so many vhs tapes from the nineties came from
<START> who knew they could be so funny christopher <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are known more for their outstanding work in some of <UNK> <UNK> dramas law order <UNK> and the west wing put them together on the big screen and what you get is an engaging romantic comedy with plenty of laughs br br the actors develop the story's ongoing relationship with impressive skill leaving the audience bound to fall in love with barry singer <UNK> despite the fact he's a <UNK> comic who also happens to be a mean spirited sexist jerk br br you'll be rooting for him even as he takes all his <UNK> with the opposite sex and chases <UNK> <UNK> halfway around the country in hopes of winning her heart they have so little in common but when barry finally opens his heart you'll wonder why <UNK> keeps running away br br the <UNK> opposite is a wonderful movie with an incredible cast and a gifted writer well worth your time br br
<START> i watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re sight all of the dialogue and when i watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh i think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film however watching it now i can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was but i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on vhs on my fist tv that would cloud the image in yellow and and bearing in mind it is a children's film that is why i would still definitely give it 10 10
<START> i have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me i cannot understand why some people compare this to babe this film is not about the secret life of all animals who secretly can talk instead it is about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner a little girl with a serious <UNK> overcome her speech <UNK> only to be separated from her in a heart wrenching scene early on then the great journey begins paulie the parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend marie br br along the way he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people he falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her he gets <UNK> into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him br br he <UNK> his tale to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved marie br br tony <UNK> shines as the kindly janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who <UNK> to help little paulie despite the risks jay <UNK> plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across br br there is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too it is a witty clever epic animal adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl he search for marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who don t know much about <UNK> br br kids who have seen the wild green parrot <UNK> in los angeles and <UNK> will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds especially <UNK> are not <UNK> pets all children everywhere will see that pets form deep <UNK> themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be <UNK> br br so no babe here more of an incredible journey with a twist br br enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts
<START> one of <UNK> worst an average thriller the only thing to recommend it is de niro playing the psycho the finale is typically of this genre i e over the top with yet another almost <UNK> <UNK> to pain villain i didn't like the 60s original and this version wasn't much of an improvement on it i have no idea why scorsese wasted his time on a remake then again considering how bad his recent movies have been i'm referring to his dull <UNK> movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress the blond girl <UNK> <UNK> this isn't even that bad by comparison and considering spielberg wanted to do the remake could have been far worse
<START> after watching the next action star reality tv series i was pleased to see the <UNK> movie right away i was <UNK> of such a showcase of new talent but i was pleasantly surprised and thrilled billy zane of course was his usual great self but <UNK> and sean held their own beside him it was also nice to see jared and <UNK> also from the competition in their cameo roles <UNK> character not <UNK> is the hunted and his frustration at discovering new rules in the game is well played <UNK> walks the <UNK> well between her character liking <UNK> and only being in it for the money i loved how the game was played right to the last second and then beyond not a great movie but an entertaining one all the way and a great showcase for two folks on their first time out of the gate
<START> i usually try to <UNK> reasonably well <UNK> <UNK> of films but i can not believe this got past the script stage the dialogue is appalling the acting very dodgy the accents just awful and the direction and pacing is <UNK> at best br br i don't remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad joseph <UNK> pretty as he is might just have killed his career as quickly as it started br br the island of doctor <UNK> was no worse than this garbage
<START> in fact it never was i'm not sure why billy crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy what a vacuous <UNK> none of these people come close to a cary grant spencer tracy <UNK> hepburn etc and anyway today's audience isn't as <UNK> to this <UNK> <UNK> writing is trivial the hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious the chemistry between the leading characters is non existent it's interesting that julia roberts seems to think she's a reincarnation of some big star from the golden age of hollywood whenever that may be it's an effect she tries and fails to <UNK> yet again with richard gere in runaway bride
<START> for die hard judy garland fans only there are two 2 numbers that are really good one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady you've all seen the <UNK> and a pretty good number at the very end there are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny but basically the script is so bad and the movie so dated that it's hard not to cringe at the awfulness throughout but it's worth the 2 50 to rent the movie just be prepared to fast forward it
<START> model chris <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is brutally raped by a teacher chris sarandon of her sister kathy <UNK> <UNK> he is brought to trial but goes totally free he then rapes kathy br br <UNK> and sick rape film this movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape what it is is a badly written and for the most part badly acted drama it <UNK> to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but <UNK> the scene in our face to be totally honest however <UNK> acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had the trial scenes were boring and predictable and the movie just went too far when 15 year old <UNK> is raped thankfully that wasn't shown i do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when <UNK> grabs a gun and shoots sarandon dead but seriously having a young girl raped is just revolting br br acting doesn't help for instance <UNK> was no actress she was certainly a beautiful woman and an actual model i believe but her acting left a lot to be desired it <UNK> the film <UNK> was just ok but this was one of her first films sarandon does what he can as the rapist he wasn't bad but the terrible script worked against him br br i do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in 1976 some women stood up and <UNK> when sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people i found this boring simplistic and really sick a 1 all the way
<START> a young scientist is trying to carry on his dead father's work on <UNK> <UNK> his overbearing mother has convinced him that he murdered his own father and is <UNK> his progress for her own evil purposes a young doctor uses <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently ripped off a few minutes later he <UNK> himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm admittedly the special effects in severed ties are pretty good and grotesque but the rest of the film is awful the severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few people big deal the acting is mediocre and the climax is silly 3 out of 10
<START> br br the first thing i have to say is that i own jake speed i've seen it at least 10 times this movie is one of the most fun movies ever made the film begins with margaret karen <UNK> trying to find her sister her sister was kidnapped in paris and the family has heard nothing along comes jake speed wayne crawford telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her jake speed is a hero he doesn't work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure his partner dennis christopher follows him around and writes their adventures into novels this film is a great adventure it's hilarious it's action packed it's just great i guess it's a cult film with a very small cult following crawford is perfect as jake speed and throws out some one liners that you'll never forget <UNK> and christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick respectively john hurt the guy who's stomach blew up in alien plays the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which just adds to the fun in many ways this film is similar to indiana jones in some ways it's similar to james bond films maybe it should have been called indiana bond but whatever it's title is it's a very enjoyable film
<START> holy this movie was still warm and <UNK> from the pile it was made with i tried to watch this pile of <UNK> waste but found it easier to slash my <UNK> and slug back a <UNK> of <UNK> floor <UNK> than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv and thats saying something i once witnessed a cow crap in a field i watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half who knows it might have moved or something well that was time better spent than watching this tripe the acting was non existent the plot was somewhere other than on this film i think i saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to <UNK> in hopes of becoming a steven king <UNK> please tell me director is getting <UNK> he so desperately needs it's pretty clear he needs heavy <UNK> and i'd willing to front the money needed for his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i can't give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in <UNK> word alone let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this <UNK> on the rack walk to your car start the engine then <UNK> both of your <UNK> straight into the fan until it you can't feel your bones <UNK> anymore be sure to have your <UNK> in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway you might as well have the <UNK> of wasting it yourself br br by the way i watched this after a buddy of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it he <UNK> come over she had too whats worse is that she had to watch this thing twice i heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month i hope it was because of this film
<START> pet sematary succeeds on two major situations first it's a scary horror movie those that just aren't produced in these days second it's an emotional clever movie overall so if you are looking for chills scares creepiness and visually stunning settings great acting <UNK> and gruesome effects this is the movie you are looking for a classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan br br probably the best adaptation to any of king's novels the events feel a little rushed compared with the novel but that doesn't means that this underrated movie isn't a complete horror drama accomplishment br br stephen king's novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time the movie captures the same feeling mainly because there's a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it's members then when everything seems to be happiness technically happy because the title pet sematary does not offers <UNK> a tragic event changes the movie's atmosphere now it turns very dark the movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits but after gage is killed the movie becomes sad gray creepy dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family's entire life and pet sematary proves it dramatically br br the legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot sadly enough the legend comes true and baby gage returns from the dead the previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it's something much much worse what will happened with the lives of our all american family could <UNK> prevent this tragedy what is it with the surreal nightmares br br watch pet sematary to witness one of the most touching emotional horror movies of recent times you won't regret the acting is very good although i didn't dig the actor who portrayed the father he didn't seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation but that's just my opinion denise crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble tender mother baby gage was amazing even on his creepy parts <UNK> overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people's deepest fears the loss of someone you love the dead returning to life and a feeling of desperation br br something is for sure i don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
<START> at your video store you might find this gem br br the human condition in modern times la no exaggerated drama just a <UNK> of events that might happen to any group of individuals over time br br helps you understand the <UNK> and desperation of urban life br br the direction and cutting are top class cinematography and music very much follows the mood and situation and the cast br br excellent casting and excellent acting no one out of place or out of character br br and it's not really as much a <UNK> as you would expect i gave it 7 of 10 br br if you <UNK> seen it do
<START> titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple <UNK> or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate <UNK> is wonderful as rose an <UNK> young lady <UNK> by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack <UNK> <UNK> a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social <UNK> the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes br br the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for <UNK> that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose <UNK> <UNK> who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is <UNK> to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to <UNK> ireland where the titanic set <UNK> from on april 10 <UNK> as all the passengers are <UNK> after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by <UNK> but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless <UNK> of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal <UNK> and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith <UNK> as shown in the movie was <UNK> by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper <UNK> and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on <UNK> night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the <UNK> decision going against his thirty two years of experience to stretch the <UNK> legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were <UNK> in were full of <UNK> but they ignored these <UNK> and <UNK> at full speed as shown in the movie on april 15 <UNK> at 11 <UNK> an iceberg was <UNK> they attempted to shut off the <UNK> and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the <UNK> side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large <UNK> along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2 18 when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to <UNK> many <UNK> for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had <UNK> them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty <UNK> that were on the ship <UNK> the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic <UNK> to be extremely <UNK> overall the basic plot is very accurate in its <UNK> of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic br br many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as <UNK> characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and <UNK> mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the <UNK> molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce <UNK> and all of the <UNK> officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to <UNK> afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since <UNK> where he worked his way up to his status as the <UNK> captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting <UNK> and was <UNK> to the point that james cameron <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> in his honor in the <UNK> former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower class passengers from non english speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the <UNK> as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the <UNK> not wanting to leave her husband's side mrs <UNK> refused to get in her <UNK> and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr <UNK> who was shown <UNK> his <UNK> and smoking a <UNK> reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the <UNK> man on the ship john <UNK> <UNK> who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a <UNK> in addition molly brown was saved and later had <UNK> made up for the crew of the <UNK> that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over four thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully <UNK> down to the last pieces of china and <UNK> the <UNK> which is hardly seen is <UNK> perfectly with all of the machines <UNK> to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and <UNK> were an excellent re creation of the post victorian era of <UNK> the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the women's <UNK> movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back <UNK> status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to new <UNK> such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very <UNK> women had to be <UNK> to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the <UNK> scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but <UNK> of <UNK> which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally <UNK> <UNK> not <UNK> women were <UNK> physically by their <UNK> and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross <UNK> the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking br br a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives everyone <UNK> differently and he gets you to think of how you might have <UNK> had you been in that situation on the titanic on that <UNK> night in addition this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking <UNK> from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is <UNK> there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever <UNK> they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter br br technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve <UNK> to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to <UNK> the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the <UNK> to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the <UNK> years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in <UNK> manner at the very beginning of the movie a <UNK> recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film br br titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including <UNK> sound <UNK> and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early <UNK> and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you br br
<START> as someone else has already said here every scene in this film is gem most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect but director <UNK> hit a home run every time the cast got just the right take on the excellent script and in addition dick <UNK> musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film the comedy is subtle mostly and the camera work mirrors every little emotional <UNK> of the narrative cher is such a comedy natural vincent <UNK> who i know mostly through his frank <UNK> role on all in the family until i saw him in this and then off broadway in the 80's deserved far greater stardom than he ever got and <UNK> hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast has <UNK> ever written about this film br br would love to read it hard to figure out why the average rating here at imdb is so low
<START> anyone that has see <UNK> child <UNK> knows that this is a director that can do better let's hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot <UNK> anyone and that is was a case of second feature <UNK> the characters are one dimensional and over used the scenery is terrific however and showcases the pacific <UNK> beautifully br br the cinematography is great shot almost entirely outside the images are crisp and beautiful you can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves br br technically this movie is as sound as they come it just lacks a heart
<START> i wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist as this film was <UNK> but this one failed me miserably for me the plot was a bit confusing to follow and i rapidly lost interest i feel so sorry for john cusack joan cusack ben kingsley marisa tomei and <UNK> duff for getting involved with this movie i'll remain a fan of all of them but only time can <UNK> my feeling over this one the one thing i can say positively about the film is that <UNK> played <UNK> character so well that i didn't even recognize <UNK> it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her luckily i rented it for 1 through red box had i paid to see it in on the big screen i would be really <UNK>
<START> the 3 d featured in the man who wasn't there stands for dumb dumb dumb this inept comedy features lousy 3 d effects that makes the 3 d effects in jaws 3 <UNK> 3 and friday the 13th part 3 look better by comparison not to mention the movie is <UNK> to the extreme this was one of many 1983 movies to feature the pop off the screen effects steve <UNK> and jeffrey <UNK> got trapped in this mess but at least it didn't kill their careers <UNK> would go on to star on <UNK> the larry sanders show and ron <UNK> box office smash how the grinch stole christmas while <UNK> followed this flop with police academy and <UNK> what them in those projects instead of them here in the man who wasn't there if you do you'll regret it br br 1 2 out of four
<START> wow one of the greatest movies i have ever ever seen br br absolutely loved it before the opening credits were done i was glued to the screen br br it's a sci fi thriller and edge of your seat <UNK> incredible br br i <UNK> it would never end br br lucy liu is a throwaway role anyone could have played it the lead actor jeremy <UNK> was the perfect geeky guy br br this movie appeals to me who loved war games <UNK> and track down br br incredible br br 8 22 <UNK> walt d in <UNK>
