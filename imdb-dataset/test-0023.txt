<START> although i am sure the idea looked good on paper and it <UNK> to me when i first heard of it this movie often <UNK> along and falls flat and when i watch it i just want it to end the <UNK> beginning and ending of the film about lou having to <UNK> a <UNK> is contrived at best although i found the tall cop part to be humorous however i found little to laugh at with the bottom of the barrel script that was thrown together for these two great comedians i thought that it was a mistake to put them in a musical and it <UNK> of wizard of oz rip off with the songs and black and white to color format i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone but die hard a c fanatics anyone else will be disappointed and they have many better films
<START> i saw this movie a <UNK> years ago and was literally swept away by it so charming and so very romantic david duchovny and ms driver have chemistry that is so hot you will need to take off a <UNK> of clothing the supporting cast is 100 top notch just watching <UNK> <UNK> and robert <UNK> play off one another is pure poetry bonnie hunt and jim and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen like jim belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep forever or him dancing in the kitchen this film made we wish i knew people like that in my own life not to mention what woman does not want david duchovny for a boyfriend
<START> my review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself br br 1 plants eating people have been done hundreds of times it's been used by <UNK> in everything from mario to <UNK> to <UNK> prime it's been used in plenty of low budget 50's movies on par with the lowest of the godzilla franchise and this brings it to a whole another level of cheese with plants that talk i've known no one who walked out but i know a lot of people who absolutely broke out in <UNK> laughing during parts of this movie i was one of them doesn't the horror genre deserve something a little better than this pile of laughable crap br br 2 the characters easily could have been copy <UNK> from hostel or wrong turn or wolf creek or any other movie with <UNK> kids with bad luck yet it's called <UNK> when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clich√©s that hundreds of characters before have had don't you ever wish a movie had characters that weren't just forgettable pieces of meat with legs br br 3 this was not gory a guy cuts his skin off oh my not a guy gets his legs broken oh my gasp not i have shown movies like this to my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick and she said i've seen pg movies worse than that why was it rated r so why was it rated r br br 4 here's the only plot the movie book has <UNK> kids drink have sex get naked <UNK> bleed and eventually die this is possibly the most typical example of a cheap <UNK> horror movie yet people call this mature what the br br 5 i do not think i have ever seen something less original sense i watched a beautiful mind br br haven't you ever sat there and wished the horror genre easily the most diverse genre out there would do something well diverse something truly original br br i just wish more horror movies would have actual horror not just cheap <UNK> parties put on film with a few <UNK> of fake blood tossed around br br 1 10
<START> almost certainly staged montage of women reading lines very briefly and getting naked not very briefly in front of a anonymous and uncredited <UNK> almost certainly including producer charles band thrown in are random scenes of surrender <UNK> many movies primarily lesbian scenes most of the women like riding horses hmmm there is a polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting despite going to an audition a <UNK> camera that films actresses getting naked behind the screen br br <UNK> <UNK> too made up but still beautiful introduces a couple of her own movie scenes and talks in a way to the camera if you enjoy lesbian scenes the one with <UNK> and <UNK> taylor from is included and they are probably the best looking lesbian ever weird excuse for a movie and aside from the obvious draw of naked women a frankly dull and uninspiring experience
<START> this thing oh god this thing i can't even call it a movie a movie is something that does something goes somewhere has some semblance of a plot or something i don't know how i'm doing it i really don't first i say dark fields is the worst movie ever and i thought it was then pirates of ghost island proved me wrong and now third time in a row another film goes above and beyond the call of duty to prove me wrong br br <UNK> ok dark <UNK> ii the <UNK> lord this is awful let me break it down for you man senses daughters are in danger through some magical psychic powers he got from his act ii popcorn apparently and races to find them in a corn field of course this is the <UNK> in all of existence being the size of the <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> children of the corn and signs combined the main character whose name is shy awesome name btw then runs through a corn field finds some ghost girls talks to them and runs through a corn field <UNK> a while and runs through a corn field and the incredibly sad thing i'm really not leaving anything out that pretty much is the entire movie the only thing i may be leaving out is how he gets chased by two policemen who want to arrest him for i don't know pretending to be an actor i didn't care by this point he gets away and the police are by the killer <UNK> holy crap there's a killer apparently yes there is as he's introduced nearly 4 5 into the movie but wait then he runs away for a while and there's you guessed it more running through the corn field and digging then there's the ending where he saves his daughters <UNK> br br the biggest problem with this movie is it's boring it's incredibly <UNK> tremendously boring i can't explain how <UNK> dull this thing is nothing happens the characters are as appealing as a root <UNK> and it's just an hour and a half of nothing the only good thing that came out of this movie was that me and my friend may have found enlightenment due to the near <UNK> state this movie put us into after the effects of the drugs in our brain had to kick into <UNK> to keep us alive during the ensuing insanity i found <UNK> a wall much more enjoyable and my friend found a new passion for laughing hysterically while <UNK> all over the floor as if he having a <UNK> this is the sort of insanity this movie brings it's not just bad it's bad for your health the cover looks awesome with a picture of an awesome scarecrow killer that i would totally consider dressing up as for a horror con but this was the most misleading box ever don't let it fool you too do not watch this movie watch a better corn movie any movie about corn is better just don't let it get you don't a 0 out of 10
<START> if you wondered whether disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than paris more shallow than britney more vapid than jessica and more <UNK> than the girls next door wonder no more the amazing thing is <UNK> <UNK> is apparently supposed to be the heroine she's also supposed to be an <UNK> from the spoiled shallow vapid <UNK> popular girls at school which is no more believable here than it was for <UNK> duff in <UNK> <UNK> plots range from recycled <UNK> i dream of <UNK> to parodies of harry potter the older boy <UNK> between being a magical genius and being unable to master the <UNK> of his own the younger boy is just another of the smart mouth <UNK> <UNK> who have <UNK> on tv like <UNK> in new york and with the same appeal the dad is the stereotypical dumb tv dad and the mom well she's not totally awful but all <UNK> beside the hideous <UNK> and yet horribly fascinating like a bad car accident spectacle of ms smug self satisfied <UNK> performance and again she's the heroine
<START> graphics brilliant obviously the most stunning things were definitely not given away in the trailers fight sequences move extremely fast but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it won't seem so confusing cloud has a wide array of swords and i kinda wish things were moving a little slower just so we could see them because they were each incredibly detailed oh and we finally get to see exactly how one <UNK> br br music brilliant also i was a bit nervous about it since from what i've seen isn't the best at writing music to go along with action remember the steal the tiny <UNK> sequence but it's brilliant and it fits perfectly i'm glad i <UNK> the <UNK> they changed the lyrics to one <UNK> angel though so you won't be able to sing along if you know the lyrics br br plot the first half of the movie sets up things and introduces everyone in a fairly complex <UNK> but the second half is almost entirely fight sequences once all the players are in place i wouldn't call it a weak plot but it's nowhere near as convoluted as the <UNK> plot was i think this is in an effort to avoid trying to <UNK> the game and i think that's a good thing the movie is its own <UNK> and shouldn't try to top the original in terms of sheer plot br br i admit i was kind of hoping that this movie would bring to a wider range of people but this is not a mainstream movie i was going to give it only nine stars just because it doesn't even really try to explain anything to <UNK> marlene at least i think it was marlene sounded like her gives a bit of background at the beginning but it's more of a <UNK> than a crash course but then i realized for me this movie is a 10 10 so why should i take off points just because other people probably won't like it as well if you've played the game or are at least familiar with it you should see this movie but you don't need me to tell you that if you're not familiar with it go out and buy it sit there for twenty hours and beat it and then see the movie although even without any background it's still stunningly beautiful you just won't get any of the inside references which make up 50 of the movie that is everything that isn't a fight sequence
<START> this was really one of the most enjoyable <UNK> that i have seen on tv he is just an incredible performer his personality shines through in each one of the songs that he does i really wish this was available as an uncut dvd so i could watch it over and over without the <UNK> for explicit language i have not had the chance to see him live but that is something that i really want to do now i can't forget his <UNK> singers they really added a lot of substance and humor to the show with their campy style and flamboyant dance moves they really <UNK> the true talent of dan i wish there were some more of the songs that are on his live cd which is also incredible it is refreshing to see someone like him perform just so incredibly <UNK> and real i really can't say enough good things about dan and this show once again i just wish this was available as an uncut dvd
<START> i went to see this film because <UNK> de <UNK> was in it <UNK> had a fairly small part so it was good that i liked the film on it's own in fact i liked it a lot br br the film centers around two characters albert and <UNK> albert is a shy <UNK> sort and <UNK> well <UNK> is not the story revolves around <UNK> request to albert to let him come over to <UNK> place for just a little while <UNK> has just gotten out of prison br br albert and <UNK> have known each other since childhood and of course they do something together there is trouble and it's albert who always takes the fall br br the action of the film is based on the adventures that ensue from <UNK> visit on the run is a <UNK> of mad cap zany situations however bruno de <UNK> and scriptwriter joseph <UNK> after hours don't always take you where you expect to go there are twists and turns that add depth to this film of course there is plenty of outright comedy but there is much subtle humor here as well br br there are some downright good performances here as well albert is played delightfully by michael <UNK> he's getting fairly well days from the hbo series the sopranos br br <UNK> is played by john <UNK> who <UNK> his character with a lovable child like quality no matter what he does you just gotta love <UNK> br br both these actors are excellent in their individual characters with <UNK> you'll want to hug him and bring him home to mom <UNK> well you won't know whether you should slap him or bring him home and not to mom p br br there are other stand out performances as well the character of rita is played by deniro yes <UNK> daughter the audience <UNK> her in talking with the others who saw the film it was fun to discuss whether it was albert or <UNK> who was their favorite of those two but everyone loved rita br br is this film perfect no i can't say that it is there were many times i wished the director had had a bigger budget to work with there were some scenes that cried out for more <UNK> freedom give this guy a decent budget to work with and i believe you are going to see a film that will make you stand up and notice br br the ending sequence was a bit of a victim of budget yet budget or no budget the ending screen shot in my opinion brought together the talent of actor and director into a memorable emotionally effective scene br br
<START> this movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together i wouldn't call it a movie it's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished illogical stories which are not all that funny <UNK> several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning and they just disappeared from the story he's just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1 2 hours i left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy br br i think this movie is just an extended version of <UNK> padded with a lot more characters and dancing br br if this is the best movie that this couple has ever made then i'm pretty sure i'm not interested in any of his previous ones
<START> when i first read about berlin am <UNK> i didn't expect much but i thought with the right people the right locations the right music and fashion you could at least make a trivial movie about the hip berlin everyone seems to be talking about but failed it's so ridiculously it's a complete <UNK> of what it is going on in <UNK> so called scene of course it's not all about but you should expect more from a movie that's being sold as the definite berlin movie br br and apart from all the credibility stuff it really is a bad movie mediocre acting and a rather boring plot interestingly some of the actors have proved in other movies that they are actually quite talented so it really must be poor directing skills br br don't bother watching berlin am <UNK> unless you are 17 come from some small town in western germany and want to move to the big city after you finished school then you might actually find it enjoyable and totally cool
<START> this film goes into my worst films ever made file i have a copy of this film which i watch when i want a good laugh and this isn't even a comedy i am disappointed that such great actors agreed to be in such a piece of garbage this film is inaccurate in its portrayal of hockey offensive to <UNK> and i wasn't even all that impressed with the acting even the story was a bit weak if you have never seen this film you're lucky if you have i'm sorry
<START> i will admit that this movie was awful cheesy sexist badly dubbed and poorly edited but i loved it anyway i first saw this movie when i was 14 and it has stuck with me ever since <UNK> this is very close to hard core porn as i remember it certainly got my <UNK> flowing this flick gives a whole new meaning to swedish <UNK> it is a <UNK> take on human sexuality as seen by hot randy female aliens who are i think just looking for some for their dying race
<START> from watching the trailer the movie looked pretty interesting the production of the movie is also pretty good it looks like they had a good budget and doesn't look like a cheaply made movie the acting <UNK> from good joe <UNK> as professor simon to ok kelly as eve to bad james <UNK> as don br br the actual content and plot of the movie is weak the movie starts out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed <UNK> boring twist watching the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie ok but everything in between makes this an absolutely boring movie to watch it's as though they made a short movie then tried to force it to be over an hour long by <UNK> the middle with an hour of filler material br br if you want to waste a good hour and half of your life watch this movie otherwise stay away from this extremely boring movie
<START> in a word god awful too many plot holes um yeah who takes their kid to dig up a dead body in the middle of the night and what's up with his wife stealing the <UNK> who does that why exactly did the shrink stab himself in the neck and that whole dog thing i mean really having <UNK> <UNK> from the beginning also just completely destroyed the suspense for me i mean if he's <UNK> the story clearly he's lived to tell it so there's no chance of him getting <UNK> where's the suspense there br br of course you expect plot holes in a film like this but there are so many i lost track of the story completely because of them what kind of name is or why did the wife dig up the body who does that or go into that crazy spooky asylum alone and <UNK> all those <UNK> come from why does the writer have his <UNK> box in the freaking book i mean come on and the book just happens to find its way to the <UNK> next door to the wife's <UNK> way too convenient oh and happy birthday honey here's a book about a serial killer what a thoughtful gift the book is like 20 pages long half of which are blank and it takes him freaking forever to read it if he's truly obsessed with this book wouldn't he have read it all in one shot br br a bit convenient for him to <UNK> into his future wife carrying a cake about 23 seconds after being released from a mental hospital how old was he playing <UNK> br br was i the only one at the end rooting for the bus to actually run the guy down not good when you're rooting for the protagonist to bite it in the end br br it seems like this was written by <UNK> i imagine that the first draft probably had nothing to do with the number 23 it seems as if they needed a <UNK> hook to bait the audience into thinking there was some supernatural thing going on when in the end it really didn't seem to have anything to do with anything i mean i wasn't expecting the godfather or anything but everything about this film was a total let down without all the <UNK> stuff this movie could actually have been ok instead of some hackneyed <UNK> <UNK> br br not scary unintentionally hilarious and otherwise a total <UNK>
<START> welcome to the world of <UNK> the man who was once successful and got several hits with small actors like and also the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his one film with <UNK> <UNK> br br one sneak peak about this films are that all are hollywood remakes and some decent ones like the once which worked br br speed is a remake of <UNK> and that too a terrible one br br a look at the stars we have the once <UNK> but now out of work <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> then we have the flop khan and others br br the film could be a decent thriller but many problems are there the storytelling has several <UNK> scenes like <UNK> a mobile company and many more and the stunts too are laughable while the twists in the end are too laughable the film also took a long time to reach the theatres which <UNK> it's spark br br direction is awful music is outdated br br khan screams makes faces etc what he does always <UNK> is good in her part <UNK> <UNK> is not that convincing tries hard in a negative role and he is okay is horrible and he makes you laugh in a negative role surprising the same director gave him his only solo hit sophie is horrible <UNK> is a non actress
<START> absolutely nothing about this movie is funny interesting or relevant besides two characters getting together at the end nothing is ever resolved and there is no plot and by the way what is the deal with the cover of the dvd it has a female ass in daisy duke shorts where was that scene in the movie no one ever wore daisy dukes in this film surprisingly enough almost all of the acting in this film is good and jack black plays a full song could be a <UNK> d track don't know though those are the only redeeming values though overall it's just a waste of time
<START> this is such a crappy movie i have no idea how it got on the shelves they must have paid the movie store to make them put it there seriously the story makes absolutely no sense unless you are on some seriously heavy drugs you would definitely have to be on something in order to watch this total piece of garbage so much so that you would not care what was on the tv because you're almost in a coma the writing sounds like it was done by a 5 year old and the acting is worse than grade school plays the hideous special effects they were trying to do look so stupid what did they spend a whole 5 to make the entire movie it looks like it oh my that scene with the old woman who has an 80's <UNK> and the ugly girls in the rubber suits me and my friends laughed so hard did someone actually think it was a good idea to make this into a movie i find that hard to believe
<START> i liked the understated character that laura <UNK> played in <UNK> <UNK> and she is very good in <UNK> of the <UNK> br br but wow robin williams doesn't give that much of a performance with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak laura <UNK> may not have been miscast but either the editing raped her character or this was just a sad performance by director barry <UNK> br br and i think it was barry <UNK> that got old so many weak performances such uneven results have to be the fault of management br br christopher walken and jeff goldblum are great in supporting roles goldblum plays a sinister side with <UNK> and <UNK> combination of manager and <UNK> for the film is wonderful br br but the story is clich√© the presentation looks like it could have should have been a very good picture and too many actions are half hearted the pacing story and direction all come up weak compared to say <UNK> <UNK> spoof of <UNK> of my
<START> i was shocked at how bad it was and unable to turn away from the disaster this made <UNK> league <UNK> and brothers oscar worthy in comparison br br i have tried to remember watching anything as bad as this in my life and was unable to come up with anything even close
<START> i don't know why this has gotten any decent reviews as it could be the weakest horror comedy i've ever seen englund is just in it for a cameo and his performance is as unnecessary as most of the lame attempts at jokes and scares the direction is terrible and the acting is worse it seems like every year producers are trying to make another evil dead but these weak unoriginal attempts are just stepping on the memory of a true horror classic br br whether its filmmakers saying this isn't a remake but its an 80s <UNK> which is just as unoriginal in my opinion <UNK> or people trying to plug this with other horror classics its still misleading and wont make up for the lack of scares horror comedy or even a decent movie for that matter br br avoid at all costs
<START> i have seen this movie since i was a little girl and being from new york and remembering how people lived back then brought back a lot of good memories this movie is not just about wanting a fairy tale ending but understanding the struggles of becoming a better person woman and <UNK> <UNK> attempted to be it was about the <UNK> system putting women in a <UNK> situation it was about the injustice of a system that <UNK> and put demands on a family to stay <UNK> diane <UNK> was nominated for an oscar for this role and it was well deserved if you want to experience a strong family with <UNK> but wonderful bonding moments enjoy <UNK> your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind and understand the overall frustration
<START> i first saw this film in video form even on a television screen the <UNK> were impressive seen on the big screen in its full glory it must have blown people away br br as one or two other comments have pointed out the story of the early <UNK> and how they got around the problems of <UNK> etc on the road to <UNK> is as authentic as any film can be it therefore shows that it is totally unnecessary to take liberties with the truth something that today's film makers should take <UNK> of reality is enough br br the plot relies on the struggle of man against the elements and hostile natives subplots are few and simple but the basic plot is enough elsewhere i have reviewed <UNK> rival to the big trail fighting <UNK> in spite of having a more sophisticated plot and having better actors fighting <UNK> lacks the breathtaking scenes br br the big trail should be <UNK> viewing
<START> when i went to the video rental store back in the days when dvd was yet next to unknown to me i had seen all the movies at the store that i was interested in or so i thought the man behind the counter told me he had something for me that i definitely would like he gave me and at first i <UNK> it to be any good but i trusted his advise and man i sure am happy i did take this jewel along this is one of the best adventure movies in years if you ask me of course with robert <UNK> as a major part how bad can a movie get surely <UNK> tyler does once more what she's good at and nothing much more being pretty but still you can very clearly sense that the cast apparently had a lot of fun making this movie
<START> otto <UNK> the man with the golden arm is a reference to heroin addiction something that must have been rather <UNK> to film back in 1955 fifty years ago the censors today still have a problem with drug content in films br br the lead role was originally offered to marlon brando then <UNK> by frank sinatra before brando could respond sinatra convincingly portrays a pro card dealer and ex heroin addict who returns home to the city only to find himself battling the demons of temptation br br preminger is one of my favorite directors his <UNK> of a murder starring james stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary courtroom drama preminger pretty much helped change the face of cinema back in the <UNK> <UNK> of a murder was extremely controversial when it came out due to both its plot and content references to rape women's <UNK> seduction etc and the man with the golden arm deals with a topic that is equally <UNK> br br however preminger pulls it off without becoming exploitative this is like a <UNK> to the panic in <UNK> park 1971 and bears more than a few similarities in terms of general <UNK> to the classic billy wilder movie lost weekend starring ray <UNK> these three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism <UNK> the 1980s and still remain relevant today
<START> two years after the success of <UNK> jim <UNK> and jerry david <UNK> created this brilliant sitcom starring the great leslie <UNK> as plain <UNK> detective <UNK> also in the cast was alan north as <UNK> ed ed williams as and william as <UNK> the shoe shine <UNK> <UNK> squad ' featured <UNK> corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background each episode would conclude with a mock freeze frame in which the characters in frame stand completely still one of the best sequences saw one of the characters <UNK> coffee into a cup while standing still causing the cup to <UNK> guest stars were killed off in the opening titles one included <UNK> <UNK> brown being crushed by a falling safe despite gaining positive reviews and much critical acclaim ' only lasted for six episodes before being cancelled this didn't mean the end though five years later the show was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the <UNK> <UNK> films
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the worst movies i've ever seen but on the other hand is better then most of the movies from <UNK> who are filled with depressing characters and story without any bright ideas <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is bright optimistic and without any artistic moments in many interviews director tried to tell us that his movie is top quality just because it didn't cost a lot of money but thinking that way is wrong <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is for me very bad movie the dialogs are really bad written 90 of the script is consisted of <UNK> the characters are stereotypical morons the story and its twists are very predictable and the action sequences this movie supposed to be an action comedy are filmed very very bad and without any style is just thinking he's even bigger than quentin tarantino so he's <UNK> his style over all 90 minutes the humor in the movie is very cheap and primitive probably thinks that constant <UNK> is funny in my opinion is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> very cheap not only by budget movie with stupid story and very very bad acting
<START> the <UNK> is a pretty satisfying film for those who are after the things above for clint eastwood's die hard fans it will be a disappointment although eastwood does his best here in his so <UNK> role except for the fact that his character is a charming <UNK> which he isn't so <UNK> with the ambiguous nature of his character which goes from being a sort of fallen hero to a manipulative and <UNK> woman eater to put it that way will eventually be too much to handle for anyone used to see him play heroes in the best western tradition morally a bit <UNK> but still without that dark side i think he manages to pull this unlikely part off but those who really steal the show are the two women the <UNK> page and the head of the students played by elizabeth <UNK> br br we see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> most innocent girl in the world until she becomes <UNK> with john and becomes <UNK> of him this is what causes tragedy as well as the secret lust the forbidden fruit she carries a great and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother whom she clearly <UNK> still the fourth factor in this <UNK> love spiral is the wicked carol played by jo ann harris who <UNK> john away from his crush on <UNK> and into her bed br br the whole nature of the story gives this film a sort of gothic feel which makes it a pretty rare thing in the western genre but a popular thing in the movies of the 70's a unique achievement by the <UNK> eastwood team and a movie not for the faint hearted
<START> sir has played <UNK> over 200 times but tonight he can't remember his opening lines sitting at the mirror his eyes reflect the king's madness his <UNK> <UNK> him gently <UNK> the words there is an air of desperation about both these men the great actor knowing his powers are <UNK> away his <UNK> <UNK> major <UNK> conscience <UNK> surrogate wife aware of his <UNK> decline into madness and knowing he is <UNK> to do more than ease his passing the <UNK> is really a love story between the two over the years they have become <UNK> <UNK> on one another to the extent that neither can <UNK> a future without the other set during the second world war it concerns the <UNK> of a frankly second rate <UNK> shakespearean company <UNK> an equal number of has <UNK> and <UNK> led by sir a theatrical knight of what might kindly be called the old school whatever part he is playing he grabs centre stage and <UNK> out over the bullying his audience into applause but somewhere inside him buried most of the time deep beneath the ham he regularly <UNK> out there still remains an occasional <UNK> of his earlier greatness it is to catch a glimpse of this that his audiences <UNK> hope for mr a finney very cleverly concentrates on the ham often to the point of caricature and just when you are ready to dismiss his performance as mere <UNK> and <UNK> he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realise that a great actor is playing a great actor the same goes for mr t it's easy to write off his portrayal br br of norman as an exercise in stereotyping here we have a middle aged <UNK> rather than camp theatrical <UNK> his way through life enjoying the company of the girls and loving the wicked <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the theatre there were and i strongly suspect still are many men just like norman in the profession infinitely kind and patient knowing more about the plays than many of the actors they run <UNK> with wisdom and affection i believe the vast majority of them would hoot with <UNK> laughter at mr portrait i saw the <UNK> on the london stage where against the perceived wisdom mr norman was rather more subdued than in the movie sir was played by the great mr <UNK> jones to huge acclaim from the audience it was a memorable performance that overshadowed mr <UNK> him rather to an also ran as opposed to an actor on level billing the idea that sir and norman might be almost <UNK> without each other went right out of the window norman was reduced to being his puppet which i'm not sure was what ronald <UNK> intended but made for breathtaking theatre <UNK> finney and <UNK> the balance in the movie <UNK> <UNK> to the relationship both men have come a long way since their early appearances in the british new wave pictures when they became the <UNK> of the vaguely middle class and ashamed of it movement when the british cinema virtually committed <UNK> <UNK> in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door with the renaissance of more substantial movies they re appeared <UNK> in the <UNK> bright light br br the <UNK> marked their return still <UNK> with energy and talent shouting to the world at large we're still here it's not a big movie but is <UNK> a great one
<START> i must have been in a good mood to give this shameful predictable embarrassing movie even a 3 what's wrong with it let's start with the gratuitous sex although i admit the style of was something i had not seen nor experienced before and i guess they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times then there are the inconsistencies the <UNK> seems to be in a green part of whatever town it was supposed to be hamilton <UNK> yet in the scenes on the roof it appears to be in an industrial area with a steel mill <UNK> smoke and flames also the inside of the building the the seem much bigger than the outside spoilers here then when our <UNK> reporter finally gets fired she comes back to the building several times once after hours hardly likely the ending is also <UNK> predictable the classic bait and switch caper in which the good guy turns out to be the bad guy but my major <UNK> is the fact this is yet another movie <UNK> with canadian and <UNK> tax credits which is ashamed to set itself in canada yet again proving that the canadian film industry is craven and <UNK> a country's movies must do more than just provide jobs they should reflect the culture it's bad enough that the american studios use toronto as a stand in for new york but it is embarrassing and <UNK> when canadian producers in this case global do it with help from the federal and <UNK> <UNK> in a word <UNK>
<START> night of the demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good low budget can be sure much of it is fairly predictable but somehow it's still much more enjoyable than the crap we see these days being passed off as horror i give the gore a solid 9 and the one liners are actually funny i'm still <UNK> out by stop looking at me the soundtrack is well done i was surprised to hear <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> there is also some very nice t a on display as well as some <UNK> good make up effects the second film in the series is pretty good too but avoid the inferior third one night of the demons may be dated dark and low rent but it still has a lot of potential it's definitely worth a rental at least give it a chance tonight just stay away from any old makeup you'll understand when you see it
<START> i should have known when i heard anne rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me i couldn't have predicted that years after it's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry the novels are amazing and while i understand much gets lost in the translation to screen this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work i hope one day someone tries again the right way starting with the vampire <UNK> they change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason they destroy history the acting of the queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy but i just can't bring myself to laugh the charm and <UNK> of the novels just isn't there the movie is a bad excuse to <UNK> as many musicians and dark imagery as possible into one movie hoping the <UNK> of america would lap it up part of the appeal of the first movie of <UNK> story is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse <UNK> is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world thank goodness i read the books first or i'd have never touched them after this movie
<START> br br very good 1970s movie about mob <UNK> in new jersey when a maverick gangster doesn't play by the rules of the neighborhood sooner or later it's time for <UNK> br br joe <UNK> was true to his character smooth and funny he only gets better with age his face and present day fame should not have been used on the dvd cover to sell this b grade movie as he was only the third billed star br br dated 1970's <UNK> wide <UNK> shirts and lesser quality background music make for a distraction nice to see the 1970's big cars br br however the acting is good br br <UNK> on the part of anne <UNK> was not needed to make this mob story work and she does not show up in the <UNK> as every acting again in any film other than this one too bad she did a good job br br moral of the story don't get your don upset with you br br if you are wanting to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night then check out this dvd it was part of a three movie on one dvd 5 <UNK> special at the local <UNK> store br br
<START> 4 oscar winners karl malden sally field shirley jones michael caine great character actors telly <UNK> and peter boyle 1 hour <UNK> minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking br br irwin allen was just trying to cash in on the popularity of the original classic disaster film with a grade d minus script the actors were obviously just in it for the paycheck as well the horror the horror br br how insane are the characters that caine <UNK> malden and field are playing go into a potentially deadly sinking ship that's 1 on fire 2 hot from steam 3 <UNK> from water and oil 4 <UNK> that are exploding every 5 minutes etc all for the love of money greed 5 they have very little equipment not even a pair of <UNK> or work boots in sight much less a <UNK> hook rope etc br br stupidity br br what were they thinking br br peter boyle overacts so much that i just wanted to <UNK> him stop it and what's the deal with the bad <UNK> also there is no way you can believe his character was a ww2 veteran br br caine field and malden find all that gold and money and they are happy <UNK> we're rich we may not live to spend it but hey br br and <UNK> <UNK> it's the great character actor slim <UNK> br br survivors <UNK> jack warden and shirley knight too br br the final dramatic sub plot about that scary <UNK> never really went anywhere it's like they forgot sort of lots of holes in the script br br this film has an illness that the strongest <UNK> couldn't cure i'm surprised alan j name wasn't on the script i'd be embarrassed to have penned this one br br oh the insanity oh the humanity <UNK> <UNK> br br the horror the horror br br it's like a bad two hour tv movie br br at least the sets were made from recycled material from the first movie br br the script needed to be on the <UNK> heap
<START> well in to 2002 i've got some catching up to do and looking back on a <UNK> year best in show <UNK> no great storyline little action just a <UNK> of magnificent characters particular reference to fred <UNK> and jim as a <UNK> pair of tv <UNK> well done well worth the effort br br ron viewed
<START> no wonder so many young people have attention <UNK> disorder it seems that stage dance productions these days are all about how many cameras and camera angles a director editor can squeeze into a 1 hour show is there a special emmy category for this feat try counting them sometimes for something different to do with this otherwise completely unwatchable show br br i tried to make out at least a few faces of some of the other dancers in the production that was impossible they didn't appear to have any faces just <UNK> it was just michael face michael bare chest nice sheen michael feet and that <UNK> <UNK> over the shoulder come <UNK> look repeated <UNK> <UNK> since he was an executive producer of this cut and <UNK> job i guess that was to be expected one doesn't have to wonder too much as to who his target audience is br br <UNK> was a much better production as it tried to present the show pretty much as one might see it from the audience not the <UNK> side wings or floor nail perspective if i'm not mistaken i believe sir michael has retired thank god for small <UNK>
<START> this is a pretty interesting experiment to watch it's the first ever still existing attempt to <UNK> sight with sound it features two men dancing to a <UNK> player possibly william k l <UNK> himself who is standing next to an edison recording <UNK> that is capturing the sound br br the sound and images were not linked together as one yet and it wasn't until recently that the sound and image have been added technically together it's probably the reason why people hesitate to call this movie the first ever sound picture br br the movie is made by william k l <UNK> a assistant to thomas edison himself who ordered him to come up with a way to <UNK> pictures and sound the answer he provided was the a <UNK> <UNK> a large wooden box with a <UNK> in it so people could watch the moving images with a <UNK> <UNK> inside of it for the sound this is the first that we know off surviving movie experiments that feature this technique all of the later movies using this same technique were shot as silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and <UNK> so the was not an attempt to <UNK> sound and images but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound in some cases people could even choose from three sound <UNK> featuring 3 different <UNK> performances to <UNK> the images only 45 were ever made so you could hardly call the a success also after this experiment focus went off to other cinema techniques mainly regarding movie <UNK> br br so the experiment itself obviously did not become a success also since it took over 30 more years before the first movies with sound were made and <UNK> released they just couldn't yet technically <UNK> and put the sound and the images together yet at the time and even if they could and techniques would had been available it would had been a very expensive job to do so it <UNK> really isn't the most influential or historically important movies out of cinematic history but it's very interesting to watch how people constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of early cinema and movie making br br 8 10
<START> i would give this a zero if they had that rating fun was no fun at all i grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better it did not the others i watched this movie with also agreed the acting was annoying i am tired of jim <UNK> over the top ham acting the supporting cast was no better while this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under the vehicle for this would have been better served another way i actually disliked the leading characters dick and jane so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic i am trying to recall one scene where i or anyone i was with laughed and cannot a worthless movie and a total waste of time
<START> this is one of <UNK> first national films from the period between his glorious mutual shorts and the more mature united artists features more <UNK> than the mutual films it continues <UNK> quest for <UNK> his comic expression most people forget that the film is actually a dream that charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front br br there is plenty of slapstick via the <UNK> cheese being used to gas the enemy and <UNK> <UNK> into enemy territory dressed as a tree br br by this stage in this career the great man had become so immersed in <UNK> expression that his films give the impression of making themselves <UNK> this was not the case but still it gives as convincingly realistic view of life at the front as i can remember albeit from an ironically humorous perspective br br as far as i am concerned <UNK> with the entirety of <UNK> work should be a <UNK> for all <UNK> do not <UNK>
<START> wow most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer <UNK> displayed on screen br br the shift from the early days as a new york based black american phenomenon to current days as a <UNK> diverse <UNK> and largely west coast based is <UNK> well br br the humble <UNK> is not given the respect of any traditional musical <UNK> but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex these <UNK> take the required skills for any musical <UNK> <UNK> rhythm and timing among others and apply them to a new technology with several more <UNK> br br dj comment that he pictures what music must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out seemingly silly at first makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a <UNK> of sounds that no single traditional <UNK> could ever create br br some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain <UNK> and <UNK> an opportunity to profile the wider hip hop culture one film at a time people
<START> i clerk in a video store so i try to see the movies we're about to put out each week i don't have a problem with this in fact i sort of feel it's a <UNK> not so with this film after an hour and a half of our hero whining and <UNK> his way through scene after scene i was truly wondering if they planned to get to the point i felt like i should be getting paid for watching this at home in my free time and if i'd known there was another hour to be endured i might have given up right then i didn't care about the characters the filming was <UNK> and ford made kissing look like a chore even the score was <UNK> and jarring what a waste
<START> when a group of dumb kids including an unlikable racist bitch stay at an old house it <UNK> four murderous spirits can <UNK> la <UNK> save the day will you be able to watch until the end due to the horrible comedy on display br br the dark power is the kind of really bad horror comedy hybrid troma used to release regularly thing is they didn't release this that doesn't excuse the whole thing as it has a dreadful <UNK> score including bad attempts at native american music and even worse comedy music bad make up effects basically halloween masks and atrocious acting ok the fat guy was alright though everyone else is terrible and la <UNK> a western movie vet seems embarrassed to be there not that i blame him really br br the worst thing though is the comedy aspects sure dumb teens is one thing but when the movie keeps talking about the spirits as if they are the ultimate evil only for them to turn out to be horribly annoying bumbling fools all hope is <UNK> combining horror and comedy takes at least some skill there is no skill on display here as it all is just stupid and not so dumb it's fun either i mean smoking pot and listening to bad punk rock aren't i dumb dumb br br not even a decent ripped off face and a chick in little clothing can save this disaster terrible movie and not even worth a rental
<START> i watched love life on holiday when it was filmed at a film festival in florida it was a lovely surprise to find a british film that wasn't derivative or <UNK> a beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film the transitions between scenes i found a bit distracting but as whole i think love life is a winner a ruby in the dust one for all the family a pleasant change to see a british film for teen audiences that isn't <UNK> with four letter words try and see it
<START> considering this film was released 8 years before i was born i don't feel too bad for over looking it for such a long time back in january of 98 though i attended the second <UNK> quentin tarantino film fest held in austin texas the particular theme of films this night was neglected 70's crime films and boy was her right the <UNK> train or the <UNK> brothers as it appeared this print was an absolute gem wonderful performances quirky characters smart plot hilarious comedy and just an all around great time rarely do you see a crime film that is so entertaining and fresh <UNK> <UNK> in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well i hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it in the meantime go to an indie video store and hope they have it
<START> hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie although i haven't seen dahmer 2002 i can say that following what the media put out about jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction i have studied the jeffrey dahmer case and learned all i can about this man this is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer if you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind i loved this movie just <UNK> yourself for low budget and no blood its a story as seen through the eyes of a killer and his actions and thoughts from childhood up through his arrest my favorite line is if they had bothered to look in the back seat it might have saved a lot of lives enjoy
<START> dr <UNK> michael harvey head of a seriously <UNK> for the insane takes a approach towards the treatment of his patients even allowing his <UNK> complete freedom of the building day and night he pays the price for his forward thinking however when he rather <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wood with an axe as therapy for one of his patients and consequently gets his neck mistaken for a <UNK> serves him right for not suggesting basket <UNK> br br shortly after this tragic incident nurse charlotte <UNK> <UNK> arrives at the hospital to take up position as the doctor's assistant and discovers that the facility is now being run by the much <UNK> dr <UNK> masters <UNK> despite being unaware of her deceased <UNK> decision to employ ms <UNK> and not particularly eager to take on new staff dr masters agrees to let the pretty nurse begin work but following several harrowing experiences at the hospital charlotte begins to wonder whether it might have been better if she had been turned away br br it doesn't take a genius to figure out what is actually happening at the hospital the have taken over the <UNK> <UNK> being a premise that should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans but s f don't look in the basement still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive in fun thanks to its well defined collection of <UNK> <UNK> sucking sam bill judge oliver w cameron gene ross who continuously <UNK> courtroom phrases old mrs <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> william creepy poem the <UNK> and warns charlotte of impending doom <UNK> <UNK> danny jessie <UNK> who <UNK> in <UNK> the other patients harriet <UNK> <UNK> who thinks her doll is a real baby army nut sergeant hugh and best of all <UNK> king betty chandler whose <UNK> by a series of men has left her with a <UNK> for love ie she tries to jump any man who goes near her br br this convincingly crazy set of characters plus a bit of gore and nudity reasonable direction from who also gave us the impressive white trash horror <UNK> of the earth and a solid turn from playboy all go to turn an otherwise rather predictable low budget piece of exploitation into a very watchable psycho shocker
<START> having read so much negative press on this movie over the years i'd always avoided it but the <UNK> of the cheap public <UNK> dvd encouraged me to finally give it a viewing br br unfortunately it's been transferred from a poor copy the modern prequel shot on <UNK> stock is <UNK> and the contrast non existent faces are occasionally difficult to make out having said that the actual story is entertaining and lou comes across as an accomplished actor more so than in many of the <UNK> movies br br once the movie switches to the <UNK> story the film switches to and i use that term loosely most <UNK> are orange or brown the <UNK> look particularly bad br br dorothy ford as the maid was a big plus for me as i enjoyed her in an early <UNK> appearance br br with so many negative comments put down to the actual quality of the print i'm still happy to give this movie a 7 it gave me a lot of laughs and that's more than the greater majority of comedies i've watched over the decades can manage br br one to watch if you get the chance
<START> this movie is stupid and i hate it i turned it off before it reached half i hate this movie amitabh sucks in this movie i wanna throw eggs at the person who directed this movie this movie is stupid and i hate it i turned it off before it reached half i hate this movie amitabh sucks in this movie i wanna throw eggs at the person who directed this movie this movie is stupid and i hate it i turned it off before it reached half i hate this movie amitabh sucks in this movie i wanna throw eggs at the person who directed this movie this movie is stupid and i hate it i turned it off before it reached half i hate this movie amitabh sucks in this movie i wanna throw eggs at the person who directed this movie this movie is stupid and i hate it i turned it off before it reached half i hate this movie amitabh sucks in this movie i wanna throw eggs at the person who directed this movie
<START> usually any movie with steve <UNK> in the lead is a good movie however this movie does not <UNK> to that opinion <UNK> is a below average movie that is extremely confusing in the beginning reminds me of star trek but is able to pick things up a bit towards the end when london becomes zombie city a horror sci fi mess that is very hard to sit through although the naked vampire is very easy to look at this movie deserves a rating of 4 out of 10
<START> this documentary is such a wonderful example of what an entertaining and amazing experience a documentary can be if done so well as this the subject mark is smart funny and very driven and this story of his personal fight to live his dreams will be inspiring to anyone who knows what it is like to harbor an impossible dream see this
<START> this film hits the heart with a reality like no other i have seen it shows what us what we in a <UNK> society take for granted and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing the acting in the film is superb sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a <UNK> and not real life mr <UNK> does wonders with his role as he does with all roles making the <UNK> fully dimensional and human the set is incredible it gives the feeling of <UNK> the round theater which does not add or take away from the emotion of the action this movie seeks to open the eyes of the viewer and i'd say they have made a success of that goal
<START> a vehicle for michael caine its fairly well written and there's some ok acting in it but really it's a mess not funny enough not frightening enough it's a <UNK> modern cockney thriller br br i like the premise that even in the <UNK> moral <UNK> of east london people do do things for the right reasons a surprise result to the first proper fight <UNK> old school billy <UNK> has promoted his paranoia the second half of the film has him chasing shadows to deal with the disappointment of the outcome of the first br br my greatest disappointment was in director john failure to make more of the relationship between <UNK> and his lieutenant substitute frank <UNK> <UNK> a british tom <UNK> understands his role well whilst those around him seem to have ignored it pity 4 10
<START> kane is a killer named <UNK> <UNK> he lives in this burned down old hotel where eight teen <UNK> go to do some cleaning most of them die except for 3 of them in my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever i still thought that the killing scenes were really well done like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs the best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the blonde girl's mouth kane was a seriously great horror movie actor he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change that was his only look the entire movie great action and killing scenes i don't think i could give it a full 10 out of 10 but 6 seems good
<START> i went to see the movie because my boyfriend was raving about how much he wanted to see it and how his friends had already been and loved it so i came in with a neutral attitude not really expecting the worst unfortunately that is what i got i could write a 15 page paper on why this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen but for your benefit i will point out the pros and the endless supply of cons to begin the acting was very good especially christopher <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> there were also a few lines that deserved a laugh and a couple suspenseful scenes sadly good acting a little humor and suspense is where the good points end the whole beginning story could have been great a jewish girl's family is butchered she goes into hiding later encounters the man responsible for her pain and then <UNK> a great plan for revenge sounds very good but the movie wouldn't be quite as satisfying for the americans and jews <UNK> nazi blood i have no problem with wwii movies or killing nazis i saw <UNK> and like it very much however it's the way and attitude with which our would be heroes kill i'll give you a prime example of the kind of <UNK> this movie <UNK> our <UNK> gang <UNK> a german unit and kills <UNK> all of them except a sergeant and two other soldiers no problem so far they ask the sergeant to <UNK> information on another german unit when he <UNK> refuses to <UNK> the lives of his fellow soldiers they bash his head in a with a baseball bat cheering and swearing as if they were at a football game they took that <UNK> head off now let's look at the <UNK> in that scene here's a <UNK> situation a group of american soldiers are <UNK> and taken captive by the enemy the same scenario follows and the american commanding officer would rather die than <UNK> his fellow soldier the enemy <UNK> his head in with much celebration this would <UNK> an audience if this scene were in a movie that american soldier was a hero for placing his men above himself and those <UNK> brutally murdered him about the nazi sergeant well he's a nazi and deserves to die the <UNK> death possible right <UNK> the <UNK> felt the same towards the jews see the <UNK> by celebrating the butcher of the nazis we are placing ourselves on the same sadistic level br br major <UNK> 2 the nazis make a propaganda movie about a german sniper who kills nearly 300 american soldiers near the end of the movie the film is revealed hitler and his <UNK> giggle with delight as they watch an american soldier get shot out of a window and fall into a <UNK> the nazis cheer as soldier after soldier falls to the <UNK> skill this is supposed to <UNK> the american viewers of this scene those evil nazis are laughing over the deaths of our brave men well the irony is isn't that what we were doing or supposed to be doing the entire time we're watching <UNK> <UNK> laughing over the pain of others simply because they were the bad guys how would we feel if native americans somehow made a hit film in which they <UNK> bloody vengeance on the american <UNK> or what if blacks made a movie <UNK> the <UNK> turner rebellion ok enough about the <UNK> flaws br br i'll <UNK> other reasons for the 1 star rating 1 there were view admirable characters throughout the movie brad pitt even <UNK> a woman by sticking his finger in her <UNK> wound because he suspects she betrayed him he's the good guy 2 scenes dragged on way longer than they needed to 3 brad <UNK> southern supposedly <UNK> accent is horrible and thoroughly annoying throughout the entire move i'll quit now since i'm at 700 words br br unfortunately it seems that the general population doesn't think anymore they just want blood and that is why this movie received such a high <UNK> i recommend this movie for the ignorant or if you are jewish and simply wanting to see a nice fantasy justice personally when i finally got out of the movie theater i felt like i had been <UNK> or wish that i had so i wouldn't have suffered over 2 hours of mental rape
<START> saw this last night at the <UNK> <UNK> nyc home film festival a rather <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> down for this sweet and touching two woman film br br the relationship between the two one older and blind the other a twenty something who helps her with her mail is established <UNK> and its depth is readily apparent br br there are no car chases explosions or mind <UNK> special effects just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of humans reaching out toward each other to help and be helped br br see if it you can
<START> son in law didn't do so hot in the box office but that only means the masses were wrong this movie is one of the few movies that <UNK> shore really excels in with some of the funniest lines i've ever heard although the ending is sub par the antics of shore carries the movie
<START> i have a lot of respect for mr <UNK> work but this film lacks many of the qualities that make his films really unique the opening to the film is great and sets you up for the possibility of a really scary horror film what occurs for the rest of the film lacks structure or purpose and does not build into much there are some good performances though and a lot of great atmosphere the end of the film is weak considering everything this builds up to where there should be some grand climax of huge proportions you instead get a very typical conclusion that too many other bad horror movies use making it feel like they just needed to wrap it up a couple of scenes are very memorable for their imagery but in the end the film does not <UNK> to make a really good movie unless you feel you must see everything this director made i suggest passing on this one
<START> ok so one night me and some friends decided to get really stoned and watch a movie unfortunately for us we chose goes to africa ' i have never laughed so hard in my entire life this movie is beyond bad i have literally <UNK> out better films than goes to africa ' i <UNK> films br br the highlight of this movie for me at least was the opening sequence when ernest is making silly faces when they showed him with a head the size of a <UNK> i lost it perhaps i found this so funny because at that point i was the most high perhaps you are right br br if i had to guess what george w <UNK> favorite movie is i would guess goes to africa ' never before have i seen a movie rely more on 1950's stereotypes of people of color there were times when words escaped me and i just <UNK> in awe br br as i was watching this i couldn't help but wonder is this movie meant for children do <UNK> adults actually watch this how could there possibly be a whole franchise of <UNK> movies is this really my life is this real br br i hated this movie
<START> in the early '80s i recorded <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the cable since then i have waited hoping it would be on dvd yesterday i found it it is one of the best humorous character studies i ever saw the old fashioned episode is priceless at this time 4 28 <UNK> only two have reviewed it one hated it the other loved it if you have a dvd player either rent it or buy it as i did
<START> although i'm not a golf fan i attended a sneak preview of this movie and absolutely loved it the historical settings the blatant class <UNK> and seeing the good and the bad on both sides of the <UNK> line held my attention throughout the actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing and i was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments which were not only dramatic and exciting but easy to follow toward the end of this movie came strongly to mind although the greatest game ever played is far less complex a story than that film in both cases the fact that the events really happened <UNK> my interest
<START> this movie was better than i expected i don't think it deserved an r rating though i've seen pg 13 films with worse language and violence i found this movie entertaining and i enjoyed it if you're a person who <UNK> everything you might find a lot wrong with it but if you take it for its face value i think you'll find it entertaining
<START> being from eastern <UNK> right on the border of northern new jersey i still get a feeling like this was a documentary more so than a movie i have friends from new york and new jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that still exists today in lower <UNK> outside of the big city lifestyle if you have not seen this movie and ever wondered what really goes on in the urban jungle check this movie out no really big name actors its as if they just pulled these guys off the street and said act which adds to the realism of the movie the performances are fantastic none the less see this film
<START> i saw this film at a special screening at first i thought the movie would be like a typical amanda <UNK> movie but i was wrong the movie is based on the <UNK> book the night this movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great <UNK> to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the <UNK> guys team at her old school on her way she gets caught up in a long <UNK> web of love lies and deception this movie is this years mean girls i think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are <UNK> some big stars to be featured in this movie
<START> i love stephen kings work and the book was great but i was very disappointed when i bought this movie on dvd this was one of the worst b movies i have ever seen it feels like they had a tight schedule and only took one shot at every scene even if it turned out to be a bad one and where did they find the actors
<START> those reviewers who have complained that this movie lacks <UNK> or has problems of construction are missing the point this is a wonderfully camp romance with plenty of play <UNK> dance <UNK> music that both sends up exotic love stories and <UNK> them up ray <UNK> makes an amusing foil for a <UNK> with black hair <UNK> <UNK> and tons of jewelry the character's <UNK> to feed <UNK> and look after him more closely resembles the good german <UNK> was off the set than her mannered <UNK> roles censorship being in force it's made clear that they share a <UNK> on <UNK> terms only with <UNK> fighting off <UNK> advances with a determination remarkable for a <UNK> bachelor who might be killed any day his only excuse is that she <UNK> so perhaps a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> might indeed be put off br br in the small role of <UNK> young companion on his secret mission bruce lester adds a note of camp of a different kind we are told at the beginning that he hero <UNK> <UNK> and indeed he rather on him when after they are separated he meets <UNK> now transformed into a brown skinned gypsy with a shirt open to the <UNK> his glowing appreciation of the disguise even further suggests that not only <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> br br despite the wonderfully improbable characters and sequence of events the growing love of <UNK> for <UNK> and his acceptance of the non rational aspects of life is rather touching and when on their last night alone before he escapes he says that each of them now contain half of the other the two have become one and then darkness falls i think we can assume that the <UNK> decided to give them a break one goof at the beginning <UNK> who is supposed to be english refers to a lieutenant using the american <UNK> the english say since <UNK> was british he must have been saying it that way because the american movie makers feared that american audiences would be distracted and confused by the british style
<START> i don't understand the people here the film is neither as good as as bad as some people say here except for de the acting is ok the problem with the film is mainly the script the characters are not believable the sex is done okay but the psychology behind the people makes very little sense the film doesn't look good but what do you expect the film was shot for very little money on video off course then it doesn't look as good as a normal film duh the one thing i do agree on is that the music is bad sounds like a cheap soft erotic film from the <UNK> the film is not good okay but you have to give some credit for pulling this of without any money
<START> ok this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments but there are a couple of items i wish to add the mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a <UNK> animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf if we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that fine but the animal in the cage is a <UNK> that would make a did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a <UNK> they're easy to tell apart that's weak br br secondly this movie was covered in the third episode of mst3k on the comedy channel it took joel and the <UNK> a number of episodes to get up to full <UNK> steam and they weren't up there quite yet on this one they did add enough to this <UNK> to keep you awake until the end but it was not one of their better episodes they never even mentioned the glaring <UNK> of an actual wolf and that joke was just hanging in the air waiting to be <UNK>
<START> just watched this one again i wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time this is why these kind of movies are made to entertain people and zombie bloodbath 2 does that for me and for everyone i have showed it to br br the story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that run into a group of escaped <UNK> who have taken over an old <UNK> when a scarecrow that is actually a demon i think gets disturbed it comes to life and re <UNK> dead bodies from the local <UNK> this leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a <UNK> in a small town pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies br br i loved this movie from it's different <UNK> black and white film video and digital cameras to the very fast pace and great music there was always something going on and it never <UNK> you sure it's cheap but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film i have read other reviews and all i can say is that these people have missed the point if you want <UNK> full moon fluff or if you are into modern stuff like urban legend then i say pass on this if you like low budget stuff like gates of hell and evil dead i say buy this now br br the make up and gore is very good the acting is uneven at times but over all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive there is enough going on in this one to fill two more films it is actually one of the better b movies i have seen in ages
<START> this may not be the worst movie to ever win best picture but its up there well on second thought this is probably the worst film to ever win best picture still though you would expect it to be a worth while film that in fact though if questionable as well the film contains almost no depth and is just fun after fun if you want to call it that at first its very interesting but it seems as if everything is exaggerated on so many levels br br the acting was not spectacular to watch but it was quite interesting seeing charlton heston in his first lead role i found many of the characters like the tone of the movie annoying after awhile who i did like a lot was james stewart as the philosophical clown he to me saved the film in that he gave it a much needed extra <UNK> sadly though after stewart there was not much else br br the directing of the much respected cecil demille was non existent to me i found the movie corny at times and his use of betty <UNK> was a mistake the look of the movie was very good at times but it did not generate that magical feeling that classics need to have the writing was actually pretty good considering how shallow much of the movie was br br from movies like this did the term hollywood trash come up there is no depth no valid attempt at drawing emotions out of the audience and simply no artistic value to the film then of course the many holes in the plot throughout this movie was consistently annoying and frustrating i even had a sense through this film that much of what i was watching was not only and inaccurate depiction of circus life but instead the opposite of how it really is why this won best picture is beyond me but its not like the first or the last time the oscars will and have made a mistake
<START> what a stinker i swear this movie was written by a computer that took a whole pile of other movies and <UNK> them all together into this of film <UNK>
<START> after seeing the film version of heart of darkness i feel as if i wasted 100 minutes of my life though the book was not my favorite i was very disappointed to see how poorly nicolas <UNK> portrayed the story despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly <UNK> the book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely <UNK> in the movie br br you'd think a director would be able to fit <UNK> pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half the differences completely changed the story for me for example when the character of fianc√©e is <UNK> to the fact that <UNK> has died it completely <UNK> the ending the book had given not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described it sincerely feels as if <UNK> was filming another story with references from heart of darkness <UNK> in it br br if you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like joseph <UNK> tale you may find it good though i thought the camera work was poor and the cast <UNK> it is a captivating story all the same however if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story don't look for it in <UNK> film
<START> ok let me start off by saying this isn't a horrible movie by any means it's just not good i recall one poster saying the acting isn't campy it's just nuanced no i've seen nuanced japanese and asian acting i'm sorry you're wrong this is camp br br the characters are totally unsympathetic the deaths are totally random and utterly meaningless the writing is bad i'm fine with <UNK> disbelief i'm fine with not having everything handed to me in terms of plot but this movie has no plot one reviewer stated this movie is set in a small town where people are going nuts over and <UNK> that's not a <UNK> that's the entire freaking film <UNK> i've just saved you nearly an hour and a half there is nothing more to it no character development no plot development no explanations no resolution and not even the acceptable within the realm of j horror lack of resolution just nothing br br in addition the musical score is done by someone who obviously wasn't actually watching the movie at the time because it's random enough to cause <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is one thing and done well it can be brilliant see dark water but here it just seems as if the score was designed to go with another movie all together br br the best example i can give is it's as if the japanese remade evil dead without any of the clever bits or good acting it just falls flat it's j horror without the horror
<START> the most vivid portrait of small town <UNK> i've seen in a long time and i'm not just talking about australian films this piece of work seems to have been made under the radar and really it's an entirely fascinating piece of work that has a <UNK> mostly unseen in recent film making br br at times it is rather slow and strange it seems to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> not really sure if it's a thriller or a <UNK> <UNK> but the stunning aspect of the film by alex is its iron <UNK> ruthless direction it never <UNK> it is highly controlled precise and absolutely self assured the cinematography is some of the most <UNK> beautiful and lyrical i've seen the sound is all psychological the music builds the tension br br by the third act the story is <UNK> up and episodes <UNK> and <UNK> don't attempt to piece together the puzzle of the last 20 minutes it's a bit of an but by that time the film has you a bit of a <UNK> a sort of <UNK> and you've been sold a <UNK> that has no real answer
<START> i first saw this movie back in 1994 or <UNK> during my <UNK> year in high school when it was on lifetime after i first saw it i thought it was wonderful sure it may not have run longer but it is as accurate as can be in my own opinion regardless of what anyone else may think <UNK> was great at portraying karen and mitchell anderson was okay as richard louise <UNK> yes who played nurse in <UNK> one flew over the <UNK> nest was fine as well but i found her version of <UNK> karen and <UNK> mother to be a little bit of a control freak i am an extremely huge fan of the <UNK> and i believe that <UNK> voice was and still is so wonderful it really <UNK> me about the fact that she is gone and had left this earth too soon but thanks to the never ending popularity of her music and her <UNK> voice the music will live on anyway back on track to this movie it really is a mystery to me and possibly other people fans and non fans of the <UNK> as to what caused karen to end up getting this problem with her health was it the media that was responsible or was it just <UNK> decision i would not believe that it was her decision it could have been the media from one article that was <UNK> out about her somewhere in <UNK> when their hit close to you came out from what was shown in the film there are some other moments in the movie as well <UNK> struggle with drugs and <UNK> brief marriage i did not hear about her loss in <UNK> of 1983 as i was not yet into watching the news i had found out years later i don't know if there will be another movie about the <UNK> or karen made in the future but until then this movie will do fine i will say this though if karen had <UNK> the false details of that article or any future <UNK> that might have been published with similar content calling her <UNK> which must have been quite an insult she would still be here on this earth today i know that she is in heaven and probably entertaining everyone with her beautiful voice god bless you karen
<START> this movie easily falls into the category of laughable if not beyond that to actually insulting i mean in what alternate universe did the filmmakers and studios think that this film would play from beginning to end we <UNK> with overacting and ridiculous facial expressions laying on the im a loose cannon act a little thick another picking point i had with the movie was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character i mean in one scene where lewis is playing in a bar before making it big there is this over the top just completely absurd bar fight that every citizen in town is apparently a part of then lewis begins to play his rendition of a whole lot of <UNK> and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins dancing wildly as if its the most normal thing in the world these kind of scenes of which there are numerous coupled with the lack of depth in any of the characters led me to actual laughter so all in all this film is not worth viewing for anyone not interested in mocking a filmmaker and his actors decisions for an hour and a half
<START> nurse betty is the kind of movie you can't describe on a poster or in a trailer or <UNK> it's the kind of movie that you walk in to expecting a more mature dumb and dumber what with <UNK> insane waitress goes on a cross country adventure while avoiding crooks trying to kill her br br the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams the best part about nurse betty is it's <UNK> director neil <UNK> uses brutal violence to <UNK> dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next
<START> this movie is truly a classic 80s movie a must have in any movie collection guns bad guys creeps gangs charles bronson and more creeps br br in my opinion this is the best death wish movie tons of non stop action br br and keeping with the classic 80's bad guy vs good guy movie this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and creeps we see bronson <UNK> down thugs and creeps with a 30 caliber korean war heavy machine gun a heavy machine gun for crying out loud when charlie runs out of <UNK> for the heavy machine gun he runs back to his <UNK> and takes up arms with his long range high caliber pistol this pistol can stop a <UNK> elephant and charlie is putting holes the size of <UNK> <UNK> into bad guys with it and if that is not enough charlie is also <UNK> an anti tank <UNK> <UNK> which by the way is only good if he can get the creeps <UNK> together br br the acting in this movie is ha ha great and a lot of off the wall actors mainly playing creeps appear throughout the movie the film is loaded with memorable one liners and scenes heck my favorite scene line is where the creep leader confronts <UNK> in jail and <UNK> explains to him tell you what i am going to do i'm gonna kill a little old lady just for you catch it on the six <UNK> news br br is this film violent heck yes but you'll laugh and cringe all the way through
<START> being a history buff i rented this movie because of the subject matter the idea of the <UNK> island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one small group is intriguing unfortunately the movie falls flat much of the story is simply boring nothing much happens for long stretches the director uses goofy imagery offered up in the form of <UNK> sequences in an apparent attempt to break up the <UNK> pacing but instead it <UNK> with the authentic look and feel of the movie the characters are also poorly drawn in the end we don't really care as much about them as we should it's a shame that this wasn't what it could have been i would still like to see a good movie about the american immigrant experience but this one isn't it
<START> forget the recent dire american remake which sadly <UNK> the reputation of the french original by virtue of the director's involvement in both this is a <UNK> drawn romantic 90s noir with many twists and turns it works best as a <UNK> <UNK> to hitchcock's rear window because the notion of <UNK> is the constant theme that fires the intricate screenplay the story is stunningly realized like a <UNK> painting offering multi perspectives on the same event and demanding the viewer's participation throughout the settings music and haunting score are wonderful as well as the excellent <UNK> from the cast watch it more than once
<START> for me this is another one of those films that i got to see off of the los angeles based z channel when it was in service and it was another one of those movies that i saw when i was young and learned that there was a world out there one i did not want to accept br br moving to los angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure <UNK> of mine and to date no premiere channel programming has matched the z channel in its showing of international films the three international films that stuck in my young head were <UNK> beau <UNK> and of course this one <UNK> br br this was the most shocking and saddest movie i ever witnessed in my life this was also one of the first movies that made me understand that there is a difference in cinema to entertain and to inform let me be honest growing up in a small town on the east coast i had no idea anything like this to this extent existed all i knew from south america was <UNK> of fabulous <UNK> and that columbia had a lot of drug <UNK> br br then comes a film like <UNK> sad disturbing <UNK> scary you're watching children those that need shelter love understanding and all these get are a way to survive day after day through drugs sex robbing stealing sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group homes etc their survival is hard to watch with other street children prostitutes etc and you begin to wonder how can things like this be allowed to happen in this world br br <UNK> is not a film for entertainment it is a film of information it shows shocking and disturbing images but it shows life for these daily street children
<START> i first read about the left behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to check it out since i have an interest in the way religion is used to control people in our ever more hate filled world so imagine my surprise and joy when i found a copy of left behind world at war in my local library <UNK> among the big budget action movies br br now as a movie it's extremely poor the acting is straight out of an <UNK> school production and the special effects would have looked dated in the early 90's being the third part of a series the story would be <UNK> to anyone who hadn't seen or read about the other left behind movies and even with my prior knowledge it was still pretty laughable br br on the religious front i don't think anyone who wasn't already filled with the spirit of the lord would find anything in the movie to convince them to change their ways how are you supposed to fear the <UNK> when he's got a comedy russian accent and the worst of his powers are some pitiful cgi br br however my main problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to try and <UNK> people into believing that it's a big budget action movie upon picking up the box and reading the <UNK> i immediately noticed something odd nowhere on the <UNK> was there a mention of the true nature of this film to someone not in the know it would appear for all <UNK> and <UNK> that left behind world at war was no different from the latest tom nor on the copy that i rented did it say anything about it being the third in a series br br considering the whole premise of the series is that the <UNK> has <UNK> the whole world i find it extremely <UNK> that the film makers tried to <UNK> me twice before i even got the to counter if you're so firm in your beliefs then why not be honest about it br br the simple fact is had this not been a christian movie with the built in fan base that goes with it i seriously doubt it would ever have seen the light of day if cloud ten were hoping that i'd see the error of my ways and give myself to god i'm afraid to say i would have died of boredom and or laughed myself to death before i ever had the chance
<START> the hunting trilogy of rabbit fire 1951 rabbit <UNK> <UNK> and duck rabbit duck 1953 should be considered the comedic high water mark of the chuck jones michael <UNK> collaboration while they are seldom mentioned in lists of the greatest or most important cartoons in the history of animation they are certainly the funniest cartoons i've ever seen michael <UNK> never got the credit that directors like jones <UNK> or <UNK> got but it's his dialogue and situations that make warner bros cartoons and these three in particular some of the funniest ever made
<START> i have seen this movie a number of times and find it very compelling and sad the lack of real emotion from most of the characters is very disturbing they seem empty hopeless the story is based on a real event br br a teenage girl is murdered by her boyfriend for no obvious reason apparently he just felt like it then he boasts about it to his friends and as they don't believe him he takes them to view the body a number of times no one reports the murder there are two strong leads keanu reeves and <UNK> glover <UNK> <UNK> character is seriously annoying br br <UNK> character matt appears to be the only one who has a sense of right and wrong this is keanu at his best a flawless performance and very believable anyone who thinks this man can't act should watch this movie <UNK> little brother is almost the most disturbing character in the movie only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life it is very sad to think there are kids out there like this it really makes you grateful for what you have 9 10
<START> the only redeeming feature of this movie is steve carell like john wayne i've never seen steve carell stretch too far as an actor but it doesn't matter he always plays his one role perfectly br br as marty <UNK> once said comedy must have internal <UNK> you can have 4 men on stage sitting in garbage <UNK> and that's fine but if you bring a fifth man on stage who isn't in a garbage can you must then explain to the audience why he is not also in a garbage can br br why doesn't <UNK> accept his role as a <UNK> of god why when he does accept it is he so profoundly embarrassed by it why isn't anyone more impressed with the way that animals follow <UNK> around they are explained away by the <UNK> <UNK> as trained animals possibly from a circus there's a terrible <UNK> at the end and most everyone we see <UNK> on the <UNK> and is saved but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the <UNK> there is no post disaster emotional atmosphere at the end instead most of <UNK> has finally seen the light and is about to <UNK> the lone bad <UNK> for <UNK> br br i gotta admit i also liked the fish in the <UNK> <UNK> to the presence of <UNK>
<START> there is not much of a plot to this movie there is a wealthy baseball team owner who dies and whose wife is going to sue the hospital for not much more than that but it does not matter br br it does not matter because you have some real actors giving their dialogue life and because of the cast you have yourself some hysterically funny scenes and even if you're not cracking up laughing you have a smile on your face br br matthau plays <UNK> whose wife recently passed away and who finds himself the object of desire of several women at the hospital he is delighted to taste everything on the menu available to him then he meets anne <UNK> glenda jackson who at first is a patient in the hospital their first scene together is very funny and then they meet up again on a television <UNK> discussion show where they disagree on nearly every topic that is discussed br br <UNK> begins to like anne and vice versa except that she is very big on <UNK> in the men in her life her husband was a <UNK> and they decide to give it a shot two weeks of <UNK> br br i will not give away anything else but i want to mention the chemistry that matthau and jackson have on screen she is usually not the first person anyone would think of for a romantic middle aged comedy but her touch with comedy is very light and <UNK> she is matched every step of the way by matthau who is more charming than ever he does not have to play mr sensitive or mr macho to get the girl he just has to be himself br br art <UNK> is a riot all by himself as a practically <UNK> doctor the scene where the baseball team <UNK> <UNK> are buried at home plate is priceless he also has a very funny scene in a parking lot with richard benjamin richard does not have much to do in this movie and more often than not is just the straight man to <UNK> and matthau the role does not tax his considerable talents but he had to have had a good time making this comedy br br very much recommended 8 10 br br ps <UNK> matthau presented jackson with her first best actress oscar and jackson presented best actor to art <UNK> for his role in
<START> and again i find myself in the minority br br i didn't like this one this is the only <UNK> work i haven't <UNK> including slam <UNK> ernest rates the credit for being the worst of the line but this is a clear <UNK> for that dubious title br br this work is too rough and too base to be lovable was one of <UNK> key <UNK> and this element was completely lost <UNK> unfortunately most think this is the best of the line but if you loved the essence of what made ernest ernest you will realize to what i refer about fifteen minutes into this work it was too blatantly base to be fun br br it rates a 3 5 10 from br br the fiend
<START> the <UNK> of the sad <UNK> worked hard at its image but when it came down to <UNK> time it was left standing in its own self created dust br br one cannot image saying this out loud but if vanessa <UNK> <UNK> were to fight john wayne or even clint eastwood my hard earned dollars would have to go to redgrave her portrayal of <UNK> was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multi million dollar <UNK> persona redgrave gave <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hard earned woman from the south to the average viewer this could be <UNK> as annoying but as the film progressed it became her ¬ñ miss <UNK> <UNK> this stage beauty into a <UNK> it was <UNK> performance as well as her interaction with the other characters that made this film stand tall ¬ñ but not the <UNK> the others following her performance were needed but not stellar as we moved past the murky clich√© image passed on by every set designer hired for the post depression south job the minor characters felt like poster board the image was needed to set the scene but the characters of the town had no other purpose take for example rod <UNK> vision of some old wild spoken preacher his scenes alone will make any viewer question the <UNK> of this off the beaten path town the main two players who surrounded <UNK> <UNK> with charm for the admirable top scene stealing moment but due to the lacking direction ¬ñ it just seemed faded the most absurd of the two albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line is <UNK> <UNK> who plays cousin who shows up randomly one night his character is never quite defined he lacks true motive and his <UNK> remain uncertain he plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us the viewers to question his sanity and honesty can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue <UNK> your ears and <UNK> your chest and head finally there is the other end of the absurd ¬ñ keith carradine <UNK> close ups of this tormented man build character but our lack of understanding between him and <UNK> causes his purpose to <UNK> these were the characters as clich√© southern as they were ¬ñ some stood forward and attempted to create an <UNK> period piece and i cannot argue that they failed br br where <UNK> of the sad <UNK> failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative this film was about <UNK> and her need for other souls in her life the audience's level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining ¬ñ one couldn't help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to <UNK> off a warm heart <UNK> character is never quite understood but we do accept him with brief shots of him and <UNK> doing small things together it is his idea that transforms from a <UNK> <UNK> to a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> owner the problem is that director <UNK> never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between <UNK> and redgrave ¬ñ is the man crazy or does he represent all of family i needed something from <UNK> that brought these two out of the david lynch esquire relationship that they had then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of carradine as love interest using the technique of a flashback within a flashback we see the two <UNK> but never <UNK> their love ¬ñ which anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness why was <UNK> so angry why was there no connection between carradine and redgrave why was this even in the film with the lack of focus towards these <UNK> connection the eventual scenes between the two made no sense ¬ñ throw in choice and it just gets completely <UNK> while there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that <UNK> created the inability to transfer his characters from point a to point b i lost focus interest and my care for the characters <UNK> when i didn't understand the ultimate question ¬ñ why br br overall the <UNK> of the sad <UNK> began with a bang but ended with a very small crack of a <UNK> my emotional feel of this film <UNK> up and down up and down and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters redgrave did a phenomenal job as <UNK> and while the other characters outside of the random <UNK> tried their best i just didn't quite understand who they were their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred i was <UNK> director <UNK> seemed to have been lacking <UNK> connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players <UNK> created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to <UNK> the scenery which allowed us to focus on <UNK> ¬ñ or carradine but nothing was explained or developed the film played out with anger discover happiness flashback anger anger anger fade out without the <UNK> this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera it was a shame because sad <UNK> had the promise it just couldn't deliver br br grade <UNK> out of
<START> the game of hockey i play and watch has something called speed which the actual hockey scenes in this limp movie never even come close to capturing add to that a storyline that is clich√© predictable and <UNK> than stupid with some of the <UNK> '80s music numbing your senses in every scene and you have <UNK> oh keanu as a french canadian yeah whatever <UNK> and the anytime one out of ten
<START> i bought the dvd of this movie because i am a fan of william <UNK> and i was really disappointed about a christmas visitor the story of the movie is so boring and slow in the development that you just want to turn off your tv or dvd player after about the half of it the dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera but not in a tv movie william <UNK> was alright in his part and he was acting quite good but he did so much better in other movies and projects meredith <UNK> was horrible and couldn't really bring the warm hearted mother to the viewers instead she was playing very cool and wasn't better than a middle class actress i absolutely cannot recommend this movie spare your time and your money for this one
<START> <UNK> <UNK> creation mr bean has stood the test of time and will be forever <UNK> upon the memory of those who viewed it br br living alone and appearing not to have a job of any description mr bean goes around doing day to day activities in a rather comedic fashion the mistake prone mr bean <UNK> heartfelt laughter when put even in the most <UNK> situations though he barely spoke any coherent words his <UNK> actions more than made up for this br br even when driving in his beloved mini mr bean still manages to cause <UNK> chaos not very much is known about his background but his ability to draw tears of laughter from the audience at his funny <UNK> is well known br br before he found fame nick <UNK> can be seen in a couple of the episodes
<START> i saw this film at the seattle international film festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and indian ex <UNK> the film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film the direction is self assured especially with locals who were <UNK> on the fly for extras and bit parts while the plot and story line is <UNK> to nonexistent the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery <UNK> the lack the soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers if you want to see what can be done in 45 days with a different location every day check out <UNK> <UNK> for inspiration it was not <UNK> in the q a but i imagine hollywood could take a lesson in budget film making by learning from this director
<START> i really love this movie i haven't played final fantasy <UNK> but i still loved the movie its really funny and i love the job the voice over actors have done the visuals are so fantastic and all the lines are so well done br br i have to admit i have a pretty good imagination so i was able to fill most of the gaps the movie presented and i suggest you watch it twice because lots of things suddenly make sense br br also this is pretty funny you should watch it with the subtitles on because what they say and what the <UNK> say are sometimes completely different its really usually pretty funny but sometimes it helps u to understand what they say better br br watch it love <UNK>
<START> another movie from swedish <UNK> country which is always the northern part if black people were shown this way there would be shouts about racism and for good reasons br br this is a farce and you are supposed to laugh at the clever farce clich√©s but it's mostly tiresome a gangster comedy with the bad russians as always and the bad and stupid <UNK> and most stupid of all is of course the norwegian according to <UNK> prejudice br br <UNK> wilson is the only one who tries to make a performance reminding us of reality this is not funny this is not even exciting a <UNK> too raw to make you interested in any way
<START> i bought this movie hoping that it would be another great killer toy movie i am a big fan of the child's play series and was hoping to see the same here boy was i wrong most of the movie was not the least bit scary plus the only time we really see <UNK> alive is the final few scenes of the film the little girl in the film her acting is so bad it's almost laughable plus the ending never showed what happened to the puppet or what made them put the little girl in a asylum or wherever she was at the end of the film so in my opinion this movie is the worst of the killer toy genre if you want a good killer toy series stick with the child's play franchise <UNK> revenge is a waste of money and time
<START> alright we start in the office of a shrink and apparently not a very good one the main hero from the first jack frost is in the <UNK> office out random <UNK> about jack frost gee alright my brother is yelling it off <UNK> anyway back to the crappy movie br br the shrink has his <UNK> phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff i suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie but he looks nothing like him <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they laugh at the poor sheriff <UNK> <UNK> now some people are digging up the anti snowman <UNK> <UNK> now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people i don't quite see how this has to do anything but their <UNK> the anti freeze evil killer mutant snowman with <UNK> <UNK> it shocking it adding strange and bizarre <UNK> to it the whole nine <UNK> nothing alright they give up and leave it in a fish tank one of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank the janitor walks in <UNK> stuff <UNK> the and the coffee <UNK> the tank which makes jack alive br br behold the power of <UNK> now somehow he is in uh i believe the <UNK> but it looked more like hawaii but it couldn't be hawaii unless they spent all of their budget on the <UNK> air plane tickets <UNK> i wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self er i wouldn't suggest doing so though <UNK>
<START> born in 1946 i was about eight years old when first viewing this movie and it left a deep impression not only scary for lack of a better word this movie haunted me for more than 50 years the mob <UNK> played by john was terrifying the only scene that stuck out in my mind during those 50 years was the killing of the little girl and the <UNK> policeman referring to her as a little n kid those words were replaced when the movie was shown recently on tv maybe there are two versions of the movie or someone felt compelled to alter a little bit this heart breaking scene accurate or not the film went a long way in my opinion of the south and still till today the closest i've come to visiting a southern city is el <UNK> that stand may seem extreme but there is a little bit more to the story when the movie was shown recently it became <UNK> why it haunted me for years with the <UNK> like beginning this movie gives the impression that what is being shown is fact the film is made supposedly only one or two years after the depicted incidents adding to its realistic credibility the terror in the movie isn't provided by creatures or space aliens but by persons living in our society at the time re killing of little girl the recent viewing helped make <UNK> the impact it had on my 8 year old mind when this movie came out the only school i had ever gone to was attended by mostly african americans the victim looked like a girl in my class it was like seeing an actual killing it made a horrible scene that much worse maybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me
<START> stay away from this movie far away phil stars as the demented <UNK> of a <UNK> every performance is flat and <UNK> except the plot is a simple one and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible a group of high school kids go to a carnival see a side show and get in over their heads br br fans of fred <UNK> ray should be warned this is not like any of his other films this one is lacking in all <UNK> humor sex horror etc other f o ray movies <UNK> in br br the version i saw also contained a making of <UNK> in which the director makes comments like we had a limited budget and with our limited <UNK> which speaks volumes about how much charles band cared about this film go rent <UNK> runner fred <UNK> ray or the dead hate the living full moon instead full moon should be ashamed of themselves and that's saying a lot after seeing killer eye br br grade d
<START> i didn't catch <UNK> girls when it first came out so still doing some catch up on the first season i read through most of the users comments and for the negative ones i have to ask what show are you watching br br this show is a classic great lines characters and good acting and best of all not your standard formula show always with an occasional twist to the story there are probably more women who see themselves reflected in the emily relationship then in the <UNK> relationship the people and <UNK> are not pc but they are real br br if you find the dialogue annoying i suggest you tape the show so you can <UNK> the parts don't understand
<START> meek and mild edward g robinson as <UNK> decides to quit his bank job and do what he wants open a fix it <UNK> shop behind his house mr robinson is married but <UNK> he has <UNK> local <UNK> resident ted <UNK> as barry young <UNK> is an eager <UNK> assistant and sees robinson as a father figure <UNK> <UNK> wife ruth <UNK> as amy is unhappy with <UNK> job choice and to return matters to her idea of <UNK> their lives are further <UNK> when robinson is <UNK> br br the war also <UNK> what might have been an interesting story as <UNK> character struggles against a <UNK> unsympathetic wife possibly filmmakers are showing how war can save <UNK> and positively <UNK> lives robinson and <UNK> are a likable team robert mitchum has an <UNK> bit part the ending trick played by ms <UNK> and <UNK> is predictably staged
<START> this film was really a breath of fresh air from the load of hollywood crap i've seen recently the acting is superb and the characters are engaging and oddly endearing there really isn't much to the story it's simple and it works well an easy film to just sit down and enjoy the mood was fantastic and the sets really helped push the movie along and offered some nice visuals the film obviously has aspects of horror yet is <UNK> a little more towards the humorous side of things you won't be laughing out loud hysterically with this one but you'll be smiling the whole way through the humor works very well with the characters and the superb acting doesn't hurt i really watched this movie based on the fact that ron <UNK> was in it his role is a bit smaller than i expected but it doesn't matter the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you engaged if you like horror watch this if you like comedies watch this just go ahead and watch this anyway it's really quite excellent
<START> bach did it better much of bach 's speaking part is letters written to various <UNK> complaining about the amount and speed of his <UNK> anna diary mostly about the death of children and <UNK> other family matters is an <UNK> more engaging the music is <UNK> <UNK> century sized <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> producing 20th century concert hall sound the overall production quality reminded me of a junior high slide show j s bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself this film adds nothing netflix sent me 2 <UNK> that wouldn't play so i <UNK> the movie clearly netflix was trying to tell me something
<START> i hate movies that end like this br br this <UNK> disaster is full of clich√©s stereotypical characters a generic over done plot and terrible dialog br br in this movie we have the aggressive black guy the black guys girlfriend the blonde bitch the possible lesbian <UNK> chick the teacher blah blah blah and then the <UNK> man br br do you think someone is taking the legend too far this question is asked towards the end of the film taking the <UNK> of scream 2 too far br br spoilers typically i don't go into spoilers but i have to rant br br a dream the whole thing was a dream this is the most way to end a movie i don't know how to explain all of this and we don't have any more money let's make the whole thing a dream this is what the director producer actor fx guy must have been thinking yes the director is the character of mr e he did almost everything on this garbage movie this is such a cope out ending and what of the principal okay so he has been doing all the kidnapping what did that have to do with the movie of course the black people are killed the bitchy girl is killed the teacher that has a past of sexual <UNK> with students gets killed he is main suspect <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this movie gave me heart burn br br pointless senseless and made with parents <UNK> and which tells me it is probably still being paid off this movie is dumb boring and just plain stupid br br the only thing i liked was the credits the way they presented the names etc in the beginning and at the end it had a creepy feel to it too bad the movie didn't br br 1 out of 10
<START> i hate guns and have never murdered anyone but when even half of the events that take place in happen to you or close ones and you find a gun you shoot your <UNK> three times five times whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you i think even god would say good call in a very <UNK> type film but more realistic ¬ñ as this really could happen to anyone well if you're a pretty young woman that is ¬ñ was a decent film though on the long side a few good shocks always call <UNK> even just to change a tire basically just one surprise but for the most part you could see things coming and aside from the typical tie him up instead of the previously mentioned shooting him the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other getting past those it's enjoyable for what it is basically we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from mexico home wow that's original and one lost her <UNK> <UNK> them from leaving the airport until late and after an obvious <UNK> sign language scene they enter a too good to be true half price <UNK> ride clich√©d <UNK> previously introduced con their way on the <UNK> to join what appears to be alan stunt double from <UNK> ' from here it's obvious what happens i did mention it was a <UNK> knock off but still i didn't find too much horrible yet nothing spectacular though it would've served the audience better with roughly 15 20 minutes deleted i would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror
<START> i feel very fortunate to have the chance to not only watch this film but also learn more about this fascinating person and time is an outstanding portrayal giving a full sense of the story without falling into the usual hollywood <UNK> yes he is shown with his wife and children but the essence of the story is his politics and those of the still <UNK> independent <UNK> the film is brilliantly made moving along at a pace that is consistently engaging i look forward to seeing other <UNK> peck films as well as more from eric
<START> terrible the only way i could even begin to consider it funny is if it made fun of itself amazing it's about an ass that fights crime and he drinks <UNK> how very funny it's funny because where most people put things in their mouth he puts them in himself and now he's getting sexual service from some lady this show is so great that is what i would have to say if i liked the show though i'm sure you can see the obvious sarcasm i've noticed some people have been comparing this show to 12 oz mouse and <UNK> <UNK> why would you even try there's nothing to compare the other two shows actually have some decent character development in conclusion i hate <UNK> i <UNK> at the name of it
<START> the influences of other science fiction and thriller movies and stories are evident throughout this film the movies that come to mind immediately are alien aliens and starship troopers the story itself is fairly straightforward and not all that original traveling through space crash landing on planet with no apparent life and a deserted <UNK> expedition except when the lights go out forcing different types of people to work together toward their mutual survival while the body count <UNK> this kind of movie always tends to be fun as long as it's done well i believe that pitch black was done well the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it br br <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> the stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past physically <UNK> high tolerance for pain and conveniently can see in the dark you know he is going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie because it's hinted throughout the movie that he actually may have a conscience about things br br cole house plays the drug addicted bounty hunter who's probably in many ways a real bad guy compared to <UNK> as his character reveals itself throughout the movie it is most likely that he is most courageous when the odds and <UNK> are in his favor a very self serving character that in the end gets what he deserves br br <UNK> mitchell plays the co pilot on the doomed <UNK> who is <UNK> out of deep sleep because the ship ran through a meteor <UNK> or the tail end of a comment finding the pilot dead in his sleeping chamber she attempts to land the ship which leads to our discovery of that's character's potentially fatal flaw fear of responsibility <UNK> and being a leader her character in the short span of the story probably grows the most in that she actually grows some conviction takes charge and doesn't sit around waiting to be <UNK> up by night stalking aliens she in some strange way <UNK> with the ever distant human side of <UNK> who in turn in the end respects her for her choices and her sticking with them br br the story in some cases plays out as you would expect it but i think you'll be mildly surprised by which characters survive this harrowing experience this movie is an entertaining train wreck in progress to watch go watch it br br
<START> maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end that's odd because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed <UNK> dream once many years ago when i saw it on the stage br br i think that two things did me in that <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> name <UNK> and michelle sitting in a giant <UNK> well i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't i'd say we have a bad movie on our hands
<START> this could quite possibly be the worst movie ever made up there in a league with movies like howard the duck plan 9 from outer space and <UNK> i don't understand why i decided to see this movie as it was a waste of my life i also do not understand why one would like this movie regardless of their sense of humor the acting is among the worst i've ever seen as is the writing the characters are all stupid and there is not one funny scene in the entire movie tom arnold is quite possibly the worst actor ever this movie proves it there is nothing worthy about this movie don't rent it don't watch it don't even say that it looks interesting it's bad enough i saw it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> post murder did some good roles in <UNK> films but other director just made use of his kissing and naughty image br br is one of them and it came after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a row and i was already fed up of him and such roles br br the film has a nice twist at the start i felt like an <UNK> <UNK> film but then it turns into a routine film with sudden love sudden jealousy and a bad climax br br makes a terrible film music is saving grace camera work is fabulous br br <UNK> <UNK> just repeats his act of his earlier films and has 2 expressions throughout <UNK> looks stiff talks as if he is practicing hindi and does okay in some scenes is <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a simple but <UNK> movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides br br the combination of the central character being played by mick <UNK> and the central setting being the local lawn <UNK> <UNK> drew an unusually broad crowd ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of senior citizens and all laughed at the comedy br br as would be expected of a movie with mick <UNK> and <UNK> lucy there was quite a bit of swearing but it was not overdone and the audience i sat with certainly enjoyed it br br mick <UNK> did a good job as the lazy bloke who joined the <UNK> club three times simply to get parking spaces one for himself and two for to others at a <UNK> but who has everything fall down on him when he is required to play or lose his <UNK> br br <UNK> lucy does a fine job as his local journalist love interest and there are fabulous performances from bill hunter frank wilson monica <UNK> lois <UNK> and many others br br john <UNK> <UNK> role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives a solid performance br br the not so subtle <UNK> at provide a bit of a serious note to this otherwise light comedy br br i'm sure that those who enjoyed the castle and the dish would also enjoy this movie
<START> that got destroyed quickly by the poor quality acting cinematography numerous pointless scenes and a terrible villain well let's see joe <UNK> is bad as usual but he isn't the only casting problem writer vivian <UNK> is no great actress in fact well she sucks her script isn't so bad it's just bad directed in fact if the direction had been better and if better actors had been cast this could have been a really good film br br but alas with all of these problems fails to be even kind of passable as a horror movie plus the pacing is just awful too br br the <UNK> crew had some fun with this one but it definitely wasn't one of their better efforts 5 for that nothing for the original
<START> almost certainly the best three stooges short with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is as good as any of the <UNK> best shorts featuring curly memorable <UNK> moments abound the opening with <UNK> giving voice lessons to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> miss dee green <UNK> at her horrendous singing notes and fighting off her advances is an excellent example of <UNK> howard at his best many considered him the most naturally funny of the stooges br br later when moe and larry try to help him get up to find a wife and claim 500 000 <UNK> thinks he has cut off his head when his mirror gets <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the mirror he cries with relief there i pretty as a picture <UNK> moe quickly replies trying to <UNK> his <UNK> of an ape br br the best scene and maybe <UNK> best with the trio comes when he pays a call on attractive young miss hopkins christine <UNK> <UNK> him for long lost cousin basil she <UNK> him with <UNK> and kisses also leading to a hilarious bit between moe and larry in the hall not giving him a chance to explain his true identity suddenly the real cousin basil calls and she goes <UNK> <UNK> him repeatedly and <UNK> him of taking advantage of a poor ¬Ö ¬Ö woman that final line is delivered as she <UNK> him in the jaw with a real punch according to <UNK> and crew members knocking him through the door and into the hall in a perfectly executed gag what happened kid moe asks can i help it if i ain't cousin basil <UNK> asks before passing out br br other classic bits include moe and <UNK> getting <UNK> in a phone booth trying to find a lost <UNK> larry getting slapped because of <UNK> bad looks his face pressed against the phone booth glass and the great girl fight in the justice of the apartment the great <UNK> <UNK> delivers his classic line <UNK> on his <UNK> hold hands you love birds over and over as his apartment is <UNK> br br i <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as medicine for anyone who thinks the <UNK> glory years ended when curly left true <UNK> didn't have as many great shorts with the group as curly but that was due to an increasing lack of support from columbia and his and the <UNK> <UNK> ages when <UNK> was healthy and the trio was given decent material to work with they were still on the top of their game
<START> i just saw this movie for the second time i first saw it back in the mid 90's as a <UNK> video selection it has <UNK> it power br br it is interesting from several aspects one is that it is based on a true story two is it is a <UNK> pad for two interesting actors keanu reeves and <UNK> glover and three it has dennis hopper in one of his better social <UNK> psychotic character roles br br the movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings you have characters in one on one family <UNK> group school general society settings etc the story does well in <UNK> how a person will act in each setting br br i wish i could find the details of the actual murder to compare to the movie i saw a short bit that <UNK> it occurred in california and that several <UNK> were taken to view the corpse br br this is a good choice for a rainy night video rental be prepared to feel <UNK> at the end
<START> from all of the vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out it has this <UNK> feel to it everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you it is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other vietnam war movies what does push to such a high level is the br br the directing was spectacular here francis ford coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war most others just display and show you the horrors of war coppola though makes you feel confused shocked and scared these feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story this is something that i have only experienced very few times while watching a film the writing was of course amazing too it brought you write into the middle of the movie it never made me bored and this movie is three hours the cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the <UNK> experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm br br the acting was bone chilling just look at marlon brando also giving his last great performance playing a <UNK> out of <UNK> colonel when ever i think of a crazy gone made soldier i think marlon brando in now with brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes like the movie he was <UNK> to me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in the godfather martin sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the <UNK> he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal it is just a wonder why these two did not get oscar nominations robert duvall was able to show part of that <UNK> with his ludicrous battle <UNK> among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming also <UNK> character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable other great supporting performances were given by a young laurence fishburne sam <UNK> and <UNK> forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a clich√© also for once cameos were put into good use having dennis hopper and harrison ford who i both love br br i would definitely recommend people to watch this movie it has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best there is nothing more i could ask of this movie with its great acting directing writing cinematography and great ending watch and you will see why it lives up to its title now
<START> i loved this movie my daughter is 3 1 2 and a country girl at heart there are not any movies for young children i loved this one because the worst thing in it was when one of the boys said stupid i applaud them for stepping out and making a true family movie i rented it the first time we saw it and know looking to buy to add to our collection my daughter can not stop talking about it it goes along with our lifestyle we live in east texas i hope to see more family films like this one she even named one of our <UNK> hokey <UNK> keen i can not say enough about this movie i look forward to many more films like this one
<START> <UNK> can't make any good movies fact this is a great example of that br br first of all the term plot does not exist in this movie it's seriously weak even tho a lot of people would argue with me on that sure it's about a taboo but that's about it there are endless possibilities which could have been really great if used but they nearly <UNK> everything i think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures which are the only decent things in this whole pile of awfulness br br the acting is just plain <UNK> there aren't many lines so you would think that the actors have great facial expressions or <UNK> abilities but no in fact <UNK> of the time they suck and that's when they don't say anything if they say even a single word you'll start <UNK> your head saying that's damn unrealistic but than again this is partly the fault of the writing there's also no emotion in most of the dialogs br br the editing is sometimes ok but most of the time illogical and just <UNK> the whole picture it could have given an emotional push yet it seems the editing in here is all about putting cuts after each other br br someone please explain it to me why critics say this movie is a masterpiece calling this an art isn't gonna make it better sorry but you failed live with it even tho you probably won't care about my or any other guys opinion your child
<START> <UNK> master 1950 <UNK> john ford br br production pictures rko radio pictures br br john ford brings the stock company out into the <UNK> desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic no john wayne no conflicted anti heroes no psychological exploration no fireworks just a gem of a picture br br this ensemble piece <UNK> stars ben johnson as travis and harry carey jr sandy they're horse <UNK> who come into town to do some business just as a group of <UNK> led by ward bond are being shown the exit the group is about to <UNK> on a trek to their own <UNK> but they know the odds and the harsh <UNK> are against them so they hire travis and sandy as <UNK> masters for their trip along the way they run into and take along a traveling medicine salesman and his two female <UNK> alan <UNK> as the doctor <UNK> his appearance in my darling <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as his daughter tension is added when the murderous <UNK> gang comes upon the <UNK> train and there is also an <UNK> for hollywood meeting with the <UNK> br br most of the story and humor is driven by the clash of ideals cultures first between travis and sandy and the <UNK> between ward bond himself he's constantly trying to <UNK> his urge to curse and be a <UNK> man between the doctor and his ladies and the <UNK> between the <UNK> train and the <UNK> and finally everyone and the <UNK> there is also a classic ford scene of a <UNK> dance which expresses one of his signature themes of civilization coming to the frontier br br again no duke here but i've found ben johnson especially the young <UNK> ben johnson to have an engaging screen presence of his own he comes with his own <UNK> with that <UNK> and also when you see him doing all the stunt riding himself he's great here in one of his early credited appearances harry carey jr although having been around for a few years by this time is still pretty raw at times but he's likable ward bond is his usual marvelous <UNK> self i've found <UNK> <UNK> to be a drag in whatever i see her in but here she's mercifully <UNK> other familiar faces include jane <UNK> francis ford and hank <UNK> playing like he will in the <UNK> a few years later it's not any more amusing here br br there is some absolutely spectacular b w photography by frequent ford <UNK> bert not only is there the typical <UNK> on the landscapes and <UNK> there is also some <UNK> in a handful of scenes with shadow and sun light the soundtrack features the legendary country music group the sons of the <UNK> can't get more cowboy than that br br <UNK> out of 4
<START> contrary to the comment posted directly below the big trail 1930 was not filmed in a three camera process much like the later <UNK> that was the finale to <UNK> <UNK> a different film entirely the big trail was simultaneously shot in both <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> versions and both versions are shown on fox movie channel from time to time so it's easy to compare one with the other the <UNK> version broadcast in <UNK> approximately its original 2 1 ratio is more impressive <UNK> with its wide angle <UNK> but suffers from the same problem that <UNK> early a lack of close ups forced upon director <UNK> walsh because of focus problems scenes involving individuals rather than crowds or long shots are much more effective in the standard version because the camera can move closer to the players thereby achieving a greater sense of involvement for the viewer watching the two versions simultaneously one gets an accurate idea of which shots walsh chose to shoot close up in the standard version but could not in the <UNK> version there are also a couple sequences involving el a shell game with ian keith and some business with his wife a jackass which are in the <UNK> version but missing from the standard version br br for the record the big trail is the only one of three fox <UNK> films which has survived in its original wide screen format the other two are fox <UNK> of <UNK> completely lost and happy days which survives only in standard format other studios also <UNK> with wide film at this time but the only other one still known to exist in both <UNK> is the bat <UNK> filmed in both and <UNK> and released by united artists other wide films were <UNK> billy the kid 1930 and the great <UNK> 1931 <UNK> danger lights 1930 and the <UNK> 1930 all of which can be seen in their standard format versions on turner classic movies <UNK> 1930 was also filmed both wide and standard but seems to have completely disappeared it is <UNK> to be lost br br why did wide film fail in 1930 theaters were <UNK> pun intended under the impact of the stock market crash of october <UNK> and the <UNK> costs of <UNK> sound equipment and so were <UNK> to taking on the added expense of <UNK> additional new projection equipment and new wider screens to <UNK> just a handful of films photographed in a variety of different systems that were not even always <UNK> with each other it would not be until 1953 when fox now <UNK> century fox would try again and this time succeed with the introduction of wide screen <UNK>
<START> <UNK> edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed american screen writer <UNK> <UNK> it is based on an actual event which happened at a time when most of american youngsters were trying to make sense of their lives this is one of the most outstanding films made by american director tim hunter much of film's attention is focused on a reckless murder committed by a <UNK> teenager this unfortunate event sets in motion a whole range of questions about real motivations of youngsters in american society those who saw this film during its initial release must have had vivid memories of great actor dennis hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social <UNK> matrix star keanu reeves also looks good as one of the teenagers before he reached star status at a time when teen flicks are made without any kind of serious <UNK> it is hoped that <UNK> edge cannot simply be ignored as just another silly teen flick it had massive impact on people who lived during <UNK> times of the past when being an <UNK> of a sleepy town was akin to not having being born for today's generation with their <UNK> <UNK> of internet props such as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> edge might appear to be outdated but its importance cannot be denied by any serious film admirer
<START> this film suffers <UNK> from its direction julian grant and its incompetent lead steve <UNK> who's putting a solid effort to win a bruce willis look alike contest the writing is reckless hollywood action thriller sean bean whose one of my favorites david <UNK> and kim <UNK> give a decent performance the film is definitely below average 3 out of 10 i wonder what hollywood studios thought actually giving the go ahead to weak director such as grant and i'd say to sean bean what were you thinking even considering <UNK> in a film like this after such great films like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> games
<START> if you're an average guy like me and enjoy good acting good plot good scripts novel ideas or being entertained you might want to skip this one i was honestly bored from the opening credits to the very end but tried to give the film a chance and watched it all the way through only to be disappointed at every turn br br the acting was unbelievably sub par but i'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was the ridiculously wooden and horrible dialog coupled with an even worse script the plot is very vague and underdeveloped and i think the audience is supposed to <UNK> some kind of deeper meaning from it or be able to look past it in some way but honestly to do so would be a waste of time br br the film has a kind of crude sexuality to it which doesn't serve any purpose other than to show off some <UNK> and <UNK> no one seems to have any motivation except making money off of some kind of investment deal that is never really explained the connections between the characters aren't terribly clear and there is little to no character development br br this is either some kind of sub culture film meant for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute crap but you can decide for yourselves br br i gave it a 2 because it is definitely one of the worst films i've ever seen but probably not the worst
<START> an ear splitting movie a quasi old fashioned screwball romp designed to showcase singing star <UNK> comedic attributes she does indeed go far out on the proverbial <UNK> here playing a beyond <UNK> <UNK> attempting to prove she was framed for murder a body was found in the <UNK> of her car after she ran a red light big laughs after an energetic animated credits sequence which is much more fun than the rest of the picture we have nothing to look at but <UNK> black <UNK> and red lips set off by her <UNK> hair and pale what else is there <UNK> dunne seems defeated playing <UNK> keeper while the poor choice supporting cast struggles to get laughs with lousy dialogue it's an unfortunate set back to the talents of director james <UNK> who <UNK> allows his star to run rampant in the spirit of the nutty slapstick films from the 1930s but even <UNK> hepburn in bringing up baby had a human side wretched from
<START> an interesting companion piece to true documentaries of john c holmes unfortunately it doesn't deal with what ultimately killed holmes and it certainly could have <UNK> from doing so burt reynolds and mark <UNK> got the most praise for this but i felt the true stars were <UNK> moore as the cocaine <UNK> mother wannabe don cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as <UNK> salesman in some wild and william h macy who's wife is the ultimate slut not to mention a nearly <UNK> alfred <UNK> <UNK> new year's eve bash and <UNK> chance for a better life after a <UNK> shop robbery gone wildly wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie or at least the two best shot what this movie does best is show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms however none of the characters apparently learn anything from their dark <UNK> spiral as they all <UNK> and return to their normal lives
<START> anybody who thinks this film is great desperately needs their head seen to it strikes me that this film was made as a joke it has no good points whatsoever the props cost about 10 and the entire set looks like it could fall down at any time why do films like this get made in the first place this also had two of the most annoying characters i have ever come across in the young boy on the spaceship and the redneck from the <UNK> century this film is almost as bad as cool as ice starring the incredibly talented vanilla misunderstood ice
<START> who ever put that review as <UNK> bad <UNK> is not all quite there its so funny genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series all is as good as <UNK> standards if you think that it is <UNK> or <UNK> then i can only think of one thing to say to you go to hell thanks it had to be said i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete joke i would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that haven't you got anything better to do with your time what are you trying to prove thanks for reading my heart filled review on the matter cheers
<START> i love ben kingsley and tea <UNK> however this is easily the worst movie i have seen in 10 years and i see my share of movies a stinker this is a bad idea for a movie poorly executed nothing about it is funny credible or interesting i was looking for wit irony and genuine humor instead this looked like most of the cast members <UNK> on to the set to do tea <UNK> a favor it's too bad such acting talent was wasted on such <UNK> don't bother i have to wonder what opinion the makers of this movie have of their audience to subject them to the idea of polish gangsters in buffalo ny sending a contract murderer to san francisco to become a <UNK> assistant while attending <UNK> <UNK> bill <UNK> should begin reading scripts before he agrees to be in a movie sad
<START> the only thing that makes this one watchable is <UNK> performance as the lunatic killer on the loose what remains is a most impossible tale of revenge and <UNK> <UNK> during the <UNK> <UNK> scenes i had the feeling that <UNK> was <UNK> a sweet <UNK> and not a communication device another interesting thing about this one is that alan hale the <UNK> from <UNK> island is not yet so fat and he can still lower his arms below his <UNK> other than that there isn't much to recommend here
<START> lovely i just love the movie i want to see this movie because rupert is a fantastic actor his expressions are great spectacular the movie was excellent julie <UNK> it was perfect too i think that rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love rupert have a beautiful smile a beautiful voice and a wonderful accent i think that the movie was great and was great see rupert in another thing but harry potter and its a very good actor so it deserves that and more he just have a golden globe but probably it deserves an oscar academy award there are some actors that do not act very well but have a oscar anyway it does not matter but he is perfect brilliant and beautiful
<START> i have been most fortunate this year to have seen several films at my art museum on occasion well more like half of the time i am unable to watch the films there i have <UNK> attempted to view each of the films that i have missed so far <UNK> and pleasures on the <UNK> sea and who killed the electric car are the other films that i have had to watch this way the film covers an intriguing subject matter and is well <UNK> emphasis on this later but not as successful as <UNK> and pleasures but far superior to electric car br br the film's <UNK> the future of the american concept of suburban living it questions the <UNK> of such a practice as oil <UNK> rise so the film <UNK> the origin of the <UNK> and it's evolution until the early <UNK> one theme the film <UNK> at length is the alienation the <UNK> creates among its inhabitants while several people may live together they do not know each other as we define the word this to me represents the strength of the film its appeal to actual human emotion we are able to understand the <UNK> argument so much easier because they do not have to convince us of their <UNK> this is also one of the reasons <UNK> sea is such a wonderful documentary br br unfortunately <UNK> loses its message in <UNK> explanation in support of its central argument as those interviewed speak their arguments become <UNK> more akin to those made by <UNK> <UNK> we are told that oil production will hit its peak in this decade but are given no scientific evidence professional reports <UNK> etc in support of this claim we are given little information as to how this date was <UNK> fortunately this was the only significant flaw that i was able to <UNK> in the film's argument yet it's a glaring one nevertheless another less important <UNK> i noticed was the liberal political bias which could some viewers however this bias is revealed <UNK> clips of various events and not the filmmakers themselves the clips especially those from the 1950's seemed a tad unnecessary to me the film was no better with their presence and would have been more <UNK> in their absence br br as i thought more of this film before <UNK> this review i thought about why i found its argument more convincing than other documentaries that i'd recently viewed finally i realized that the filmmakers actually offered analysis to the suburban problem they <UNK> a village system where <UNK> of people would live together they <UNK> this practice would lower the necessity for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> wasted space they define wasted space as the long stretches of parking lots between shopping areas for instance what is incredible about this is that it's actually <UNK> most documentaries vaguely state that some problem should be ended but offer no method of doing so thinking more about the film i decided that this analysis is what saved the film for me and why i give it a <UNK> review br br while neither perfectly convincing nor fluid in presentation the end of <UNK> is a worthwhile investment of one's time it not only <UNK> the contemporary problem of <UNK> but it also provides realistic insight on how to <UNK> it the audience can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the 1950's spliced with the modern people living in <UNK> georgia or the <UNK> region of north <UNK> will particularly enjoy this documentary as <UNK> is the most established there
<START> as a <UNK> khan fan i was looking forward to this movie after <UNK> <UNK> epic novels about <UNK> and reading up on loads of historic records i feel i know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie br br that turned out a deception this movie is practically made up from beginning to end there are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers that does not have to be a problem i like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring nothing of the greatness comes forth in this movie br br i would not recommend this movie if you know anything on the subject
<START> this takes place on fire island back in the 1970s a couple peter craig dudley and buddy j will <UNK> are throwing a 4th of july party at their house unfortunately their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests the rest of the movie chronicles the party and what happens between peter and buddy br br ok i'm a gay man but i was 8 back when this was made if this is a true view of what gay life was in the 1970s i'm glad i wasn't around from the puzzling opening credits which shows kids playing in the sand this movie <UNK> slowly into disaster there's a guru robert case who talks <UNK> about nothing of any importance i wanted to gag the guy halfway into his first long speech there's the young kid danny who is there for his first time there's the lesbian couple who do nothing except one <UNK> for no reason there's the leather queen worst of all is the <UNK> man named jimmy jimmy foster we're introduced to him and his friend whose name i never got when they get a flat tire they basically scream and <UNK> for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix a flat i know some people find this funny but i found it offensive and pretty sad the party itself is full of people you would never want to know it's like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing obnoxious people with the sole exception of dudley no one can act br br this may be valuable as a portrait of what fire island was like in the 1970s but it's pretty dull viewing this gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies
<START> i watched this movie and all i can say is this i am not a film student nor am i some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that i don't understand however if i were to do that with this film my thoughts would be br br yep he's on drugs and i can picture it now he was <UNK> one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like hey wouldn't it be funny if nuns really could fly like what if one just fell out of a plane and free fell for a while <UNK> to the ground and got up and walked away <UNK> or if <UNK> gave the <UNK> a bath oh my god i'm cracking up just thinking about it dude we gotta make a movie about it and then he says to his friend as he's laughing oh and wouldn't it be hilarious if people loved it and called me a genius for it so to me this is what happens when some guy does one too many drugs and writes a script and produces a movie should i have been doing <UNK> to understand what this guy was thinking so i could have had a laugh too because i have to tell you i wasn't laughing i was <UNK> and checking the time br br i think everyone who is trying their hardest to find a deeper meaning is hysterical i had never heard of this director until i came to read the reviews which i did because i was mad that i lost that last 2 <UNK> or how ever long it was it felt like 12 <UNK> of my life and i can't ever get it back anyway i have read that this guy is a heroine addict and he wanted to die for art what the heck is that so my point is sort of proved this guy is not all there he's a drug addict and his movie is evidence of such so please quit trying to find a deeper meaning to it if one really wants to understand everything in this movie go drop some <UNK> and sit back and relax then it might actually make sense br br it reminded me of the time i watched gus van <UNK> last days another movie i was mad about watching i cannot help but wonder what the ratings would be for that movie if the same people reviewed it who reviewed this one it seems like if the movie's director is totally off his rocker or if it's a french movie with sex and subtitles or if it's a cartoon it is going to get great reviews hands down anything else is boring and has already been done blah bring on the boring please
<START> how many times must i write the words boring and not funny on this page until i get to ten lines george is about original an actor as from the little <UNK> although that is probably a slight to how many times do i have sneak into these <UNK> actors crappy films before i will learn that there is but one law in the movie industry take the money and make a movie even if it is crap they spend millions making this movie but can't take a few moments to watch the end result and <UNK> should stop taking the illegal drugs she is on and seek medical help for the facial problems she is sporting at least i hope its drugs as she is quite unattractive whilst talking out the side of her mouth this movie was neither funny nor dramatic and these <UNK> should just stop making crap like this george and <UNK> you should be ashamed of yourselves and stop being stop <UNK> greedy
<START> after a few <UNK> we are still waiting for the french horror movie that the critics will certainly <UNK> but will launch a new trend not this time doug <UNK> can't be accused of not being in the genre he is editor of a high class fantasy <UNK> has worked for legendary magazine but why a scenario that uses every clich√© in the book except maybe the <UNK> comic relief why make it so predictable even the <UNK> towards <UNK> fails flat it's not even an euro teen movie like the german <UNK> much better just a <UNK> of scenes that barely seems to have any relation one with the other and features lots of plot holes the whole <UNK> aspect is barely touched and after a painfully predictable the screenplay offers us a boring endless chase in a <UNK> which seems bigger than <UNK> <UNK> i really wanted to love this film really but even a mother would not oh and writer was supposed to have a cameo but i <UNK> looked for him
<START> this is my all time favorite looney tunes cartoon it's a common plot <UNK> duck tries to convince elmer <UNK> that it is really rabbit season and shoot bugs but your can never <UNK> that rabbit in addition to usual cartoon comedy this cartoon is supported by great word play that will keep you rolling on the floor
<START> if you are dating a girl that is into br br many parts of this movie were killer and the feeling you get from this movie while watching it and immediately after is enough alone to sit through it all but some things really bothered me about this film that i cant really put my finger on br br i definitely think that this movie is one that any art student or photography student should see b c of the camera style and <UNK> that <UNK> never seen but that is just it it looks like an art student made it and the plot if there is any is so <UNK> that you really need to be on a lot of drugs to get just what is going on
<START> and now for another point of view i didn't like it i didn't finish it in fact i know that <UNK> is <UNK> by some as one of the greatest westerns ever made i know that it stars and was directed by clint eastwood one of the icons of american cinema i know that it won a bunch of oscars still i didn't like it i don't like westerns and that's clearly a matter of taste but i also don't admire eastwood's acting he is not and never has been a leading man he is no burt <UNK> no paul newman no john wayne in this film alone he is <UNK> by richard harris and gene hackman they are both actors no eastwood is a tall guy with a <UNK> voice who usually plays tough guys here he plays a retired tough guy when i see him on screen i see a man at his acting then there's the anti western western plot it is too obviously intended to <UNK> contemporary values a respect for the role of women blacks native americans and single parents a <UNK> for violence and drinking the <UNK> that comes with marriage including <UNK> marriage and small adorable children into a century in which those values weren't necessarily accepted at least in these ways by promoting those values the movie comes across as mannered if not preachy then there are the <UNK> movie stereotypes prostitutes with hearts of gold the kid who can't shoot straight the city <UNK> new to the wild west the <UNK> brush <UNK> on a summer afternoon with a musical <UNK> in major <UNK> finally there is the pacing of eastwood's direction i gave up after an hour eastwood was still riding north <UNK> with morgan freeman and the kid who couldn't shoot straight sixty minutes after the plot driven by the <UNK> of a prostitute was set in motion it was way too slow somebody had to find these elements <UNK> i am afraid it was me
<START> better than it has any right to be this movie died a quick and painful death at the american box office at times <UNK> at others <UNK> satirical and witty <UNK> and hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times laden with drug and sexual humor reminding one at one time or another of everything from the woody allen of everything you always wanted to know about sex to the mel brooks of the producers saturday night live to monty python <UNK> to cheech and chong watch it listen carefully because some of the jokes go by really quickly and remember a time when comedy was allowed to be <UNK> hilarious
<START> this movie was so predictable and poorly acted i really can't recommend it to anyone not even for unintentional laughs it is just plain bad it is pure tv movie hell the cast doesn't seem all that bad but they act terribly just stay far away from this movie and rent something more intellectual like porn
<START> the <UNK> it's shot pretty well has some interesting <UNK> characters likable main character albeit weak br br the bad plot story editing characters wasted jessica alba br br i'm a fan of sappy movies but this movie is cringe bad i don't understand how anyone can hand over <UNK> to this guy and before i go any further i just want to say that i don't dislike jessica alba i really wanted to like her in this film however jessica alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable she has absolutely no screen presence in this movie and she ruins every scene she's in needless to say the romance does not come off as believable not even a tiny bit br br all i saw throughout was the actors <UNK> their wings trying to get this thing off the ground with what little they were given but sadly all this movie does is sink there is no emotional connection no emotional conflict and nothing is gained it's a pretty empty movie
<START> i know this is a made for tv movie and the acting in made for tv movies is usually sub par but it's absolutely horrendous in this film sometimes acting gets so bad it's laughable but in this case it's so bad it's sickening
<START> the greatest <UNK> to the other <UNK> here at imdb who asked himself why this series didn't get stuck in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the 80s did br br it is not true the series would have gotten worse if further continued br br i will at the end of this my comment post some thoughts about the other movie <UNK> rather attempts of the robin hood legend br br first of all robert you are among us all you live forever br br nothing is as fun as the entire two if one wants three seasons of this absolutely unique series and at the same time absolutely <UNK> with the mostly new and revolutionary <UNK> of terry jones' history about egypt <UNK> rome the and <UNK> and the middle ages and <UNK> yes the <UNK> python terry jones br br if you have seen those brilliant and funny jones <UNK> you will better much better understand all the historical background stuff carpenter the writer of the robin of <UNK> series which happens to be the brother of john carpenter who made the thing their third brother makes music intended to tell us br br the writer of dick <UNK> <UNK> and the first two seasons of robin of <UNK> called <UNK> carpenter is my movie <UNK> he's better than all those others who criticize his sword and <UNK> element or taken from the robin of <UNK> of this series that i can not see or have other non criticism of which there existed a lot back then and still now br br that's why when you get to know this robin of <UNK> better you'll be severe you will at first <UNK> the third season not only that i did myself go thru this and on top of it i have only taken up the first two seasons into my deepest heart despite the fact that the actor of robin left this series because after the series had enormous success he was offered a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous canadian series called the new of jules <UNK> already the title reveals the <UNK> of the whole project went for money and not for fame he didn't stick with his gang and <UNK> i mean as actors br br actors who personally represent the afterwards really in our present time famous and legendary faces and characters of the robin legend the potential of this series could and should have been let <UNK> a lot more without any <UNK> <UNK> of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues br br again obligatory to say a change of the main role was forced by stupid decision of leaving robin of <UNK> for a silly remake series of the <UNK> tales and brilliantly woven into the filming of the story still it is in some aspects a catastrophe br br anyway if one is informed about this and that connery was maybe really advertised by his father but that the young connery did not at all chase away how i thought in the first place then one can absolutely enjoy the 3rd season sad here is that the script was not anymore written by superman <UNK> carpenter so we don't have anymore that critical and free thinking historical background like i e in the witch of or in the king's fool two episodes of the first series that is a funny b historically <UNK> and c brilliantly acted br br don't trust the lion br br unlike many other characters that wished him dead for the sake of their own gain of power richard <UNK> as shown in <UNK> and as in real history was a greater authority than john or others but used it only for his wicked idea of the <UNK> and the war against in france he slaughtered and had slaughtered much more than <UNK> of thousands of christians muslims and jews in the <UNK> and his soldiers even <UNK> the children they <UNK> out of <UNK> or poverty on top of that after his capture by the muslims in the <UNK> britain was <UNK> out for his <UNK> 100 000 marks at that time <UNK> century comparable to <UNK> 30 billion dollars of current value to get him safely back and then he just visited england for a month to return to in france where the norman <UNK> went first for the <UNK> one learns that in the episode the king's fool for this new <UNK> possibly kind of a revenge for his capture richard <UNK> again <UNK> the country of money <UNK> out of clive mouth when he <UNK> robin in being critical with even the king robin <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> he <UNK> richard himself telling him the poor gave everything to set you free how can you ask more of them richard give me your courage and strength not your words later in private richard orders the assassination of robin br br so the <UNK> were the real <UNK> br br p s already when i watched <UNK> in <UNK> i got upset because after <UNK> i found out in history course in school that richard was not that good just man as displayed by sean connery in his appearance at the end of prince of the thieves well as terry jones would put it it is a lie a <UNK> lie sean plays <UNK> and charismatic and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of robin of <UNK> br br again is according to my info up to now the one who left <UNK> for a stupid <UNK> series nobody with brains will ever remember or want to remember
<START> may contain spoilers this movie was the worst movie ever i couldn't even watch it all it was so bad this film is actually worse than scarecrow <UNK> which is saying a whole lot this was worse than terror <UNK> which at least terror <UNK> was funny at times not even the gore in the film was good the shootings were fake and the acting was worse please do yourself a favor and skip this one if you see it at the rental store then run the other way there is nothing good about this film at all if you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch night of the scarecrow or <UNK> head if you want to see an ok new cheesy movie then watch scarecrow i rate this movie a 0 2 out of 10 that's how horrible this film really is the worst movie ever
<START> honestly one of the worst written directed and acted movies i have ever seen seemed like a made for tv movie and a bad one at that i cannot believe that people are still hiring danny huston after seeing him in this movie or that they are still allowing john <UNK> to make films my husband and i came across this movie on tv one night and got so bored with it we ended up cleaning the house while it was on and it still bored us it made me think that critics have been so <UNK> with previous films such as lone star which was <UNK> about at he time but didn't really add up to much in the end spend your time on something better anything
<START> this was a pretty good movie that was overall done quite well the idea about mercy won't spoil was original also i think angelina did a good job as one of her first movies the only things i <UNK> upon were some of the corny fight scenes won't spoil either i liked the first movie and i liked this one as well 7 10
<START> delightful it never pretends to be a masterpiece but it's a mini gem of late seventies british comedy given that the producers wanted to sell it abroad it stars an american the late character actor richard jordan but at least he isn't the usual dull hollywood hunk type surrounding him is the cream of british character acting talent led by a wonderfully <UNK> and superior david niven br br <UNK> <UNK> the terrible naturally gets the best one liners and all the best reaction shots he also manages to be surprisingly menacing and dangerous the moment in the <UNK> club when he drops the charming <UNK> and threatens richard jordan will come as a shock to those viewers who think of niven as being only a light drawing room comedy star he is filled with genuine power and <UNK> as we see all at once how <UNK> earned his <UNK> all the more surprising given how ill niven was at the time shortly after filming this production he lost his powers of speech to <UNK> <UNK> known as lou <UNK> disease this is the last picture niven made where you can hear his own voice being dubbed thereafter by the comic <UNK> sid <UNK> br br alongside him you can spot numerous familiar faces from seventies cinema and television <UNK> <UNK> flashing her breasts in true seventies era politically incorrect bimbo mode oliver <UNK> michael brian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc etc <UNK> <UNK> gets one of the biggest laughs as he holds up a security guard caught making a phone call who you <UNK> bloody <UNK> a disc you <UNK> <UNK> br br great shots of london street locations making the film a period <UNK> time capsule of red phone boxes with <UNK> round <UNK> <UNK> black <UNK> driven by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and ladies and <UNK> <UNK> all manner of deeply dodgy late seventies retro <UNK> wear and hair styles br br unlike the classic ealing comedies of an earlier era the <UNK> is allowed to get away with his crime and escape to a life in the sun how times had changed the morality code by which crooks in films always had to be seen to be <UNK> had long gone by the seventies with anti heroes like <UNK> green <UNK> status through their <UNK> anti <UNK> and determination to a at a <UNK> <UNK> establishment of be suited fat cat <UNK> we are encouraged to cheer as <UNK> makes off <UNK> and free as a bird with his ill gotten <UNK> compare that to the ending of the <UNK> hill mob br br highly entertaining dated in its fashions and attitudes and the stuff of late night cult viewing perfect to watch at midnight after the <UNK> have shut if you're of a certain age are feeling a touch nostalgic and have always wanted to see david niven in a branch of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an american via the use of a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> as a long island independent film maker myself and having have had two theatrical releases under my producing directing belt i had always been told of how much i could learn by viewing a fred carpenter production so i was lucky enough to have his eddie monroe as my <UNK> to his superb <UNK> production casting settings and masterful directing talents my heart went out to it's characters it's story and was totally won over by the trick switch ending that brought the film's plot to <UNK> were <UNK> chosen and human emotions in it's characters brought a realistic link to my bonding with all the elements that mr carpenter <UNK> throughout to his and his film's benefit
<START> yes sure this is a friday the 13th rip off but i have no problem with it it's a good effort the killings aren't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie what a scream queen jennifer for a low budget movie the effects are nicely done okay sometimes you can guess how it is done some people have problems with the use of the camera i can't see what's wrong with that it's so strange that so many people dislike this movie i really enjoyed it of course the script isn't original but give me one that is i mean so many slashers are made in the woods maybe it is all predictable but it's a worth see i have seen a lot <UNK> i can tell you that
<START> there is nothing in this that the viewer could point to and call good the acting was dull and <UNK> the sets and cinematography look like they were developed by someone grew up in a <UNK> and tried to make the perfect gap commercial characters have no drive motivation or reason for us to care about them there's such a lack of interest and tension that it's hard to follow the banal action and dialog and the plot if anyone finds it i'm sure it would be as boring as everything else br br this isn't funny it's not romantic it doesn't reflect on the human condition if you want a good <UNK> comedy watch half baked if you want a good <UNK> drama watch <UNK> the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of one is because it's kind of fun seeing some familiar faces in the mid late 90's cast which is a shallow reason to give the film even one star but then again this is a shallow movie
<START> the story takes place on the streets of <UNK> in brazil where a young boy named <UNK> grows up alone without his parents left troubled and with no direction <UNK> gets taken into a child asylum with other <UNK> from the street behind closed doors terrible things occurs within the staff and within the child groups and there is one last trigger that gets the place blown up the last incident that makes <UNK> and his friends decide to break out and escape from there on begins a journey overwhelmed with strong <UNK> friendships friendships torn apart love and hate criminal activities and simply chilling on the beach talking about things something someone like you and i also does sometimes br br i think this film is perfect in so many ways because it touches you on so many levels it did that with me anyway the document like style used to portray <UNK> and his surroundings does it seem more realistic and the actors who really are street children and have lived similar lives helps the humanity in the conditions seem more natural it has a social comment about child abuse too but i think what makes the film so great is that the pressure is on the story and not on the political views the last scene which i find the best piece from the film strikes me as something beyond nothing i've seen before so full of emotions and yet so <UNK> makes this film a truthful believable unbearable unforgettable story tale a true heartbreaking masterpiece which is so underrated br br my vote 10 10
<START> br br to make this short and sweet i hope this movie will not be considered the <UNK> work for the <UNK> asian of american film making the acting was sub par relying on stereotypes raised voices and exaggerated eye <UNK> to convey its message chris chan park does not delve very deep into the any of his characters allowing them to remain caricatures of angry frustrated distant <UNK> <UNK> these depictions do not make characters mysteriously appealing it makes them confusing and unsympathetic i like to think that us <UNK> are more complex than that br br i came out of the movie <UNK> <UNK> that these characters had a life long blood brother like connection with each other to go to the <UNK> they did to help their buddy out <UNK> that the main character had anything beyond a superficial attraction to his girlfriend <UNK> that hard working immigrant parents wouldn't pay for their son's college education <UNK> that all of the characters were even necessary i e janet who is put to bed in the back of the car and quickly forgotten br br the story line which i actually think had potential was not allowed to come into its own for two reasons 1 flat characters for whom i had no sympathy <UNK> 2 the plot is overshadowed by meaningless non <UNK> scenes such as the <UNK> shop sequence with amy hill which was simply ridiculous and unnecessary br br i <UNK> park for his efforts as i'm sure it took a lot of hard work to even produce the film and i'll even give him the benefit of the doubt this time around as a rookie director screenwriter but i sincerely hope that next time around he'll go a little deeper just because the film is one of the first of its kind about the korean american experience doesn't mean it's automatically good
<START> written by brilliant tv writers <UNK> <UNK> and dee caruso which way to the front was the last of the jerry lewis movies until hardly working almost a decade later <UNK> comedy is evidently an acquired taste and admittedly he can occasionally be his own worst enemy when he <UNK> as producer director but even in the of his films there are always moments of brilliance br br which way manages to be amusing entertaining and yes quite funny it is somewhat unlike any of the typical lewis films the pace is very upbeat and <UNK> are lots of excellent supporting players a kind of jerry does heroes the whole thing looks kind of like an tv pilot and you will either love it or hate it but hopefully you <UNK> laugh
<START> i didn't watch this show that much when i was little and i think i only watched 1 episode which was about <UNK> i believe because i liked trains and still do even then i thought it was a baby show i mostly watched arthur the songs are pretty weird too and i don't think it's that educational either they just sing some dumb <UNK> <UNK> this is a dumb show any adults who like it are crazy if you want some good kids shows watch something like arthur mister rogers neighborhood or even better pee <UNK> <UNK> i thought <UNK> street was boring when i was little but even that is better than barney trust me this show is pretty dumb there are other kids shows that are better than this one i can see many of the reviews here that a lot of people don't like this show now there are some mature people i hope they take this show off air soon
<START> this is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts donald was an english businessman and amateur sailor who <UNK> in the sunday times golden globe race a single handed round the world <UNK> race br br i was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview from the producer john who is also the producer of touching the void one of the first documentaries that made a commercial success in 2003 i had gone to the cinema with great hope and not much previous knowledge on the historic event and i'm <UNK> that it didn't let me down for <UNK> minutes i was led through a haunting story and came out with much to think about br br without any <UNK> this film made great use of the limited audio and video archive footage they found and turned it into a compelling story which allowed the audience to understand from a personal level the story <UNK> itself as people who had direct <UNK> to the events including his wife and his son and the eventual winner also the only one who made it back out of the 9 <UNK> robin knox <UNK> gave their own accounts of what happened almost 40 years ago br br <UNK> <UNK> that he kept during the days at sea are so haunting that it made it much easier for me to come to understand what being in total isolation can do to a man while body was never found the other <UNK> <UNK> whose <UNK> <UNK> just weeks before claiming the prize for <UNK> passage committed suicide three years later after <UNK> attempts at properly <UNK> a br br everything could take its <UNK> especially the sea br br the director louise <UNK> was also at the q a session after the showing together with producer john i had no idea that it's a female director and that just came as a very nice surprise the film is getting a limited release in the uk a couple of days in certain cinemas catch it in cinema while you can unless you have a state of the art sound system that can recreate the sound of the bashing southern ocean then i'm sure they'll soon have it on dvds too
<START> i would watch this movie every time it was on cable and it never got old who can forget some of the best lines in film history <UNK> fat boy <UNK> <UNK> fat boy <UNK> and look between the giant <UNK> i used to wish i could run all over the city in a treasure hunt as fun as this it's an all time <UNK> and i'm happy to hear that it's out on video i'm positive that this is where mtv got its original premise for the road rules series
<START> watching this movie i can't help drawing the comparison between it and wild <UNK> another thoughtful film about teenagers coming of age br br like wild <UNK> this movie is slow and the director would not be <UNK> so if you want a quick resolution to things don't watch it this movie is like a slice of life beginning <UNK> and ending <UNK> there's no resolution to anything no happily ever after for anybody just like real life br br this movie is as real as it gets the acting is surprisingly good the director is fond of long really long shots and the actors and actresses <UNK> at showing subtlety and inner thoughts br br i love this movie i almost didn't watch it but now i'm very glad that i did it's not a movie for everyone but if you're willing to let it grow on you you will be rewarded br br 10 10
<START> this movie i watched back in 1981 when it came out although i missed the first part of the movie what i did see was great this movie is hard to find but if found you must see the acting is great very believable sad movie if i ever find me a copy i definitely will buy me a copy to treasure
<START> warning some spoilers br br matt a rich writer is in fact still just a boy in his behaviour he doesn't care about anyone's but his own needs and couldn't care less about the consequences of any of his actions just as he gets to know and her bonds with her and her he starts to feel that something is missing in his live br br he starts to realize that he is in fact lonely and stuck in <UNK> <UNK> that are just convenient but lack heart and commitment nevertheless he <UNK> away from any and is reluctant to change his live but will he be able to settle again in his old life and ignore the bonds he's already <UNK> formed br br situation is the absolute opposite she is pressed into the <UNK> of her community its prejudices and its medieval values being a single mother her position is difficult and it gets even worse when she falls in love with matt a white devil as the would say a man who cannot commit the women of the community plan to marry her to the to end her single status and give sammy a name but that would mean for to give up all independence and self determination but is there an alternative for her if she wants sammy to be accepted and herself to become a respected member of the community br br this movie has it all a very sensitive and sensual love story with very sexy scenes of matt and and an endearing child who is eagerly <UNK> a beautiful scenery in lively colours br br colin <UNK> <UNK> and long show a great chemistry it's just fantastic to watch them and roberts as sammy is just to die for you simply want to adopt him i just love the way sammy and matthew talk to each other they are both on the same level in many ways especially when sammy asks matt about sex this scene is absolutely adorable br br almost nothing to complain about wait that's not true one thing is not good that the movie is not long enough well and maybe that the is too bad and too silly to be convincing br br 10 of 10 by all means
<START> ok i'm normally pretty open minded about movies i can normally see a good side to a film which has been totally <UNK> by others this is an exception br br i won't waste to much energy telling you what happens but think along the lines of bill and ted meets the worst police academy movie out of all of them and you won't be far off br br the thing that really got me about this film was the stupid <UNK> racism that was evident throughout the general theme of latino black guys cool white guys lame is slightly amusing for the first couple of jokes but when the same joke has been <UNK> for the time not an by the way it gets both tiresome and offensive br br i spent months waiting for the laws of <UNK> to get back at john <UNK> for this film i had almost given up hope when the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were screened live in the uk what followed was mr <UNK> performing the rare feat of a comedian bombing on stage you'd have to be a complete <UNK> to laugh at him <UNK> ha ha ha
<START> i hate to be too critical but this one really was bad i like the baldwin brothers i just wish there was more talent <UNK> spread between them i did like the general plot but there was just too much and not enough actual as far as quality acting was concerned br br my favorite character out of the whole thing was bald cop he reminded me of jeremy roberts i believe from start trek 6 <UNK> country just without the hair br br if you have hollywood <UNK> <UNK> program and are really trying to get your <UNK> worth then through this in with one of the three <UNK> movies you pick up it's worth it for a few laughs br br the single most impressive special effect in the whole show is the sound of stephen <UNK> rifle firing i suppose that lets you in a bit on the quality and excitement of the rest of the show
<START> i saw this movie alone when i was an early teen in my hometown in india at a time when the only thing that fascinated me aside from girls were <UNK> i came home after watching it with a <UNK> look in my eye wanting to be that bloke in the movie that <UNK> the <UNK> what a movie and what a moment that was the theatre i saw it in does not exist any and has given way to a shopping mall i don't know how i'd feel about it now after so many years and do not want to spoil a childhood memory by finding this movie available on dvd or something similar and not finding it interesting anymore i have learned from previous experience that a childhood memory is often <UNK> when one travels life's jaded <UNK> occasionally trying to <UNK> their <UNK> past by way of movies only to find its <UNK> innocence completely <UNK> and not welcome anymore and i do not want to throw away the experiences of a memory of this movie into the wind i do not have kids so i probably am being selfish in leaving this movie in a <UNK> toned area of my brain not wanting it on dvd but if you are at a <UNK> age and want to <UNK> in later years memories of an endearing childhood try to watch this film if you can ever it'll be really worth it
<START> thus starts one crazy summer the evil twin of better off dead how can any movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by david lee roth br br this movie is a total blast pairing again john cusack with curtis armstrong but this time adding <UNK> to the mix has great funny results <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the nerve of everyone around curtis <UNK> <UNK> is the son of a deranged military with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> moore with natural breasts wow as the love interest of once again <UNK> depressed cusack br br the story is well simple enough the laughs are there but both savage steve holland films have a certain quality to them they are funny but they are also sweet the scene where curtis finds a blown up doll in the target practice beach and begins about how a little girl won't be able to sleep was dumb funny and touching the animation used throughout is quite surreal the boat is hysterical complete with u <UNK> and <UNK> doll overall a fun film though not as good as better off dead
<START> why does this piece of film have so many raving reviews br br this is amateurish unfunny and annoying br br the only memorable thing here is the corny title song br br the production values are low and the comedic if you want to call them that ideas are weak they seem like <UNK> of <UNK> from snl that even they would not dare to have put on the screen br br i'm beginning to thoroughly <UNK> imdb ratings br br this is light years away from kentucky fried movie not even in the same galaxy br br it's not even possible to write 10 lines about it br br ok another good thing ugly street scenes and ugly people something one doesn't get to see a lot in todays tv and movies
<START> a study in bad bad direction bad acting bad writing and f x teach you that better <UNK> your computer before filming it¬¥s the kind of flick you used to do totally drunk in your <UNK> with camera when you were young at heart but you certainly would not show it in public when <UNK> sober again would you you <UNK> even view it avoid at all costs
<START> spoilers ahead but that shouldn't matter since i hope you wont see this one anyway br br if you planned to see this one i have to strongly advice you not to because this was one of the most wasted <UNK> hours i've experienced br br first of all this is an complete rip off of the great movie battle <UNK> it is as stupid as watching any lame american tv show like cops or <UNK> camera br br the plot are totally predictable one <UNK> pregnant and another is a nurse anyone doing some logic thinking understands in the beginning what should happen between those br br the concept is ripped as mentioned before and the movie lacks the violence necessary of making this movie enjoyable i mean the <UNK> shoots a guy in the back and no blood or not even any trace of the hit in the back br br i could go on forever without finding anything good about it so take your money and get a copy of battle <UNK> instead of watching this piece of crap br br 1 out of 10 too bad i couldn't rate it lower almost makes scream 3 a masterpiece
<START> i was prepared to love where's <UNK> it features the <UNK> of normal <UNK> sitcom character actors who when i was growing up felt like extended members of my sized broken nuclear family how fun it would be to see <UNK> free <UNK> hughes vincent <UNK> ron <UNK> rob <UNK> and a pre snl <UNK> morris br br but alas where's <UNK> drags it's claustrophobic and plodding and breaks the <UNK> rules of farce <UNK> of mood and a fast pace br br the plot involves the efforts of a lawyer george segal to rid himself of his overbearing jewish mother who lives in his gigantic new york apartment along the way we are exposed ridiculous characters and situations a comedic group of <UNK> who repeatedly <UNK> the brother of the main character the rape of a policeman which involving a gorilla suit and subsequent gay love ruth pulling down <UNK> pants and biting his ass as he serves her dinner why doesn't this work part of the explanation is the sense of doom <UNK> by the <UNK> dark interiors and <UNK> set decoration i absolutely eat up cinematography of new york during this era but watching this movie felt like i was through the police <UNK> in a dark bus <UNK> br br the main reason though is the slow pace modern mtv style quick cuts have changed what <UNK> feel is a comfortable editing <UNK> but even taking this into consideration camera shots are held for an <UNK> long time plot developments are also very slow there is one situation in which this works a weird love song george segal sings to <UNK> van <UNK> very close to her face and for an excruciatingly long period of time it reminded me of those <UNK> extended shots in the british version of the office where you find yourself mentally begging the camera to cut away and at the same time you can't stop looking br br sadly most of the film is more hurry up than can't look away which made me wonder if it's possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce the dilemma is that the <UNK> of the subject matter in a black comedy tends to <UNK> down <UNK> of the farce movies like robert altman's m a s h and kubrick's dr <UNK> prove that it can be accomplished they do this not only through speed but also through entertaining subplots something where's <UNK> <UNK> br br although the film features multiple <UNK> funny characters almost all of them are directly involved in the central drama of how to deal with the mother the scenes featuring <UNK> morris and the central park <UNK> are as close as the viewer gets to a mental break the <UNK> seemed almost shakespearean following the tradition of comic <UNK> wells if the rest of where's <UNK> had <UNK> a little more closely to stage tradition it would have been a better film <UNK> isn't always better it's as if all these talented actors and the director carl <UNK> were taking a short before the creative <UNK> of the 70's br br random notes after ron clothes the <UNK> mention <UNK> <UNK> the naked prey 1966 a great action movie that was a <UNK> <UNK> to planet of the apes br br as politically incorrect as he was it's <UNK> to learn about the death of an action hero as <UNK> as <UNK> heston linda harrison who played <UNK> <UNK> mute mate said that james in the sequel seemed to be cute and tiny compared to heston
<START> i remember waiting to be born br br vision quest that was the american west br br we went to a psychic br br i'm sure their first reaction is that she's <UNK> br br the place is haunted br br i think there's another dimension right here br br an artist <UNK> and her husband many decades ago left the <UNK> and <UNK> and culture of new york and moved to a god <UNK> town with a population of 10 in death valley there they <UNK> a theater painting it is a very home <UNK> folk art manner and once finished she putting on dancing performances for practically no one in many ways it's highly reminiscent of the <UNK> <UNK> film or field of dreams though is a documentary of a real person not a mythical crazy man like <UNK> kinski or kevin <UNK> her husband eventually leaves much of it apparently because of the lifestyle she chose so today she lives on with her ten cats and a <UNK> for eventually along with her new male companion tom br br what you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives if you are into new age ideas and open to these sensibilities then you'll more likely appreciate the film her talking about how she remembers her birth ghosts vision <UNK> and <UNK> frankly made the psychology teacher in me cringe and this would definitely be the case for many people in addition her <UNK> and trying to <UNK> horses in the desert will most likely appeal to <UNK> and many other animal lovers though with my background in <UNK> concerns and <UNK> i see the and horses as a <UNK> that would destroy the native plants and animals so on two different accounts i tend to think quite the opposite of <UNK> who is more of a and <UNK> individual depending on how you feel about all this will definitely color your opinions and i am pretty sure most people will either think she's a genius or a nut you'll just have to guess what i think br br now despite all this the film is interesting and life is definitely not dull particularly since in recent years people have actually begun taking <UNK> to the desert to see her perform there is a definite following for her and her unusual little world while i would not be nearly as positive as most reviews i also can't be as negative as the one review as there is definite merit to this odd documentary i like films about unusual people and <UNK> certainly is unusual i also appreciate her love of her art and happy life that is a rare gift br br i teach psychology at an arts school and it sure would be interesting to show this to the staff where i am pretty sure we'd get a strong positive and negative reaction to the film probably depending on whether the teachers taught the arts classes or core <UNK> it sure would be interesting br br by the way and i am not trying to be sarcastic but when husband was having affairs with whom did this occur after all they lived in the middle of no where and i was left wondering where he'd find partners br br by the way if you'd like to see her perform and or stay at her hotel it can be found at www com the site is in english french and german and hotel rates are pretty reasonable as are ticket <UNK>
<START> several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film first the scenery and special effects are incredible the best and if everything else worked as well its <UNK> presence might have made it a great film br br but as soon as the actors open their mouths you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your <UNK> watching a movie the story itself is full of and melodrama and the dialogue is some of the worst i've ever seen and as if that weren't bad enough they made a fool out of the protagonist and in my experience you don't want to do that unless the film is a comedy br br bottom line i had a hard time getting into it and i wouldn't recommend it
<START> back in 1983 michael jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to make a 1 million horror music video with the american werewolf team and featuring the voice of vincent price then that was exactly what he was going to do and never has a music video created such a sensation before or since when it was released on vhs this 13 minute short became the world's largest selling musical of all time but odds are you already know all about it as whenever there's a list of the greatest music videos of all time this one almost <UNK> takes the top spot br br it begins with michael jackson walking down a dark street with his date after their car has broken down he explains to her that he's not like other men damn right and then the full moon appears from behind the clouds his girlfriend stands there and screams and screams and then screams some more during a lavish transformation sequence as michael jackson becomes a werewolf he chases her through the forest catches her and we cut to a movie theatre ah all of this is just occurring in a horror movie that michael jackson and his date are watching br br so we're five minutes in and still no sign of the song thriller <UNK> much anyway you must know how it goes from here dancing singing graveyard vincent price zombies what's the problem then end credits end credits for a <UNK> music video thriller isn't one of michael most memorable songs but even by today's standards it sure is a bitch of a visual experience if you still haven't seen it in it's entirety then you definitely should someday soon
<START> the worst movie i have ever seen i didn't even watch it all i just fast <UNK> it to <UNK> bits and then the end he is the only reason to watch this i have to admit to <UNK> a copy as i am a huge burt fan stop laughing and needed it for my collection i wouldn't care when this movie came out i had a nightmare renting <UNK> as my local store only had 2 copies and fans of all the various stars always beat me there imagine my disappointment when i sat down and watched this movie there are just no redeeming qualities about this movie absolutely nothing what so ever to like about this movie this movie became a running joke between myself and a mate <UNK> worst rob <UNK> worst worst hour and a half of my life
<START> <UNK> is one of the most unique films i've ever seen it is more to me a study of sound light and dark and movement than a real story the type of thing you see as a video at the museum of modern art than a film enjoyed at the local theater i'm not going to try to interpret the images of the mother nature the <UNK> in <UNK> the twisted and tortured body of her child some things just defy interpretation
<START> seems like a pretty innocent choice at first the name employee of the month might ring <UNK> with office space and the show office clerk i think not this isn't even a dark comedy the director of this movie whoever the guy's name was a complete jerk and has a sick perverse mind there is no pleasure in being <UNK> into feeling sorry for a complete loser who <UNK> on his wife steals from his top notch job and lies through his teeth 24 7 the second i walk in to the room when my family are watching it and believe me they were only watching it more because they were praying that there would be at least some relief perhaps even some fable in the end sending a warm message of good justice done and when the good guys look good all the good guys were killed so long ago that they had no time to look good no <UNK> was made br br this movie has borderline insanity it the elderly the dead and women and the director tries to make people to like it br br i gave this movie a two only because the soundtrack was good but not even that was all that memorable if you were lucky enough to not see this in theaters my friends do not do this at home
<START> this movie was very good i really enjoyed it tom performance was excellent and very believable as the <UNK> son edmund i also enjoyed the set design house and the costumes
<START> bridget fonda has disappointed me several times over the years but she had my attention in break up it's true the story is missing critical details in several places but i just kept fonda for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she didn't let me down the look in her eyes in the last scene as she <UNK> up courage to literally put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face acting ever i believed her completely possibly because i've known and admired several tough <UNK> who survived similar abusive situations and they did this without becoming man <UNK> but that's my own hopeful projection of <UNK> character at the break up
<START> he seems to be a control freak i have heard him comment on losing control of the show and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule no snakes he needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame the only reason i watch him is because he some some great guests and bands br br i watched the craig <UNK> show for a while but his show is even worse he likes to bull sh to burn time i don't think either man has much of a future in late night talk shows br br daily also has the annoying habit of sticking his tongue out to <UNK> his lips he must do this at least 10 times a show i do like the joe band carson daily needs to <UNK> up before it is too late
<START> i remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool i never got the chance to see it though when i went to blockbuster to rent some videos i figured i should watch it after all i did love silence of the <UNK> and <UNK> and if you enjoyed those movies you might get a kick out of the cell the whole story concept is very interesting going physically into the mind of a killer i can't imagine the world they live in the acting is actually pretty decent jennifer lopez is the only one i have to say that wasn't that great but she does a believable job i would recommend for a scary thriller br br 7 10
<START> this is the best thing burt reynolds ever did nice combination of suspense and humor with an excellent supporting cast this is a very well written and credible urban drama with a great sound track as well makes you wonder why reynolds doesn't direct more movies
<START> an old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere strikes him down dead and keeps driving the rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him why he was hit and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village separate lies is a very british movie indeed i'm not saying that hit and run car <UNK> are a particularly british phenomenon but the way everyone <UNK> to this tragedy is very british tom <UNK> plays james <UNK> a hard working respectable citizen with a stiff upper lip attitude towards tragedy his wife anne emily watson who is twenty years younger than her husband is more emotional more <UNK> and more prone to drama br br the man who really <UNK> up life in this sleepy village is playboy millionaire william played by a deliciously <UNK> rupert everett most american audiences will <UNK> remember him as julia <UNK> gay friend who completely stole every scene in my best friend's wedding in separate lies everett is cruel cold and selfish but he's an absolute blast on screen no it's not that exciting of a movie title separate lies ¬ñ how did they end up with that lame and forgettable title did they just not have a marketing team did they just now care about getting people to see this film but beyond the title is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness
<START> this comment may contain spoilers warning this does contain spoilers i have seen some pretty lame films in my day and that only stands to reason seeing as i see about 80 films a year i would have to say that out of those 80 films i see at the theater maybe 5 are really really good 15 or 20 are not that great 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible here on earth falls into a category <UNK> itself this is one of the most predictable <UNK> despicable films i have ever seen it is loaded with unlikable characters <UNK> situations about after school special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make the young and the restless look like american beauty and i am not being unfair this is an awful film br br this is the story of a rich guy a poor girl a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh <UNK> every day for all of it's town folk are you getting warm and fuzzy yet let me continue one day the rich <UNK> comes <UNK> into town with his new <UNK> present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at so he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together what this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see chris <UNK> with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him he has <UNK> oh and he is rich and he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone he is james dean he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn he is rude to everyone in town he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat but <UNK> <UNK> still falls for him there is no reason given as to why she does she just does oh <UNK> me that's right i forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does well if that doesn't get you wet then i don't know what will br br here on earth also has some of the most predictable moments i've ever been <UNK> to in film there was one point when i left the theater to get some popcorn and read the <UNK> on the wall of the bathroom and i told my fianc√©e exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes upon my return she just laughed and said i was right even when i said that there was going to be a dancing scene and furthermore the disease that she suddenly <UNK> is cancer this is the most beautiful cancer patient i have ever seen have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly they lose weight they lose their hair their <UNK> begin to <UNK> it is not a pretty picture <UNK> <UNK> after she <UNK> cancer like she is pregnant what an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease and how do you contract <UNK> cancer from falling down in the field br br now i realize i have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times but this is ridiculous there wasn't one thing to like about this film or the chris <UNK> character he is a jerk he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him here on earth is not only a bad film it is an irresponsible one this received a 4 2 on the imdb voting <UNK> and that is way too high this is an embarrassment to screen writing and whoever gave the green light to this being made should not only lose their job but he or she should have to promise never to step foot near a script again br br 0 out of 10 and that is being generous this film should be shown at film schools as how not to write and direct a film br br if you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow <UNK> or watching this film choose cleaning the cow <UNK> it'll smell better and you'll feel like you've done something good with your two hours
<START> blew my mind the first time i saw it and it's held up quite well over the years the sets and monster effects work are some of the best i've ever seen nobody i know seems to have seen this film which i believe <UNK> at the box office because of the lack of interest in horror in the early nineties it plays like a dark horrific fairy tale and is a lot deeper then you'd think with a strong message against <UNK> presented by a rich mystical past that clive barker created what sucks is the film ends on a really cool sequel note that we'll probably never see my only minor <UNK> is that craig <UNK> is only a passable actor at best and the the project might have <UNK> with a better actor in the part just a minor complaint though as <UNK> does alright i had a similar issue with scott <UNK> in <UNK> lord of <UNK> not really a terrible performance but i just didn't like him in the role as much as i would have other people
<START> robert <UNK> hanks is called to rome to help <UNK> the mystery behind the before a new science experiment blows up the city br br the da <UNK> code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of dan brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours seemed to bore many br br having read the book i was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed tom hanks and audrey <UNK> attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the <UNK> but for angels and demons the <UNK> were raised once more as lead star and director return br br having asked around most people seem to prefer angels and demons to the da <UNK> code for an entertaining read and it seems as <UNK> and fans whilst still not fully justified prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release br br this howard picture certainly has a more <UNK> energy and exercise to it as unlike da <UNK> tom <UNK> robert <UNK> has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten in the <UNK> and because of the time limitations the action and desperation up the <UNK> and deliver an excitement that certainly beats the da <UNK> code but also <UNK> plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences br br the interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders earth wind water and fire are all included in <UNK> and powerful sequences to <UNK> a feeling of overall power to the situation br br this really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over br br just like 3 years ago there are many <UNK> and <UNK> of symbols once believed to be lost forever and <UNK> is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other <UNK> circumstances br br it is fair to say dan brown is a complex writer he certainly likes to <UNK> issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences as well as trying to discover the there is also the scenario of the election of a new <UNK> the <UNK> with a new scientific experiment and the power of religion is again present all interesting to discover and listen to if occasionally the <UNK> and dialogue tend to send your mind <UNK> but as there is so much in the novel this was always likely br br ron howard who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in da <UNK> returns in perhaps the worst way possible his jerky ever moving camera <UNK> does nothing to keep the pressure up and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style he is certainly no paul <UNK> and this is by no means bourne br br slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than da <UNK>
<START> the idea of young girl who gets pregnant at the age of 16 is nothing new to the drama genre but it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre there is this basic plot of and <UNK> mother and daughter comes from a wealthy background got pregnant with 16 and ran away from her parents' house at 17 but this series does not start there it starts when <UNK> is 16 and everything is just about the problems of a single mother who has terrible problems with her parents and about all those problems you have when you are 16 br br okay now again this sounds pretty normal but there is this little thing called joke the <UNK> girls talk incredibly fast and they make like 60 jokes a minute even if you don't understand all of the jokes since they contain hundreds of references to films music <UNK> history literature and politics sometimes you even get confused but that really is the fun and not only it is fast it's smart and wonderfully sarcastic in addition to that it is not only funny it has great drama parts in it and you can take some lessons from it even home which is a thing that does not go for every single tv series br br so watch it it'll <UNK> your mood and help you through hard decisions
<START> i saw this turkey in the theater but i had a good time the special effects aren't worthy of a grade school production a toy boat representing a <UNK> moving at <UNK> <UNK> on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction the red and blue <UNK> <UNK> add that extra dramatic touch whatever <UNK> vincent price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work calling this a documentary is like calling britney spears a musician about 20 minutes into this something struck me as very funny maybe it was <UNK> overly dramatic <UNK> of the <UNK> used line they <UNK> into the devil's triangle cut to black next story once i started laughing my friends joined in next time <UNK> said the crucial line someone in the back <UNK> out good after that it got almost as many laughs as a marx brothers film nobody stayed for the dreadfully serious second feature <UNK> of the gods
<START> the jaws rip off is the <UNK> of the all the italian and director joe <UNK> is second only to the great jess franco in the trash film production stakes put the two together and what do you get a gigantic piece of trash of course unfortunately it's not trash in the good sense of the word either as deep blood delivers more in boredom than it does in hilarity to the film's credit it does actually attempt something <UNK> on a plot but to take said credit away from the film the plot is rubbish it has something to do with a group of friends taking of an <UNK> of friendship and then some indian curse that <UNK> itself into a shark or at least i think that's what was going on anyway the majority of the film is padded out with boring dialogue and <UNK> and the shark itself which lets not forget is the only thing we really want to see finds itself in merely a cameo role or not even that since most the shark is actually stock footage despite being a trash genre there are actually a lot of fun jaws rip offs but with this one joe <UNK> makes it clear that he couldn't be bothered to even try and the result is what must be the worst italian shark movie of all time avoid this <UNK>
<START> the first time i saw this film i wanted to like it for so many reasons but i simply did not it just seemed a little dull but there was a tiny question i had about something i saw near the beginning of the film so i watched it <UNK> and then finally it <UNK> for me i first watched the movie knowing the surprise ending and while i definitely wouldn't recommend having the ending spoiled for you i have still thoroughly enjoyed the bulk of the film and discovering the many seemingly insignificant events that all unravel to point to a very sinister scheme br br i don't think that everyone will love this movie or even like it if you like any of the actors you'll like this movie because the acting is fairly strong and they all get a lot of screen time if you like mysteries namely hitchcock you'll like this movie if you like independent or psychological films you'll like this movie it really worked for me on all of those levels if you don't like the actors mysterious plots or psychological elements you might not like this movie but that's your loss personally the only thing that <UNK> me a little was the accents good try alan <UNK> on the american <UNK> but it wasn't much improvement from the scene in die hard the wonderful voice makes up for the weird accent though the <UNK> of accents in the movie was a little odd but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly irritating also the camera change from scene to scene was evident and might bother some people but i actually think it added to the scenes or <UNK> i can really only recall one scene where the change was severely different but it worked br br when you see this movie see it at least twice the second time you see it i hope you realize how intricate the plot really is every time i watch this movie it's under an hour and a half so multiple viewings are not difficult i seem to notice something else about it and find myself wondering why did that just happen or was that intentional i like movies that make me think this one does so just see it twice
<START> obviously can be seen as just not another stupid animated movie that a studio might put out to simply survive it is far from it and it can be easily described as a captivating beautiful movie experience br br miyazaki has indeed another masterpiece now to many this has been said to be the least of his achievements in film making due to in part of his certain weirdness factor not being there that is true the morals and insights that are not quite so evident in his previous films are very up front in this picture is not too difficult to understand or comprehend his idea i believe was to make a children's movie that was just as suitable for adults as their kids and for it not to be too complicated he accomplished this perfectly and he also didn't lose any substance along the way which is the reason it gets a 10 br br besides that the film itself is so engrossing from the start and the way its presented is so beautiful it left me in awe at times because i remembered how they were all hand drawn by miyazaki himself i haven't been so <UNK> and happy after seeing a film since i saw once a while back another film not to be missed everything about was absolutely stunning and breathtaking even the music for it was pure perfection the only bad thing i have to say about it was its english dubbing don't get me wrong they were good too but i had seen about 2 weeks before it came out <UNK> and i believed that in some parts i wish it had kept some of its japanese dialogue not all of it though did enjoy the english way too all in all everyone should see it's absolutely flawless and in another league of film making altogether finally and don't hold me to this but i wouldn't be surprised if got a best picture nomination as there are now 10 films that can be nominated for it it's just that good
<START> a box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be <UNK> free but the cost is the life of someone they've never met this is a very tedious film to watch richard kelly who wrote and directed it decided to make a film without any payoff you are taken on a ride of slow build ups one after the other with minor revelations at best at certain moments i thought to myself this will have major significance at the end but nothing does the film just leaves one thinking this story could have been told in 30 minutes without all the stretched out nonsense i will hope you avoid this god awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so
<START> return to was a hard film to track down well i accomplished that mission and it had been sitting on the shelf for a good while wish it was kept that way first sam hell is of course not <UNK> <UNK> he is replaced by a dude with a large face less charisma and this poor actor is very soft spoken for the part sam hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome here he gets captured three times what kind of a hero is that is replaced as well here by another actress why did we not get different characters here this was stupid lou <UNK> stars in this film and he is not even the hero common sense says let lou be the hero of the film bad effects poor acting and just a forgettable film funny as they take shots at ninja <UNK> 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie at least ninja <UNK> 2 was funny and not a bad movie i really wanted to like return to but i just <UNK> when the fight scenes would <UNK> this film makes <UNK> 3 look like gold avoid this or you will be the one singing <UNK> <UNK> talking turtle tv dinner
<START> i have seen previous movies from <UNK> and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth having been an <UNK> student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad i know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time yes it is great fun because of that i thought i should not miss this movie unfortunately i was disappointed to find that fails to satisfy in many ways the characters are stereotyped the events are trite and the story is shallow although there are quite a few familiar situations they are <UNK> clich√© and do not go beyond the trivial events this made the movie uninteresting to watch and gave me a strong been there done that don't you have anything to add feeling apart from that the movie lacks a firm story it sometimes looks more like a documentary or <UNK> <UNK> show than a seriously made movie br br however i can imagine that if you haven't studied or <UNK> abroad this might be fun to watch
<START> i am in a vast minority here i also didn't much care for the original <UNK> aside from the chase murray duo scene and <UNK> rodney jokes okay break it down rodney vs jackie both jewish and have similar humor <UNK> a bigger name and more distinct jackie has an incidental and more <UNK> approach to his jokes and is more <UNK> in this sequel <UNK> attitude toward everything is memorable and in a way inspirational his quick lines and over confidence left me wishing i could express myself in such a way rodney was good but there wasn't enough of him and he was more <UNK> your <UNK> and <UNK> jackie in a rare film appearance makes a perfect sub for rodney come on a gun shaped hair <UNK> really look at the little things br br stack vs knight both play <UNK> <UNK> very well ted knight despite his wonderful tv film career kinda shows his age but he does pull off the <UNK> demands of the part and we want to see him fall ted looks kinda weak and is pretty annoying playing his anger and frustration too slapstick while stack is more incidentally <UNK> and vengeful you really hate him and enjoy see him constantly fail stack wins with me br br murray vs <UNK> well both had great vintage snl like scenes with the ever present and enjoyable chevy chase <UNK> <UNK> i did like the murray chase one better murray plays his great annoying <UNK> character with obvious <UNK> skill and is <UNK> yet annoying and the exact same can be said for <UNK> both get annoying after a while but it's a tie br br i really loved part 2 over the first they are 2 totally different films part one is more drug bathroom sex humor with a cast full of great names part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a it to the <UNK> type of comedy that makes one feel better about being working class 80s script yes a bit far fetched yes but wasn't the first an insult to the sport of golf yes it's a movie thin story yes it's a comedy with actual humor not with besides part 2 has a much better soundtrack please don't expect this to be a sequel to part one it is 98 its own movie and shouldn't even have the name in it that said i am a big fan of <UNK> 2 and it is a great <UNK> of 80s fluff entertainment with quality humor <UNK> jackie mason to all the <UNK> up it's a great comedy of its own randy quaid was wonderful jonathan silverman was wonderful heck everyone was all this <UNK> and now i feel like watching it i think i will
<START> this looks like one of these australian movies done by talented students and <UNK> by the government it is chock full of smart shots of colors and <UNK> and verbal <UNK> into <UNK> psychology to be appreciated by art students and teachers alike but in general it is perceived a stupid mockery of good cinema good storytelling and generally good taste this what happens i guess when art students become so <UNK> indulgent pink <UNK> is miles ahead one the same subjects some porn movies from 70s are far more watchable and inspiring book of revelation is not entirely without merits but as an overall experience it is well below average b grade
<START> don't get me wrong i love the tv series of league of gentlemen it was funny twisted and completely inspired i was looking forward to the movie the premise was interesting and i looked forward to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre storyline would take them br br it was a total disappointment for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bit parts for the other characters why not pick mickey pauline <UNK> or <UNK> and edward for the main parts it was unfunny throughout half baked gags and poor slapstick humour br br the real <UNK> was the plain ridiculous period drama comedy and i will use the word comedy loosely it distracted from the main storyline and felt awkward not to mention painfully unfunny the direction of the movie is appalling and often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within one take very rushed br br then the three headed <UNK> esquire monster what the hell was all that about plain ridiculous it felt like the league of gentlemen <UNK> it on at the end br br all in all i found myself looking at my watch and <UNK> with disappointment throughout my experience of the film what was once an amazing television series has been <UNK> by a terribly unfunny film br br if i could give it 0 out of 10 i would do not waste your money seeing this
<START> i couldn't stop laughing i caught this again on late night tv i suppose you think you're some kind of hero for bringing my daughter back alive no good br br haha
<START> utterly useless having been there done that with the subject matter i have to say this captures the <UNK> atmosphere in absolutely no respect it may have done so had the characters not just been <UNK> for incredibly dire unrealistic drivel so many cringe worthy scenes that would put the office to shame not a compliment to this film it also may have helped to have some semblance of a story a point a message a commentary anything seriously kevin perry go large had more to say on the subject than this film term used very loosely in this case there should be minus numbers reserved for films like this 10 extra turd
<START> what a bad movie the premise was all there the actors were all there and yet a believable plot good dialogue characters to relate to were somewhat missing br br typical heist gone wrong premise set against a backdrop of <UNK> being <UNK> by the system the lead character and his little brother have been having no luck and their house is going to be <UNK> along comes godfather matt dillon who does not look much older than so not exactly sure how that happened to the rescue with a plan to steal money from an <UNK> van which they work on as security guards has a brief <UNK> with a conscience but decides to go along with it and thus begins a truly awful hole ridden 30 minutes of unbelievable trash i will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic but let me point out the major ones br br because of deciding to be a good guy because a homeless guy became <UNK> damage all of his close friends including his godfather die his godfather who is supposedly family and the man who brought him into the caper at the last minute to help him out dies because of in the process of <UNK> his friends and godfather destroys all the money the money came from the same bank that was <UNK> his house and yet he chose it over the supposed family of matt dillon br br there are many more needless to say that this film was tripe and i <UNK> hope nobody else goes to see it
<START> a friend of mine showed me this film yesterday and i was really amazed that someone could make a movie this terrible br br mix the most awful clich√©d dialog with the most wooden acting you've ever seen with the <UNK> special effects know to man and you get this magnificent beast br br <UNK> is funnier than most comedies i've seen it really is awful br br i was in <UNK> during the scene where the ex cop vampire assassin character is having coffee with the internet journalist just watch it and you'll see what i mean br br i honestly can't believe that someone made this with serious intentions br br tragic but a really good laugh it has to be seen to be believed
<START> randy <UNK> john wayne comes upon the half way house at just the right time to take a break from the trail and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to ed rogers <UNK> of the establishment he's observed by the dead man's niece sally <UNK> vaughn from behind a hidden room where she remained <UNK> during the carnage br br randy rides alone was directed by harry <UNK> he uses a filming technique here as in other of his films where he fast <UNK> the action from one location to another usually involving a rider on a horse it's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930's era lone star westerns br br pre <UNK> george hayes is on hand sans <UNK> and this is the first time i've seen him as a villain in fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a <UNK> role first as <UNK> businessman matt the mute <UNK> via <UNK> and paper only to turn into marvin black leader of a gang of <UNK> <UNK> gang was responsible for the murders at half way house in an attempt to <UNK> sally into selling out to matt marvin another <UNK> player is here as well <UNK> <UNK> as a black henchman named spike interestingly <UNK> portrayed a villain named sam black in another <UNK> wayne <UNK> the arizona <UNK> br br there's a fair amount of time killing <UNK> riding back and forth between <UNK> gang and the <UNK> <UNK> as john wayne's character <UNK> to expose the bad guys in the end he saves the day by <UNK> sally <UNK> thirty thousand dollars at the expense of destroying the half way house where he <UNK> some sticks of dynamite for the <UNK> in a safe greedy marvin black attempts to open it with his six <UNK> and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain in his best <UNK> <UNK> attitude john wayne falls under the spell of the pretty sally rogers and alas randy rides alone no more
<START> i found the movie at my local video store and i was surprised to see it on dvd i had heard about the explicit sex scenes gruesome violence and the notorious <UNK> i sat and watched and i began laughing the set <UNK> and art direction was cheap and fake the nudity was <UNK> and incredibly <UNK> the story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors being held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written the incestuous relationship between <UNK> malcolm mcdowell and his <UNK> beautiful sister <UNK> <UNK> ann a vulnerable beauty can't be taken seriously it's not even shocking or repulsive peter o'toole and john were obviously held hostage during the making of this film luckily they die in the first thirty minutes of the film the cinematography was a joke and i was even more amused when they used a quote from the bible the book of mark no less if you are looking for shock value this movie will disappoint you if you are looking for camp cult value you will be even more disappointed i know i was i have seen shocking and this is two hours of your life you will never have back
<START> an art teacher comes across an <UNK> wooden bed made from trees and puts it in his apartment but it has a terrible history and he becomes hunted by a ancient spirit who <UNK> his human form by ripping the hearts out of people br br this beautifully crafted well actually it's more fantasy romance than anything else does raise some chills and provide some stunning visuals but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any sort of life problem was that i spent most of the time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button it sure would have <UNK> up the film's slow pacing but then again i wouldn't know about too much that was going on which was reasonably hard to figure out or keep interest in the first place the performances <UNK> from too melodramatic or just plain dull and that's probably because these characters are unconvincing stale and coma inducing the actual back story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and <UNK> put together with too much focus on a flimsy romance being laughable when it shouldn't be and overall it's constructed in an ordinary manner that just lacks the <UNK> or conviction to carry the film what <UNK> for the story's shortcomings are really arty images which looked grand but the use of some images had me somewhat <UNK> to what they actually mean towards the film what catches your eye is the faded colour scheme but sometimes the actual screen would look real grainy or snowy although from that it shows the raw intensity of the production but also add some nice polished effects that goes well with the <UNK> but sometimes edgy score the camera work was pretty diverse although it didn't add too much to the feature but during some of the more upbeat scenes there were too many close ups or dark lighting which made it hard to understand what you are seeing also on show are some nice moments of blood and gore but not overtly grand or <UNK> from most other films br br <UNK> odd film with <UNK> images that look like something out of a painting but still it isn't particularly <UNK> watch out it might put you in a deep <UNK>
<START> i was rather appalled to see the low rating this movie received here personally considering it fun family fare it revolves around a young teenager sandy who is sent by his mom to <UNK> key to spend the summer with his uncle porter while there he befriends a <UNK> named <UNK> lots of adventures ensue amid the predictable nephew uncle bonding as well as a little romance for sandy with a local girl br br i'm a great crocodile <UNK> fan myself so absolutely loved paul hogan in his role as <UNK> and comical uncle porter for starters he keeps an endless stock of spaghetti in his house to serve as his usual meal <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> wood <UNK> from the lord of the rings appeared quite competent playing the young sandy a boy at first none too fond of his forced summer vacation locale br br of course the <UNK> is magnificent and there are some wonderful underwater scenes set in the florida keys it was apparently filmed in the <UNK> this adaptation of <UNK> makes great family entertainment a sweet sentimental and fun movie that is infinitely superior to many of the cinematic offerings for youngsters nowadays
<START> i do not generally appreciate light weight attempts at creating <UNK> stories which means that anita no el cannot score very high for me the story is good a middle aged but still good looking woman finds a new love but the attempts at making this film as a romantic comedy only managed at times to be somewhat comical br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> las de <UNK> von <UNK> <UNK> and el de shanghai <UNK> however the powers that be have over the years <UNK> her out a lot of trivial stuff for the cinema and for tv something similar could be said of <UNK> perfectly able to produce serious performances <UNK> <UNK> belongs safely in this <UNK> br br such that in the end i was left with the feeling that i would be real pleased to see a new making of this film in a serious tone which would allow the actors to really show their performing skills and the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading actors wasted talent on a rather silly film that could have been very promising indeed
<START> hard to get in depth with this kind of stuff since there is absolutely no existing shred of even partial reason for watching it let alone expressing an opinion on it i don't know anything about this watched it for a laugh and stayed for the fake breasts apparently it's an <UNK> sequel to <UNK> <UNK> party massacre which i did enjoy as a fun slasher <UNK> massacre looks like a late <UNK> soft core <UNK> porno and not surprisingly chicks like <UNK> fritz and samantha phillips prolific t a actresses are in this plenty of <UNK> <UNK> and not much else a group of 20 something high school <UNK> two random guys and the fat stupid comic relief <UNK> become stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to stay the night the recently escaped <UNK> party killer is in the area and begins killing them off there's no gore or originality and i wouldn't say the nudity is a real selling point since this is just about as boring a slasher movie can be absolutely terrible
<START> the film is not for everyone some might think the acting is bad when it is actually understated and natural there are no obviously evil acts and there are no stunningly beautiful moments there is a lot of <UNK> an lot of <UNK> feelings br br actually this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject sex with <UNK> it is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and <UNK> are still developing and both of their minds and personalities are still developing complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with <UNK> and complex because the characters don't know if society is right or if their instincts are right br br some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship who was damaged did good come out of it was it art who was damaged more did some of the problems with their relationship <UNK> from it being forbidden by society did some of the problems <UNK> from their own <UNK> and probably most important was this truly a crime br br the film is <UNK> neutral on all of this and it is this <UNK> that is its strength it is the reason for the understated acting the simple sets the lack of background music soft lighting and the general flat presentation the message is clear we don't really understand this kind of relationship today and quick <UNK> are bound to be shallow
<START> with a cast of mostly lesser stars <UNK> <UNK> robert wagner eddie albert lousy special effects sure it was the 70's but alien and star wars came from the same decade and a storyline that is so laughable that one might want to cry this is a flight that should have been grounded br br even academy award winners <UNK> <UNK> and george kennedy can't keep this bird <UNK> br br the <UNK> of the third film airplane is <UNK> in the <UNK> triangle is much more believable than this turkey br br avoid the <UNK> at all costs
<START> this movie sucked the problem was not with the cast i think the cast was great lots of good talent lots of great acting but the script was terrible it seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which steve <UNK> could do his <UNK> and that is what he does best but it just didn't work here the script was hard to follow the story was non <UNK> and scenes were random and lacked direction also much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out it was a good effort but as max says they missed it by that much i am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the imdb obviously the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the imdb if you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users br br this movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work i loved steve <UNK> in anchor man and i like his comedy and style but i will tell you that i never once laughed while i was watching this movie yes i had a couple of light moments a couple of chuckles but no real laughs nothing that struck me at all br br spoiler alert one ridiculous scene was when max had his hands <UNK> on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape he uses his special swiss army knife but instead of just using the blade of the knife he tries to shoot the <UNK> with his <UNK> <UNK> and as the <UNK> miss fires and shoots little <UNK> into him over and over again almost putting out his eye max doesn't give up or try the blade instead no he just keeps shooting himself with the <UNK> what was he really expecting to do with that <UNK> it seemed to be the worst option on the knife to try to remove the <UNK> it just made absolutely no sense br br that is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie they were ridiculous poorly thought out poorly motivated and made of pure nonsense and that was truly distracting br br as i said this movie was a big let down and i recommend you avoid it a note to the imdb you should do something about these phony reviews that people are leaving it <UNK> the authenticity of the site
<START> fame was released in the u s a year before i was born i was too young to ever remember the original version of fame and yet i heard and read numerous things about it such as the fact that it <UNK> a tv series and that its soundtrack was led by the irene <UNK> <UNK> hit br br fame was arguably the first of its kind to portray and showcase the world of performing arts in the form of a feature length film the lives the struggles the <UNK> the students and some of the teachers <UNK> themselves were under the eye of the viewers br br the performances were great yet one which caught my eye in particular was gene anthony ray who played the <UNK> yet promising <UNK> angry frustrated and at first rude his character later became less angry and frustrated and more committed to his studies not just with the practical in the performing but in the <UNK> too irene <UNK> was good as <UNK> the scene with her taking her <UNK> off while some <UNK> director was filming her was rather <UNK> to watch as well as paul for his amazing portrayal of a vulnerable but <UNK> homosexual trying to cope with life and on a performing arts school in new york after he had been kicked out of the military when he told them he was gay ralph played by barry miller was interesting but at times his character did <UNK> on my nerves br br the choreography was excellent there were some good dance numbers involved and the <UNK> scene in the <UNK> was worth watching another scene that was great was when the song was played and all the kids started <UNK> out into the streets of new york and <UNK> wildly and without a care in the world it was a street jam like no other br br the only star to ever truly benefit from this in the long run was and is debbie allen she later became a producer director and star though she mostly worked behind the scenes on shows such as everybody hates chris and the fresh prince of <UNK> air paul later went on to star alongside peter <UNK> in the movie where he played a villain and e r as the <UNK> obnoxious doctor <UNK> br br british director alan parker shot this really well he allowed the performers to dance act sing to their hearts content without wanting to <UNK> with and affect their styles br br throughout the duration of the movie we see the various stages the students encounter during their 4 years from their <UNK> to <UNK> year all the way up to <UNK> in new <UNK> high school for the arts br br fame is one of those movies which <UNK> for or is aimed at a particular audience that isn't necessarily the general mainstream movie loving community it is definitely not for everyone br br i for one enjoyed it because i have an interest in the arts not technically in terms of being a performer because i am not one but as someone who <UNK> that creativity and artistic expression can be through hard work commitment and passion towards what one does with their talents therefore if you are an aspiring dancer actor or just someone who is creative you might be interested in a movie such as this though whether the events in fame are anything like what it is in a performing arts college school in real life then that is a completely different matter altogether br br the 2009 remake of this movie was released recently and frankly it virtually <UNK> by comparison br br as for the original fame almost 30 years on though yes it is a bit dated but it is still a great movie nonetheless br br it's not an outright classic but as a 80s cult classic in line with other 80s dance hit movies such as <UNK> and <UNK> fame hits the spot isn't it a coincidence that all those dance movies begin with the letter <UNK> br br gritty moving and intriguing this one is worth a watch
<START> i loved this movie br br movies and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose social political and other problems that affect the majority this movie served that purpose br br i identify with the plot and know people to whom this has happened at the time this movie was made concepts presented in this flick were advanced for the public yet had already happened to friends of mine by way of people in powerful positions and i know what it is like when people do to you what they did to angela bennett because they have done it to me br br i greatly enjoyed sandra <UNK> portrayal of angela bennett ruth marx she portrays a pretty intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up to overwhelming odds fight hard to keep her sanity and <UNK> her life and try to protect those whom she loves losing her self concept and <UNK> to that age old attempt to <UNK> a <UNK> self <UNK> by <UNK> in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality br br the climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind problem
<START> well this latest version of <UNK> park seemed to try and take the <UNK> of the 1999 theatrical version outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story unfortunately the result is a rather lackluster and <UNK> production and as with all the other versions of <UNK> park out there the character of <UNK> price is no where to be found instead there is a strangely child like <UNK> blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character at least in the 1999 movie the character they call <UNK> price is firmly established as rebellious <UNK> who is too clever for her own good this <UNK> price is a complete <UNK> someday i would really like to see a <UNK> of <UNK> park that actually includes a depiction of the character of <UNK> as she was written by jane austen a sweet kind compassionate girl with a <UNK> personality and <UNK> <UNK> she is reserved in manner and painfully honest but also strong in her <UNK> loyal extremely intelligent and remarkably <UNK> a bit of a late it is not until her <UNK> year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward adolescent to self possessed young woman and she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most it's a wonderfully complex character that i look forward to one day seeing <UNK> portrayed
<START> this movie is one of the worse examples of hype people who read imdb comments might be tempted to view this total waste of time as i was by false tag lines like a <UNK> to 80's horror and what not this movie sucks from the acting to the directing to the story horrible all across the board and i really like good horror films i am not at all a <UNK> this sucked for reference i loved the grudge 1 and 2 black sheep planet terror texas massacre the beginning the others the ring jason x <UNK> planet terror and really hated the ring 2 texas chainsaw massacre re make wolf creek the hills have eyes re make hostel 1 and 2 and this movie gore doesn't <UNK> fun or originality
<START> here is a film which clearly banks on being <UNK> as <UNK> to audiences unfamiliar with its subject matter br br an attempted hybrid of fiction and document clumsily falls in between the <UNK> as a documentary on the one hand it is neither accurate nor insightful to realize its sloppy handling of detail one needs to go no further than the opening scene where it is quite obvious that the ultra <UNK> protagonist does not know even so much as how to properly put on his more generally the tedious <UNK> style presentation of details in this case of jewish ultra <UNK> ritual is the role of a <UNK> not of a good documentary the latter should provide an <UNK> principle a if you will for the viewer so that she may emerge with a better understanding of the viewed this clearly does not happen here as ultra <UNK> ritual is being made even more enigmatic the director seems to have done a decent job explaining it all <UNK> during the film's release campaign <UNK> however this is a severe case of <UNK> as a fiction feature on the other hand it suffers from <UNK> of character simplicity of plot and <UNK> of message at some points i felt i was watching a cartoon e g the wedding night <UNK> scene without going in detail into angles positions and <UNK> well technically this could not possibly be a realistic portrayal of human sex savage as it may be br br there are no subtleties in this film the clever manipulation of hints stimulating the viewer's imagination and thought into taking an active part in the cinematic text which i believe is a mark of a good feature is completely absent on the contrary watching the movie i felt at times as being force fed again and again with the same already <UNK> up and way too obvious content it is indeed as director <UNK> himself put it in an interview an <UNK> shifting objects in space and then <UNK> the scenes with the appropriate emotions when called for and <UNK> the plot on its appropriate and predictable track but the spark that creative like dark spark let's not forget is supposedly a tragedy that which casts on a two dimensional screen the spell which turns it into an <UNK> of the viewers world is missing without a trace perhaps a work of a visual engineer perhaps of an <UNK> <UNK> definitely not of a true filmmaker what i saw was a passion play for animated issues rather than flesh blood and <UNK> real people the acting by and large failed to <UNK> this directorial <UNK> of an idea forced at times even tortured into film one notable though relatively minor exception was that of the lady and the mother both played by the excellent and seasoned <UNK> <UNK> br br it takes more than strict <UNK> to a winning formula namely a serving of <UNK> plus heart wrenching yet simple melodrama plus a popular agenda preferably politically correct to my interest <UNK> the bottom line here all being said is that for a considerable portion of the movie i was simply bored in spite of the novel perhaps even <UNK> achievement of using an ultra <UNK> neighborhood as a movie set for which mr <UNK> and his crew deserve all praise i found way too <UNK> for trite
<START> along with having minor flaws to it this film is a masterpiece and most definitely the best war film i've seen not the mention it's one of the best films i've seen in all genres i might have written this for no man's land before but now i think this one's better it's very sad in the ending and i almost cried after the two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes close to the film's final br br performance as the main character was fascinating although he's supposed to be a rookie considering his age this film makes you think a lot makes you cry or at least gets you close to it and makes you hate any kind of war and political <UNK> the flashbacks to the prison hospital make the film even more delicious br br one tiny flaw about the film is the non british accents of supposedly british people most of the british people on screen were actually british but how about the ones who are supposed to be british and speak with a foreign accent that really didn't fit into this adorable film but it's pretty much the only flaw i've noticed effects could also be a bit better but then again we all remember many films from one particular land that have tremendous fx and absolutely nothing else br br briefly this film is a total masterpiece and every single individual should see it if you want to travel to the <UNK> of 40's and if you want to virtually witness a tremendous amount of emotions at once this film is for you if you don't want to do those this film will make you want to do so
<START> as with all <UNK> films make your own decision don't be <UNK> by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends see it yourself isabelle <UNK> is stunning in this film combined with <UNK> these two never pull their punches <UNK> <UNK> us in with the lure of golden boy benoit but this is an anti romance as much as funny games was an anti thriller you'll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the <UNK> is much more in the range of <UNK> anxiety than any kind of emotional release but it's incredibly <UNK> and thought provoking <UNK> continues to hold up a mirror to how western civilization is or has become people may turn their <UNK> up at this but it's only taking what <UNK> did in happiness a few steps further while grounded in reality much of what erika <UNK> does can be viewed as emotional metaphor i'm not <UNK> it but i wouldn't <UNK> you either it definitely <UNK> people but given it's largely about <UNK> that's no surprise
<START> i saw at a preview showing a few days ago and found it to be a thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable film the film is about a not so successful american actress who goes to india to act in a low budget film only to find herself stranded there when she finds on arrival that the film's <UNK> has <UNK> along with the producers and <UNK> a chance encounter with an indian film shooting nearby leads her to be hired for a small dancer role in that since indian films <UNK> a significant amount of singing and dancing this is a problem for who has two left feet not to mention a personality so tightly wound up and <UNK> that she can hardly hear the music let alone feel it as <UNK> the choreographer of the film <UNK> her to do br br but <UNK> the word not the person means love and <UNK> the person not the word seems to <UNK> that emotion in the way he deals with all around him whether it be his production assistant friends who introduced to the shoot the <UNK> and arrogant leads of the film or the bitchy and uptight herself soon under his expert <UNK> and endearing treatment finds her feet literally and <UNK> br br i must say a word for those not familiar with the use of song and dance in indian films unlike american musicals the story progresses through these dance numbers as plot developments unfold and character <UNK> occur in parallel with the dancing it should also be pointed out that indian dance is about a lot more than mere movement an essential part of it is the <UNK> of the <UNK> feelings and emotions while telling the story of the dance this is the main purpose of the dance and the dancer br br that reaches this stage of accomplishment is demonstrated in a stunning dance number about <UNK> through when while performing the dance she is required to do for the film within the film also expresses her love for <UNK> it is an amazing performance by ali especially when one considers that she is not used to dancing in her films or <UNK> her character's feelings via dance it shows her skill as an actress as well as how much hard work she has put into the role br br of course no romantic film can work without a credible prince charming salman khan who plays the role of <UNK> fits the role to a t even when it turns out that he is a prince not so charming he does not lose the audience's sympathy salman has been <UNK> hindi cinema sometimes called bollywood for many years now and it is worth remembering that his first leading role was also as <UNK> he is completely charming sweet adorable sexy and vulnerable for those who have never encountered him on screen before be prepared to be hit with mega doses of sheer <UNK> he and ali make a lovely pair and are as well matched in their acting as in their appearance br br will they manage to work out their problems it doesn't seem possible as we hear the last song of the film a lovely <UNK> of fact and fantasy reality and metaphor the ending certainly took some of the audience i saw it with by surprise but they were left satisfied the songs are used very cleverly they are in hindi for the film within the film sequences and in english for other occasions but their meaning is always clear from the context and choreography br br is a very satisfying romantic comedy yes there is quite a bit of humor as well in it the indian locations and costumes give it a fairy tale quality <UNK> a story which can be <UNK> to a modern fairy tale br br if you are or have been curious about indian cinema but were <UNK> to try it this is an excellent introduction it captures the color and <UNK> of indian films not only in the costumes and jewelry which are quite impressive but also in the lively dances and world sound music br br if you are a fan of ali you should watch it for her excellent acting in portraying a selfish demanding high woman who nevertheless has an inner attraction that <UNK> the love of two men if you are a girl you will enjoy <UNK> lovely costumes and <UNK> her hunk of a leading man if you are a guy you can not only admire ali in her sexy costumes but learn from salman khan what it takes to bring out the loving heart even from someone as edgy as
<START> while traveling with a team of misses for the <UNK> of the miss galaxy the airplane <UNK> by <UNK> powers eric roberts and mike <UNK> charlie <UNK> crashes in an isolated where lays <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by the jurassic <UNK> while the group fight to survive alien apes plot to use the <UNK> to destroy the human race and dominate planet earth br br i like parodies but miss <UNK> is an offense to human brains the awful story and the special effects are very but really very bad there are spoofs with lost <UNK> jurassic park sixth sense titanic planet of the apes <UNK> of the lost <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perfect storm austin powers jaws mission impossible close encounters of the third kind star wars and hulk but the problem is that most of them are very silly and not funny in the end the trailer is better than the film my vote is four br br title brazil mission almost impossible
<START> i especially liked the ending of this movie i really felt what the characters must have felt which i think is a mark of good directing i was <UNK> with how the new hire at the record store turned out great character development there even though his role would probably be considered minor br br i was also impressed that the entire film while dark in its subject matter was free from gratuitous nudity profanity and violence sadness sexuality and darkness can all be <UNK> often better by what is left <UNK> but it seems that this is often unique to really classy films and actors kudos to the film maker for that
<START> i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews after seeing the trailer i thought what an unfunny movie full of clich√©s but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often don't portray the movie very well what a waste of time the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it i couldn't recall one single line that made me laugh the funniest parts of the movie were the <UNK> parodies but that also is pretty <UNK> i couldn't relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because i found them utterly stupid the plot is extremely predictable and <UNK> <UNK> comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally
<START> this movie really is that bad and i'm normally a sucker for bad movies but this was too much seeing this is like on pure suck now you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel you may have <UNK> through every title from full moon and troma all the movies of edward d wood jr uwe boll albert <UNK> and direct to dvd flicks from faded men of action you may even have seen death tunnel ghost lake and a vast array of the movies that mst3k covered but in their original form but you do not know truly awful film making until you have seen <UNK> and if you haven't you shouldn't don't bother not only is this movie amazingly poorly written directed shot edited acted and <UNK> in crude cheap <UNK> first of all it's a pretentious mess but not good <UNK> or lynch style pretentious or hilariously messy in an <UNK> or early waters sort of fashion it's the kind of <UNK> that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks they've come up with something incredibly smart sort of like m night <UNK> only that man seems like a <UNK> <UNK> when compared to this <UNK> and this coming from a rampant <UNK> it's also boring not heavy going type boring which is okay if the movie awards your patience <UNK> does no such thing it's boring in a oh my fu king god if i see another shot of a cat set to an obnoxious audio cue i am going to fu king kill myself kind of way br br btw anyone who claims to like this film is a liar and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bed
<START> director lead larry bishop tried way way too hard with hell ride the movie wants to be edgy witty provocative outlandish biting all of this seemingly in a quentin tarantino rob zombie style but it's not edgy the references seem forced the dialog tries to be clever and fails the humor is never funny nice try setting a gritty tone but we'd have to care about the characters or the story for it to remotely succeed br br what you're left with are cool <UNK> and pretty girls surrounding a bunch of tired old and out of shape bad boys in what looks like an attempt to do a <UNK> sergio <UNK> western if this movie can make newer generations interested in 60s and 70s films kudos for it but on its own it is rather boring and irrelevant i do believe there is a place for style over substance but this movie is not it
<START> random hearts is a very well directed well scripted and perfectly cast actors for the primary roles i found it to be so intense that you have to stop and wonder in almost every scene harrison and <UNK> are together how their characters deal with this horrible situation they find themselves in very talented acting from both of them a lot of people i believe who did not appreciate the movie for what it was did not get the point of the movie or could not even <UNK> a situation like theirs br br please skip this next part if you have not seen the movie yet br br i loved the ending which was a great surprise which tied the whole movie it was <UNK> to see how these two good persons can come out actually happier in the end br br
<START> generally speaking i don't make negative comments on here but since this is a festival piece i don't want you to waste your time when you could see something else that might not be playing again br br i thought the actors were pretty bad for instance they totally didn't play off each other rather they waited to <UNK> their lines which were pretty poor to begin with the dialogue sounded really forced norman or whatever his name tried or so it would appear to be witty and biting in the lines he chose but just fell really short br br after words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all <UNK> and he all but called them <UNK> look there were so many clues the biggest being a <UNK> full of cash for a 500 an hour whore i mean the john gave her at least tell tale sign now no you couldn't see exactly what was going to happen but by the time the twist actually occurred i for one didn't even care i was just glad to get out of there i asked him which draft he shot and he said 8 1 maybe next time he will wait to shoot <UNK> 15 3 cause this needed a lot of work br br but he seemed like a fairly nice guy he is making his own films he'll probably get better and i hope he does not in a <UNK> way either i mean it i wish him luck just remember this is just my opinion
<START> very <UNK> but ultimately harmless film version of the children's literary classic which <UNK> an animated portion in the style of mary <UNK> 1964 and <UNK> and <UNK> 1971 the human cast is very distinguished james mason <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> joan <UNK> bernard <UNK> but their roles range from the miscast a <UNK> year old mason as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> aristocrat to the bizarre <UNK> plays several <UNK> characters including a circus performer an old <UNK> a maid and a fairy for no apparent reason br br the animated segment of the film handled by a group of east european animators is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and as usual with this type of thing there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with one of which in particular is <UNK> far too often for its own good the film was directed by noted character actor <UNK> who had previously directed far more successfully other children's films namely the <UNK> children 1970 and the amazing mr 1972 which i've yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on <UNK> dvd by anchor bay uk
<START> this movie received a great write up in blockbusters <UNK> i was looking forward to the release date <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the plot sounds reasonable the cast alone should have guaranteed a side <UNK> but <UNK> there apart from the <UNK> the wall <UNK> this was quite a bore br br this will never become a comedy classic and i'm afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> now he was quite funny in a <UNK> <UNK> sort of way
<START> i saw this film when it first came out in the cinema we were all looking forward to seeing mark <UNK> <UNK> his career but we came out wishing we hadn't bothered many people walked out after about half an hour i wish i had too the basic premise seems okay but the plot was ridiculously involved and <UNK> and runs out half way through its completely <UNK> and not a film you want to have paid money to see if you're really bored and it's on tv then it'll help you kill a couple of hours or help you to nod off 2 10
<START> for many years ed <UNK> classic <UNK> <UNK> has been considered the worst film ever made forget it the roller blade seven is infinitely worse the cast is made up of famous peoples brothers and almost famous or has been actors and actresses the plot along with the budget and script are non existent the running time is made up not in the classic ed wood style of using stock footage instead there is endless slow motion and repeated action and as for the roller blade seven aren't even seven of them br br you must see this film just to know how bad film making can really be giving independent film makers everywhere hope
<START> i'm not a fan of this brand of comedy stereotyped characters over acting their way through a cops and robbers farce but there are enough likable characters to sustain interest michelle pfeiffer is adorable but the person really carrying the film is dean <UNK> who steals every scene as the head mobster named tony no less br br performance is the reason i'm writing this review and the only reason i'd recommend it in fact you'll be <UNK> by his screen time he's plays the mob boss perfectly with comedic touches in the right places managing to avoid becoming an overbearing cliche in fact a complete delight to watch a master of the take ' and a real in those classy suits and <UNK> br br says a good film to watch while <UNK> <UNK> or eating <UNK>
<START> this owes a great deal to the plot of <UNK> courageous although he is quite grown up it is partly the story of a wealthy <UNK> who is as a crew member aboard a <UNK> <UNK> and becomes a man in the process <UNK> of the title is a <UNK> young woman also brought up on a <UNK> owned by her father when the <UNK> burns she and crew members are <UNK> to our <UNK> ship however the captain has <UNK> on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where <UNK> is concerned the inevitable ensues our <UNK> falls for the <UNK> and she for him in the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united some interesting dialogue points out that <UNK> belongs to no man and no woman a nod to <UNK> here dorothy dalton is appropriately <UNK> as <UNK> and not too attractive either <UNK> does well in a romantic action role his sexy build and <UNK> are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a <UNK> one he is very appealing this is no great film but it passes the time what it really showcases is beauty and <UNK>
<START> imagine spending the summer without your family or friends from school and meeting new people or yet it's your first time where you're a nobody and the only person you can count on is somebody from camp <UNK> packs lots of comedy in this film in camp there's a eccentric <UNK> bill murray who knows how the boys and girls can have a good time enter a kid named <UNK> chris <UNK> who has no one to look up to he doesn't fit in with anyone only can make him have fun the rest of the can are just as crazy as camp is an average camp with an above average team one the other hand camp <UNK> is an elite camp that has them running for their money in the basketball game the got and in the <UNK> the <UNK> got the revenge they needed when one of the members take out the <UNK> and <UNK> harvey this poor soul can never get himself in gear if he tried a very very funny comedy and it's a big keeper i'll say this movie shows that camp can be fun if you wanted to be 5 stars
<START> excellent performance by mary kay place steve <UNK> <UNK> and johnson superb story that <UNK> you into the movie emotional yet light hearted i own this movie and everyone that i've shared it with loves it great for mixed company 18 crowd br br nice production not a cheap budget well organized and keeps your interest uses <UNK> newer ideas for flashbacks and at one point keeps the viewer at the edge of their seat br br no matter what walk of life a viewer is from they will buy in to one or more <UNK> in this film br br would love to see a sequel
<START> didn't really know what to expect from this movie and found myself being pleasantly surprised i picked it up because i recently stumbled across norman <UNK> and am trying to find more of the films that he's been in br br i'm not big into hustler movies or con movies but i have to say this one <UNK> me in within minutes probably because i couldn't quit figure out exactly who was <UNK> who this movie is stylish and fast paced with a story that is believable thanks to location and fantastic performances br br while i was impressed with most in the film i must say was simply excellent br br give it a chance it's a really fun film
<START> <UNK> is not a movie is a bad episode of a cheesy badly conceived soap opera br br the acting is not a bit better of that in soap operas i guess the writer and director has seen too many mexican soap operas and can't <UNK> anything remotely different br br give it up go back to your soap operas so that you have an audience to please br br stop <UNK> our time and money and giving a bad name to the once respectable mexican film industry br br it is not an ok or good movie it's a mediocre soap opera
<START> yet again not quite bad enough to make it enjoyable in fact this one is just boring it's reasonably well made even though the script is bad the effects are ok and the acting average apart from james mason who is always great but in this one underused br br i suppose it is hard to write anything about this film because it didn't evoke any reaction in me what so ever br br dull dull dull dull dull
<START> this is a poor caricature of <UNK> <UNK> and larry br br i love your books with <UNK> <UNK> among the top three i have admired the way you view yourself through your characters with such <UNK> honesty balanced by never taking it all too seriously i am therefore spoiled br br why have you come to this br br <UNK> moon is not up to your standards i see that you are credited with the screen writing but this is so unlike you i prefer to think it is written by someone else br br the dialogue makes me claustrophobic wishing someone would break out with a naturally stated sentence the part about was <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> because of the inane words coming out of his mouth br br well i miss call too br br the most important missing factors are gus and call and the men they are their matter of fact courage the underlying vein comprised of <UNK> and honesty their lack of self <UNK> hard men leading hard lives with a certain <UNK> grace br br some blame has to <UNK> to the <UNK> direction here and throughout all of the cast needed <UNK> and dialogue <UNK> br br while i try to imagine robert duvall as speaking this same dialogue it comes off better but not much it tries to sound cowboy of few words shy sly grin witty but doesn't half succeed br br how can it be so different from <UNK> <UNK> can the writer have forgotten his characters you have fooled some of the people mr but not this one
<START> alexandra <UNK> wrote a horrible sequel to margaret <UNK> masterpiece book published in the 1930's margaret <UNK> <UNK> sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra <UNK> to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara <UNK> romance novels i was a huge fan of margaret book and the fake sequel by alexandra <UNK> was written just to cash in for money br br although i always admired the acting talent of <UNK> kilmer and timothy dalton this is a really terrible film the script is horrible and full of clich√©s ann cameo as belle <UNK> is so awful i wanted to slap her br br the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful <UNK> performance as the sexy <UNK> villain lord <UNK> sean <UNK> performance is along the lines of the man you love to hate and portrays an <UNK> sex symbol br br but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an <UNK> boring script br br don't waste your money on this film unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance
<START> first of all i have nothing against christianity i believe every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses but i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this what a waste of money they'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries i don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this movie because i couldn't find any of those in this story's simple two <UNK> one a is <UNK> the other b for some sake has abandoned religion b <UNK> his confidence in religion and teaches a a lesson believe in christ or go to hell this message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie people do not believe the rating of this movie read reviews first i didn't and wasted an hour of my life ps why is it classified as sci fi because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky u f o <UNK> evil <UNK> that's a new one
<START> this is easily one of my favorite musicals of all time bette midler comes as close to real magic on screen as anyone has in her turn as gypsy lee's <UNK> <UNK> brave and very scary mother she evokes a sense of desperation that is at times both comic and tragic but always genuine and quite beautiful such charm and <UNK> she is indeed a <UNK> woman without a frontier that frontier is discovered for the children who in turn must <UNK> their own in a world ruled by their <UNK> mother br br this particular version is as i understand it in it's entirety including the brilliant choreography of <UNK> robbins as well as the original stage directions
<START> one has to be careful whom one tells about watching 12 hour long films it could become easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular <UNK> in fact even in the world of cinema such <UNK> running times are extremely rare for obvious reasons this is one thing that hollywood and art cinema share in common the generally accepted running time of 90 <UNK> minutes with a minority of movies that dare to approach but rarely <UNK> the three hour mark br br for this reason a film like out 1 runtime minutes is a challenge for even the most hardened <UNK> and it goes some way in explaining why it has only ever been screened on a handful of occasions and remains extremely hard to find br br originally <UNK> as a tv series by maverick <UNK> vague director jacques <UNK> it raised little interest from the french networks and wound up being given a brief theatrical run instead peter was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo documentary the war game although that had more to do with state censorship than issues with running time shown a couple of times in 1971 out 1 has re emerged at a handful of <UNK> <UNK> over the last two decades and many who have seen it including <UNK> us critic jonathan <UNK> have acclaimed it as one of the greatest films of all time br br is it well yes if you like <UNK> that alone is a big as jacques <UNK> has never been a <UNK> successful director only two of his films were hits celine and julie go <UNK> 1974 and la belle 1991 both superb and many remain difficult to find on dvd today out 1 only recently became available over the internet after a rare <UNK> was <UNK> nevertheless he is greatly respected within the film community and with good reason his <UNK> surreal <UNK> sense of pacing and use of <UNK> set him apart as one of <UNK> most unique and satisfying film makers br br out 1 deals with a theme that re occurs throughout <UNK> work the nature of acting particularly in the context of theatre and <UNK> his fascination with acting make <UNK> films a far more <UNK> process than many of his <UNK> as the <UNK> aspects allow actors to have a far more active role in <UNK> how the film comes together out 1 is roughly divided into four major <UNK> gradually <UNK> and <UNK> as the film develops two <UNK> of acting each trying to <UNK> post modern theatrical adaptations of plays the other two individual petty thieves played by <UNK> vague icons jean pierre <UNK> and juliet pursuing eccentric methods of making money and an <UNK> plot involving a mysterious <UNK> inspired conspiracy <UNK> around an <UNK> known as 'the br br as with any <UNK> film featuring a narrative the mysteries and secret <UNK> are little more than a red <UNK> as the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their plans and <UNK> connections break down the film becomes increasingly symbolic of post 1968 <UNK> and the decline of the ideals of that era for a film made in 1971 these were remarkably <UNK> themes another french director in jean <UNK> would tackle this topic equally <UNK> in his 1973 masterpiece the mother and the whore but this is not the limit of out <UNK> scope br br comprised of eight episodes of roughly 90 minutes each the beginning of each episode has a brief abstract black and white still montage of the events of the previous chapter out 1 is no less watchable than any quality tv series and may even be better experienced on a one episode at a time basis this is not to say that it doesn't remain challenging even when viewed in segments like most <UNK> films it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before <UNK> on the plot of sorts and some of those early scenes particularly the sequences depicting the actors' heavily <UNK> seem <UNK> long these scenes are important however not just as an exploration of the <UNK> acting methods that play both a literal and a <UNK> role in the film but as a method of <UNK> the viewer to the somewhat <UNK> pace of the film <UNK> long takes make long films far more tolerable for an audience and this understanding of pacing has led <UNK> along with more modern directors like michael <UNK> and <UNK> to create films with less commercial running times that nevertheless retain the capacity to leave viewers enthralled br br in a film that is in many ways about acting the acting is fantastic many famous <UNK> vague faces appear including the aforementioned <UNK> and the outstanding michel and <UNK> regular even another legendary director in eric rohmer has a great cameo as a <UNK> professor who appears in a pivotal scene the people and architecture of paris c 1971 though seem to have an equally significant role the city landscapes crowd scenes and interested <UNK> freeze out 1 in time a document of a place at a point in history br br after a little more than minutes the film ends on an <UNK> brief enigmatic note yet the <UNK> journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities <UNK> and <UNK> that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters for those who have watched many kinds of cinema and think they have seen everything the art form has to offer out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and <UNK> in so many more directions than current conventions allow for film makers film critics and artists of all <UNK> this is something to be <UNK>
<START> while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring star trek the final frontier is plain bad in this terrible sequel the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress <UNK> from the <UNK> that <UNK> representing earth <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> home world have been kidnapped by a <UNK> <UNK> bent on his quest to <UNK> a starship to venture into the great <UNK> there he hopes to find god using <UNK> and bad writing he <UNK> many of the senior officers of the enterprise to <UNK> kirk and get a hold of the ship they do reach the inside of the great <UNK> and find a planet where they do meet a god like alien this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin at the core is a good idea that is never really developed the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco the action scenes don't have the suspense of wrath of <UNK> the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner when he takes the director's chair the ego gets bigger most of the focus is on him spock and mccoy but does not give the others enough to do moreover whereas shatner is usually guilty of over acting in previous movies and television spots he is just plain bad in this one now kirk is reckless a practical <UNK> and silly one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song row row row your boat in a round by a <UNK> in any case this is the worst of the star trek franchise i should have given it three out of ten instead of five
<START> i love this show i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the season starts again i have followed this show since its pilot then all the way threw from where rusty starts college and <UNK> <UNK> his sister to now where he's dating dana love this show cant wait until monday night also i am so glad that and <UNK> finally got back together that was driving me crazy as for <UNK> and rebecca i hope they get back together which it just feels like they will by the finale i just looked it up about the main part of the cast and i am so shocked that <UNK> <UNK> spencer <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> daughter that just surprises me so much and the other thing that's a huge shocker is that she was born the same year as me and that she was born on my baby brother birth date with my year and i had been watching her the whole entire time and had no clue
<START> a killer john with a <UNK> for really bad <UNK> <UNK> wig on a white dude <UNK> around in his van looking for victims detective <UNK> james is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird again the <UNK> wig comes into play tracking the killer to his home <UNK> decides to set up a <UNK> <UNK> involving a female police psychologist br br inspired by the crimes of ted <UNK> before he was caught killer's delight is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick director jeremy has no idea how to pace a film or even make it suspenseful he does know how to show lots of close ups of the killer <UNK> his hands though the only thing this really has going for it is the captured 70s atmosphere look out for the bathroom <UNK> well that and a downbeat ending the media <UNK> <UNK> show dvd has lots of nice stuff though including an audio commentary by and plus video interviews trailers and an alternate opening
<START> i loved the gorgeous greek scenery but the story which is not something you can follow anyway was even harder to follow in the movie i cannot imagine how anyone watching the movie can get any kind of grip on it if they have not read the book and then like me they would probably wonder why australian allison turned into french anne and many other seemingly pointless changes in the story the mysteries in the book seemed to be chopped up or left out in the movie i saw it when it first came out and had the same problems with it then since i had read the book several times i recently watched it with my <UNK> very intelligent at 20 and usually into movies i like who was mostly amazed at how young michael caine and <UNK> <UNK> were in it but otherwise could not imagine why one would watch it except for the scenery
<START> continuing in the string of stalker slasher flicks in the vein of wolf creek hostel joy ride etc comes rest stop the most unoriginal and useless one of them all br br we start reasonably promising with the violent death of a pretty young girl in a filthy <UNK> br br this is where our interest is lost we then move to the clich√© road trip couple on their way to la with their eyes on acting stardom which doing movies like this they'll never achieve br br from the sexual romp in the park the couple drives arguing all the way to a deserted and disgusting rest area for the girl to use the bathroom harmless enough until she <UNK> and finds her boyfriend missing and realizes she's being stalked by a lame version of joy ride 's rusty nail only driving around in <UNK> from cars br br honestly if this had been directed written produced acted by anyone else it <UNK> been fairly good but no br br because then comes the ghost story <UNK> you guessed it plenty of oh i'll help you but wait you're dead to wait is this stalker a person monster or ghost br br but wait who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie that one brother excellent we're saved sarcasm oh wait no we're not br br you know if you want to laugh off a pretty bad or if you get free <UNK> like i do give it a try br br if anything you'll learn how not to make a movie br br <UNK>
<START> wow just wow never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert that somebody wrote one day in 20 minutes and then i happened to come upon lady frankenstein this movie takes everything you know about frankenstein and turns it completely upside down and not in a good way if you've seen this movie you either stumbled across it on italian tv or you have the dubbed version on the 50 chilling classics box set like i have as number 24 and lets just say there's a reason why these movies are here because they're not very good enough of that though onto the movie br br it starts out with dr frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant who's obviously not <UNK> for some reason his college graduate daughter shows up and states how she just <UNK> with a medical degree cause yeah there were so many female doctors back then so she states how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no and then he makes the monster and it kills him so she <UNK> for exactly 7 seconds and then makes up a story with the assistant how it was a <UNK> the monster escapes and goes on a rampage br br ok i really can't believe they killed dr frankenstein so early in the movie he dies like 20 minutes in and then his daughter takes over which doesn't make a whole lot of sense but sure br br so lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster who's now <UNK> is to make another monster oh yes how i love her logic so her new monster she gets the body by killing someone and putting the brain of the assistant in it i know just nod and go along with it so the monsters meet and duke it out i love how the assistant asks why don't we just let the <UNK> kill it and she answers with they wouldn't know how to kill it and in the end he kills it with an axe to the head haha oh yeah nobody else could have figured that one out so in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein the end br br this movie was just weird it was seriously like somebody wrote a self insert there's no other way to describe this movie there were some odd naked scenes too like this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend the monster picks up the girl and the guy drives away haha nice guy she then struggles a bit and dies from to be quite honest i really don't know what she died from but whatever it's lady frankenstein it doesn't have to make sense br br this movie had a lot of those why moments to the point that i just gave up movies shouldn't do that but for some reason i see that more than i probably should br br so final word it's not the worst movie i've seen on this pack but it's a tad boring and full of many many holes and random things br br so lady frankenstein gets 3 frankenstein porn scenes out of 10
<START> i accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels i immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast <UNK> <UNK> aside and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars having not seen the original i guessed it might be the <UNK> adventure since it was obviously on a ship in distress was i wrong i cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great or promising actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash there is no story the performances all looked forced the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event and start <UNK> about the real meaning of life at the level of <UNK> <UNK> philosophy br br it is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such <UNK> as sally field michael caine et al they must have needed the money badly can we blame the director
<START> i just saw this at the castro theatre in san francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive <UNK> little film it is a 75 minutes film that felt like <UNK> minutes and has about 20 minutes of <UNK> engaging material it's not bad in any offensive way it just repeats things that have been said many many times over and more interestingly and <UNK> with only a couple of exceptions the interviews <UNK> on and on and on making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic it's more like a how to guide for something that can't be done anymore i was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented
<START> this is a great off the wall romantic comedy about love work <UNK> to the public taste and <UNK> <UNK> the main character is a talented movie director who decides to make a silly pg 13 movie to get himself out of <UNK> with the irs it has an excellent cast a wide range of humor from deadpan to slapstick and fine writing it's also a <UNK> send up of the movie industry the includes several excellent cuts between reality and the movie that's being made and in some places the film <UNK> from strict realism the result is a multi dimensional masterpiece of <UNK> <UNK> humor
<START> director john <UNK> tense and frantic film tells the true story of christopher <UNK> and andrew lee two young men who sold united states government secrets to the soviet union in the early 1970's br br timothy <UNK> plays christopher <UNK> very competently he is a young man very <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> activities in allied australia sean penn as the <UNK> up drug running andrew lee is outstanding br br the competent and professional direction of <UNK> along with some very good acting make the <UNK> and the snowman an espionage thriller not to be missed br br <UNK> <UNK> 4 1992 video
<START> fortunately i haven't seen this film in a movie big screen just on a small screen on video i doubt that i would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film after watching the first 30 minutes i became both disappointed and curious br br disappointed because of the hard to follow story line the hardly understandable screens the huge amount of <UNK> i still don't know why i had been shown the main character pulling out raw the teeth of another person his on women him cutting out his tongue and also curious to see what will the film say as a conclusion what is the ending summary of all this brutality br br unfortunately though the movie was not boring i didn't get any answer to all these cruelty that i had to watch from the beginning to the end to my opinion if you want blood and want to laugh there is kill bill 1 2 if you want blood with more meaning you can take any recent war movie and if you want an eastern movie there are much better titles out there afterwards i will take the ratings from the cannes film festival with more as while <UNK> got a lot of praise from the jury it had not much to say to me and had only 4 10 on my scale br br i am hungry to see something beautiful <UNK> with true feelings and a clear message
<START> mexican <UNK> was the third entry in the aztec mummy series as you will soon find out this movie is anything but a classic instead it's more like a movie that deliberately tries to bore you br br some scientist wants to steal aztec treasure from a tomb but <UNK> that tomb is that walking toilet paper commercial the aztec mummy knowing he can't beat the mummy he then builds a robot and a very bad one at that we only get to see mr robot in the last reel as he <UNK> around and does battle with the aztec mummy br br i have seen a lot of lousy sci fi films hell most sci fi films i see are lousy but this one for it's entire duration of 64 is the worst movie i've seen with <UNK> coming in a close second br br in conclusion don't waste your time
<START> <UNK> since the warrior queen raised and slaughtered most of <UNK> family she has trained in the art of sword fighting now has taken a very powerful <UNK> that threatens to destroy the world if not destroyed killing <UNK> sister in the process now <UNK> is out for revenge and to save the world along the way she meets the very conan like but not conan no the child prince and his bodyguard <UNK> at first <UNK> <UNK> all help but is later forced to accept it and together they go to save the world br br comments when you watch a movie like this and you think that it is the story that the is the best element in this movie the movie is in big trouble because 1 a movie like this should draw its strength upon good <UNK> and effects and 2 the story is really really bad it is simple and <UNK> and really offers nothing in way of character development or even suspense it is predictable and boring and the obvious couple <UNK> and has no chemistry at all and the kid is just annoying and most of the scenes is drawn out so long that they become boring though the movie is not very long it has not material enough to fill its time and so back to point 1 the fighting is slow <UNK> and really bad it clearly shows most fighters clearly <UNK> the opponents <UNK> far ahead of the <UNK> has even begun to strike in my honest opinion i believe most kids fighting with sticks creates more exciting fights playing knights than this movie did all in all this is a really bad spin off that should be avoided by all who liked the conan movies br br 2 10
<START> i had the good fortune to be at island in the fall of 1959 the <UNK> showed one evening at the <UNK> theater directly in front of our <UNK> b co 1st 1st br br although we hadn't been there long enough to even think about seeing a movie we could hear those that were laughing it's one of the many <UNK> memories of my thirteen weeks at <UNK> br br at some later date i got to actually see it in a theater i'm still convinced that to date it remains the most realistic portrayal of the experience in the late 1950's ever done no one has done it better than jack <UNK>
<START> he's the only reason to see this film he gives a very good performance much better than this crap deserves he's very handsome and very talented he deserves better than this also depressing is to see malcolm mcdowell in this he's another talented actor who deserves better but like <UNK> he gives a very good performance so if you're fans of either of them you might want to watch otherwise stay away one more complaint couldn't we have had more scenes of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> on this site i've often <UNK> the americans for not knowing how to write comedy but while they've never produced anything of the quality of <UNK> or 'the fall and rise of <UNK> they have also never to my knowledge made anything as bad as this the <UNK> of british comedy br br on my <UNK> scale of comic awfulness it rates only behind the truly <UNK> <UNK> you being as the worst comedy show in the english language with bad acting annoying characters and humour that i'd grown out of before i left primary school unfortunately it was part of a large crop of shows back then along with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ain't half hot <UNK> and <UNK> that relied on ridiculous situations and familiar catch phrases to keep audiences amused br br michael crawford proved later on that he's a talented performer but personally i'd rather be sentenced to a month of watching than endure a single episode of this drivel which makes me ashamed to be british
<START> this film is completely underrated br br it's a film similar to will <UNK> and patrick waiting as well as <UNK> <UNK> restaurant and the classic film breaking away which are all about young adults who are stuck and know they're stuck with little or no chance of breaking free br br death by pizza delivered is about an intelligent free thinking artistic young adult will played by david who is stuck and waiting bitter at the world's <UNK> and bitter at his own lack of direction and desire will meets his nemesis reed ron <UNK> another intelligent young adult who's so bitter he's chosen the path of crime both end up helping each other to free themselves of their <UNK> which <UNK> them to get <UNK> br br for these young adults getting <UNK> or breaking free can mean both <UNK> ahead into life and <UNK> <UNK> into death br br <UNK> life is filled with the <UNK> of a young stuck adult a soul sucking <UNK> under paying job crude customers an ex girlfriend who left him because he was <UNK> a partial college education with no degree a house filled with self made art and of course the new friend whose <UNK> choices help him to save himself

anyone on earth has ever encountered she's also totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous it's a pitch meeting i'd have loved to have sat in on <UNK> from the british space

show to transport human souls from the london underground to their mother ship i loved every <UNK> insane moment in it's own truly unique way this might be the greatest film ever made br br the dvd offers the original <UNK> minute version that opened in the uk rather than the heavily edited 101 minute us version which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar but also fully <UNK> henry <UNK> score to its original glory the us version covered a lot of the gaps with additional <UNK> by michael <UNK> and james <UNK> although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight <UNK> cut his teeth on many of the classic universal sci fi horrors of the 50s and his score is quite superb with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from blake <UNK> sadly there's no more than a trailer by way of extras though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from <UNK> originally intended <UNK> minute cut from what's on display here these might just offer even more comedy gold
<START> i only rented this stinker because of its relatively high ratings it totally sucked i cannot imagine how anyone would think this a good movie even an ok movie none of the characters had any redeeming qualities of any kind to varying degrees they were each selfish and mean spirited or abused and damaged personalities who hadn't a clue about the spirit of christmas when this takes place i know <UNK> and like them but i cannot think that even they would think this a good movie i'd rather a sharp stick in the eye than watch this offensive movie again a <UNK> waste of time and money do not believe the person who wrote the opinion that it was worth watching this person probably would enjoy having a dentist <UNK> their teeth without <UNK> too don't mean to be <UNK> but for the life of me i cannot imagine what this person was thinking unless they had <UNK> motives maybe s he was the director or the producer if so i'd like to ask them to give me back my money if your money is important to you save it instead of renting this piece of <UNK> or rent something anything else i'm running out of good reasons not to rent this film if i were canadian i'd be ashamed that it's supposed to be a favorite canadian flick if so i would say that those who think so are definitely in need of great <UNK> of powerful drugs
<START> ok i have seen gordon lewis movies before but this one really takes the cake its really gory and gross not to mention disgusting the way the <UNK> are done in i'm talking bad acting that makes plan 9 from outer space look like hamlet the only saving grace is the late great <UNK> <UNK> as the strip club owner yeah take my wife please the are real sexy for 1972 i believe they used this same plot again in the roger corman movie stripped to kill in 1987 i did enjoy the earlier h g lewis flick 100 <UNK> which was a mini masterpiece of sorts but bad acting no awards here but be aware this is a splatter movie that <UNK> the way for friday the 13th and saw in one disturbing scene a half naked stripper has her butt <UNK> with a meat <UNK> ugh morbid stuff here h g lewis strikes again 2 out of 10
<START> black water co directed and written by david and andrew is very simple in its execution yet effective the film is a low budget australian movie that will unfortunately not get the recognition it deserves because as far as creature features go this is one of the best out there the setup is rather basic grace her husband adam and her younger sister lee are <UNK> some in the northern territory when a <UNK> crocodile <UNK> their boat and leaves them stranded in the trees the whole movie is about their survival while the crocodile is lurking below waiting to strike unlike greg rogue another killer croc movie released earlier in 2007 black water is not about the audience having fun guessing who's gonna be eaten next it is about hoping and praying that the three people will get out safely br br the three unknown actors do a great job with pretty demanding roles considering it was filmed on location with a real crocodile instead of cgi the characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced suspense is built up throughout the entire film we do not see a lot of the creature but just knowing it is near is terrifying enough this is edge of your seat stuff and highly recommended if you enjoy original and most importantly scary horror films br br 4 5
<START> from an artistic standpoint the movie fails to entertain or provide any moral resolution the plot is hard to follow if there is one at all the acting is tough to stomach the dialogue is cliche and clearly written by somebody who doesn't know english only the cinematography was worth watching in this movie although you can still see flaws in the picture br br as an asian american female the movie <UNK> me because it proved how narrow minded people can be politically speaking putting asian women in such <UNK> roles should be <UNK> <UNK> stereotypes of asian prostitutes is not only bad for the self <UNK> of asian women but also to the country as a whole i feel for the lead actress who played <UNK> and the exploitation she must have faced in playing such a role br br as americans please avoid this movie art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for one another not hold it back
<START> an unusual <UNK> western well worth watching despite a slow start the film builds ¬ñ with <UNK> any dialogue and no subtitles ¬ñ an increasingly involving and intense almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the western desert the growth of the lead characters is worth waiting for and the strong central cast bring a real sense of desperation to the struggle for <UNK> of the all important horse how interesting that this was made by a british director i hope he's smiling now i get the impression the film was largely ignored by <UNK> but time works its usual <UNK> and hidden gold shines out as it inevitably must one note <UNK> for me the <UNK> is only carried so far sam <UNK> as an indian granted he plays his part with real emotion and intensity but really couldn't one american indian actor be found to do the job but his scenes with caroline <UNK> have an <UNK> which <UNK> nicely with the immense landscape around them br br forget big <UNK> hollywood versions of the past men with big <UNK> and <UNK> music this one is all about a <UNK> struggle between protagonists who stripped of all the <UNK> of <UNK> life come to understand what is worth fighting for impressive
<START> this is an extraordinary film <UNK> it made me feel awful that <UNK> died in 1999 before i had a chance to see her live to know that she performed a marvelous lincoln concert in 1991 that i <UNK> been there but wasn't is painful beyond words br br i just purchased my first recording while the musical recording is fantastic being able in this film to see her face its tremendous <UNK> passion as she sings these songs of terrible sadness is wonderful sort of like seeing the face of mary as she <UNK> jesus in her arms in the watching her on film reminded me of being witness to a similar extraordinary concert performance by <UNK> <UNK> in the mid 1990s at lincoln as i sat listening to <UNK> sing i felt i was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual musical force that contained awesome primal power some of the art of 's musical segments are touching such as <UNK> paying tribute to singing one of her songs solo in front of a packed concert hall the musical segments also convey the incredible international <UNK> of her musical <UNK> the bonds she created w fans throughout the entire world there is one segment in which she claims that she has played in every single town in italy that has a stage br br in another section talks about her bout w mouth cancer how she came to nyc to commit suicide in a hotel yet through watching fred astaire film videos she gradually <UNK> herself that life was worth living turned away from killing herself amazing later in the film she quite <UNK> directly admits to the <UNK> that though she <UNK> <UNK> the world <UNK> her personal life was one of pure sadness she admits that she has never been happy this is <UNK> sad to hear but perfectly in keeping w a singer <UNK> in the which she <UNK> as bad destiny or bad luck tradition also one <UNK> to hear more about her personal life what was in that made her so sad what were her <UNK> br br the art of is a little disappointing in other major areas my <UNK> to show 20 30 full songs in the film yet to only provide an english translation for the very last one seems a waste unless the film was only intended for a portuguese speaking audience which i can't imagine to see the profound pain on her face as she sings not to understand the lyrics is a let down as for the other <UNK> there is almost no <UNK> material about family background there is one 20 <UNK> <UNK> w her singing w her mother it's absolutely grand there is one short reference to her parents moving <UNK> the countryside to <UNK> i would've loved to see film footage of the village she came from the interviews such as they are are almost solely w herself a few close friends she is a good but not great subject there are no interview subjects who are experts on or portuguese culture society so we get no depth of understanding of her musical roots br br in short this is a wonderful film that everyone interested in should see but it's not a perfect or definitive work on the subject
<START> this one isn't even lively enough to be fun something is out there ripping people off off screen after a spaceship crash off screen while government executives <UNK> off screen and bad actors says stupid lines on screen including a guy who looks like jim carrey with a <UNK> the monster when it finally is shown looks like an extra from robot monster but there ain't enough monster fu anyway br br fortunately it's pretty short skip it unless you want to get bored out of your skull by this
<START> if only disney had stayed away from it see i think that this movie has some potential well the main character's situation does at least take out the whole jordan <UNK> thing and you've got the <UNK> of a decent movie of course you also lose more than half of the film but oh well not that much of a loss br br so here it goes you take a typical <UNK> suburban teenage girl <UNK> <UNK> who's actually a decent actress whose best friends <UNK> a lot mostly over a pop sensation i'm assuming it's a direct quote from the movie movie's like this almost always involve that particular phrase named jordan <UNK> except of course wants more out of life enter brenda <UNK> character a sophisticated individual who is just what needs honestly i don't care what the character's real name is i like the <UNK> better the two new friends go to see jordan <UNK> one to <UNK> one to make fun of the and they come out of it with his cell phone <UNK> ensue and everything turns out alright in the end br br if only disney or any major film studio for that matter didn't have such a low opinion of 8 to 14 year olds or maybe if 8 to 14 year olds expected a little more out of the movies targeted at them it's sugar <UNK> crap like this that make me more than a little unsure who to be more disgusted with a little film called <UNK> school <UNK> comes to mind
<START> okay so maybe the acting wasn't bad but i am <UNK> this review as a public service to prevent anyone else who happens upon the intriguing beginning of this <UNK> from throwing away two hours of their life waiting for some plot development that will never come the chief investigator has a gut feeling who did away with the missing marine officer guy and few people other than <UNK> <UNK> and the seem to <UNK> her so what is the point of staying with this drama beats the heck out of me i kept thinking or hoping there would be some sort of plot twist or new revelation but none was <UNK> in summary i cannot think of a single reason to sit and watch this pointless tv movie based on a true story or not
<START> original movie lovers can actually love this show if they just stop complaining all the time br br the <UNK> new school brings up some old jokes from the movie like pulling the <UNK> to lab and <UNK> the episode but since it's a kids show it's just classic and is in their right places even though the style is much more simple the animation and characters keeps their personalities very well and it surprised me actually <UNK> <UNK> makes excellent voice acting for and j p does a wonderful job for voice instead of david spade who played in the movie great plots hilarious moments and amazing looks makes this show worth watching just stop complaining about everything
<START> great film about an american g i who <UNK> the army to marry a german girl who saved his life in the last days of the war she accepts but does she do it because she really likes him or because he can support her with easier access to food and such meanwhile her brother and an old friend form an anti american terrorist group called the werewolves their purpose to drive away the <UNK> you might remember the same group playing a major part in lars von <UNK> film europa <UNK> james best best known for his role as <UNK> p <UNK> in the 1980s television show the dukes of hazzard is shockingly excellent as the american he should have become a big movie star ¬ñ at this age he reminds me very much of warren beatty the other main actors are good as well <UNK> direction is quite good using a lot of long takes again although they are not nearly as complex as they were in park row the long takes more often than not consist of long scenes with a lot of dialogue the only problems lie in the script as seems to be the case with all of the fuller films that i've seen it's not too badly flawed but it ought to have been expanded <UNK> out major characters and parts of the script <UNK> the wife goes through a major change but completely off screen therefore the emotional center rests <UNK> on <UNK> shoulders fuller also should have killed off the sick mother early in the film i hope that doesn't sound too harsh she just doesn't really do anything throughout the film except lie in bed she has so few lines but fuller keeps bringing her up as the film goes on i would have had her death <UNK> david and relationship myself and the film ends too abruptly and it lacks payoff these aren't really the biggest flaws in the world the way i described them makes them sound bigger than they are 9 10
<START> this is one of four 1970s movies by tv writer lane <UNK> about <UNK> murders in small towns they feature likable tv personalities as police <UNK> and quirky characters as town <UNK> including light touch love interests the others are they only kill their masters james garner 1972 and the girl in the empty grave and deadly game both andy griffith 1977 br br <UNK> is set near <UNK> <UNK> angel next to horse creek the others in california <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> landing and <UNK> in the mountains <UNK> lake all try to capture the feel of a small town to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it on that level they are somewhat entertaining that they were often re run itself suggests they have some appeal but they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue slack pacing bland settings flat or exaggerated characters and off putting forced attempts often juvenile or crude at color or humor br br <UNK> and <UNK> are the most serious about story characters pacing and tone they have the best supporting casts though <UNK> is put to better use the griffith casts pale in comparison <UNK> has the best director br br shocking has some surprise and drama the killer's method is inventive the tone is more even and the dialogue more natural than in <UNK> <UNK> film does not suffer like the others from smug big city <UNK> to the town or from hokey exaggerated local characters both of which come across as <UNK> of a hollywood scriptwriter not as genuine the worst <UNK> is the griffith <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moron <UNK> who we are told tried to hook a <UNK> up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch dragged away the <UNK> for the police boat stole tomatoes from a <UNK> truck only to get nothing for them and filled out 11 on the <UNK> slip of t only to be discovered by the <UNK> mercifully absent is the clunky heavy handed repetitive style dialogue from the griffith movies you going to lunch i'm going to take out the boat you going to take the boat to lunch i'm not going to lunch you're not going to take the boat to lunch there aren't any fish in this lake why are you fishing here it's illegal in horse mountain it's posted here too you're breaking the law some law there aren't any fish in this lake then why are you fishing here i told you it's illegal in horse mountain please call me lloyd my name is lloyd okay lloyd call me lloyd that's my name my name is lloyd br br but <UNK> is too low key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small time police chief certainly not a red hot <UNK> in demand by a rival town <UNK> has the character admit as much when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue as a result of an accidental name recognition rather than <UNK> or investigate barnes strikes out <UNK> in emotional denial his secretary <UNK> <UNK> him a key clue why didn't i think of that he says an embarrassing funeral scene plus a plot <UNK> leads to another gift clue br br worse barnes is more interested in the military style <UNK> of the county police sent to help him deadly game also suggests <UNK> has something against the military than leading them or his own men effectively he allows a late murder by <UNK> <UNK> a known target barnes allows his car to be repeatedly <UNK> by the killer fleeing one crime scene without drawing his gun or trying to take control again he is <UNK> and nearly killed in the climactic scene which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially <UNK> by accident the <UNK> <UNK> accent that <UNK> affects does not help believability br br there are plot holes why would the killer strike after all these years and committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible but they are nothing compared to later ones a couple together a <UNK> in his store during business hours a fully <UNK> deputy <UNK> in his office and unbelievably his dog br br <UNK> movie also suffers from some offensive elements that <UNK> <UNK> into all the movies barnes first appears in a motel bed he then treats her <UNK> at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids this and talk about the female doctor <UNK> of a crude mean spirited pattern <UNK> film has been described as sleazy including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a <UNK> in the road had part of her <UNK> bitten off by a guy in the car with her <UNK> feature an <UNK> <UNK> routine in which the woman embarrassingly tries to <UNK> the man into the supply closet a gratuitous locker room type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman's car accident death did you take her out i took her in once a reference to bank <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> up in places and to sticking a pin in her and to hating and firing secretary <UNK> because she was too hairy a description of the female doctor's practice as two tables and a <UNK> a <UNK> scene in which <UNK> ryan <UNK> griffith offering some home grown and an insulting subplot in which a woman pursued by a deputy played as a <UNK> <UNK> seems to sleep around br br finally <UNK> film has a grim <UNK> out <UNK> lifeless look and feel only louise <UNK> adds spark at least the other films had some spirit scenery and pleasant music <UNK> got out onto the <UNK> onto the lake and even out into the big city you feel more like re watching masters or empty grave than shocking
<START> everything is <UNK> a young jewish american <UNK> for the woman that helped his grandfather escape nazi <UNK> while <UNK> on a cross european tour with some unlikely associates br br <UNK> <UNK> makes his directorial debut with a playful angst usually associated with his acting <UNK> when successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair we usually get a <UNK> glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask check we usually get a <UNK> of genres check but what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible intelligent and moving br br <UNK> wood plays jonathan an <UNK> young boy who <UNK> pieces of life as he goes he is on a mission to find a woman in a photograph the <UNK> picture bears his grandfather an uncanny resemblance to him and the woman to aid his journey he <UNK> the help of travel <UNK> that <UNK> of a hip hop loving break dancer alex eugene his <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> grandfather boris and his dog sammy davis junior jr what ensues is essentially a comedy there is an un <UNK> simple introduction with voice overs <UNK> is especially funny as he <UNK> his younger brother on the year 1969 proving how popular he is with the chicks and break dancing thus setting him up as <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> begins to break down the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as an intentional <UNK> to what is a story about three people linked to the holocaust who do not really know themselves all three hold the film with <UNK> and authenticity something <UNK> was unlikely to get wrong and as enchanting and <UNK> as the film is the horrors that are allowed to crack through i e the past are presented in an almost <UNK> tone incidental music cinematography which make them all the more unsettling br br as the unlikely group finally find the town they seek they learn of the true atrocities that occurred and find out a lot about who they really are br br <UNK> wood is as authentic as usual bringing his usual innocence and strength to the screen <UNK> a resident good in lord of the rings and a resident evil in sin city he plays jonathan with <UNK> as he is <UNK> with culture shocks and a quest for truth boris as the grandfather also delivers his angst and frustration at the <UNK> with great humour and conviction as his own past is <UNK> however it is eugene as alex that makes the show the director using that old trade of translation <UNK> to create and maintain a humour that is actually funny and not <UNK> br br <UNK> has delivered an enchanting debut that has both heart and soul the continuous score and beautiful photography creates a fairy tale <UNK> around a story about identity truth and family if there was a complaint it would be the speed at which the film changes direction though this could have been intentional it may not sit well with all nevertheless this is a sterling effort that delivers great comedy and bonding between an unlikely group while <UNK> another aspect of the horrors of world war 2 in a completely fresh fashion br br <UNK>
<START> born bad is a well put together crime drama about a group of teenage kids teens as well as young adults would find this movie well acted and entertaining the movie is similar to the black circle boys in the sense that a bunch of teenage boys go around their town making up their own rules and not caring about the consequences
<START> this movie did attempt to capture the naive <UNK> that many young <UNK> girls have for fun friendship escape danger sex maturity etc the problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level which is why it failed to build a decent story around them i couldn't follow the point of any part of this story nor any reason why i should care br br this movie is not an exploration into <UNK> at all it's basically about a girl being in love with her sister and her sister being in love with the idea of men while the latter tries out her love of men the former tries to win her sister back by getting even br br the plot is weak the characters are weak and the reality of it all was similar to an amateur porn filmmaker without the sexual substance
<START> since i'm from <UNK> one of the top ten or so <UNK> countries in the world it was much fun to watch how we use <UNK> from the <UNK> and live in <UNK> from the medieval times and since we have very strict laws when it comes to <UNK> it was fun to see how much guns there actually were in <UNK> during the five minutes of the shooting there mr direct to video even managed to bring his <UNK> on short notice so he must have powerful friends in the customs br br please do at least some research before going to an exotic country <UNK> you may hurt the feelings of old fans br br old fan with hurt feelings
<START> this movie was made only 48 years after the end of the civil war most likely in anticipation of the <UNK> <UNK> of the end of the war in the film there are <UNK> of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nation a <UNK> absurd and racist film because of this this short film would be excellent for use in the <UNK> to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to <UNK> as a drummer the boy makes good and is a hero though the film ends rather <UNK> a definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the over the top acting you often saw in other films of the day br br one annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time
<START> this film is about a young man's painful journey to discovering his sexuality br br the film is raw and <UNK> it does not rely on steamy sex scenes to attract the viewers though the plot may seem incoherent and <UNK> at times and some events are not properly explained i can understand it though because this film is a collection of memories that are highly personal to the director the subplot of about his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the film but i can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life br br the low budget of the film is clearly discernible it is a pity that the sound effects are poorly done the narration and some dialogs particularly the scene in the <UNK> with the french teacher have so much echo which makes it hard to make out what is said the <UNK> noise notable traffic noise is also captured throughout the film when a scene cuts into another the level of traffic noise changes br br this film is probably not entertaining but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young man's journey to <UNK> his sexuality
<START> although the concept of a <UNK> year old woman portraying a 12 year old girl might be a stretch for today's br br sophisticated audiences in the <UNK> this was what the fans of mary pickford desired and expected from their favorite star the opening scene displays <UNK> <UNK> character as the apparent leader of a multi ethnic street gang in comic battle with a rival group the sight of a young girl being in the jaw and kicked may be a bit crude but the scene is played in such an our gang fashion that it would be hard to take any of this seriously anyway annie can dish it out as well as take it once annie returns to her <UNK> home and <UNK> her street <UNK> with more <UNK> <UNK> it becomes more difficult especially in close ups to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street <UNK> however for those who can <UNK> the required suspension of disbelief the rest of the movie has it's <UNK> <UNK> between comedy <UNK> gang puts on a show to sentiment annie plans a birthday surprise for her irish policeman father to tragedy her father is killed on his birthday the film gives mary ample opportunity to display a range of emotions that would please her fans of any era br br of course the requisite happy ending is eventually achieved the <UNK> are <UNK> with the help of <UNK> friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her pals riding down a busy <UNK> on a sunny day which is a good a way as any for a mary pickford movie to end br br
<START> if this was nominated for a <UNK> award by the <UNK> a professional association of screenwriters then it's time to hang up the word <UNK> astonishingly inept writing direction production at every level even for a tv movie no cliche goes in this jaw <UNK> bad movie what were they thinking does anyone really believe kids are stupid enough to watch this
<START> please if you haven't attempted to sit through this garbage and are considering viewing this flick mini series do yourself a favor and find anything else to do <UNK> your teeth start learning to play the <UNK> beat your dog anything you choose will be time better spent than watching this junk this is not a bad movie that you can get a few chuckles out of it simply sucks in every way possible just boring from beginning to end br br and for those animal lovers out there that feel my comment above is <UNK> if your dog could speak he or she would beg for a beating rather than suffer through watching this mess
<START> this game requires stealth smart and a steady hand the <UNK> is simply the best on top of that though are the interesting extras bullet holes stay in the walls enemies react to specific points where they have been hit by bullets there are tons of motion captured animations that make the enemies seem very real for instance when looking through a window at a guard he will stand there flies away <UNK> or scratching himself the list goes on this is the best <UNK> movie <UNK> ever and it puts you in the shoes of the super spy this game is the best reason for <UNK> an <UNK>
<START> is an interesting film i personally love the dogma movement i wish it had lasted longer it seems to have already died many critics tried their to shut it down i don't know why it's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the french new wave besides i've seen the first three in the series <UNK> and <UNK> they were all great being a masterpiece in my opinion isn't up to those others i was just fascinated with the filmmaking it's played as if it were a real documentary with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down at a few points in the film it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction but that illusion was <UNK> for an amazing amount of time i wish that the filmmakers would have come up with something a bit more interesting to put <UNK> it is basically about this guy <UNK> who is an <UNK> visiting the islands were only in the last couple of months allowed onto the islands and <UNK> plans to <UNK> the women with <UNK> children he sets his eyes on one and most of the movie is spent on her seduction the two actors are very natural <UNK> only kind of hints that she is an actress <UNK> seems completely real the politics of the film are somewhat confusing to me since i have only an <UNK> of the situation surrounding the island and its recent history i was 3 i think when the were <UNK> the final bit of the film doesn't work at all i don't get what the filmmakers were going for there still is an interesting dogma experiment it does break some dogma rules though notably the no extra <UNK> music rule there is a lot of that 7 10
<START> hello again i have been thinking about this movie all my life i saw it when i was 5 years old in los angeles california in 1942 what a wonderful story of being good to one another kindness and charity you forget it is the bugs relating to one another it was just as if they were people i love this movie and so do my adult children such beautiful color in this movie i need to see this movie again there is a story about an <UNK> in the movie that i just can't remember the why of it br br thanks for listening
<START> this is a really amazing story and the most amazing part of it all is that it really <UNK> in case you haven't noticed it's based on a true story br br possible spoiler br br imagine the shock and horror of discovering that your own father was once a ss officer in <UNK> ii br br it's a very intriguing story and i'm really surprised the movie is rated a lousy 5 3 here on imdb com br br my rate 7
<START> robin williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him this may work if you buy into the u s a number one mentality but story wise nothing much happens quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something and says it sincerely it just doesn't pack enough emotional punch
<START> this movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate my <UNK> have watched it non stop since they've gotten it and as a result i've seen it nearly 4 times all the way through i can't get enough of it the cgi images are great to watch the humor is good and the ballet portrayals are excellent although the story line has a few holes no little girl will pick up on them and as an adult the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices just keep in mind that it is a <UNK> movie and though cheesy at times in my experience this one lives up to the high standard which the other <UNK> princess movies have set for it i would recommend this to anyone who has a little girl who has always wanted to be a princess it teaches a good lesson as well everyone is special and different in their own way and everyone can make a difference
<START> i saw this movie yesterday and can't stop thinking about it i moved to <UNK> four months ago and have tried ever since to find the origin of the strange <UNK> i felt when i saw this film i was <UNK> with the brilliant <UNK> of this society yes this is all true i too found a great job with a great pay and i live with my norwegian boyfriend in a nice apartment downtown but so far everyone i have met have left me with that tasteless empty feeling i had never had before this is what this movie is about dinner parties with nothing to say to each other but <UNK> comments long <UNK> no stress a creepy calm and frozen smiles of <UNK> this <UNK> nightmare is perfectly rendered in <UNK> see this movie
<START> simply beautiful one of the best mind <UNK> <UNK> in existence both <UNK> and <UNK> play their roles to the <UNK> in this tale of a <UNK> book writer who maybe has written a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> could learn a few things from the torture techniques in this film they could also do worse than hiring alan <UNK> five out of five stars and at present 1 20 2000 2 on my top 100 films of all time list
<START> i am surprised that there is confusion over the title of this film quite obviously it is an investigation into the nature of modern love it is suggesting that love is love while the going is good but one in which people <UNK> the right to put themselves first and if the going gets tough they get out and go onto something else br br this observation has <UNK> <UNK> as it is coming from generation x makes comment on generation x and in the end is aimed at generation x it expresses disappointment that love has transformed from that which the baby <UNK> the parents of generation x had <UNK> in their <UNK> and family lives and which gave generation x the innocent and <UNK> childhood it ultimately enjoyed br br the generation x attitude to love is of course <UNK> but as decisions are made and <UNK> are broken the biggest <UNK> are the children of generation x this is made clear at the end of the film and was so <UNK> i took a week to recover from the shock i received from this <UNK>
<START> spoilers br br oh sure it's based on <UNK> dick totally obsessed and it <UNK> him it's a total <UNK> the movie starts off rather well but by the end of the film everyone else is destroyed and the main <UNK> mind is a blank br br the supposed half sister is never convincing some very poor lighting effects music is interesting but little else it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing i suppose if you like being john <UNK> you might like this but where as <UNK> was a great movie that i just didn't want to watch again x is a movie i just hate to high hell the only possible excitement in the film is the incest sexual scene towards the end of the film hopefully <UNK> not thinking of catherine either br br this movie is severely boring depressing and poorly directed not highly recommended if if you like french movies go watch <UNK> rivers instead br br 4 10 br br quality 5 10 entertainment 1 10 <UNK> 0 10
<START> <UNK> the rest of the <UNK> world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous <UNK> to sell something weird locations too much makeup too much skin is not necessary sex does not always sell when you are selling to women the same goes for the horse <UNK> <UNK> walk that looks unnatural people come in all <UNK> <UNK> they need to have that on the show my daughter has a <UNK> is tall <UNK> a size 5 i am more average at a size 12 we would like to see both i can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it it will not fit the same way on me i do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter we would really love the show to consider women of all <UNK> thank you
<START> this is one of the few movies of this type i have reviewed and enjoyed while clint eastwood is his usual self the overall story works well even in the limits of washington d c br br the theme an assassin is tracking the president and there is only one person who may save him br br it cannot be easy to make a film which audiences enjoy these days involving this <UNK> this film succeeds on several levels eastwood is his usual <UNK> hero wanting to save the president since the kennedy era he does well in this role as does his foil russo an fbi agent overall well done and suspenseful with extra stars for <UNK> 9 10
<START> we open in a doctors room of some sort a girl is <UNK> to a seat across from the doctor he asks her questions silence follows he continues to ask questions ignoring the girls obvious <UNK> atmosphere br br the story is about two girls who are taken home after spending some time in a mental home after an <UNK> that happened before hand they are <UNK> on their arrival by their trying way too hard to be nice but so totally evil stepmother who the girls obviously hold <UNK> for as time goes on at home the evil stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls and to top it all off there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls' <UNK> br br this film is amazing it has twist turns and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense the relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming it almost makes you cry at some points i know i had a <UNK> moment of two specifically 'the <UNK> <UNK> but what i love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits the soundtrack is <UNK> the <UNK> in the house and the use of colour are fantastic a pure joy for the eyes this is a definite must see for all asian movie fanatics or any sort of movie fan an easy 10 10
<START> once i heard that the greatest and oldest <UNK> <UNK> heroic poem was transformed into a film it almost became my obsession to see it the first <UNK> of its appearance i caught never disappointed me a futuristic interpretation with <UNK> our favourite <UNK> and tomb <UNK> to be in leading roles <UNK> appealing though some doubts came to life an important female character in beowulf two hours ago i saw the film after i had read the director's name my world fell apart as i said from that point on there was not many surprises first and foremost the film has nothing to do with the original beowulf if we disregard a couple of violently and <UNK> stolen names if they had not stolen the names and <UNK> it to be a new story it might have passed as an f class action stupidity with nice costumes and <UNK> this way it is simply a crime an attack on a legend and its ideology as well as on common sense ok let me be positive for a second apart from the general <UNK> <UNK> atmosphere which is nice it also has good music that was it for both the positive part and this comment
<START> i saw this flick on the big screen as a kid and loved it and all recently i found a copy on video and checked it out again badly made sure <UNK> fun most definitely it still packs an entertaining punch it's much more fun than the dull disney version alive the only thing alive did better were the special effects if you're a lover of b movies i highly recommend survive not to mention all the other <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> movies and the mexican wrestling flicks made by his father <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> survive is long <UNK> for dvd special edition treatment are you listening all you kind folk at anchor bay
<START> this is a fun movie with subtle intention its off beat comedy is hilarious to me unfunny to my friends the soundtrack is perfect br br i own this on vhs and i have watched it many many times because it's simply a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the principals though using joan cusack solely as a <UNK> for big hair was a waste of her talent i know i know she was still young br br on a sad note i decided to check out the dvd last night instead of watching my vhs tape and was shocked to find many crucial scenes cut and on the copy i watched there was no special feature of deleted scenes it was as if the deleted scenes never existed i am so glad i bought the used vhs at a flea market br br it is clear there was a great deal of choreography in this which is another reason i love it so much it takes great skill talent and genius to move around the scenes like <UNK> <UNK> dean <UNK> and matthew <UNK> do from scene to scene note the scene when the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the rolling on the floor during the shoot out in miami the chicken <UNK> <UNK> the foot <UNK> the <UNK> hair <UNK> there is a very theatrical feel to this film which may be the turn off for so many whose poor reviews follow i know some viewers who don't quite understand this style mistake the <UNK> and over the top performances for poor acting and worse direction not so jonathan <UNK> does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles br br the opening credits and first scene rank among my all time favorites as well another favorite opening credits first scene fly away home br br too bad matthew <UNK> so <UNK> <UNK> out of the public eye i really like him and found his casting perfect in the role of mike smith actually this film is well cast from soup to nuts everyone is believable and true to his role as for the question of expecting audience to accept pfeiffer and <UNK> as italians why not i thought they pulled it off perfectly well br br charming fun exciting what is there not to like if you want a little fun watch this quirky colorful adventure mob love story if you are looking to learn more about organized crime and families tune to <UNK> the sopranos
<START> looking for a real super bad movie if you wanna have great fun don't hesitate and check this one br br <UNK> is incredibly bad but is also the best of this mediocrity br br
<START> the only reason i didn't <UNK> this movie after 20 min is because we already wasted 20 minutes on it br br the only and i repeat the only effect that they used is a weird from india jump on a half <UNK> wall trash <UNK> i mean effects doesn't make a movie but <UNK> me and my friend hoped the entire movie for some real effect a huge wolf something but all we got is a jump on a 0 5 <UNK> wall they used and they found guns in the <UNK> i mean what the hell oh i forgot there was another effect contact <UNK> as green eyes every 10 min we <UNK> the only thing that can save the movie from the disgrace is a giant wolf who kills them all besides that the script was so awful that you don't know who you would like to die first you actually pray and i mean pray that the good guy will die hopefully in the beginning br br make yourself a favour and send letters to <UNK> the movie from every <UNK> in the world
<START> from the film's first shot <UNK> knightley as elizabeth <UNK> wandering reading through a field at dawn thus <UNK> all the clich√©s cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong minded rebellious female character in period drama i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself br br joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the <UNK> <UNK> that what he was filming was not in fact jane <UNK> subtle nuanced comedy of manners <UNK> through <UNK> delicate social interaction in <UNK> century english drawing rooms but a sort of u <UNK> <UNK> heights thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and <UNK> taking place outside for no apparent reason in <UNK> rugged scenery and often in the <UNK> rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular p p is not about passion sexual tension or love it's about different <UNK> of <UNK> the of <UNK> century society which was completely ignored so that the house was a <UNK> chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on <UNK> and pigs wander happily through the house the society balls become <UNK> country dances one step away from a matrix <UNK> style dance orgy and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for <UNK> br br the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for <UNK> and the tragic <UNK> of her characters <UNK> from <UNK> and <UNK> by that speechless gap so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots particularly in this film to function was completely <UNK> subtlety in general was nowhere <UNK> his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which <UNK> entirely with the material and the performances br br it was so obviously trying to be a serious film the humour which is pride prejudice both <UNK> <UNK> and her appeal was almost entirely <UNK> in favour of all this <UNK> faced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily pride prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and <UNK> themes are not just <UNK> with the humour they are <UNK> in it you can't lose jane <UNK> technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy handed mystical <UNK> cinematography br br elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman an adult mature and sensible and clear <UNK> <UNK> knightley played the first half of the film like an empty headed <UNK> <UNK> and the second half like an empty headed <UNK> who thinks she is a tragic heroine <UNK> wit her <UNK> verbal <UNK> her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody's <UNK> including her own her strength and <UNK> and her fantastic clear <UNK> were completely lost and replaced with what a lot of <UNK> and staring into the distance rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest <UNK> and not genuinely raging either no these were <UNK> <UNK> fits and where the great strength of <UNK> elizabeth at least in <UNK> eyes was her ability to retain integrity and <UNK> while remaining within the boundaries of society and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around <UNK> in the mud in the <UNK> century version of <UNK> established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong minded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it an astonishingly <UNK> and bland performance in which quest for <UNK> and weakness she was <UNK> matched by matthew br br donald sutherland as mr <UNK> seemed weak <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> without the wicked sense of humour and ironic <UNK> at the expense of human relationships that makes mr <UNK> so fascinating and tragic his special bond with <UNK> as the only two sensible people in a world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools and that completely <UNK> the end of the film of emotional impact mr was no longer <UNK> and well meaning to the point of <UNK> but was played as a complete <UNK> for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all the script <UNK> wildly between <UNK> <UNK> of jane austen delivered with remarkable <UNK> and totally <UNK> language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy br br just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the <UNK>
<START> a group of teens have their car break down in the middle of nowhere they seek shelter in a <UNK> but three murderous <UNK> are there killing the owner of said <UNK> and his family one of them accidentally brings zombies around by knocking over a scarecrow cue blood gore carnage bad acting better than the first but only by <UNK> i still wouldn't wish it on my arch enemy bob in the end the filmmaker wants it to be a <UNK> about how we us americans are killing and our <UNK> huh ok whatever buddy dude i'd rather chop down <UNK> then have my <UNK> <UNK> and my grey matter <UNK> out of my ears in other words become a simple minded idiot liberal br br my grade d
<START> this is indeed one of the weakest films based on agatha <UNK> work a lifeless muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace and the budget of its predecessors death on the <UNK> evil under the sun and donald sutherland is a pale shadow of peter ustinov as far as screen detectives go of course he is playing a character much less interesting than <UNK> the film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of <UNK> plot alone all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest but the direction is hopelessly flat 1 2
<START> this is a truly awful movie the jokes are few and far between and the pacing is a down right <UNK> test the only thing funny to come out of this production is it's comparison to the classic film this is spinal tap br br avoid this film as if it were one of the <UNK> of the bible itself br br
<START> even in her glasses wearing geek mode kathy ireland is very easy on the eyes but her acting is not easy to watch most of the actors in the film either take it way over the top beyond campy fun or act slightly embarrassed at being there the effects and soundtrack are nothing special and fairly low budget the plot line really stretches ones ability to suspend disbelief catch this one to laugh at if it comes on a <UNK> movie channel or network saturday afternoon tv but do not <UNK> money on this thing br br one worthy mention for trivia purposes is that one of the underground <UNK> is played by deep roy deep is now famous for playing and doing it well all the in <UNK> charlie and the chocolate factory
<START> if you're actually reading this review i give you a lot of credit you care enough to actually look up this movie which most people have forgotten about and then cared to read beyond the first review so for your reading pleasure br br i'm assuming you know the plot line already so i won't waste time <UNK> that out i will mention that sandra <UNK> did an amazing job with this movie she really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of a computer <UNK> often difficult to do i can say this because i happen to be a computer <UNK> br br anyway i thought the basic plot was a very good one you can easily build sub plots upon its <UNK> and turn it into a very enjoyable movie the premise is also <UNK> realistic in that this can all really happen if the right aren't taken br br to make a long review short <UNK> too late if you enjoy sandra <UNK> bringing a role to life and want to see a very well made movie for the time take a look at this little gem you won't be disappointed
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is where the sequel mediocrity of the <UNK> series well and truly sets in gone is the imagination and invention of the first two movies gone is the <UNK> of <UNK> and his <UNK> gone are the sick desires of humans in fact everything that once made <UNK> so original has been <UNK> by this mess of a picture br br all that is left is that basic premise of christian mythology that there is a hell with evil demons what happened to the evil that men do this watered down excuse for a <UNK> movie is padded out with endless psycho <UNK> so that <UNK> becomes a nonsense <UNK> <UNK> and not the <UNK> of doom as he is meant to be br br the film uses the most basic of film <UNK> with characters <UNK> and getting <UNK> killed <UNK> is not alien the link between the box and the <UNK> or is never established it just arrives at a sacrifice and sits on a br br the lead female character is called and the producers obviously think it really funny because everyone keep saying her name really the film should have been <UNK> to give it that characters name br br shame on you kevin and alan <UNK>
<START> unfortunately due to a <UNK> start i can't say that this is one of <UNK> best films it very excellent none the less the film stars jimmy stewart and doris day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back they both give excellent performances not surprising of course really however i was most impressed with <UNK> amazing use of music the climax at the opera house was fantastic and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene also the use of doris day singing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was excellent especially when it is <UNK> on scenes at the end of the film so this film to me ends up being <UNK> best use of music that i have seen to date unfortunately it had a slow start or i could have recommend this film a little more highly even then it is still well worth a look 8 out of 10
<START> the movie forever strong will never be nominated for an oscar it will never be nominated for best acting for best motion picture but this movie does have things that other movies don't in a nation with so much scandal so many problems movies being <UNK> out with little thought to the morals of society at least this movie <UNK> good what is wrong with standing behind something that <UNK> happiness we should support movies that tell our american teens that there is more to life than sex drugs and alcohol as for this debate as previously stated the is not <UNK> to the new zealand all blacks various <UNK> high school football teams and <UNK> perform this ritual before games including hawaii <UNK> etc
<START> <UNK> is a masterpiece the storyline is amazingly depicted the characters beautifully animated and the weapons are the storyline is so interesting even when you complete every single mission to get more levels you have to beat them on a higher difficulty and the <UNK> mode is so you pick the weapons you want to play with then play me and the three of my friends along with my brother always play <UNK> if you don't have this game i suggest you buy it
<START> i was attracted to this film by its offbeat low key <UNK> <UNK> story line that is a twenty something guy <UNK> in the big apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more <UNK> brother it just might have worked but there's a problem and that <UNK> name is <UNK> affleck br br <UNK> affleck is nearly <UNK> in this film his acting <UNK> must be <UNK> as little effort as possible at all times or why speak when you can <UNK> or maybe put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls lips moving when speaking barely facial expressions none <UNK> in face something nothing anything <UNK>
<START> when you want to celebrate life and love especially for precious little daughters you have to shout it from the countryside and what gorgeous there are so many tears of joy even god joins in see this movie br br
<START> this is certainly a good film beautifully photographed and <UNK> acted yet one should certainly criticize it and for it is not without flaws and weaknesses really cared for women and wanted to make statements on man's lack of sympathy and total cruelty yet he sometimes gets ahead of himself in trying to make this statement by <UNK> the wrong means this is certainly a case in 'the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and he sets the scenario in <UNK> japan which leaves the viewer at the end with the partially right <UNK> boy does suck i'm glad that it is over and true some of the scenarios such weaker films of present would be literary impossible today also his women characters sometimes become <UNK> of unrealistic self sacrifice which also <UNK> the scenario less appealing saying that <UNK> lovers is a good film with such few relative weaknesses though the sometimes <UNK> cynical <UNK> by the screenwriter helps this film <UNK> i still highly prefer and recommend films of 1936 and of the as well as his late masterpieces in which he showed more restraint and subtlety and 'the life of
<START> i saw this movie when it was first released in <UNK> <UNK> i had traveled from <UNK> <UNK> a distance of <UNK> 85 miles i knew nothing of the plot nor the players i had read no reviews nor had i talked to anyone who had seen it believe me i will never make that mistake again it was being <UNK> i believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3d process that was what <UNK> me to make a <UNK> mile round trip br br there was a waiting line two <UNK> that stretched i kid you not 2 or <UNK> long and moving very slowly i could hardy wait to be <UNK> if i had only known at that moment what i soon would know i could have been <UNK> of the way back to <UNK> by the time the feature started br br by the time the first 3d scene was shown i was already <UNK> off the novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony br br without going into excruciating detail i can only offer the following advice if you have ever seen the famous film plan nine from outer space supposedly the worst movie ever filmed it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage br br i don't know if this has ever been shown on tv if it has i don't know why if you ever get a chance to see it do something else take a walk cut the grass wash the dog have someone <UNK> you with a rubber <UNK> anything your time will have been better spent br br this has been my first movie review it might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and i wouldn't make book that will happen br br bill br br
<START> any movie should have an idea simple or more complex it needs one the problem with <UNK> it's once more that when he decides to make a movie he so anxious to do whatsoever that he forgets this main detail and as result we have the characters doing whatever without any justification behaving without justified reasons they are simple puppets going along the movie on the <UNK> of the wind it's boring and sad to see them appearing and <UNK> like cards being <UNK> in a game <UNK> always seem to have talent in advertising is own work and that leads you to see what he did but in the end there's always a big disappointment it's not enough having a movie full of the hot pink magazine stars especially when half of them can't act they only pretend to be funny here my only good point goes to the actor <UNK> one of the few non <UNK> he makes the effort to establish some credibility and in such a messy movie without any direction of any kind i give him the credit for trying hard but this movie its worth to check out as a <UNK> of how to not do a movie and if previous works where bad this one it's a masterpiece in achieving the title of awful in few words just check it out it will make you good and if you <UNK> your family movies and always feel bad with your work so just spend 30 minutes looking to this so called professional work your home made stuff will look like powerful hollywood flicks compare to <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a <UNK> high 9 10 rating i say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement perhaps the filmmaker himself or one of his mates has written that review naughty naughty br br i watched this movie on the <UNK> channel on sky tv expecting it to be truly awful the special effects used were to be honest very very good for a low budget film and some of the acting wasn't that bad either but most of the acting was really awful but well done for trying as i expect most were pals of the filmmaker br br i think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above his weight i did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just wasn't br br if you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended this film is no way a 9 10 but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production
<START> i recently bought this movie for three bucks at a garage sale and while i'm glad i didn't have to pay the usual 19 99 for this dvd i was pleasantly surprised by how good the film was br br it's set up like a horror anthology broken up into 5 tales including the story which involves four teenagers who's car breaks down a dark lonely road in the middle of the night apparently these <UNK> like horror stories because that's what they decide to do until morning tell spooky stories around a <UNK> each character takes their turn telling a story after which their own story is wrapped up with a nice little twist br br the first story the hook is kinda a waste of time a bit bland and dull luckily this is not one of the main stories and only lasts maybe 5 minutes it's intended merely to introduce the film and it's easy to overlook the <UNK> of this piece br br the second story the <UNK> is eh okay it's about you guessed it two people on their honeymoon they're traveling around in an <UNK> headed to las vegas they decide to stop somewhere for the night but they're quickly warned by a mysterious stranger to leave the location or risk being attacked by some dangerous unknown creatures this story has a pretty good setup but just merely an <UNK> delivery basically it's fairly entertaining and mysterious till the monsters show up then it's just kinda <UNK> br br the third story people can <UNK> too is my personal favorite it involves a young girl who's parents are going out for the night and who's older <UNK> is <UNK> her for a party so she's going to be all alone a fact she makes known to an internet buddy of hers trouble is that internet buddy is not exactly a thirteen year old girl this story's conclusion is slightly less climatic than i might have liked to have seen but still pretty <UNK> good br br the final story the is definitely the one packed with the most atmosphere set in a creepy mansion on a dark rainy night it's the tale of a young man played by glenn quinn traveling around on a motorcycle who stumbles across this house just at the time that he conveniently has a problem with his bike he meets the mute girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight unfortunately not everything is all fine and dandy and it might have something to do with that hanging around her pretty neck br br after the stories are wrapped up we're presented with a twist involving the four teens in the car a twist which in retrospect should have been obvious but which it didn't really see coming and it's a quite pleasing conclusion to film br br so all in all a good movie rent it if you can because unfortunately i don't really think it has a lot re watching value but next time you're in the mood for a vaguely scary flick in the same vein as tales of the <UNK> or something grab this movie and some popcorn turn off all the lights and treat yourself to this surprisingly nifty little flick
<START> i have seen this film 3 times mostly because i kept thinking while watching it have i missed something here is there some reason this film was made was it trying to say something and i just missed it well after 3 viewings i failed to come up with an answer br br i guess the worst thing i can say about any film is that it bored me and i did not finish it i will admit there is plenty of eye candy and fast editing and hip music to keep my attention all the way through but is that all a movie should be br br i am not against extreme violence it is almost non stop but it seems there should be some sort of inspiration something that is <UNK> by it the word gratuitous comes to mind but it is worse then that somehow in the first part of the film we are all given insights into the motivations of the characters and yes the 3 principles are very good in their roles but the roles are completely unbelievable so in the first part we get to know the characters and in the second part most of em die and use sadistic glee in killing others that seems to be the whole movie and the first part has nothing to do with the second br br for example how could a nice smart guy like <UNK> agree to join a bunch of <UNK> and amateurs to do a job like this it makes no sense he is portrayed as smart yet he goes ahead with this suicide mission the fact that he survives is totally inconsistent with the rest of the hyper real violence and mayhem so what are we watching here a hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real super violent blood bath i recall having the same reaction to two other films this director was involved with true romance and dogs br br needless dreck
<START> i could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake was it's so dreadful it easily lands a place in my top 10 worst films of 1998 about the only thing it had going for it was bruce willis who should stick to action films as a completely <UNK> killer who'd kill his own mother for the right price but i'd rather listen to <UNK> talk american for a week than listen to richard <UNK> nauseating irish accent again but this film is also implausible unconvincing uneven <UNK> unimpressive and lands sidney in a rubbish role to make a possible career comeback one for purposes entirely
<START> mattei <UNK> is a single with a little gun who loves cats and his boss at the paris police department is a <UNK> who knows that even the police becomes sooner or later guilty that is what the film is all about and a jewel robbery at the place br br corey <UNK> brings the plan from prison <UNK> joins him and helps him against two tough guys who are after him because he took <UNK> andre money while rico already took <UNK> girl friend and left him very much alone for five years in jail corey and <UNK> find a third man <UNK> <UNK> a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand made <UNK> into a hole a perfect plan and <UNK> but they have to sell the <UNK> and there is mattei in the role of a <UNK> in disguise the circle <UNK> running to help each other they are shot by the cat loving mattei and his little pistol br br it took <UNK> 20 years he says to make a robbery film after he failed to get a contract for <UNK> wrote the screenplay and filmed in the south of france and in paris of <UNK> the great <UNK> is as usual the lighting cameraman it is the one before last picture of who died after another film with <UNK> in 1972 br br <UNK> actually wanted <UNK> instead of he didn't like that italian at all but <UNK> is an excellent fugitive and gives next to the most convincing performance but mind you <UNK> notes that is an <UNK> actor a strange character very <UNK> and absolutely impossible on a french set <UNK> didn't like him at all and didn't want to work with him ever again br br <UNK> is wrong give the most lively character in the nowhere of not so many interesting characters you can see what he is feeling being chased by mattei and his little dangerous gun and all the dogs of france in winter 70 a wild actor br br also <UNK> who passed away close to the time of the filming he also was not first choice but definitely a great substitute he carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the whole film and gets in the end his chance to become guilty once more br br <UNK> has entered at night the jewelry shop with a rifle and a <UNK> but risks eventually a successful shot when he meets <UNK> the first time we already know that the elegant <UNK> has a severe drinking problem after the robbery <UNK> <UNK> to take his part of the <UNK> and mentions to <UNK> who looks up to him that he only got into the red circle because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe <UNK> doesn't catch what he means the audience recalls having seen <UNK> in a great scene in his haunted house fighting <UNK> nightmare creatures that come out of the wardrobe and attack him at that time a very rare scene one recalls a long time after i bet it was ever so difficult to <UNK> and direct that stuff at a time no one imagined the coming days of digital movie making great artwork when art was made by hand br br we sure will remember a crew like the actors still it seems even after 33 years this one stays the less popular of the six thrillers of <UNK> what is wrong with it i am afraid one doesn't take much interest in those three actors showing three criminals and their police hunter we learn too little about corey and his fatal 5 years away from his beautiful girl anna <UNK> is still a great sniper but what made him become a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe <UNK> acts as if he is in an earlier adventure of the <UNK> is the man in the <UNK> of american car and superbly moving and mattei is <UNK> to look at a great actor at the edge of his life but how could he ever possibly doubt that all are guilty br br in an interview <UNK> states that there is no woman in the film not in the very red circle but i remember well that jolly good looking female anna with no future career we are in the 70s there in fact rises a woman from the bed of an old <UNK> wearing nothing and walks slowly to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover <UNK> <UNK> did something like that 10 years earlier this time <UNK> was directing well done br br the red has certainly added a few but not many <UNK> gems to film history the robbery at place and wonder bullet the inhabitants of the wardrobe and escaping in white underwear and carrying his <UNK> carefully across a stream that is too little for a great gangster and robbery movie but the <UNK> minutes never bore you and it is a game on a high level and there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the film over and over again none of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late <UNK> <UNK> is also featured br br michael
<START> ok so i really like kris kristofferson and his usual easy going delivery of lines in his movies age has helped him with his soft spoken low energy style and he will steal a scene effortlessly but disappearance is his <UNK> holy <UNK> this was a bad movie br br i must give kudos to the cinematography and and the actors including kris for trying their <UNK> to make sense from this goofy confusing story none of it made sense and kris probably didn't understand it either and he was just going through the motions hoping someone would come up to him and tell him what it was all about br br i don't care that everyone on this movie was doing out of love for the project or some such nonsense i've seen low budget movies that had a plot for goodness sake this had none <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> empty of reason a complete waste of good talent scenery and celluloid br br i rented this piece of garbage for a buck and i want my money back i want my 2 hours back i invested on this grade f waste of my time don't watch this movie or waste 1 minute of your valuable time while passing through a room where it's playing or even open up the case that is holding the dvd believe me you'll thank me for the advice
<START> the only reason i watched this movie a second time was to learn the name of the second banana girl playing opposite katie her name is marisa never heard of her before she is lovely captivating with an animated face and cute <UNK> she is highly watchable she's got real more than a passing vibe of grace kelly with youthful <UNK> i think she is irish in gene pool my favorite female <UNK> so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful irish american the movie is <UNK> katie is classic beauty in the flesh but marisa is the one you follow with your eyes in 1999 when this movie was made she was around 25 years old in her prime this reminds me of another silly worthless movie with the only redemption being the pretty girl in it it was career <UNK> with the first time i saw jennifer or grease ii the first time i saw michelle pfeiffer
<START> hello i normally love movies i'm 19 i have seen many and dislike only one or two this one though the second it finished i had to pull my sister who had wanted to see it out by the arm and i burst into tears of laughter as soon as i got out because it was such a ridiculously awful movie br br why it was awful all the <UNK> had especially <UNK> were the male ones with none of the characters were unique or engaging except perhaps the main <UNK> the idea of <UNK> keeping watch against <UNK> is just ridiculous the <UNK> moments are repetitive and become simply a sequence to out do the last one the themes of working together which should have been present at the end were nonexistent instead people get the impression well i'll take this all upon myself and in this case i was lucky that my friends decided to back me up without my knowledge all the moments similar to the lion king as mentioned below were beyond <UNK> even for a kid's movie br br and the worst of all it parallels the lion king in every single way responsible father figure who is killed by <UNK> the <UNK> are essentially the <UNK> with the lead <UNK> being the equivalent of <UNK> the farm falls into chaos the cow though basically <UNK> wants to play around and is shocked that his dad died believes it was his fault even though in this movie it was his fault confronts the <UNK> and gets an ass <UNK> after which tells him to leave and on the verge of leaving somehow decides to go and save some <UNK> and his friends back him up by complete surprise of course he leaves without knowing they will come help him br br other things taken from lion king stars moving around as signs father figures referring to stars signs in a mystical loving way the obviously of how the father ben found and took care of him and how at the end love interest gives birth and he has a similar experience birth at the end good god what the hell and even similar type music which seems completely tacked on at the end because it is completely different from all the previous music br br honestly this is the first movie i have ever seen where i really was rooting for the bad guys i never understood what other people were saying until now br br bottom line don't waste your time to go see this convince the kids not to see it and re watch the lion king either that or take them to see the <UNK> bully which was creative and artistic
<START> the new twenty is one of the worst films i have ever seen yes some may argue that formulaic small budget films that <UNK> for less may seem worse but i would argue that a pseudo intellectual anti formulaic indie film that pretends to be more is worse br br the new twenty was written and directed by chris mason johnson and i will never get back the <UNK> minutes of my life that i wasted on his film br br the screenplay characters br br from beginning to end the screenplay failed to provide an anti hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would want to see succeed or fail br br in story telling the three dramatic conflicts are man vs man man vs the world and man vs himself br br the screenplay focuses on a group of college friends in new york and is <UNK> with the dynamic of man vs himself where each of the film's characters are so self absorbed in a <UNK> of depression and self destructive behavior that the movie before the audiences very eyes br br each of the main characters <UNK> in unexplained bad behavior heroin addiction with no history as to why the character is an addict a fianc√©e who has sex with her <UNK> boss <UNK> even though the character is written too smart to have sex with such a sleazy character a man who begins as a decent guy but is attracted to a foul mouthed <UNK> and <UNK> for some unknown reason into a similar foul mouthed business jackass a <UNK> <UNK> gay <UNK> geek who does nothing but find dates online and a gay asian man who dates an hiv positive older man but has no scenes establishing why the relationship works and why love develops br br crucial scenes establishing the cause of the character's addiction the suffering and self loathing of the fianc√©e that might explain why she would sleep with a sleaze bag the back story that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a gordon <UNK> type character and become a jackass a story line for the <UNK> <UNK> geek and more scenes of interaction between the asian man and hiv positive boyfriend are all missing br br without proper establishing details all of the characters' actions seem forced and contrived br br direction cinematography score br br i found mr <UNK> direction to be without a clear point of view leaving the actors emotionally incoherent br br the cinematography can be described as mundane at best mr johnson selected small spaces to shoot and failed to catch the <UNK> of new york city this failure created a claustrophobic film that viewed like the filming of a stage play and not a film br br the score was embarrassingly absent from most of the film i assume that mr johnson is to blame since he could have asked for full score to enhance understanding in each shot br br conclusion br br the new twenty is an annoying and <UNK> failure in film making
<START> this film is far and wide and beyond any shadow of a doubt the single worst and most <UNK> film in the history of the universe br br it really is that bad br br personally i have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film and rented this one thinking it would be one of those to my immense disappointment it was not br br the script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they're reading the lines directly off <UNK> the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera i couldn't even finish watching it it is even worse than witch academy and that's quite a feat in itself br br i cannot even begin to <UNK> how a director could shoot this film and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release br br painful awful horrendous
<START> i absolutely love stand up comedy i love to hear the raw thoughts of the stand up on stage as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so ing stupid that they had to share it with someone br br there used to be stand ups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to rodney <UNK> comes to mind or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others richard <UNK> and then there were the thought provoking comics like george <UNK> who despite pretending to be a <UNK> was the <UNK> guy in the room who <UNK> to people to <UNK> things they saw when they walked around and realize just how screwed up things were and how easily they could change things br br now this might seem to not have anything to do with mind of <UNK> which as i agree with most <UNK> here is comedy <UNK> horrid solution to the loss of <UNK> show but it does carlos <UNK> spends half of the show doing stand up bits for his audience sometimes on popular topics most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes he tries to be all three of the above types of stand ups he makes a stage character an every day mexican named carlos who despite stereotypes is just your run of the mill normal guy he then proceeds to try to laugh at others people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion and then finally he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer telling them that it will help them see his point of view br br carlos <UNK> always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been <UNK> about to death but he <UNK> encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around laugh br br promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest yet <UNK> way to get laughs in stand up the best comedians which i fear carlos <UNK> feels he is in good company with don't have to resort to them they talk universally and ask you to laugh at absurdity rather than with it like <UNK> encourages as he creates more skits or real life situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it he tells us rather than asks us to laugh and actually presents these <UNK> as truth rather than just extremes of it br br his show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it <UNK> doesn't give us comedy and ask us to <UNK> it and take from it what we want something that as much as i hate to compare the two was <UNK> show's finest quality he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it which according to him is to make a stupid face and say dee dee dee this show is appropriately named it is indeed a show about the mind of <UNK> it's <UNK> mind through and through and as such is nothing more than dumb entertainment the show is <UNK> made to give life lessons to its core audience 14 24 year olds about how stereotypes are bad but that racial bashing is alright to carlos <UNK> and therefore should be alright to you
<START> <UNK> des takes too long getting going with <UNK> so <UNK> of his back stage <UNK> that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story however once it does it's <UNK> at his best <UNK> <UNK> father of <UNK> <UNK> and co star of his <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> who married beneath himself and who plans to kill the seedy studio <UNK> with designs on his wife only to find that someone has beaten him to it not only that but his carefully planned but clumsily executed <UNK> falls to pieces not least when a thief steals his car at the murder <UNK> br br the film really kicks into life with the arrival of luis <UNK> police inspector a rather wonderful creation half <UNK> <UNK> in green for danger and half world weary with better dialog in a neat running gag his investigation is constantly <UNK> at the top of his voice against chaos and noise whether it be the <UNK> <UNK> of the police station or a loud rehearsal the police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation a wealth of chaotic and telling small details that makes steve once revolutionary 80's us cop shows look like <UNK> museum pieces by comparison br br if <UNK> is a rather unconvincing femme fatale the supporting cast more than compensate with the beautiful <UNK> a standout as the lesbian photographer in love with her from <UNK> and constantly mistaken for <UNK> lover by and other interested parties only <UNK> similarly unlucky with women understands and genuinely <UNK> with great black and white photography by <UNK> this is a terrific little thriller with a nice twist ending and a lovely scene with a cab driver reluctantly <UNK> in a police station trivia note pierre who played the <UNK> philosophical dr in le turns up in smaller roles as a cab driver in both <UNK> and les br br the <UNK> dvd is quite superb great picture quality plus an <UNK> <UNK> from a french tv show featuring interviews with <UNK> <UNK> and
<START> br br a few years ago i bought a movie called the <UNK> i had heard that it was supposed to be a great movie but it turned out that it was a flop and a b movie br br the story is good but there are no good effects in the movie maybe they didn't have enough money for that on the budget br br if you choose to watch this movie be sure to watch it three times the first only and last time
<START> i saw this film 2 weeks prior to going on a holiday so for me it was really just to get my mind in mode for my holiday the film boasts some sweet skills throughout the films in the action scenes these moments were great a bit like watching extreme sports channel sadly the story was quite honestly awful the acting was generally alright with a fairly small cast this film is apparently comedy at least it tries to be comical but it seems like the comedy and the storyline was written by a teenager the story lacks any depth or purpose and the comedy struggles to be anything more than a small <UNK> a few times during the movie it might be worth renting just to see the action but then again there are plenty of movies out there that are totally devoted to stunts and don't feature a un funny badly written story
<START> very nice movie i was <UNK> the channels on my tv and i usually ignore the channels that air drama movies but then i saw this channel that <UNK> old school movies and it is where i saw this movie at first when i saw the title the cure i thought it's gonna be boring but then i got hooked when i saw brad was in this movie because of one of my favorite movie of all time is the client where brad also stars then the scenes was getting better and better the story is so beautiful and very touching i cried hard in this movie which i don't usually do great casting and there are so many beautiful lines quotes in this movie which is very striking and made me cry hard now i bought my own copy on dvd and i always recommend it to everyone
<START> having been pleasantly surprised by sandra <UNK> performance in miss <UNK> i decided to give murder by numbers a shot while decent in <UNK> self <UNK> roles ms <UNK> performance in serious roles see hope <UNK> speed 2 28 days leave much to be desired her character is at the same time <UNK> confused and sexually <UNK> the sub plot of <UNK> past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character the two teenage boys gave decent performances although their <UNK> expertise and catch me if can attitude is <UNK> by stupid errors that scream we did it chris penn as the all too obvious suspect is wasted here as is ben <UNK> token partner love interest character br br spoilers ahead mediocre acting aside the biggest flaws can be <UNK> to a tv of the week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place and as mentioned the stupid errors <UNK> up a rare food on the murder scene an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor the two boys hanging out together in public a convenient love interest to cause <UNK> etc etc cause the view to go from being <UNK> to being bored and disappointed by the murderers the ending was strictly by the numbers and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie using the now cliched <UNK> of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so called intelligence the film <UNK> to arrive at it's conclusion a somewhat promising concept but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way out of
<START> this is the dreary tale of the self absorbed affair between two unlikable people one of whom is married to someone else it ranks high on my list of most boring movies ever and i'm a die hard romantic my husband <UNK> out after the first hour of its three by which time little had <UNK> the desert scenery is spectacular with the endless sand and the sunshine on golden hair however cinematography does not a brilliant film make unless it's a national <UNK> <UNK> the magnificent <UNK> scenery in this ill conceived tale is like putting <UNK> on a pig br br the movie revolves around a badly burned dying pilot named count de who is left in the care of a canadian army nurse <UNK> during world war ii italy he appears to remember little of his life but through a book in his possession his story is very slowly revealed with the help of a man from his past named <UNK> who mysteriously appears at his <UNK> was a hungarian <UNK> employed by the royal <UNK> society to <UNK> the <UNK> desert he entered into an affair with the wife <UNK> of a fellow <UNK> who proved to be a british spy meanwhile in the present nurse has her own affair with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is involved in the dangerous work of <UNK> mines br br my <UNK> with this movie are many length and tedium for starters i don't fault the acting in particular it simply isn't a good story <UNK> seems unnecessary his connection to <UNK> he provides a torture scene but appears to serve no essential purpose in the film br br the core problem is that the two parties of this affair and <UNK> are woefully unsympathetic characters shallow and dull they simply aren't very nice thus there is no one to cheer for is cool <UNK> <UNK> and eventually <UNK> <UNK> of another man's wife <UNK> is likewise detached and nasty not to mention having a <UNK> lack of guilt or feeling whatsoever for her <UNK> but loving husband apart from managing one <UNK> tear at the corner of her eye when he dies br br this is a tale of lust rather than love with such <UNK> as 'i can still taste <UNK> ridiculously to a colleague his erotic obsession with the in his <UNK> neck surely more <UNK> of a focus on body the victim of this <UNK> adultery is the hapless husband geoffrey who is treated as little more than an unpleasant <UNK> it's all quite <UNK> and disgusting <UNK> of feeling faint so that these lovers can <UNK> in their much <UNK> <UNK> passion all as silent night is being sung in the background i'm not sure whether the intent was to contrast the <UNK> <UNK> with their selfish lust but i definitely was not impressed by the <UNK> <UNK> we have full frontal nudity with <UNK> but their sex scenes come across as cold selfish <UNK> and sometimes downright hateful not warm loving giving nor even truly passionate if either of these two feels any emotion for the other it is a totally selfish one and definitely not love as i define the word br br return to the cave of the <UNK> to retrieve the body of his beloved comes across as contrived rather than moving <UNK> must have <UNK> only moments earlier as she shows excellent colour and barely appears <UNK> not at all corpse like of course this is all for dramatic effect as the <UNK> watching this tale normally i'd be one of them would not appreciate a <UNK> <UNK> corpse in order to retrieve his <UNK> <UNK> body he has betrayed his <UNK> the allies by giving his <UNK> to the nazis the english being cast as the villains of the piece regardless of whether or not he's keeping his final promise to <UNK> his <UNK> act is not something i admire much br br <UNK> seems a pleasant fellow and <UNK> generally likable but their romance is not in the least engaging merely a brief wartime <UNK> with the parties <UNK> little trauma upon <UNK> moving back and forth between the two settings past <UNK> desert and present italy proved distracting and unpleasant but really both stories were dull as <UNK> the only spark of interest in the whole picture was <UNK> tense mine <UNK> scene br br not being totally heartless i did have some sympathy for the current severely burned and dying state however perhaps my major complaint with this film is the <UNK> at the end when <UNK> <UNK> her patient by giving him a <UNK> <UNK> we are supposed to feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously has affection for cries while she is preparing the deadly <UNK> and reads <UNK> from his allegedly passionate book to <UNK> him as he's dying br br the amazing director david <UNK> masterpieces should not be insulted by comparison with this pathetic <UNK> tale yes lawrence of <UNK> also has a desert but in lean films doctor <UNK> brief encounter those engaging in affairs are sympathetic characters <UNK> admirable restraint guilt and some regard for the betrayed <UNK> as opposed to the total self <UNK> of this pair in <UNK> daughter the <UNK> husband displays touching loyalty and forgiveness br br this movie is a supposedly intellectual enormously over rated bit of boring and disgusting drivel that unfortunately passes itself off as a great love story its best picture oscar does not speak well for the academy for those who wonder why people are so hard on this movie the answer is simple it's awful
<START> as one who frequently goes to the movies i have to say that this has been one of the most impressive movies i have seen this year ed harris and cuba gooding jr gave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters it is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend entirely upon special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levels i wish hollywood would produce more movies of this <UNK>
<START> i would consider myself a fan of dean <UNK> having read a number of his novels and liked them all but unfortunately i never got around to reading <UNK> so i'm left with no choice but to rate this film on it's own merits rather than comparing it to the book that i haven't read i went into this expecting something awful and while i didn't exactly get a brilliant horror film i am lead to believe that it's fans of the book that are rating it down because as a film in it's own right <UNK> is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror movie the plot obviously takes some influence from predator and begins with an explosion at a research lab it's not long before a <UNK> is killed by some strange beast and the boyfriend of the dead man's daughter has picked up an ultra intelligent runaway dog a secret government agency is soon on the case as the murders continue the boy continues to be fascinated by the <UNK> intelligence but it somehow ties in with the murders and the agency is soon on his tail too br br the script for this film was originally written by paul <UNK> who later <UNK> it i don't know why ¬ñ the writing here is nowhere near as ridiculous as his 2004 hit crash anyway the main reason this film works is undoubtedly the dog who aside from being rather cute is also the best actor in the film corey <UNK> hot off the success of the lost boys is the human lead and actually has a rather good chemistry with the dog although it is a little bit ridiculous seeing him talk to it most of the way through the film the plot is rather convoluted and as such the film is more than a little bit messy but the <UNK> of it all pulls it through during the more awkward moments michael <UNK> also appears in the film and does well as the <UNK> <UNK> side of the government agents the monster is of course one of the most interesting things about the film and the way it goes around killing people is always entertaining and gory although unfortunately we don't get to see a lot of it and when we finally do it's rather disappointing obviously the filmmakers had seen bigfoot and the <UNK> still this is the sort of film that can be easily enjoyed despite the numerous problems and i'd recommend to any viewer of eighties horror
<START> you can read all kinds of references into the world of <UNK> a futuristic world populated by <UNK> self indulgent morons <UNK> fed by the technology of a <UNK> era this idea has its <UNK> in h g <UNK> the time machine and <UNK> brave new world amongst other <UNK> br br early in the film a narrator explains the quick <UNK> of humanity over five hundred years but does not fill in the gaps of where all the futuristic technology came from in the meanwhile most of the criticism of this very fun and funny film seems to surround this <UNK> and the resulting complaint that the world isn't realistic as if realism has ever been a necessary quality of satire is brazil realistic how about <UNK> or hell how about <UNK> travels i thought not <UNK> while maybe not as pointed as the best of the genre hits the same notes and generally does so successfully br br besides i didn't find the futuristic technology to be a problem it is pretty easy to figure out that mike judge is <UNK> the current trend toward <UNK> and simple product so that even total idiots can use them as in brave new world the society in the film seems to have reached a point of <UNK> self <UNK> at some point in the past apparently created by the now <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in order to <UNK> an increasingly stupid <UNK> leaving the remainder of humanity free to <UNK> all the worst most selfish <UNK> they can come up with and grow even <UNK> the film just happens to take place during the last gasp of humanity as everything begins to fall apart for good it may still be unrealistic but if so it's a remarkably well presented brand of <UNK> br br the stupid people take up most of the screen time of course but they're just the victims they don't know any better mike judge saves his real hate for the intelligent people in power who are dead by the time the film begins but who are very much alive right now in the 21st century people like scientists who chase hair growth and prolonged <UNK> for no other reason than the possibility that they'll turn a profit on their snake oil <UNK> people like politicians who let <UNK> simply purchase the <UNK> and <UNK> people like media executives and their <UNK> stooges who promote stupidity who <UNK> the destruction of all culture morality and health to make a quick buck br br after all who is really to blame the or the the paris of the world or the brilliant executives and <UNK> that put her on tv and <UNK> our cultural standards enough to leave her there this is all <UNK> in <UNK> though a line here a hint there witness the hilarious auto doctor which literally does all the work in the health care system it's one of the few aspects of the movie that's not <UNK> into the ground by the unnecessary narrator it's just there for the viewer to pick up or not but it is one of the most interesting themes in a movie that's much smarter than any other comedy of the year br br pity that so many people will leave the film thinking it's just an excuse to show rear ends <UNK> and people being hit in the <UNK> not that that stuff isn't funny too and maybe it is a little <UNK> but in <UNK> it's just not as simple as it seems
<START> having been familiar with hartley's the go between for a good while both in its original book form and in its disappointing <UNK> <UNK> film adaptation this was interesting stuff the proves almost a mirror image at times set in a slightly less distant period for the main part featuring exposure of the british class system and containing a set piece sports match boxing takes the place of <UNK> that reveals rather a lot about br br this <UNK> in its small scale character focus you do not exactly get to lady franklin and in the <UNK> sense but this distance is appropriately played out in telling body language and <UNK> from the actors your distance from ever fully <UNK> with any one true character mirrors the <UNK> that so <UNK> the central relationship miles and shaw are wonderfully subtle and we see more in their <UNK> never once are these <UNK> performances they are <UNK> interpretations that create the impression of these characters having life <UNK> the confines of the film all other parts are very <UNK> handled though they are far smaller in this film than i presume in the novel and compared indeed to the go between a stunning work about <UNK> br br the <UNK> at the centre of this film is so sadly and <UNK> conveyed in the late scenes where shaw kisses miles and is rejected and then where a drunken confronts and lady franklin it's a howling shame that what would have been an incredibly poignant ending of spoiled desolate lives at either side of the screen is with a decidedly odd little <UNK> one is entirely <UNK> by the jump in tone as <UNK> goes <UNK> and ironically sings rule <UNK> and god save the queen as he crashes his car into things the political point is heavily over <UNK> by this <UNK> rather operatic ending all sense of subtlety so effectively conveyed <UNK> is lost as the <UNK> point is heavily and <UNK> made prop surely has no place in this sort of delicate period drama br br overall however one cannot be too harsh while this absurd end piece is a major flaw the rest of the film must be praised as a sensitive <UNK> film of sadness and detailed observation about the way british society was in the past hartley's <UNK> but crystal clear touch is very much in evidence throughout it's just a shame that we don't end on the shattering conclusion to <UNK> drunk scene the tragic <UNK> figure of sarah <UNK> lady franklin is abruptly denied her place at the <UNK> of the film as the excellent human drama <UNK> slips into the <UNK> of political point <UNK> shaw also that most dry and yet deeply feeling of actors is betrayed by the out of character excess that <UNK> the film thus a fine small scale triumph is <UNK> but we ought to remember the many good points br br rating 1 2
<START> this movie is important to those of us interested in western history because it makes use of authentic techniques in its production br br the scenes of the <UNK> train are particularly authentic so far as i know it contains the only scenes ever filmed <UNK> the techniques for river <UNK> at a <UNK> the horses and <UNK> have to be <UNK> to the river level and the <UNK> let down by <UNK> and the scene is such that i could watch it over and again just trying to get a feel for what a crossing was like and the early <UNK> did it time and time again while crossing the country br br melodrama aside this picture is as authentic in dress and style as they come and worth watching for that alone
<START> speed which i believe is direct copy of the hollywood movie <UNK> i haven't watched this one gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days but then gets in a very boring draw at the end i have watched this movie today on <UNK> january 2008 on rented <UNK> it's release date is 19th <UNK> 2007 but still fortunately for me i didn't know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office so in this situation when i watch the movie i feel that this movie could have been a very good movie but then the director again falls in the trap for bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chance br br off course as a <UNK> movie it must be copied from somewhere else but now days it doesn't matter for me if i haven't seen the original movie i just found the main theme much similar to of <UNK> and in the movie <UNK> <UNK> is shown an intelligence agent but his wife thinks that he is a chef this brings back the memory of <UNK> <UNK> the only new part was the use if the phone but that too i found out now is taken from movie <UNK> so when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies it's future is quite clear br br the things i like about the movie is its pace as the name suggest the things really happens fast and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes but this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional bollywood style of br br the plot of the movie is also quite interesting three stories going parallel one after the other one of the kidnapping of <UNK> the other of the trying to help <UNK> and then the plan of murder of prime minister these three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continues br br but then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie except <UNK> <UNK> none other makes any impression this goes even for <UNK> who is always promising in movies due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesn't really convey the feelings that director wanted e g the scene at the end where <UNK> leaves all hope and cut the phone should have made a good impact but instead we just wait for the end of that scene br br other than acting some unnecessary love for style the movie showing so cool villains is good for hollywood movies not for bollywood the background of london is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen especially at the end all those were utterly unnecessary may be director has an impression that the climax in hindi movies must have such fights they look unrealistic increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie ends br br over and all i find the movie once watchable if it is coming on tv or you can get it on rent its ok but then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy next time when the movie is on tv you can safely watch other channels
<START> i have seen most of john <UNK> films with the exception of several of his very early ones which are not available i have actually seen just about all of them so it's obvious i am a big fan and it's certain that i have a high tolerance for the gross and <UNK> in his films while way over the top and disgusting i <UNK> female trouble and <UNK> two monumental <UNK> to bad taste and excess that are seriously funny films so i am certainly not <UNK> and can take most of what waters has to offer however in pink <UNK> he has created a film so <UNK> so unfunny and so offensive that i couldn't even stand it in his other films he made before he became more mainstream they were funny yet here the humor just isn't there as it seems the intent is to shock the viewers and not entertain them in any way i am glad that after making this film <UNK> sense of humor improved as divine <UNK> dog <UNK> as in this film is shocking but not the least bit entertaining my advice is to skip this film and just pretend it never happened and then watch his infinitely better films of the 70s and 80s
<START> the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to due in no small part to john <UNK> masterful direction coupled with <UNK> superb cinematography some of the <UNK> tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art house film both james and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate is particularly good as the <UNK> of the bad it's a role <UNK> the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before normally played a hero and in fact with his <UNK> i didn't even recognize him at first <UNK> goofy buck teeth only make an already <UNK> character seem even more flawed that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable in a villain you love to hate kind of way his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic jackie chan appears briefly early on and late in the going as a <UNK> and i believe i actually <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> somewhere along the way <UNK> as the lead is nothing less than magnificent
<START> another awful movie about hockey i if never watched hockey and saw <UNK> version i would hate the game this movie doesn't make canada look that great either i can laugh at it and not take it too seriously all the same this movie is awful with every thing you can put in a 80's movie in the end don't even watch it on tv 4 10
<START> this film <UNK> of production line planning it appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies and threw spaghetti on the screen jimmy stewart june <UNK> anthony mann baseball war baby airplane roll 'em the film does address the age of the stewart <UNK> performers though i'm certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger br br there are messages in <UNK> air command i found curiously shocking and offensive but i'll stick with one truly wretched element the happily married couple is challenged when mr stewart's character makes an important decision without <UNK> his wife in the film's most dramatic scene she calls him on it it ends completely <UNK> <UNK> is crying her heart out on their bed and stewart walks out on her no discussion he simply says he is correct and walks out on his <UNK> wife for all he knows she could <UNK> her <UNK> br br later <UNK> <UNK> for questioning her husband's decision br br unbelievable br br stick with stewart <UNK> in the <UNK> story 1949 br br <UNK> air command 3 25 <UNK> anthony mann james stewart june <UNK> frank <UNK>
<START> when i started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the action channel i have to say out of all the shows that i've seen that <UNK> released this one is one of the best shows of all time i had to see it again and that's when i got my chance i bought the entire box set of this series at best buy for my 20th birthday and i got to enjoy it and see more of the episodes that i missed on action channel and the same 3 episodes that i've seen my favorite characters in this show are sylvia leon and <UNK> the animation in this series was the best and the hard suits were cool as well but the show also has a great voice cast like chris <UNK> jason douglas christine and <UNK> and more so if you like this show on action channel then you have to own it on dvd it's the best and you will see what i mean
<START> the film tells you to be aware and <UNK> it also destroys any and all things the bible claims to be true to people like me the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous it has been called <UNK> and it is if you are a believer it is sad to hear that many people think of it as a good sequel to the bible however the film shows you a lot of things and subjects that can be interpreted as a <UNK> version of the revelation some of us think that such things are not to be abused one good thing about the film is that it strongly encourages <UNK> awareness and makes you consider your actions twice the director just seems to forget that some people act that way already solely based on the fact that they believe and love as <UNK> in the bible why attempt to change that unless you be the devil yourself
<START> beautifully constructed tells the story of <UNK> usage and <UNK> from multiple points of view from a policeman view from a politician view from an addict view from a view and from a <UNK> view in a carefully storyline one gets the impression on how everything is inter related from beautiful on location shots in the <UNK> fields in <UNK> to downtown to the entry points <UNK> of <UNK> and london to the <UNK> buildings where the <UNK> takes place one sees the massive dimension of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> has just gone out of jail she is decided to not return again but life is difficult for ex convict specially if they are homeless as <UNK> when she finds the one that was her boyfriend she can see a light of hope but is now not only a <UNK> but also an aids ill this will not make <UNK> surrender because if there's a will there's a way and she is going to fight for her future to have normal life with a house and a family a very hard and touching film that has passed unaware by most of the spanish cinemas actors are great and the story is very touching maybe a better treatment of the secondary characters would have made the movie better but it is really good i highly recommend it to watch it but be aware that this is not a disney happy film it is hard and dramatic
<START> i had a great time watching a couple of <UNK> back somewhat <UNK> for most of the film its pretty much a two <UNK> showing the games and weird relationship of crazy doctor <UNK> <UNK> and stunning <UNK> <UNK> i'd seen her before in a couple of fulci films dying gruesome deaths but here she is young hip and beautiful the film is pretty predictable and certainly mild on the exploitation front but entertaining throughout <UNK> too its marvellous colourful <UNK> feel the set design music lighting and cinematography are all classic late sixties italian style a surreal feast for the eyes and ears and though the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to <UNK> there are more than enough unusual events and <UNK> bizarre sights and sounds to keep things interesting throughout both leads are pretty good and it bears repeating that <UNK> <UNK> is really really fine the music by is <UNK> too perfectly suited to the images director has come up with quite a cracker here but its not perfect though very <UNK> there's little substance here and the exploitation elements are about as mild as can be i guess this gives it a sort of charm and innocence but i can't help thinking that the subject matter could have done with more sleaze more threat that sorta thing especially since its pretty simple to figure whats going to happen this is i suspect a bit pointless for stronger exploitation fans and certainly not for people wanting sex or much nudity its more of a light fun pop art affair lovable but <UNK> like bubble bath recommended mainly for those fond of the 60's <UNK> <UNK> or sweet set designs
<START> this movie was horrible if it had never been made the world would be a better place come on a flying <UNK> what were they thinking this was a sub par movie with a horrible hook and i would like a written <UNK> from the studio that produced this along with some <UNK> to help <UNK> me for the time i wasted on this crap fest that i can never get back if you <UNK> to see this movie i am truly sorry because i watched it on tv on a sunday afternoon when i had nothing better to do and it pretty much ruined my whole week a flying freaking <UNK> and that's supposed to make up for having a horrible mother who cares more about her own screwed up needs than her children no wonder they don't have enough sense to tell someone he is beating them their mother teaches them nothing but that what she wants comes before everything else absolutely horrible
<START> i <UNK> to watching this movie with a group of friends despite my extreme dislike for horror movies however it was not the shock of a monster that turned me off this movie it was the horrendous acting and absolutely disgusting ending within or the <UNK> has no redeeming qualities it is poorly made laughably scripted <UNK> bloody and the inclusion of the gratuitous final scene me no it is not my dislike for horror movies that makes me hate this film i've seen such wonderful teen horrors as house of wax its the fact that the film leaves you with the awful understanding that by renting the video you are supporting the creators of within
<START> subject matter worthwhile acting fair some of it plot ridiculous br br details sound goes from high to nearly <UNK> music is not altogether awful but mostly is dialog and characterization are laughable the main character's process of discovery is <UNK> obvious to everyone but himself and the writer apparently animal scenes are just plain stupid singing moon river in an off key forgotten lyrics silly <UNK> to a herd of wild <UNK> for hours as one example finally the wet t shirt contest is so over the top silly that it has to be seen to be hint the who wins is not a well i'm not giving that away
<START> i'm totally agree with from comments about this film <UNK> <UNK> non can't see what's the big deal about this film some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly <UNK> are the ones who would actually <UNK> it ' it's still not quite the truth and as a <UNK> chinese i do <UNK> <UNK> although i don't speak because we do have the similar in <UNK> too i know that it's really hard to understand and to accept this as a reality but it is definitely not a <UNK> real <UNK> i was pleased to see this film outside <UNK> because it will and definitely be banned in <UNK> too which means either you get it in copied or or hope that someone to be kind enough to it in the internet this is not an <UNK> violent teen drama ' because it portrays the reality which exists in <UNK> and in <UNK> too in an interesting way sad humour i was just a little sad to know that this film got about 20 cuts in censorship what a waste
<START> but like the disney film of two generations ago this film fails as well in the accuracy department but at least disney used a <UNK> <UNK> br br is the true story to mundane for movie producers i don't think so there is ample <UNK> to accurately portray they true story instead of the <UNK> accounts we have had to suffer through br br some day a movie will correctly portray <UNK> owner john gray as the <UNK> policeman that he was and correctly portray <UNK> license a being paid for by the lord when that happens i'll be at the theaters
<START> preposterous <UNK> executed in a <UNK> amateurish and inept way or perhaps several since the incredible lack of continuity tone realism <UNK> suspense and much more combine with walter attempts at charm to produce a cinema curiosity to rank with some of fritz <UNK> other <UNK> failures i thought the german <UNK> was actually played by lang but apparently not they could have been twins if you cannot predict the ending from several away you are not actually alive br br i was eagerly awaiting this dvd and was totally surprised and disappointed by such dire crap even with george sanders and john carradine maybe i can wash my mind out by watching in <UNK> instead and for the <UNK> time br br anyone want a dvd used once there may be a movie to be made about the making of this atrocious film and how so many talented people could be wasted so completely
<START> although i lived in australia in 1975 i moved overseas not long after fed up with constant industrial <UNK> the general worship of mediocrity unless one is a <UNK> and the <UNK> of so many <UNK> who chose to ignore the <UNK> pace of change taking place in countries to their north br br consequently i missed the <UNK> along with many other australian made tv dramas of the '80s and <UNK> such as the superb <UNK> and phoenix series which i have since seen along with <UNK> br br to me the filmed story of the <UNK> is fair and as far as i am aware accurate however as to public outrage it only shows one side of the picture not how families were by the controversy i know as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward br br but the commentary is in my view very one sided throughout the <UNK> fact is that notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial <UNK> of the community the australian <UNK> chose and chose <UNK> in favour of <UNK> as they did again two years later br br this apart a historically accurate and superbly well acted <UNK>
<START> i was mighty impressed with nurse betty all the way through it has a great ensemble of characters an <UNK> plot and an ending i <UNK> seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings br br if <UNK> any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was morgan freeman and chris <UNK> interaction these two are great and it <UNK> my heart to see rock isn't going to do crappy big hollywood fare like lethal weapon 4 for the rest of his life freeman is as always the man really there <UNK> be any need to critique his work anymore hell kiss the girls was watchable with him in it br br <UNK> does the best she can with her role and kinnear is good as her br br sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the <UNK> of the male 9 <UNK> 10 br br
<START> like those who listened to radio reports about the attack on pearl harbor every one who has ever seen pink <UNK> can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it and some thirty years later the movie is still one of the most <UNK> vile obnoxious repulsive and hilariously funny films ever put to celluloid guaranteed to test the strongest <UNK> and the <UNK> funny bones br br filmed with a close to zero budget and some of the cinematography around pink <UNK> tells the story of two families that compete for the <UNK> title of the <UNK> people alive just how filthy can they be plenty the film includes everything from sex with <UNK> to what i can only describe as a remarkable display of <UNK> control to a <UNK> helping of <UNK> doo and i guarantee that you won't want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it br br the cast is either wonderful atrocious or <UNK> wonderful depending on how you look at it the star of course is divine and to describe divine as the biggest drag queen on the planet would the understatement of the year she is a <UNK> creature given to big eye makeup big orange hair and big expressions she is the <UNK> heston of drag and whether she is almost running down a <UNK> <UNK> to use the bathroom on some one's front lawn or startling real life <UNK> by taking a <UNK> along a <UNK> sidewalk she is both <UNK> and <UNK> funny others in the cast include mary vivian <UNK> danny mills and the ever appalling edith massey as members of family and <UNK> stole and david as the white <UNK> baby selling couple who challenge status br br it should be pretty obvious that pink <UNK> is not exactly a movie that will appeal to just every one and viewers who know director john waters only through such later films as <UNK> and <UNK> will be in for a major <UNK> but if you want to see something so completely different that even monty python couldn't imagine it this is the movie for you just make sure you eat before you see it because you probably won't want to eat afterward and you might want to keep a <UNK> bag handy just in case br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> all the reviewers are making one big mistake this movie was not suppose to be taken seriously br br it was made for kids and teens of the late <UNK> or early and as such it was truly a film of it's time if you hated that period or love the first movie so much that you can't even take a joke about it then this is garbage but only because it wasn't meant for you the low budget here and failure of the <UNK> 1 at the box office <UNK> under four <UNK> with a nine <UNK> budget were obviously the reasons to drop the seriousness of the original and to put it in the present day you can complain about the story dialog or logic but again this was made to run not to win races if the movie had tried to take itself seriously it would be a total failure but it doesn't do that for a second in our world <UNK> sees a movie theater that's advertising the <UNK> 2 enough said to <UNK> clint eastwood from dirty harry movies this movie knows it's limitations it's more of a comedy parody then usual adventure soundtrack for the time was also great actors aren't taking themselves that seriously either so even the usually irritating spoiled rich brat role played here very well by young <UNK> <UNK> turns out good br br so if you are nostalgic for the <UNK> cheese culture or you liked the first part and don't mind going out on a cheese <UNK> you'll have tremendous fun with this attempt to revive <UNK> in the this is not really the sequel to the first and don't watch it if that's what you want it's more of a what if fantasy sequel br br as for the why different dimension and not just different time question when in history did we have those tall <UNK> <UNK> creatures that suck the flash of bones from the end of part 1 by the way the movie ends in the <UNK> because of an attempt at a cheap big finale it's suppose to be the best place for <UNK> to show all his moves him being the <UNK> of animals
<START> lou <UNK> jr is great as a super u s air force pilot who comes to the rescue of a nice but <UNK> <UNK> jason the son of a captured pilot who is determined to borrow a couple of f 16 fighters to use in an attempt to save his dad from a dictator david <UNK> of an enemy overseas country br br better than <UNK> <UNK> this air force <UNK> film has excitement and lots of explosions you know all that cool stuff you'd want from a contemporary military adventure film br br cool music including twisted sister's dee <UNK> <UNK> out <UNK> not gonna take <UNK> and king excellent <UNK> say <UNK> br br aim high air force
<START> i did not like this film at all the scenario is boring and after a while its primitive predictability really gets on your nerves even if you give <UNK> a high bonus for not being a <UNK> i did not manage to find anything specially interesting on his characterization of neither
<START> if you are looking for king kong you your search this is a low low budget movie that was <UNK> to entertain people in a comic sense here is the most ordinary human who is the only 1 who can save the world from a 300 ton surely you can see the humor in that
<START> on a second viewing this is still a wonderful romance that is in my opinion much better than the film it came paired with on my 2 dvd set the leo <UNK> <UNK> classic an affair to remember yet it seems to have fallen out of favour slightly only a 6 6 rating here on imdb and <UNK> by many critics as <UNK> <UNK> how sad because this is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work by the two leads jennifer jones and william <UNK> if anything the film should be well remembered for the gorgeous colour cinematography and the unforgettable musical score i don't much like <UNK> day but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again and i'm glad of it while i still think <UNK> character death is too heavily <UNK> taking suspense out of the final scenes this film is very moving and i really enjoy it
<START> just saw this movie 2 days ago a very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine i have no special interest in wine and yet i found this very <UNK> the director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are while he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer he shows a lot of compassion to people and dogs and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don't want to tell br br the movie shows us where our world is going to what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay it is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big personal and global character and formula br br the real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their <UNK> look at the world and themselves br br it takes some time to get use to the <UNK> camera moves and editing but it's worth it br br highly recommended
<START> do you hear that sound that's the sound of h g wells rolling over in his grave between this version and spielberg's cinematic abortion it's been a tough year for the classic novel but at least steven got a few things right compared to this hello the ships weren't big insects they had names they were <UNK> and the aliens worked in <UNK> the ships and the aliens were all wrong you don't really get to see the aliens until the end the effects and the cast work fine but these actors are much better then this movie deserves the bulk if not all the movie is the <UNK> character wondering through the <UNK> meeting one person they join him and he <UNK> them for one reason or the other there's not more then two people on camera at any given moment though most of the movie it's like if they filmed three at once it would put the movie over budget or something so fat the only and mean only watchable adaptation of the war of the worlds story is the george pal version way back in the 1950s the black hole
<START> i'm still laughing not i'm still asking my myself what the point was i barely got a chuckle this movie sucks it tries to be charming and touching but it turns out stupid i do not recommend it
<START> actually son of the mask did make me laugh a few times mostly due to the cartoonish jokes that made bugs bunny and <UNK> so funny the cgi is very impressive and is used <UNK> in this movie garfield for example is no where on par for cgi but i would give it the same vote br br everyone knows the story which wasn't that bad for a kids movie yes it is a kids movie and therefore should be treated as such jamie kennedy is not very good in his role his attempts to act crazy are not very good and overall acting is poor br br everyone else is not too bad br br basically my 2 and 5 year old watched the whole thing without complaining at least i was able to sit through this br br there is no way this movie is worst than <UNK> class of 1999 br br 4 10 for the cgi and a few laughs
<START> i really like the movie's opening when <UNK> ted masters realizes on his fighter radar that four enemy aircraft were approaching from about 10 <UNK> the good news is that the movie does not mention at the very beginning that the colonel along with a fighter who was a lieutenant was trying to do a freedom of <UNK> exercise along the eastern <UNK> sea but went a little too past the <UNK> air space zone reserved for a rogue middle eastern nation as they fly past it br br i also like all of the <UNK> on the <UNK> fighter radar and computer displays as the enemy aircraft <UNK> picks the two american fighter pilots into an engagement for <UNK> their <UNK> that first <UNK> immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot movie top gun from the <UNK> of the enemy <UNK> to the enemy thirty rounds that struck the <UNK> jet <UNK> and forcing the plane down forcing him to <UNK> all of this reminds us of one thing <UNK> fighter techniques can keep you alive but one false move can cause you to be shot down br br the only problem in the movie was the snake sequence scene it was a little bit too long yes the movie's opening was great when you see the conflict which was the <UNK> engagement only when one boy tells doug masters that his father was shot down after the <UNK> planes landed in the snake race forces us back to the time the conflict already started i guess the snake sequence in the middle should be interrupted a little bit by <UNK> masters being dragged in <UNK> in the middle of the desert on his way to the <UNK> center while the music sequence for the snake continues the film does not do it if it were the details would have been <UNK> at that point still good otherwise br br when word found out that <UNK> ted masters trial for high <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> air <UNK> was over and he was condemned to be hung on the <UNK> in three days doug masters decides to go into action with the air force having <UNK> attempts to save the man doug decides to pull his friends and <UNK> <UNK> played by louis <UNK> jr for a plan to rescue masters <UNK> a high chance of facing a court martial and spending more than a year in a military <UNK> he goes against air force policy and makes a plan to rescue masters without <UNK> of the u s government br br doug and his friends sneak into several classified areas of the base to get plenty of stuff on the area where masters is held for the upcoming hanging and the surrounding area around which turns out to be a fake middle eastern country for the movie one plan included shooting off <UNK> outside the air force <UNK> area as a <UNK> to get classified photos and <UNK> stuff on the fighter aircraft fighter base intelligence and all of the other military stuff around br br when all was said and done and <UNK> studied all of the intelligence he almost <UNK> at that plan because doug was way too cocky not until they get the two f 16 planes and tried a dry run across a firing range that i realized what they were going to do overseas i realized that fighter shooting and bomb dropping is not good until he hears rock music i can remember when he dropped one <UNK> <UNK> bomb on a <UNK> target and the bomb missed by 20 feet i realized that doug is unusual he likes music when he fires the fighter <UNK> br br the last part of the conflict the final <UNK> action in iron eagle was better than top <UNK> climax of the hostile <UNK> sequences i liked the way the final conflict <UNK> especially when doug masters faces off with an middle eastern ace fighter pilot who actually ran the trial against ted masters short but sweet when doug took the enemy fighter out after a second try by a side missile looks like this colonel was akin to darth vader in star wars in the air he can be very evil because if you have seen star wars darth vader was actually <UNK> skywalker who was an ace pilot in space unusual <UNK> for this but still works
<START> i came across the last stop one day at a video store and they were selling it for only 2 i decided to give it a try and bought it it was pretty good i enjoyed it the story is about several people all caught in a cabin somewhere in nowhere because of a raging <UNK> there is a police officer nancy his ex girlfriend two brothers that just got out of jail a older man and his lover a black man and the couple that owns the <UNK> and their <UNK> son that never speaks suddenly someone is found to be murdered and a bag full of cash is found everyone is a suspect the last stop is a pretty good thriller i would give it 8 10
<START> i borrowed this on dvd from a friend the other day i didn't really know what to expect i haven't seen a lot of russian movies and i don't think i've ever seen a russian war movie maybe that made me expect something different something more along the line of an imagined russian mentality but whatever those expectations came from they were put to shame as this is a quite ordinary war movie br br the whole formula of following a few young people from their <UNK> through training to <UNK> and through some battles is well known we have seen it done both many years ago as well as more recently as with <UNK> sure there's a difference here because the movie is about russian soldiers instead of americans as is almost always the case but in general this could just as easily have been a vietnam movie i guess that just <UNK> my feeling that afghanistan was the soviet <UNK> vietnam a country that should have been a <UNK> for a <UNK> made the war drag on for years with terrible loss of life both for soldiers and civilians br br the good points in this movie i felt were good photography there are some beautiful ambiance shots and decent effects for what i guess must have been a rather low budget movie what made me disappointed is mostly the story itself it just doesn't manage to stir any emotion in me mostly because the character development is lousy and to really feel something when people are <UNK> down you have to make them people not just <UNK> cardboard <UNK> they fail to do that in this movie also it's overly long and that seems to a kind of trend lately in my opinion a movie that's more than two hours long has to have a lot to offer and this movie doesn't cut it also there is a disturbing music that's put like a wet <UNK> over every scene especially in the action scenes this is highly disturbing not that you need action music but something more than just slow keyboard music would be nice otherwise the production values were good enough that was not where the problem was br br i don't know how to view this movie as a reminder of the fact that no matter where you are war sucks that russian film makers have already watched too many american war movies to make something original regardless of which this movie is rather clich√©d lacks in spirit and while it has acceptable technical qualities it lacks in script and character development in the end it just becomes another of all those war movies that fails to make you think and fails to add something to the genre i've seen a lot worse but a lot better too i rate this 4 10
<START> the cell is weak on plot filled with holes and has pretty lousy acting as well but none of this matters for director <UNK> has given us one of the most visually stunning movies ever the whole plot is just an excuse to let fool around and take you into the minds of a serial killer bringing the audience some shocking pleasing breath taking and mind blowing images br br the images from this beautiful movie will stick with you for a long time to come this movie is a perfect case for the suspension of disbelief theory forget the silly plot just let your senses be overwhelmed with the images and j lo looks stunning enough to add to the rest of work the cinematography is harrowing the music haunting the costumes just stunning br br the movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art its just that the medium is not <UNK> anymore it is the big screen and celluloid one of the most refreshing movies of this decade the cell is a must watch a bold new step in movie making br br an enthralling 8
<START> for those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships <UNK> <UNK> street is a must see br br by training the spotlight on his own family block covers <UNK> that is off limits for most filmmakers he explores a common but often <UNK> family dynamic and does so without <UNK> to <UNK> or <UNK> in fact the film is <UNK> low key at the outset br br in addition to providing a <UNK> look at one family and by <UNK> every family block has also <UNK> a very specific period in recent history i don't know if this was intentional but <UNK> due to <UNK> content br br highly recommended
<START> after watching <UNK> <UNK> i had many feelings but most notably i felt <UNK> i have heard so much hype about this movie but i came to find it lacking don't get me wrong i can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film but as far as depth and emotion i was not so impressed i found the characters to be <UNK> and unrealistic which <UNK> from the dramatic effect in addition the fact that the war was fake led me to feel that the emotion was not real dramatic war movies in my opinion are much more effective if the events not necessarily the story itself really happened i find that of all the movies that try to show the brutality this one falls in the middle as far as <UNK>
<START> there was a time when not all animation was disney or pixar its so nice to see this wonderful film again and i actually got hold of a good reasonable copy on dvd be careful as its out of the public <UNK> and there are some really bad copies around i got a very good copy by a company called flashbacks and its quite good in the old days i watched it on black and white on tv and its magic to see it in colour very much better than some would have you believe the songs are delightful and the colour is great interestingly the characters are really well developed which is odd in animated movies i loved and the villain mr <UNK> is a real <UNK> its incredibly imaginative the way <UNK> objects like <UNK> <UNK> old <UNK> become part of the environment and have new functions is great the use of insects is amazing considering the much creatures most people sadly think are <UNK> hopefully we may never step on an <UNK> again the insects enemy is man in reality of course its the insects that will survive no matter how hard we try to rid ourselves of ants here in australia they keep coming back the battle has been lost and we have to live with them there are several scenes that stand out such as when and mr <UNK> are caught in a <UNK> can the great <UNK> and the journey to the top of the building are all wonderful its also rather <UNK> but in a way thats charming the human characters look very like the ones in <UNK> and its incredibly effective the wedding scene looks beautiful its a crime this movie has not been <UNK> as a classic the only jarring note for me is the occasions in the film when the characters slip into <UNK> speaking <UNK> <UNK> the narration and it was no needed the <UNK> is awful and <UNK> an other wise good script its great and kids will love it its a joy to look at there's a very clever ending too
<START> this film was so well paced that i don't think i actually <UNK> while watching one intense situation after another kept me glued to the set however i would have liked to have seen corey <UNK> a lot more in this picture he just steals every scene that he is in this could be my favorite grown up corey performance the ending was clever and unlike other films which back away from <UNK> body parts of likeable supporting characters this film goes for it i liked that it was not graphic blood and gore but left more to the viewer's imagination bravo i literally had to wipe sweat from my <UNK> during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter ultimately the film works because of its likeable lead character and the awesome presence of my all time favorite bad guy james <UNK> 48 hours remember i strongly recommend this film for anyone looking to break a sweat br br
<START> tv movies generally do not receive as much recognition or credit as great films and it is usually for good reason but the 1996 hbo movie the late shift is easily one of the best tv movies ever based on bill <UNK> revealing book the late shift is about <UNK> handling of late night talk show <UNK> david <UNK> and jay leno when it came to filling the <UNK> tonight show seat once held by johnny carson we see what happens in front of the camera author bill carter director betty thomas and hbo show us what happened when the cameras were turned off br br unfortunately we can never really know for sure what really happened when it came time for johnny carson to be replaced by either <UNK> or leno but the late shift gives us an interesting possible reality while simply being a very well made film the late shift also does a really good job of portraying all the sides fairly equally although you wonder if the film makes <UNK> and leno out to be too nice of guys especially leno who seems a bit too <UNK> br br the performances are also very good in a very deserving golden globe winning performance kathy bates plays <UNK> extremely <UNK> manager helen who according to carter and the book film was very <UNK> for the studio and leno the real actually suited bill carter for over this portrayal john michael <UNK> breaks out of his usual <UNK> of getting small quirky comedy parts and gives an excellent performance as david <UNK> giving an excellent impression of <UNK> but also creating a dimensional and <UNK> character daniel <UNK> gives a good performance as leno but does not quite measure up to some of the other talent in the film <UNK> probably did the best anyone could have done it is just looks hammy whenever anyone tries to do an impression or portrayal of leno bob <UNK> a <UNK> warren <UNK> treat williams a magician like michael and ed <UNK> jr a pompous rod <UNK> also give memorable supporting performances br br the late shift certainly is one of the best made for tv movies i have ever seen i suppose if one has not watched david <UNK> or jay leno the late shift might not be for them but it is an interesting film for those who get into the late night politics something that has recently <UNK> its ugly head yet again with the 2009 10 conan leno nbc <UNK>
<START> this is my first review on imdb com and probably first ever written review of a film i've done of my own <UNK> not for some class assignment i think that fact alone says something about this movie not a good thing i am no seasoned journalist or critic though i have seen my fair share of movies but i found this particular film so terribly painful to watch it was necessary for my own peace of mind to <UNK> about the experience where better to do it than imdb as i forced myself to sit through the movie physically <UNK> from the inability to connect the <UNK> i was sure there would be some light at the end of the tunnel a revelation to explain what in ll was going on the movie ended and i was as <UNK> as dog after several <UNK> to review certain scenes i still could conclude nothing sensible i found myself wanting to yell does this make sense to anybody i would recommend to not waste your time but then again if i were you i'd probably want to experience it myself if that's the case bring a <UNK> puzzle or something so you don't get bored
<START> the original story had all the ingredients to make a thoroughly gripping film but failed miserably in this version as even <UNK> was a pale imitation of what she was to become so much so that i suspected that she must turn out to be an <UNK> right to the end sherlock holmes was turned into a warrior quite unlike anything every suggested by sir arthur <UNK> doyle in fact it was doctor watson who showed what little common sense that was going the boot <UNK> midget from the islands looked as though he could not fight his way out of a paper bag and what the villain was doing taking tea in baker street for a denouement was beyond anything that the old scotland yard could ever have <UNK> up so <UNK> this tv film to their black museum please
<START> filmmakers made a rather boring <UNK> story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home at the same time we're exposed to a truly original existential french loner br br the film is more than a documentary hardly ever do i feel that i've experienced something that's accidentally profound which makes it all the more profound br br film has visually interesting interior moments absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on quite a lot of europeans in the credits hopefully <UNK> will screen this so that it reaches a wider audience in the usa
<START> from reading the back of the box my first thought was that this is probably a knock off of saw 2 i couldn't be further from the truth it seemed to me like they gave somebody with a camera phone and 10 00 and told them to make a movie the plot didn't exist and neither did the acting it was almost as if i was watching a silent film about grass growing it didn't surprise me at all to find out later that the entire film was improvised by the end of this film i had lost the will to live and i may have gotten aids just from viewing this piece of cinematic crap it was about 70 minutes that i could have spent doing something that was less painful like jumping off of a building
<START> i went to see this because of snipes <UNK> but honestly chaos is terrible this movie has absolutely nothing going for it it should not have been made br br don't read this review if you don't want to read spoilers cause i'm going to address a lot of plot holes here br br first of all the opening scene it's the great big event that made the two semi lead characters <UNK> and snipes turn crooked but it's boring and mundane only at the very end we get to see what really happened and by the time you won't care anymore also this whole event where one bad guy and his hostage get killed is hardly big enough news to fill hundreds of newspaper <UNK> as referred to in the movie br br then the bank job it doesn't get off the ground for any second the bank <UNK> makes some un needed references to chaos theory which has nothing to do with the whole story by the way the way <UNK> gets <UNK> is very <UNK> hard with a <UNK> but more boring then the things that happen in the bank are strange and pointless what's with the safety <UNK> box there seems to be some plot unfolding there but then it doesn't why go through the trouble of <UNK> up two people when it leads to nothing it involves a lot of <UNK> and it's used for nothing at all why doesn't the <UNK> leader listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to stand down br br and this is only the first 10 minutes it keeps getting worse and worse br br the whole romantic love interest story with the <UNK> wasn't just a better cop he was a better man' remark to finish it of is painful to watch it's just pointless why would <UNK> character point out the change in camera position in the footage reviewed from the bank this essentially leads to finding the that will get him all the money why go through the trouble of <UNK> some guys signature and killing him but then not kill the guy that can identify you br br i could go on for ages really but it's like this movie is pointless the whole script is a mess the <UNK> references to chaos theory are really laughable and quite pathetic the plot <UNK> can be seen from miles away and the lead characters seem to be making mistakes all the time it is really painful to watch a movie like this where the audience is taken for granted as dumb popcorn <UNK> people of which the director hopes they won't see all the plot holes and the over all ridiculous script the <UNK> at the end only adds to insult it is really really not a good movie in any way br br people who come to see an action film don't get what they come for people who come to see a cop buddy movie don't get it people who come to see a smart thriller don't get that in essence everyone gets the same a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money do yourself a favor and skip this one
<START> i love this movie i just saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and had to <UNK> it so that my sister could watch it this movie is so funny there are two times that i was laughing so hard my sides hurt i didn't expect to watch a movie so funny i really only wanted to see it because laura <UNK> is in it i first saw her in <UNK> which is an awesome movie as well br br like others reviewers have said too many people are expecting a deep moving film you are not going to get it what you will get is humor eye candy and the chance to ask yourself exactly what your perfect mate would look like if you could create them you can also wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex br br a hilarious sequence involves <UNK> first seeing herself as a naked man i was cracking up br br i swear this movie is the most imaginative teen film that i have ever seen and it is now my favorite br br just remember why movies were originally created as entertainment not philosophy in motion remember this and you will have a great time watching virtual sexuality
<START> i viewed linda and it is a top rate movie the lives of paul and his wife linda who he <UNK> as a young man and finally married they meet another married couple jeff and stella and the <UNK> become very good friends but their friendship takes a twisted turn after <UNK> together at beach a twist that never returns the married couples to their former status as friends br br linda is a must see the acting by virginia madsen is acceptable however richard thomas steals the movie with his incredible acting and the emotions that he displays br br a wonderful movie <UNK> honey
<START> <UNK> from heaven is a light comedy that uses exaggeration of human <UNK> to entertain the audience throughout the film there is the expectation that goodness will surface in each situation the result is that the movie goer finds himself herself sitting with this silly grin on his her face peace in his her heart and high expectations for human kind watching this movie was a most pleasant experience i would venture to say uplifting experience but some would say that sounds corny
<START> the twins effect is a vampire martial arts movie available in <UNK> with english subtitles it is a jackie chan production and he does make a special guest appearance although it is not for those that liked shanghai <UNK> knights and the other recent hollywood flicks he has become known for this film is a lot more special than that br br it was originally called the vampire effect but as a very popular chinese female pop duo called the twins <UNK> <UNK> and gillian <UNK> took the two leading roles the title was changed to cash in on their fame br br the film will appeal to three types of audience those who love martial arts films those who love vampire films and those who <UNK> the rubbish films hollywood generally <UNK> out br br the premise for the film is that vampires are about and a secret society seeks to hunt them down before we all become <UNK> for the undead this bloody work is carried out by some martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the edge they need well it must be <UNK> work things are going pretty much for the course until a particularly nasty european <UNK> finds out that he if he <UNK> a set of keys held by all the vampire <UNK> then he can walk around in <UNK> etc and generally eat when ever he wants to to say anymore on the plot would spoil the enjoyment of watching the film br br the twins consist of one assigned vampire <UNK> <UNK> and the sister <UNK> of another it is the twins that really make the film with some of the <UNK> and funniest acting going the fight scenes they carry out are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of genuine <UNK> and wire work to add the <UNK> on the cake the twins are both quite lovely to watch too br br the direction is crisp and the script is sharp there are only 3 things that let this film down the make up for the vampires is quite poor jackie chan seems to be in the film just for the hell of it and adds nothing to its content and some of the slapstick comedy attempted by the male vampire hunter is quite lame thankfully the twins save the day bringing an originality to the film normally only found in european films the best scene for me was one of them <UNK> <UNK> only by screaming her ability to convey her thoughts through this medium was a comic delight br br their are many other touches of originality in this film i particularly liked the coffin complete with surround sound <UNK> and tv screen and it is the <UNK> many original touches and acting that stops this from being a tired old flop and turns it into a must see movie
<START> i had the misfortune to see this film recently and have to sit through it a friend purchased it for <UNK> and insisted we watch it as it sounded good from the story on the back cover br br 10 minutes into the film it was apparent that the actors were amateurs and this was an extremely low budget effort br br the scenes were very poorly acted the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes which seemed unnecessarily long just so the movie would be of a reasonable length br br for instance when the lead character <UNK> a warehouse the film spends a ridiculous amount of time on this scene with meaningless dialogue which serves no real purpose or necessity to the plot br br the lead actor is supposedly carrying out revenge on a woman who sleeps with guys to give them hiv he never once thinks to get tested instead he turns into a crazed killer deciding to torture her before killing her and <UNK> her into pieces br br if this sounds good and you are thinking this will have lots of gore think again this film has no real gory sequences and is quite tame for this type of film br br it does not scare it does not make you think it does not offer fast paced fun it may however put you to sleep it is certain to bore you to tears so please save yourself the despair and follow my heading br br avoid this film 1 2 out of 10 this does not deserve even 1 br br the film was <UNK> minutes but seemed as if it was 2 1 2 hours
<START> saw this movie last night i don't usually comment good or bad as i think movies are like books in that there is something for everyone and everyone is different tastes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this movie was bad by the end i thought oh my this is testing my patience how many women really look and live like this when they hit rock bottom and if i could just borrow some cash from mum and carry out to live my fashion <UNK> dreams gosh life would be great i was out for a nice chick date flick with my girl my darling <UNK> likes watching movies together and i knew this wouldn't be his thing something light and easy on the senses but this was one bad movie we are intelligent and interesting movie <UNK> and this movie wasn't that <UNK> <UNK> is a great actress she held her own bad bad
<START> see dick work br br see jane work br br dick and jane are married br br they are successful br br they have a son br br they have a nice house br br they have a latino <UNK> br br the <UNK> teaches spanish to the son br br the son speaks spanish br br ha ha br br see dick get promoted br br the pompous <UNK> is a crook br br see dick take the fall for the pompous <UNK> br br jane <UNK> her job br br <UNK> br br see dick and jane out of work br br dick jane turn to crime br br as a plot device they decide to rob the <UNK> br br see the robbery get <UNK> br br see dick jane <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> plan with the money from the robbery br br <UNK> see the end credits br br okay so you've got the plot beyond that dick and jane <UNK> from one scene to the next one barely connecting with the last one or the next one the whole thing is terribly episodic in nature br br jim carrey didn't bother to bring his a material he just seems bored and slightly ashamed of the whole thing but heck when you're getting paid 20 million plus why bother tea <UNK> is frantic i guess i would be frantic not to get blamed for this flop br br there's just something sort of off about dick jane carrey and <UNK> aren't funny and have little chemistry the script isn't funny and it's not well plotted br br but it may be bigger than that the reality of dick and jane is perhaps a little too real maybe it's just not funny for people to lose their jobs in an <UNK> like situation when real life still lacks a happy ending
<START> the lovely yet lethal alexandra stunning <UNK> blonde beauty <UNK> randall who looks absolutely <UNK> in a tight black leather outfit must find a magic <UNK> so her evil demonic master <UNK> can cross over into our dimension it's up to <UNK> rugged cop jonathan graves likable peter to stop her meanwhile two <UNK> unfunny comic relief dwarf <UNK> creatures run amok in los angeles seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert jim <UNK> relates the <UNK> inane story at a <UNK> pace and takes none of this <UNK> remotely seriously the cast struggle <UNK> with the silly material the adorable barbara <UNK> woods as sassy <UNK> police captain kate <UNK> as <UNK> sexy hooker <UNK> bobby <UNK> as <UNK> bumbling <UNK> partner <UNK> peggy as <UNK> museum <UNK> monica and ace mask as the jolly dr <UNK> mark <UNK> cookie cutter script an <UNK> <UNK> sense of no <UNK> humor chuck <UNK> <UNK> score the two dwarf guys sporting obvious cheap rubber halloween masks j e plain cinematography no tension or gratuitous female nudity to speak of and the tacky less than special effects all further enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this prime slice of celluloid <UNK> an <UNK> brainless piece of <UNK> lousy dreck
<START> <UNK> bobby was not a bobby was a <UNK> <UNK> a highlight of my childhood day <UNK> to <UNK> was to go to the <UNK> to bobby i grew up with the story of the <UNK> and loyal little dog as every child in my generation did and i remember <UNK> up with my mum outside the cinema with many many other <UNK> children and their <UNK> to see the wonderful disney film how could a movie based on such a wonderful story have been made using a for <UNK> sake that's like making a movie about the life of robert burns for instance and portraying him as an <UNK> i say give bobby back his breed
<START> first i want to clear a common <UNK> it is not unrealistic that the school <UNK> goes to gives students at my school those in grade 7 and higher must have apple this is <UNK> for in the entrance <UNK> moving on this show is very annoying it has boring predictable plots and bad acting often in the show it brings girl power to a new high with girls beating guys in everything they try but that is not the worst the worst is that girls are nevertheless all portrayed as being focused on their personal appearances and screaming whenever they are happy except for the one smart girl who is portrayed as a freak who is obsessed with ugly boys and science however this show is very <UNK> i do not know why but it is although the most recent season has been so terrible bringing the stereotypes boring plots and bad acting to extremes i never thought were <UNK> so i am no longer addicted thankfully
<START> i believe the production value is ok probably deserves a 4 10 or 5 10 it's <UNK> filmed featuring good looking people with model quality and a little class br br but the premise let me annoyed a decent woman would do such dirt i mean she is gonna marry a man who would have sex with another woman br br and what's more serious she is also active in the behavior only in de mind the film also have many aspects that makes eastern europeans seem <UNK> br br after all it's just movie if it doesn't intend to <UNK> women in general i will give one more point but obviously it does br br conclusion a nasty piece of crap with a little taste
<START> another of those flimsy stories coupled with most forgettable musical numbers powell and <UNK> as battling <UNK> are quite forgettable however there are two shining moments <UNK> castle is the most incredible <UNK> walker you will ever see his drunken walk on the wire has to be the most spectacular piece of <UNK> ever recorded on film he has to be seen to be believed the other is sophie tucker doing a turn near the end of the film her <UNK> her <UNK> her sheer talent at being herself well charisma is not learned you have it or you don't a great lesson for all would be <UNK> artists a sad note w c fields in his last film cameo is completely forgettable
<START> this documentary was neither <UNK> nor <UNK> made the whole thing played out like a conspiracy theory by <UNK> to win the match in question just to make some money <UNK> <UNK> has an ego problem he was <UNK> up before the match and when he lost he didn't like it i remember playing chess against computers back in the 80s and it wasn't too difficult to win as time went on i started to lose and didn't like it today i simply don't play against computers anymore because they're just too good not only that the games are uninteresting and lack the appeal of human games where both sides are more likely to <UNK> and open the game to exciting possibilities this documentary keeps showing us images of the which is an ancient chess playing <UNK> that was really controlled by a human being from the start until the end we are lead to believe that <UNK> short of literally <UNK> a human <UNK> in the back of their <UNK> sized computer i'm a computer scientist and take offense at the notion that just because <UNK> lost <UNK> must have cheated i know how computers play chess it's not magic and it's no mystery they can be trained have huge amounts of chess knowledge and they most certainly see positions and possibilities in <UNK> detail compared to humans it's really no surprise that deep blue won perhaps at the time it was if it happened today given the ever increasing <UNK> power of machines people would hardly blink if a machine couldn't at least draw with a <UNK> today people would think the program was weak
<START> in logan <UNK> plays roy <UNK> the new kid in school who has just moved from montana but florida is a lot different from montana despite is troubles in <UNK> in roy discovers a bigger problem a new franchise restaurant is coming to town and families of <UNK> <UNK> are in trouble can the new kid a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a runaway cody stop big business from destroying these home br br this movie was pretty good the kids logan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and cody are the real stars of this film luke wilson officer is okay but really does not have a very big part neither does robert wagner mayor or jimmy <UNK> mr ryan br br nevertheless this was a fun film that the whole family will enjoy for a first time producer i thought jimmy <UNK> put together a quality piece of work plus the <UNK> were really cute
<START> the recent release of mad dog morgan on troma dvd is disappointing this appears to be a <UNK> print for television viewing some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic dvd version mad dog morgan deserves to be released on dvd in the original theatrical cut however even as released on dvd the film is still one of the better depictions of <UNK> life in <UNK> century australia after having <UNK> the old melbourne <UNK> with death masks of <UNK> on display it is mad dog morgan that comes to mind
<START> i was sorely disappointed in this movie twice i was to walk out because segments of the movie were so and depressing the movie has elements that <UNK> to all the <UNK> things in life pornography murder suicide <UNK> hatred gang <UNK> the graphic nature of the violence in this movie was particularly disturbing br br and richard does a great <UNK> to the lds church in portraying <UNK> attitudes commitment <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> br br my biggest <UNK> to this movie however was that it is the exact opposite of a feel good movie br br god's army one was okay his <UNK> city was quite good this movie in terms of casting acting and drama was his best but in terms of being inspiring or uplifting it was as awful as it could be in fact this movie so me that i am sorry i went i have lost interest in ever again supporting in an lds themed movie with a ticket purchase
<START> it is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in 2005 this one came out a day before that other one with tom cruise didn't they do that with truman capote the same year and the zodiac killer last year interesting br br writer director david michael didn't have steven spielberg's budget and c thomas <UNK> is not tom cruise this is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that <UNK> million worldwide br br the action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of <UNK> who played a <UNK> that was giving up on his god br br gary busey was creepy as an army lt
<START> this movie from what i remember was such a great movie i watched it on television when i was 11 and couldn't remember the title of it if i remember correctly i do believe that it was a christmas television movie special one of my friends at work and i were discussing it several years back but neither one of us could remember the title but we did remember almost the entire movie no one else at work remembered ever seeing it thank goodness someone at a tv movie website answered my post now i have the fun job of <UNK> a copy of it it's amazing what you can remember as a child but this movie definitely remains vividly playing in my head even after 28 years and i do believe i only watched it once maybe it was because i am the oldest sister in my family or maybe because i <UNK> and worked in day care centers that it stuck with me that long regardless of the real reason it has remained one of the movies that i have been really wanting to watch lately if anyone knows where to watch it online or has a copy please let me know i would so love to see it again thanks so much seriously i tried to post this and it says my comment isn't long enough so apparently i have to type more did you know that melissa is the sister of peter <UNK> who starred in a christmas story i know i'm not the only fan of this movie so if anyone has any idea on where to find this i would greatly appreciate it
<START> absolute <UNK> of a movie and given its age years ahead of its time i first saw this the week my dad came home with a <UNK> tv that the guy had thrown on the <UNK> heap a with all things <UNK> dad had it working inside two days this was july 1955 and then probably only the third house in the street to have television pretty much the first thing we ever saw on that grainy and <UNK> old 12 inch screen was this film it's pretty old dear i recall my mom telling me br br almost 50 years on and it doesn't seem any older rather like world war i in that respect terrific little fantasy about a london <UNK> carrying thirteen passengers that crashes killing one of their number then in flashback we pick up on the lives of these people and what brought them to being on this bus that very day br br returning to the crash at the end of the film the <UNK> identity is revealed perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 movie the list of adrian <UNK> br br if ever you come across this little gem i suggest you watch it
<START> i can imagine what happened for this film to come into being a bunch of studio guys are sitting around drinking <UNK> and <UNK> maybe a joint and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a film that would bridge the generation gap which at that time was about as far apart as <UNK> <UNK> and mick jagger something that both college age rebels and their parents would find equally interesting for different reasons perhaps but still a ticket is a ticket what interested hippies asia philosophy <UNK> and wild sets and costumes what interested their parents musicals eye candy a feel good script and nostalgia very well then lost horizon the old classic as a musical in color can't miss right it was a bomb lost horizon by james hilton is perhaps less than a classic but not a bad novel in broad terms he sketches out a <UNK> society in <UNK> la the valley of the blue moon near <UNK> inhabited by <UNK> <UNK> villagers who serve an <UNK> of i very i long lived monks <UNK> into paradise is a <UNK> island like of <UNK> a veteran of wwi a <UNK> etc each with their own spin on the situation what plot there is concerns the reaction of each of them to being presented with a choice to live in paradise or try to return to the <UNK> of the <UNK> century taken on its own terms it's gentle pop lit fluff presenting <UNK> own conservative british views in oriental dress as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie as captive <UNK> guests of the monks the <UNK> are forbidden to leave the valley but never pressed into work or <UNK> not that the monks do too much of that themselves treated <UNK> and given simple yet <UNK> who'd want to escape in this middle american heaven on earth the monks are both <UNK> and wise the climate is warm the food is <UNK> and tasty the villagers are <UNK> and nothing ever changes the nuns are <UNK> but encouraged to look pretty and even <UNK> a bit the reason given is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of <UNK> sex i've ever read even their religion is <UNK> revealed as a best of both worlds blend of christianity and <UNK> there's little to offend any but the <UNK> or the <UNK> out there who actually knew something about <UNK> which in the early thirties was a very small number br br as a <UNK> film <UNK> on the adventure character interplay angles it was enchanting and perhaps steven could have made it fly if he'd been around as an early seventies hollywood product the adventure was over too quickly and the updated <UNK> of characters too bland to make much of an impression <UNK> of the <UNK> suggestive qualities of classic b w the monastery resembles a de beauty <UNK> in white and pale blue and while at least some of the <UNK> <UNK> tried for historical accuracy most of the rest of the inmates looked as if on their way to a morning <UNK> and bath with a couple of holes of golf in the afternoon maybe <UNK> <UNK> could have restored some <UNK> to the story playing up the very real conflict inside each character's reaction just five years afterwards brian would have captured the <UNK> atmosphere to a t instead bert and hal david were given the job of writing the songs which marry <UNK> like <UNK> with some of the new <UNK> lyrics ever penned quite naturally for the time every song calls for a dance number which range from the merely forgettable to the completely boring and so is the script which has not one line worth <UNK> br br tie ins with this movie were legion there were everything from to posters planned to promote this film and such was the hype that i actually went out and bought the album just about the only thing good i can say about it is that it made enough of an impression on me to write this review completely from memory nearly thirty years after the next month i read bought a copy of the and hence learned about real <UNK> culture <UNK> br br
<START> i first watched this show hoping for a few laughs good acting and good plot sadly i got none of those things br br first off this show is completely unrealistic how can someone go to a <UNK> school that's super hip awesome location and barely any rules plus a <UNK> bar a <UNK> bar no school has a <UNK> bar and what's up with the huge ultra cool ultra hip <UNK> rooms this doesn't happen in <UNK> schools everyone in this show seems to be perfect <UNK> looks perfect has the perfect friends never has to do <UNK> and is super popular sounds more like a villain to me i hate how they use so many <UNK> in this show example dana the <UNK> chick she is completely ignorant and wears edgy clothes the jokes are old <UNK> old too i wouldn't watch this show if i were you it's one of the most horrible shows i have ever watched and i hope it gets canceled soon rating 1 10
<START> this movie <UNK> the soul of modern elite even though the movie is 17 years old the standing principle in the movie is food is more than just <UNK> matter it is also a powerful symbol and a medium for culture itself the main characters literally get drunk on the finest wine and food become inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture as they let go of their <UNK> and passion denying table manners karen makes use of the difference between north europe and south europe to point out their <UNK> different approaches to food as the strict and and rather dull get <UNK> with <UNK> from south the party gets going so what are you waiting for go watch it again
<START> it is hard to believe that anyone could take such a great book and and make such a terrible movie br br imagine king kong being <UNK> as an <UNK> monkey and fay <UNK> part being played by a young boy how about <UNK> john as rambo this movie is even worse than the tv remake of the night of the hunter br br by using the title <UNK> and dean name the makers of this movie should be <UNK> for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book br br read the book i have never talked to anyone who didn't like it another good book is the winner by david
<START> cannibal <UNK> 1 outta 5 stars miserable excuse for a movie which you might enjoy if you really like boring nonsensical jungle movies <UNK> up with scenes of graphic violence a pair of drug dealers on the run from the mob travel to the <UNK> of <UNK> to search for and cocaine they meet up with another young <UNK> and his two hot babe <UNK> one of whom is an <UNK> seeking to prove <UNK> that <UNK> does not and has not ever existed one of the two dealers turns out to be a bit of a psychopath and he <UNK> and kills a couple of natives in order to get them to tell him where they hide their <UNK> and how they could even tell him when he doesn't seem to speak their language in the first place well the natives are suddenly not too thrilled with white folks in their jungle and capture them all for some torture poor acting poor plot and poor direction not a decent moment of suspense in the whole dreary 90 minutes even the special effects are not particularly convincing though a couple of shots will still make most viewers cringe the only good scene in the whole movie is when the two women are imprisoned in a mud <UNK> and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their rendition of red river valley the following is a quote from the movie but i wouldn't be surprised if many viewers weren't saying exactly the same thing by that point oh god please let her die soon oh let her die soon and let me die soon too please
<START> no gore no blood no <UNK> death scenes dumb dumb dumb dumb dear god sitting through this movie made me sick sick sick sick very boring extremely boring br br <UNK> not even a humorous aspect to this film i cant find a good thing to say about it other than the lead guy had a nice body i guess definitely not worth the fifty cents i paid to rent it
<START> wow this movie is bad think <UNK> with ninjas the worst part is when a sword is supposed to be floating in <UNK> but you can see the strings or maybe the worst part is the gigantic eye <UNK> that looks like a coaster that the good ninja wears actually there are so many bad parts i can't make up my mind which is the worst i can't believe anyone actually put up the money to have this thing made the only redeeming value is that it is good to laugh at
<START> beats me how people can describe this adolescent exercise as film noir true there's a gun a bottle a dame the lead is a private eye but that ain't what makes the genre folks this thing plays like <UNK> tv cop show stuff lots of bloody beating lousy continuity with a dash of <UNK> memories thrown in pretty hard to watch beyond the first 10 minutes you want contemporary feel watch anything by john <UNK>
<START> who reads these comments may think we may have in hand a great movie i am portuguese and i'm ashamed that this film became a blockbuster in <UNK> it can't really call this cinema the direction and <UNK> en scene is basic even ron howard does better the script is bad and pretentious a really bad tarantino the cast is covered in tv stars models and reality show stars that don't no nothing about acting when you put in a movie this ingredients of course that the fans of this kind of tv shows will all go see i am also surprised that people who make comments here in imdb say that this movie is a masterpiece i thought that this site was only for people who truly like cinema and understand a little bit of it all the movies made to be blockbusters in always use the same ingredients and are always awful if you think this movie is reasonable please don't say your love movies and cinema
<START> i really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it it is just not available and it has not been on tv for many many years i enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there br br my 12 year old daughter just the music and is <UNK> with some of the songs someday i hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it oh would i love to see it again too br br
<START> this video has heartfelt memories it has a great cast and all the actors did a great job i have been searching to buy this video if anybody knows of where i can purchase please e mail me i really want to add this to my collection
<START> ninja hunter aka wu <UNK> vs ninja is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous characters nonsensical plot and lack of any <UNK> whatsoever the makers of this film have given us a truly <UNK> masterpiece which has to be seen to be believed br br the plot <UNK> around wu <UNK> villain <UNK> white who wants to destroy the shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist in order to do so he teams up with a clan of ninjas led by three masters ¬ñ gold ninja white <UNK> ninja and black ninja ¬ñ and succeeds in destroying the shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants however there are some survivors it is their job to pass on the knowledge of the shaolin finger <UNK> to a new generation who must defeat the ninjas and <UNK> white if peace and order is to be restored br br unfortunately <UNK> white is a difficult <UNK> to beat since he is able to make himself virtually <UNK> by sucking the life force out of hot naked chicks an excuse for some welcome gratuitous nudity br br other treats in store for viewers include loads of very impressive fighting despite some of it being <UNK> up some really amazing outfits the aforementioned gold ninja <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> suits and even some <UNK> wearing <UNK> <UNK> a ninja turning into a flying carpet plus some cheesy gore for good measure and i nearly forgot to mention the really impressive <UNK> on display in this movie ¬ñ surely a good reason not to pass up on this gem
<START> a touching love story reminiscent of the mood for <UNK> drawing heavily on chinese poetry and how this is used by eastern people to communicate feelings to each other the story focuses on a <UNK> who wants so much to be a model teacher as well as a good husband and father a senior student is very attracted to him as the story unfolds we see the emotions below the surface in his 20 year marriage and how he <UNK> with the moral <UNK> that face him a beautiful and moving story
<START> it doesn't matter whether drew or <UNK> are total babes but there are a lot of girls who are so pretty and hot but they appear to be so nerdy this movie is not oscar type of movie but it has at least a good point of view of what life is like for young people or for real people it made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are this movie represents the real world and that what really matters
<START> the palestinian situation is <UNK> and as yet largely <UNK> <UNK> for film making <UNK> <UNK> tries hard and gives us an insightful <UNK> into the almost surreal life of those caught up in the troubles but the film amounts to little more than a handful of admittedly lovely visual jokes thrown onto celluloid while the <UNK> between them become increasingly obscure as the film progresses a missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very <UNK> issue
<START> it seems that dee <UNK> ran out of ideas halfway through the script the second half of the movie is basically just a rehash of the first which makes the film very boring to sum up <UNK> daughter is <UNK> into party via where she is sexually <UNK> tortured by psychopath played by <UNK> cop <UNK> her psychopath is put in therapy jail psychopath is released four years later and the whole thing is played out again within all this are many unexplained plot elements why was captain <UNK> psycho in the first place what's with the one time personality <UNK> to bible <UNK> how does he kidnap all the adults and manage to <UNK> their mouths shut without a struggle and perhaps the biggest <UNK> mystery of all how does a man with pink hair hide himself completely behind a <UNK> average build woman these are just some of the questions i had watching this film br br it seems that <UNK> was trying to make some kind of commentary on a the dangers of online <UNK> b the <UNK> of christian sexual <UNK> and c the effect our twisted <UNK> society has on us as individuals if that is so he failed the movie is just too poorly done to entertain never mind convey social messages the torture scenes are stupid and boring <UNK> on silly especially when <UNK> goes into one of his pain and death monologues and everything else is just plain dumb the call <UNK> scene is really lame when are the cops gonna get <UNK> id and <UNK> the young partner of the main cop character is particularly awful he shouldn't be working as an actor basically and the audio in the final showdown scene is really poor i guess they couldn't afford two boom <UNK> br br the rest of the acting is not awful but it's not good either the cop is pretty one note and his detached quality is not quite believable dee <UNK> is actually not too bad but he <UNK> and <UNK> way too much robert englund who deserves way better puts in a somewhat amusing performance of a <UNK> redneck if you're a big robert englund fan the movie is probably worth seeing just for him everyone else is forgettable br br in conclusion we've seen all these plot elements done before and done better in films like silence of the <UNK> <UNK> and texas chainsaw massacre i suggest you rent one of those instead of watching this turkey 3 10 br br
<START> this film revival right march in a bad film industry and <UNK> <UNK> i want to know how the director was able to stand in front of people of the industry after he making this film work was so very bad we do not know how cinema <UNK> companies such as and other does not support <UNK> filmmakers in like we hope in the future to <UNK> film industry in <UNK> <UNK> but without such <UNK> fools <UNK> and idiots make us bad movies do not benefit the reputation of cinema in <UNK> <UNK> is like the roman and iranian cinema at the same time please makers simple experimental cinema in <UNK> <UNK> such as <UNK> and others to achieve the dream of a good film industry to participate in festivals world away from the major companies <UNK> stupid
<START> in the midst of a documentary about his parents the <UNK> mother dies but he continues making the documentary discovering a story he did not <UNK> the result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word where a likable but <UNK> narrator <UNK> <UNK> the audience the narrative thus has a double <UNK> the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary maker br br our admiration is with the filmmaker not only for <UNK> pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship but also for never giving in to <UNK> or melodrama although the stuff of hollywood <UNK> in the details doug block treats the story as he would everyday life for those of us who have always <UNK> about our parents' life before we came on the scene or after we arrived but while we were too self absorbed to notice they had a life independent of ourselves <UNK> <UNK> street gives fair warning there are wondrous things back there in <UNK> but beware if you choose to enter there br br but that caution is for the audience to go slow wandering about in the details of their parents' past it is not a warning for those offered a glimpse into the life of parents the film is a marvel at making the mother come alive as a vibrant and passionate yet <UNK> person who makes her own conscious decisions during the 50's the <UNK> particular success is to make the viewers actually see the young woman behind the elderly parent and <UNK> we all know our parents were once young and <UNK> but in <UNK> <UNK> street the mother is the father who has been distant while the filmmaker and his sister were growing up ultimately remains distant in the film but that is due more to his own <UNK> nature than to his portrayal this biography turned autobiography is dramatic intense and unforgettable sure to send viewers <UNK> for a closer look at their own family albums but more <UNK> about looking at the backs of those photographs
<START> the 1990s film with anthony hopkins and debra <UNK> is rightly <UNK> with praise and i enjoyed it very much but this tv original is just as good and in some ways more appropriately cast claire bloom isn't a <UNK> joy but she is still confident and throwing her cap at her favourite author played by <UNK> <UNK> in one of his best performances br br <UNK> <UNK> and less emotional than the attenborough film this may be but it does justice to what is a marvellous play full of meaningful dialogue you'll still cry to this version but perhaps you won't have the musical <UNK> to set you off br br there's room for both and having seen this on stage i would say that the <UNK> bloom one is slightly more faithful but they're both excellent
<START> ignoring rocky 3 this is easily hulk <UNK> best film and it still rates as one of the worst films ever hulk hogan essentially plays hulk hogan bringing his wrestling buddies in for a film with all the cliches to go along with it the crooked <UNK> the <UNK> monster the injured kid the sexy woman and <UNK>
<START> if you enjoy <UNK> and suspense you will enjoy this movie truth be told it was mostly the adrian paul part that got me to pick it up i knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand plot is sarah <UNK> <UNK> a student of philosophy and <UNK> starts playing a mysterious <UNK> game trying to figure out the reason and gets involved in the game by solving <UNK> <UNK> adrian paul is a shop owner also a <UNK> fanatic and also gets <UNK> in the game myth has it that if you solve the game the meaning of existence referred to as the design is revealed brendan character is a village idiot type hanging around the shop who turns out to be more than he seems all in all i thought the movie was pretty well done and it's definitely an original concept a rare find these days i personally happen to like <UNK> and <UNK> so while most of them weren't very difficult it was still a fun movie well worth the rental br br so if you haven't seen it get it d br br
<START> rendition presents a very <UNK> matter in the form of a very tense thriller it's a gripping and not a preaching movie seeing it in an arab country with a mixture of <UNK> and european audience gave it an extra level of atmosphere the audience was totally <UNK> by the film and gave it a loud applause afterwards the story of an egyptian married to an american picked up on the suspicion of <UNK> to terrorist <UNK> and <UNK> to a friendly with us arab country for enhanced <UNK> as meryl <UNK> character states in the film we have no torture in the us seems to be from the front page of todays news there is a very neat link between the various characters which appear in the movie and the pace of the film never drops the seems to be as stated by jake character in the film that by <UNK> and torturing suspects you create many more terrorists the acting is uniformly excellent with streep and reese <UNK> the stand outs not to be missed
<START> i didn't like watching <UNK> compared to other star <UNK> even enterprise but i didn't like <UNK> 5 and now i know why they are the same show i just read the old news that paramount stole the idea from the creator of <UNK> 5 but they chose not to sue for a reason i don't know or care but seeing as a star trek series is based off another even <UNK> show is just to much to bare now i will <UNK> anyone who even mentions the <UNK> when talking about the series original <UNK> and voyager are my favorites in that order before i didn't understand why everyone thinks <UNK> is great and i didn't but know i know it's also because the captain has a real anger problem and i hate people that act cool but freak out out of no where and he seems to on every episode
<START> you can only describe this with one word and that would be wow wow i really did not think piece of crap like this could ever be released if you watch a movie titled ninja then you expect to see at least some cool martial artists right however none of these guys know any martial arts whatsoever and it seems like they went to china and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in martial arts that's the level of their martial arts skills the actors are way overacting the special effects are ridiculous and there is not any plot that makes any sense this is the worst martial arts movie i've ever seen and i have seen plenty
<START> wow i love this movie this is definitely added to my list of ghetto movies br br juice starring <UNK> 'i don't f ' menace ii society o <UNK> <UNK> smoke anybody i just don't f ' new jersey drive hey they steal cars in broad daylight they obviously don't f br br new jersey drive is the best hood movie ever it is at the top of the list menace ii society is second and juice is third <UNK> is really stupid br br the soundtrack for new jersey drive is too mac mall young lay all about my is heard through out the movie br br <UNK> of the underground burn rubber another good song and so is ill al scratch don't shut down on a player br br if your a fan of <UNK> <UNK> you'll freaking love this movie and the amazing soundtrack the soundtrack is basically rap about stealing cars movie
<START> don't watch this movie expecting the jane austen wit crisp dialog or clever social commentary this time around the premise of <UNK> <UNK> has been updated in a very sensual way br br in this version <UNK> erotic <UNK> are not just silly fantasies but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just <UNK> into with her daylight adventures by day she is very <UNK> and <UNK> and her <UNK> henry treats her with the <UNK> courtesy but as her own sexual nature <UNK> her <UNK> shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid br br at the beginning of the story <UNK> visions of sex are based entirely on the gothic novels she <UNK> in bed it is both heartwarming sexy and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome henry <UNK> into a lurid dream of being carried off and <UNK> by romantic villains at the same time it is <UNK> and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning catherine sleeping <UNK> looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head br br later after being invited to <UNK> castle catherine <UNK> a family argument and totally <UNK> its meaning jumping into bed she covers herself up with the <UNK> and lies awake listening <UNK> her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert little by little however those pretty blue eyes and close as she <UNK> into another <UNK> dream of innocent desire this time catherine dreams she is in <UNK> times waiting <UNK> outside the castle for the approach of the it's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by <UNK> she all but <UNK> with excitement and anticipation but then after a shot of her running <UNK> to escape we are back to the daylight world where the maid is <UNK> her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep it's worth noting that <UNK> heavy eyed <UNK> in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been br br ultimately of course <UNK> stern and unimaginative lover henry the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture it's interesting that <UNK> immediate collapse into tears <UNK> not a <UNK> but an advance into adult relationships in the next scene she <UNK> burns her gothic romance and throws herself and <UNK> onto the bed significantly this turning point is also marked by catherine falling into a deep sleep except that this time there are no dreams of make believe passion presumably catherine has <UNK> enough to be ready for the real thing br br though <UNK> <UNK> has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression and all her performance is charming it must be said that outside of the <UNK> dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull i'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a <UNK> level br br if you'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong <UNK> young heroine who <UNK> real darkness and danger in a real gothic setting i highly recommend the <UNK> <UNK> by elizabeth marie <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> children is the second best <UNK> movie in the <UNK> series i saw the original the <UNK> wives in the theater when it came out in 1975 i was absolutely blown away it was terrific i have seen all of the <UNK> movies and i like all of them i think that the <UNK> children is such a campy and fun movie i just watched it again recently on tape and i enjoyed it immensely the cast in this movie was real good to watch barbara <UNK> did a bang up job as usual every role that she has ever played has been very good barbara <UNK> is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and <UNK> type of person don murray as the husband and father was just perfect in this movie he was particularly effective at being the irritated father to his two teenage children i made sure that i have all of the <UNK> movie on tape to enjoy if you get a chance to see this movie you should
<START> alexander <UNK> 1938 is a brilliant piece of cinematic propaganda the people of russia are threatened by two major enemies the <UNK> and the <UNK> knights of the holy roman empire in ordered to <UNK> the <UNK> rival <UNK> in the russian realm <UNK> takes charge and fights the lesser of two <UNK> the this influential film was copied many times over and it still holds up to this day the soundtrack by composer and direction are a sight and sound to behold many years later john <UNK> used many of the movies scenes set pieces and costumes from this film and <UNK> them into conan br br one of my favorite lines from conan was taken from this movie it's not the strength of the iron in a weapon but the strength of the person that <UNK> it is what matters the comparisons are <UNK> the armor that james earl jones and the leader of the <UNK> knights wear are virtually identical a true tribute paid from one director to another br br i give alexander <UNK> one of my highest <UNK> the movie plays like the final act of richard iii the presence of prince alexander on the screen is truly amazing
<START> a very strange disturbing but intriguing film i don't think i ever needed to see what a human being can do with his butt and i doubt if i'll ever want to see it again that said there is much to be amused by like take on <UNK> classic walk in the girl can't help it and putting <UNK> of meat between her legs in a <UNK> store a gritty feel very much like a russ meyer film generally poor acting with the notable exception of divine
<START> <UNK> has been a main <UNK> in my family for over 26 years we saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since bill murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre teen boy and befriends him while leading his into once mischievous scheme after another the cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other this is not another sleazy dumb teen sex fest it is funny and sweet and just all around fun anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves it is a must see watch out for <UNK> he is by far the best character especially during the camp social while bill murray <UNK> it up for the camera just watch <UNK> behind him dancing with the poor girl he picks to dance with by far one of my very favorite comedies of all time
<START> the <UNK> starts late one night as brother's josh joshua miller kyle jason <UNK> are camping outside with their cousin michael sean <UNK> they decide to pass the time by telling scary stories br br first up is michael with a story entitled <UNK> in which a young boy named danny <UNK> ian fried is <UNK> at school however the sinister new janitor mr <UNK> james karen decides to help him out br br next up is kyle as he tells a strange story called in which an overweight bully with a worrying fascination with dead flies gets what he deserves in a horrible twisted way br br written directed by brian peck the <UNK> didn't do much for me i doubt it'll do much for you either the script is strange as far as episodic <UNK> go instead of the usual three or four stories it only has two main tales a few bizarre <UNK> type mini scenes at the start these consist of the person who orders food from a fast food restaurant only to find a dead rat in her chicken a man who dies of a heart attack on a ride someone who tries to dry her <UNK> off in the <UNK> only for it to explode i have no idea what the purpose of these scenes are but they add nothing to the film as for the two main stories they are both weak for a start they are too long which is a huge mistake in these types of films usually the stories in <UNK> are short sharp quick with a nice twist at the end usually involving people getting what they deserved however in the <UNK> the stories last for the best part of 40 minutes each which is longer than the average tv episode i must admit i found both stories very boring they have very little going for them seem to be aimed at children the first story is the better to watch as a whole but it has no twist ending as far as i could see while the second one has a nice <UNK> ending but the build up to it is weak drawn out for no good reason i really like horror anthology films so the <UNK> comes as a disappointment frankly it lets the genre down br br director peck was obviously working on a low budget as a whole the <UNK> is pretty tough to sit through there's plenty of continuity errors it's poorly made there's no atmosphere there's no scares there's no gore the special effects are poor it features unnecessary shots of a dirty toilet several times overall it's a pretty unappealing film to sit through br br technically the <UNK> is rough around the edges to say the least the effects are far from special it has an extremely drab grainy look to the picture the acting is poor no ones going to win any awards thats for sure br br the <UNK> is a poor film it's not scary it's not fun it's not entertaining it only features two overlong stories definitely not recommended
<START> i saw this on the shelves at the rental place and i have rented everything else so i said why not why not is because it's one of the worst movies i have ever seen it looks like it was shot with home camcorder i guess thats all the budget would allow there was less boobs in it than i thought there would be some people made it out to be soft porn with a few killings the funniest part of the whole movie to me is in the extra stuff there is a spot with deleted scenes well there is only one but it is the dumbest and i think it may have brought the rest of the movie down the girls get in a hot <UNK> and find some chocolate <UNK> in the bathroom yes it ends up all over them great stuff this movie is very very bad don't bother
<START> oh dear what can i say about half past dead i was really disappointed in it i was thinking a steven seagal movie cool we'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones we might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody excellent br br however i was in for a rude awakening this film can be summed up as follows br br take an episode of the a team remove the lovable and <UNK> characters such as <UNK> <UNK> mr t and face then get a writer director to pen a plot even ed wood would be ashamed of and who's too big a fan of the matrix and john woo movies for his own good throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who don't have real names finally add in a main star who's getting <UNK> around the <UNK> and doesn't appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore br br the result half past dead an action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through the plot holes are <UNK> <UNK> large for example prisoners who when the jail is <UNK> fight the <UNK> rather than attempting to escape or how about the prison itself which has an <UNK> that contains heavy and rocket <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you also have a helicopter bearing a striking resemblance to a <UNK> with some kind of video game <UNK> in the nose br br then there's seagal himself i like the guy he can fight he's even witty in a way that jean claude van damme will never be but all through the movie i kept hoping for that one great defining fight scene never happened instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole hell of a lot i mean when someone runs down a narrow <UNK> and you fire a sub at them there isn't a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the <UNK> and into the target yet somehow they miss even the a team would cringe at this <UNK> and then when it gets to any kind of one on one physical stuff we get treated to a <UNK> matrix rip off without the benefit of bullet time people getting kicked twenty feet through the air and <UNK> other ludicrous <UNK> nonsense br br c'mon steven you're better than this your career can't be over say it ain't so br br this is instantly forgettable except i'm forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review and if you watch it try to find it amusing in an a team kind of way but i doubt it'll be high on anyone's re watchable list out for justice this ain't more like out to lunch
<START> in a lot of ways this film <UNK> the essence of everything i love about cinema in terms of capturing those strange <UNK> moments of <UNK> truth in other ways it is undeniably an amateurish <UNK> result of <UNK> self <UNK> <UNK> around with a camera ultimately it comes out somewhere between pure brilliance and <UNK> thankfully much more so the former than the latter part of me wants to reward it solely for it's absolute and moments of pure <UNK> but at the same time i can't completely ignore the occasionally downright awful acting and overtly bad production values at first the editing seems <UNK> sloppy and needlessly distracting or maybe just innovative but after a while i got used to it which is in the end the true sign of whether a film succeeds on it's own terms or not i guess that answer basically sums up my all around feelings for the film that is despite it's in flaws on a whole it does work very well and if nothing else a film like this really shows how false and contrived the faux documentary shaky <UNK> style can sometimes be when it so obviously applied purely for effect such as in films like the otherwise admirable roger <UNK> here the <UNK> are <UNK> derived from the <UNK> of the filming situation and are not just used <UNK> to make it look cool
<START> this is a great family film dealing with down to earth people who enjoy their local interests dealing mainly with horse racing lloyd walter matthau is a farmer who also raises quarter horses and has a young son named <UNK> who loves horses lloyd is able to raise a full grown horse who he calls <UNK> shadow after his son and this horse breaks all speed records and is a possible winner of a million dollar race sarah blue <UNK> smith becomes interested in this horse and offers to buy the horse for 500 00 dollars however this horse receives serious <UNK> to his legs and lloyd receives a serious set back which <UNK> the entire family walter matthau gave an outstanding performance and this is a great film to view and enjoy
<START> i'd really have to rate sex is comedy as one of the worst pieces of dreck i have ever seen the film showcases those which are the worst aspects of the french or at least how they are stereotyped <UNK> <UNK> and pseudo <UNK> i myself am french canadian and feel slightly ashamed that the creators of this film are from the same culture as me that should give you an idea as to how bad this movie really was one doesn't so much watch this film as <UNK> torture to it there was a total lack of humour and it seemed to me as if the entire film was a documentary <UNK> people who were neither famous nor talented as if to celebrate something that has never happened to begin with instead why not watch <UNK> or je t'aime a la <UNK> three fantastic modern french films
<START> do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made stop wondering i'm telling you michael is it br br it is not heartwarming entertaining or travolta at his best it just sucks if i had kids i would let them watch deep throat before michael br br a sold out john travolta a washed up and <UNK> william hurt and an about to die any time now jean <UNK> highlight this turd of a film br br but wait you'll get to hear <UNK> mcdowell sing yeah hollywood really s t all over us with this one
<START> i was <UNK> that the best make up academy award went to dick tracy a horrible film with horrible make up the based on the better titled <UNK> <UNK> look terrific the acting is excellent and david makes for a truly creepy and terrific antagonist br br the plot on aaron <UNK> who has recurring nightmares about a society of monsters living under a cemetery is he making it up or are they real and calling to him his convinces him he's a murderer a <UNK> of families br br troubled and <UNK> <UNK> seeks <UNK> in but the monsters don't want him at first he is also <UNK> by his girlfriend <UNK> who refuses to give up on him even after he dies and comes back cold and monstrous br br but <UNK> isn't about to let <UNK> continue on he raises the locals on an all out assault on like a holy war in gods name led by the devil br br <UNK> themes of misunderstood monsters may come from his experiences as a homosexual male but they are always strong and honest turns the genre on it's head the monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone but man is hunting them br br a 20 minute longer cut was originally <UNK> by barker but the studio chopped it into this <UNK> masterpiece barker is hard at work trying to locate the missing footage for a directors cut release until then this version will have to do
<START> this was such a great series for black folks at the time we loved it so much it was the only show about black middle class families on t v at the time please release this on dvd i know many many people who still talk about the show if it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this <UNK> as well as interesting the show addressed many topics from racism race <UNK> teen <UNK> sibling rivalry single <UNK> <UNK> pressure and much more the show ended in such an abrupt way and left it's fans speechless and wondering why it was taken off the air since then we have only seen a few of the actors and actresses please release it on dvd <UNK>
<START> after reading the comment made about this movie and currently watching it i can understand how the person felt about it the decisions made were after listening to common sense when the movie came out i had heard the information as to how it came about the storyline was made from an actual event during an award show an actor <UNK> the <UNK> people attributed the award to a former school teacher unexpectedly outing the person br br of course many people come <UNK> of the closet most every day each outing is different for each person in real life the outcome of any individual is gonna be different as well and a <UNK> to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to reach personal happiness for those around them the joy and honest acceptance can make life much more fuller for the movie the outcome of how howard is is a lot more comical than real life and the acceptance of the community showed the others that howard was himself and nothing else br br overall the performances were crazy the memorable quotes and use of music add to the <UNK> types out there in the world but taken with tongue and cheek humour it's a movie sit down watch with an open mind and laugh your head off
<START> a rather disappointing film the club scenes were ok but over done the plot was thin and boring it's only redeeming features were some of the characters the <UNK> and the dj were pretty fun characters tim character was just bizarre and stupid
<START> i saw this at the toronto inter film festival in <UNK> 2005 the description seemed intriguing how wrong i was this could easily be the worst movie i have ever seen in 50 years i see the director is my age b 1948 and lived with <UNK> of the <UNK> underground which leads us to andy <UNK> which <UNK> is the one i thought of while watching this <UNK> 24 hour movies of nothing much happening this is not art this is boredom br br specifically black white ok maybe but what is the purpose here surely they had color in 1968 and there is no contrast with the present and yes the subtitles were in white naturally i don't think i missed much but that made about 20 of them br br next it's pure <UNK> order but with seemingly random events thrown in what's the purpose of the conversation with the old man at the dinner table it adds nothing to the movie there were many similar scenes almost like someone took a camcorder and filmed random people and spliced them together to make a movie br br plot none the riot consists of some figures in the distance occasionally <UNK> a rock off screen mostly it's an excruciating length of time watching people in the distance stand around the repetitive <UNK> smoking is just as boring when the main character got a cute girlfriend i <UNK> up but no she was boring too this is perhaps the only french film i've seen where no one takes off their clothes probably they were too bored to bother br br romance none the girl seems totally indifferent to everything maybe her <UNK> holds some interest but if it does we're not shown that we are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are all unappealing maybe that's the point of all this
<START> someone told me that pink <UNK> was in a word insane now i'm <UNK> whether this guy actually ever saw it because that isn't the way i would <UNK> it in one word disgusting absurd um more disgusting would do it every time you think it can't get any more filthy it does one of my particular favorites was when divine had her birthday party and when the cops came to bust it up they were butchered and eaten by the guests i admit that it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque you simply can't look away but this is by no means a creative work of art it's pure shock value br br on the upside it makes the jackass guys look like a bunch of <UNK>
<START> billy wilder created a somewhat conventional biopic about the charles <UNK> flight he <UNK> the film using flashbacks <UNK> to tell the <UNK> story leading up to the famous flight across the atlantic which happens in present time in the film flying an airplane for hour after hour is not the stuff of excitement and wilder is not going to <UNK> from his theme of <UNK> as hero of the common man so things are predictable however james stewart is well cast and quite believable as <UNK> and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to get his plane in the air keep one watching br br the film comes through most successfully as wilder weaves the parts of the story together in a way that create tension then relief then tension again the cinematography is quite good score by <UNK> <UNK> enhances the scenes and stewart really seems to make <UNK> come alive makes one believe he could be <UNK> there is a bit of 1950's religious <UNK> at the end but overall the direction acting and high production values overcome the predictability of the story would anybody really see this picture and not know that <UNK> made it across the atlantic to make an enjoyable film that has aged better than most films from that time billy wilder made films of a wide variety of types and this is one that is representative of his <UNK> like best
<START> this film has me seriously <UNK> again whether <UNK> de was a good filmmaker or not his blind dead films are praised by many fans this i can understand but wanna be gothic vampire trite like doesn't show any signs from a gifted filmmaker and that also goes for de <UNK> it features horrible acting a dumb plot stupid events a lot of other things you can expect from a bad monster movie and also veteran actor ray <UNK> who does his best to <UNK> his way through this film while not having much of a clue about what he's doing in it apparently <UNK> was already very ill while shooting de <UNK> his last theatrical feature and going out with a ridiculous stinker like this makes it all the more sad one last appearance alongside peter cushing in a made for tv film directed by roy ward baker also in 1984 doesn't change much about it br br but the <UNK> puppet sea <UNK> is a hoot to behold watch it <UNK> up a <UNK> and crush it see it destroy a <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> look at it <UNK> bridges and <UNK> on charming <UNK> trains br br good badness yes 3 10 and 7 10
<START> milo is an overlooked underrated horror flick from the late 90's but the feel and atmosphere is more that of an 80's horror flick seems a bunch of little girls are taken to see things at the office of <UNK> father a and as a reward for getting to see what's there in <UNK> yes a plus something else one girl plays doctor with milo hmm his first patient and he lost her now milo is a creepy little kid that always wears a yellow rain <UNK> rain or shine and he talks funny but that's not all that's strange about him fast forward to the present where these girls are adults and there's a wedding planned for one of them but tragedy strikes and leaves one girl that came in from out of town with a choice of whether or not to replace her friend as a school teacher which she does and then strange things begin to happen again which of course involve this little kid in a rain <UNK> this isn't overly violent or graphic but has a distinct creepiness that you don't find in many modern horror flicks and it's well worth seeing one wonders why it's so hard to find any good horror flicks in this day age but here's one that's criminally overlooked and definitely worth your time if you check it out 8 out of 10
<START> our the <UNK> hour br br more than the gangsters it's a detailed depiction of an american family circa 1930 the father proud of his job who <UNK> about his son who's given up high school the mum everyone would like to have the daughter who forgets dinner time in his arms and the twins who are absolutely lovable don't go to sleep first please br br and there's the grandfather playing the <UNK> <UNK> on his <UNK> have you noticed that this tune plays the same role as doris day's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in hitchcock's the man who knew too much 1956 and there's this grandpa who is finally the most courageous person of the family so old he does not even tell you his age but proud of his country and <UNK> to the <UNK> hateful blackmail br br a good film by <UNK>
<START> it is by far the most definitive film on the police force which i have seen although not directed by ram <UNK> <UNK> it has all the elements of an <UNK> film dead straight dialogues blunt treatment of the subject brilliant direction and superb performances even by those with little job to do in the movie the chemistry between <UNK> and the don even if they are professional rivals is amazing and so are the small events like an <UNK> not giving information to <UNK> even while he is being <UNK> up in the locker but only to <UNK> when he is out the change in working conditions with the change of the senior is dealt wonderfully the first half keeps one absolutely <UNK> moving like a documentary with <UNK> acting like a mentor to explaining to him the <UNK> and philosophy of the work br br overall one of the most brilliant films on cops in indian cinema definitely not to be missed
<START> dreadful <UNK> inane film dealing with corruption at the <UNK> purchase <UNK> company br br everyone in the state of <UNK> seems to be corrupt and inept a member of the <UNK> english department can only sign his name with an x br br when it appears that a straight laced senator victor moore is coming to the state to investigate everyone there tries to blame the innocent but foolish bob hope character br br is it any wonder that vera did not get the part of maria in for whom the bell <UNK> br br naturally the corrupt officials along with hope try to show pictures of with moore so as to ruin him politically moore marries the head of the restaurant who he had insulted when he asked for a ham <UNK> he thought the reason that she was upset was because it was a <UNK> restaurant this is the extent of humor is this absolute mess of a film br br when hope tries to defend himself in <UNK> he does a take off of james stewart in mr smith goes to washington by then the film is too far gone for any good response br br the music and lyrics are both absolutely terrible that song <UNK> <UNK> sung in various ways is absolutely terrible irving berlin had something to do with the music of this utterly terrible film
<START> no matter how you feel about michael jackson himself you can't deny that this video is the most unique video of all time there is no other video that is even remotely close to thriller the first time i saw it was when i was 6 years old and it scared me bad now i watch it with a smile because i can now appreciate the marvel that it is i love this video and it will be around for as long as music videos exist i think everyone should sit down and watch it when its on sometime and look back and see how great it was especially for being 1983
<START> a very interesting addition to the <UNK> collection recommended viewing for those who like their movies complicated my interpretation of the ending would be that journey ends in hell he <UNK> the bland <UNK> led <UNK> of <UNK> a sort of but not <UNK> i e not getting anywhere even the city's <UNK> trains don't stop at the stations it has a <UNK> system like you should be able to travel freedom escape but you can never actually board those trains he is unable to reach <UNK> <UNK> heaven and winds up continuing his bus journey to its final destination the old <UNK> version of hell <UNK> not hell the <UNK> city isn't burning hot like the british version its cold <UNK> the land of land of cold and <UNK> this appears to be where <UNK> end up having just failed to access heaven through that tunnel
<START> mel welles you might remember him as mr in roger <UNK> little shop of horrors directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of dr <UNK> daughter carrying on her father's work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its <UNK> to be do good but rather for its sex appeal you see frankenstein though a doctor and scientist in her own right is concerned with really nothing more than <UNK> her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love the story is <UNK> thin here and one gets what one might expect lots of <UNK> and suggestive comments surprisingly most from the female lead special effects that are not so special acting that lacks depth of characterization and not really much action or suspense and while this film is almost <UNK> in regards to good storytelling lady frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless italian actress <UNK> <UNK> aka sara bay <UNK> plays the <UNK> daughter with some <UNK> and lots and lots of sex appeal she <UNK> desire and seduction quite well her performance is pretty one dimensional but she is quite lovely and plays over the top a little too well she is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift poor joseph <UNK> now <UNK> to european horror films for money plays the father in a brief yet competent performance he is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear as for the rest of the cast paul <UNK> is somewhat effective as dr charles marshall the <UNK> assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village policeman i wasn't buying this mickey <UNK> starts to <UNK> for answers despite what you might think not to her satisfaction where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script weak performances and lackluster direction all head further south the creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the <UNK> <UNK> very common in the 1970s while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones
<START> on june <UNK> 1941 the city of <UNK> is divided between german and russian when the german <UNK> the city the nazis send the jews to a ghetto the young catholic <UNK> martin alone with her young sister and hides many jews in the attic of her house along two and half years until the end of the war hidden in silence is another good story of human sympathy in world war ii this film looks like <UNK> stories of courage and is also based on a true story unfortunately the actress <UNK> martin performs a strong and powerful lead character but she is very weak for such a role in many dramatic situations the expression of her face is not convincing i have noted that many imdb users liked her performance but i am not sure whether they like her wonderful character or her performance indeed my vote is seven br br title brazil no hidden in fear
<START> no one said that in the big trail and i thought it would be a natural nevertheless this was one of the best westerns i have seen and i am a big fan of horses and <UNK> movies the scope and feel of this picture is simply <UNK> and as someone mentioned in their comment it does have the feel of the 3 camera <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> nowadays the cost of the production and especially the cast of thousands would be <UNK> but <UNK> walsh got it done br br the cast was excellent although john wayne was better when he had no lines and just around in particular <UNK> power sr was a perfect villain i had never seen him before and this was his only talking picture ian keith was a snake but el is an acquired taste as the comic relief he can be funny or annoying but mostly the latter and he shows up at the most inappropriate times br br it is a bit too long and it took a while for the indians to show up but this is as close to a documentary on <UNK> destiny and as true to life as you will see and a must for movie fans regardless of genre <UNK> by the time the <UNK> got to california i was exhausted
<START> parts the horror is not that bad of a movie i have the mst3k version of it on tape and it is hilarious but its still not the worst film the have ever done i would go so far as to say that it was better than 80 of the movies they have made fun of the concept could have worked if they had a better script more money and decent actors it could have become a classic if it was not so boring and had a bit more excitement sadly it was <UNK> in production and ended up on mst3k
<START> of the thousands of movies i've seen so far this is the first one which made me think of the wasted talents expression i had never ever seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances <UNK> elsa and so on the aging make up is quite awful and to make it worse lit <UNK> the use of music e g love at first sight for the young <UNK> de camp is at times so that i could feel most <UNK> around me smile <UNK> so far <UNK> de has been quite a good actor but seeing this one and les de i think he should start considering <UNK> please <UNK> give up that master of project i doubt you deserve it
<START> friday night with jonathan ross must have those in charge of ross <UNK> their <UNK> little <UNK> together they know the bbc lacks imagination when it comes to talk shows so when they have jonathan ross at their <UNK> they are quite settled to just sit back and let a half wit command this <UNK> <UNK> br br ross spends most of the show <UNK> his ego and smiling about how much the bbc is paying him the show is a complete copy of many us chat shows leno <UNK> conan o brian the list goes on but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses can also be done for the dumb masses in the uk also br br the unfortunate situation he has no competition <UNK> has gone by the reality is he was never really up to much except <UNK> a <UNK> ego can't we have someone funnier and <UNK> on british screens instead of jonathan ross once ross has built up his ego enough he will then proceed to the very boring concept of the stiff celebrities in the green room so trying to get on with each other if an a <UNK> is present which is so often the case these days as there are no other chat shows they can turn to to promote their latest movie he will spend the next hour either <UNK> with them or trying to be their best friend in the universe when he had <UNK> <UNK> on a man that cares nothing for <UNK> <UNK> ross genuinely was begging for his mobile phone number as common policy on this show is for jonathan ross to get <UNK> number so he can be seen in the right company when not working of course <UNK> said it how it is and simply said no i don't like you dead pan serious br br ross needs to be <UNK> from all awards and tv shows the masses will get over it
<START> you would probably get something like this i'm <UNK> movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5 year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence of course there are stupid hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring break but those movies don't even claim to be serious works of art but when someone <UNK> for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of <UNK> scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things br br one more thing i can tolerate political <UNK> very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the <UNK> female character was just too much i wish someone told the director that it's kind of ridiculous even in an unrealistic art movie to portray a <UNK> woman as a half <UNK> <UNK> creature connected to the forces of nature probably due to the fact that she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and <UNK> <UNK> on a three <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is one of the most awful movies i've ever seen probably only <UNK> by the dreadful and utterly meaningless <UNK> how can <UNK> even have put his name on this crap i'm feeling every ounce of respect i had for him <UNK> fast br br so what is it about this film that makes it so poor is it the story yes is it the actors yes it it the whole look and feel of the movie yes br br to start off with the story my god it's about as clich√© ridden and predictable as what you would expect from a drunk 14 year old who is late writing his her paper on what i did this summer the feel good vibe the makers try to achieve just completely <UNK> as we suffer through yet another embarrassing turn to the story br br the actors are amateurs i know and thus we cannot expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors but for this to work the characters have to be charming and or funny preferably both so that the viewers don't mind the <UNK> acting or perhaps it even adds to the characters in this case not even close baby you start off <UNK> the characters mildly and by the end of the film i think it's about 90 minutes long although it feels like 4 hours you have a strong desire to hurt somebody to get your mind of these annoying stupid guys it should be impossible to find this movie's attempt at humor successful unless you're actually yourself like these stupid their before mentioned lack of talent and credibility as far as acting goes only makes the foolish and overly simple scenes fall harder to the ground even the family of the people involved will have a hard time finding this anything but very very embarrassing i'd rather have my sister make a fool of herself on american idol br br finally why <UNK> in a bunch of misplaced norwegian celebrities they look even more out of place than the actors if this is possible these celebrity cameos just add to the cheap feeling of the film and is in itself a pretty see through shot in the dark at trying to improve something broken even before <UNK> br br i cannot even begin to stress how much i'd rather watch paint dry than ever watch this movie again
<START> this movie was made because the concept <UNK> well into a two sentence summary that can be used to lure <UNK> that is the premise is interesting and i mean i rented it based on the synopsis the problem is there is nothing beyond the initial concept there is no coherent plot no fully <UNK> characters no real comedy no interesting scenery no surprises and no good performances except jon <UNK> he does something with very little it's as if the people who green lit this thing never read the script but only the synopsis and if there were enough people like me it may even have made money br br to the <UNK> viewer don't waste your time there is nothing funny or interesting to see here to the creators of the film hey you got your film made so what if its not that great most people never get to see themselves or their work up on screen
<START> i consider myself a fan of jess franco and his trash movies but nearly every time i see one of them i just see missed opportunities and plots that don't play out well this film is unfortunately no different the film certainly had a lot of potential as franco has <UNK> the intriguing theme of the classic film 'the most dangerous <UNK> with his usual brand of trashy sleaze but the plot here gets lost too often and it takes an eternity for franco to get round to the main point of the movie with this being a later franco film you might be forgiven for thinking that the director would have got better but actually i've found that the opposite is true as this and the terrible <UNK> are two of his very worst films the plot focuses on a stripper and her sleazy boyfriend the pair is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover however they soon find that they haven't been invited there for social reasons as they are <UNK> on the island so that the wealthy woman and her friends can hunt them down for sport br br what attracted me to this film was the front cover and the fact that it was directed by the king of sleaze flicks you'd think then that i'd be pleased that the movie features a <UNK> of sex scenes and general sleaze but i'm not the reason for this is mostly that the sex and sleaze in the film is really boring and most of the time served only in giving me the condition known as fast forward however my <UNK> to see everything through to the end <UNK> that i had to <UNK> it there was a time when i didn't think girl on girl could possibly be boring but i have since been proved wrong the only positive i can <UNK> out the movie really is that the soundtrack is quite catchy and despite it being silly foreign pop music actually <UNK> quite well with the sex scenes i did enjoy the last ten minutes as that's when the plot finally got going but it was a case of too little too late and unfortunately this is a severely <UNK> film on the whole i only recommend this film to those who feel they must see all <UNK> franco movies everyone else should watch <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or she killed in ecstasy instead
<START> the submarine used was not <UNK> was in fact two <UNK> and both built for turkey by <UNK> at <UNK> in but kept hold of by the royal navy for the duration of the war was sunk but was eventually delivered in 1945 br br the confusion no doubt <UNK> because someone looked up as i did and found when in fact the last <UNK> of both and was in fact just painted out br br there are some extremely realistic moments in the film these turkish <UNK> were very similar to the s class as no s class <UNK> survive the shots of them as and of the <UNK> ship forth form part of an interesting record now as well as an excellent film
<START> there was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great sadly like bring it on 2 bring it on 3 <UNK> glory of the original bring it on there is shameless stereotyping throughout the film the lines given to the actors were <UNK> for all the races involved in the film the performance of hayden was sub par both in terms of acting and <UNK> there were several scenes in which i literally <UNK> because i was embarrassed for the cast because the scene lines plot etc were just so stupid my recommendation to the makers of any future bring it on films is that you should hire good <UNK> and teach them to act because the acting of the cast was horrendous and their lack of <UNK> ability made them completely useless to the film only great character
<START> i believe john the dead is a true classic not only was it final film he is <UNK> as saying all i know about film making is in this film the story closely adapted from <UNK> by james <UNK> is a great ensemble piece featuring sterling performances by <UNK> <UNK> john's daughter and a cast of english and irish actors who bring the story to life this is a film that should be part of any serious collection not only because it is visually elegant but because the story is timeless and very appealing the film is not <UNK> nor is it charged with action rather the story unfolds from within the characters who bring light and meaning to the dialog the end of the film is stunning poetic and haunting i recommend the dead without <UNK> as one of the finest films ever made
<START> i am a long time fan of luc <UNK> work and for about as long as i've known his name i've also looked for this movie i tried looking for this movie all over california for over four years this past summer i took a trip to europe one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie long story short i bought it and watched it in france i was blown away it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen luc <UNK> first work absolutely amazing character development very thought provoking great acting and the ultimate concept movie if you are a concept movie fan this is one of the most original and classic i feel as though it is a rare treat to see a movie like this one its <UNK> its <UNK> and ultimately its just downright unique if you are a luc fan its indeed a must see however whether your a fan or not its definitely an important work overall a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema
<START> continuing with the <UNK> film programme about complicated relationships in some european <UNK> last night in the <UNK> theatre was shown anna <UNK> a film directed by the great <UNK> film director <UNK> <UNK> lubitsch the film depicts the terrible story of the queen <UNK> of the british king henry <UNK> she was executed by her husband well not exactly the king ordered the <UNK> to do his dirty work not to mention that this marriage caused an important political and religious historical event the english br br the film stars dame <UNK> <UNK> first screen superstar during those early years and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> actor in that silent era both play their characters in a suitable way dame as an innocent aristocrat who becomes <UNK> interested in the power that the court offers her and <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> whimsical and <UNK> british <UNK> a character very suitable for this german actor who overacts appropriately given the <UNK> and excessive personality of the character himself br br in the early film period <UNK> lubitsch was known for his outstanding costume films <UNK> productions with big budgets anna <UNK> cost about 8 million marks a fortune even for this german count taking great care in magnificent <UNK> as can be seen during the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> scene which employed 4 000 extras <UNK> germans of that time were used causing revolutionary workers to create a fuss when german president <UNK> ebert visited the set during filming br br besides the spectacle one of the most important aspect of this and every film of <UNK> lubitsch even during his epic period is the complex relationship between the main characters we experience a game of different interests double meanings and the complicated art of <UNK> but what is treated lightly at first ends in tragedy the importance of those historical facts is brought to bear in an effective way but lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between henry <UNK> and anna <UNK> br br and now if you'll allow me i must <UNK> take my leave because this german count must take care that one of his fat and rich <UNK> doesn't lose her head for this <UNK> aristocrat br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> von <UNK> http <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> this movie literally had me rolling on the floor well at least on the couch laughing i didn't think i would like it but it came on cable tv one afternoon and i watched the whole thing and thoroughly enjoyed myself since then i've also seen black sheep which was pretty good but not as non stop funny as tommy boy
<START> this movie was really funny even though it wasn't meant to be the acting was stupid and so were the voices pretty much all it was was some guy walking around a corn <UNK> for an hour and a half they threw in this stupid super natural thing that made it even dumber it wasn't even like a normal movie this weird creepy music was playing almost the whole way through the movie what is it with corn <UNK> horror films children of the corn was really scary i thought and i thought this would be something like it but really it was just stupid the main character guy just walked around <UNK> yelling for these two little girls and then at the end he like kills someone or something it's worth seeing if you're with your friends because it's really funny how bad it is but if you're looking for a horror movie then don't waste your time
<START> <UNK> cassavetes shows up on the new york looking for a job but with a hidden past he gets one on condition that he pay a kick back to <UNK> crew boss jack warden while there he strikes up a friendship with black man sydney <UNK> that unfortunately leads to a gut wrenching moral dilemma for a man who we learn typically runs from his problems br br the movie looks like oscar winner on the <UNK> feels like on the <UNK> and most importantly plays much like that 1954 kazan production however its racial theme is ground breaking for the time the black <UNK> and the white cassavetes are treated as equals in every respect it might even be called the first of the black white buddy pictures that would later dominate so many action films br br it helps that the two leads play so well off each other nonetheless the movie's central flaw is failing to indicate why crew boss <UNK> pushes a friendship with the <UNK> cassavetes in the first place he really goes out of his way to <UNK> the newcomer but why he would cross racial <UNK> to do so is never really suggested one possible explanation is that <UNK> wants to use cassavetes as a <UNK> in his rivalry with other crew boss warden but then comes to genuinely like the guy there's a hint of that in some of <UNK> suspicious reactions but beyond that the relationship appears <UNK> br br if there's a single stage shot in the entire movie i couldn't spot it everything is done on seedy new york location without the usual movie extras in that sense it's an anti hollywood production carefully even down to the night club scene which itself looks like a real after hours crowd i suppose would dub this rather raw slice of life a glimpse of the working poor br br yet for all its virtues which are many the film remains too close to the brando kazan movie for comfort here a fine unknown actress kathleen maguire gets the role of the <UNK> girl friend warden the role of the corrupt labor boss while cassavetes like brando must suffer a bloody beating before <UNK> his moral standing and doing the right thing still and all despite the derivative nature the gritty urban drama <UNK> enough of the original force to merit a look see
<START> i found the movie <UNK> kiss excellent carla performance was <UNK> probably her best in her career her facial expressions in many scenes were unbelievably true to character and they were exploited to its best by director all actors and actresses were very good in their performances emma was as usual marvelous her acting <UNK> are way above what would be required for this character so she actually enhances it in the movie br br the story although sometimes over intricate is kept entertaining and pointed towards the end very very good a movie not to be missed a story well <UNK> and brilliantly directed quality of film excellent
<START> i just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while <UNK> on youtube for a low budget effort it has plenty of compelling moments in <UNK> pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish while there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly the fact that she's a <UNK> makes those scenes important to the story and there's one scene with the curly haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad the young nurse who comes in and gets hired is <UNK> herself and i'm not surprised she <UNK> for the cover of playboy some characters are very irritating and some scenes do seem ridiculous for the most part however don't look in the basement that's the title i saw on youtube provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining b movie
<START> for me north and south books i ii is the ultimate tv series of the 80's just <UNK> all those cameo appearances was highly entertaining gene kelly james stewart <UNK> taylor olivia de <UNK> robert mitchum even <UNK> no series has come close to this achievement have you ever seen anyone looking like lincoln dick smith's <UNK> made hal powerful performance even more so the crafted costumes the jaw dropping locations everything it's clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright tv series desperate <UNK> lost 24 but north south was and still is one of its kind don't miss it only david <UNK> portrayal of the ultimate villain you may call him just violent husband <UNK> the viewing maybe some characters and situations are too stereotyped i admit it but the positive sides clearly cast a shadow over them i'm so glad that finally is available on dvd in spain
<START> when i first heard of this movie i was mildly interested the plot seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and <UNK> as an actor and director seemed like something that might be good when i found out the movie starred ryan <UNK> i was even further interested i was a fan of when it was on yeah i'm that lame however i didn't have much faith in it being to good when i sat down to watch it i was afraid i was wasting my time br br but even just five minutes it it became apparent that i'd been wrong br br i thought that the comedy of this film was delightfully idiotic and definitely not suited for all kinds of people the acting was rather good much better than my expectations i thought that it was rather easy to relate to <UNK> character which gave the movie a center that was believable this is key in a movie as outrageous as this and is probably why i was not a fan of <UNK> br br the movie is not suitable at all for younger people duh and will definitely create more than it's fair share of awkward <UNK> if watched with parents but it's a good one for you and your buddies on a movie night
<START> this movie is a classic kids now will love it and people like me who were kids when it first came out still watch it for its nostalgic value as well as for its humor and great story it introduces kids to different cultures and <UNK> them to adventure it's not just a cartoon it's a masterpiece i love it
<START> it's saturday it's <UNK> and i think every movie should have at least one comment so i just watched the crime doctor's courage all the way through it's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters and a couple of the usual suspects each with their own possible motive for the crime the story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever i guess that's not too surprising for a b movie of this period there are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre wwii but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows br br the crime doctor is the sleuth who happens to be visiting california for some r r from his <UNK> practice on the east coast he <UNK> up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving <UNK> the novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth aka dr watson and also occasionally <UNK> things up with a bit of comic relief sort of br br there is also a somewhat simple but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the <UNK> sleuth and then there are the mysterious a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night club the dance is sort of an <UNK> dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30's than the 40's though the story location is california the appear to live in a castle br br there was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused but i won't <UNK> any more than that because i always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered rather than known in advance even though i can think of many many b films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent i have not seen any other movies from the crime doctor series so i can't make any comparisons
<START> wow what a racist <UNK> piece of celluloid garbage and what an insult to the great genre of westerns br br <UNK> sex scenes abound profanity <UNK> violence and gore <UNK> everything that gives modern movies such a good name especially among those who prefer classic era movies this is the kind of sleaze that gives the old folks <UNK> against today's films br br somehow i just can't picture nude male bathing scenes in randolph scott or gene films nor can i picture hearing <UNK> er <UNK> here and there i sincerely doubt that word was even around over 100 years ago yet the f word is so prevalent here you'd think you were watching a story centered in today's urban areas not the old west of the <UNK> br br prejudice well what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty brutal villain do you think someone might complain about a racist movie home come we don't hear an <UNK> when the reverse as demonstrated in this film is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country br br mario van <UNK> wrote directed and starred in this bomb remember that name apparently he is the ed wood of today's filmmakers even spike lee wouldn't be this racist you can't get much worse than this movie
<START> i was expecting a lot from this movie and i can say i haven't been disappointed first of all this movie as a world tour of wine making let the <UNK> enjoy beautiful places the people interviewed are really interesting and funny too in particular <UNK> de the shooting may be confusing the camera always being <UNK> and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds you may not like it but i don't consider it as a <UNK> br br the themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well since <UNK> isn't the only issue discussed but managed to give his movie a <UNK> all along a great achievement of this movie is revealing all the characters involved in the wine industry as they really are avoiding a clich√© good against evil this could be the main difference between and michael moore's documentaries point of view appears in a subtle way through opinions expressed by his favorite characters the <UNK> of this documentary relies mainly upon the characters the history of long time wine making families such as the de the the and the lets the <UNK> discover that wine is somehow related to families rather than just being a business and an industry this movie doesn't make you want to drink wine but certainly make you want to discover and wine makers br br i watched this movie as a student in and let's just there are many ways to learn i give this documentary 10 out of 10 despite his technical <UNK>
<START> i have to admit that in spite of all media promotion and being <UNK> for oscar my expectation from the film was not so high before watching it and i really found what i expected a film trying to be likable for both for <UNK> and <UNK> in turkey trying being authentic for foreign <UNK> and enough funny for all but it should be understood that it is not possible to be <UNK> for everybody therefore film stays as average for all br br whole movie is telling a story occurred within 24 hours to fit the short story in a full movie length some scenes are added without a connection with the main story these are mostly the ice cream selling scenes to the eccentric local people i e goat old women etc and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the <UNK> by skits with comic dialogs the subject is mentioned as a universal problem struggle of a local producer against holding companies and <UNK> but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before most of the readers will remember the hero <UNK> against supermarket from <UNK> <UNK> in 1980's this was the correct story at correct time shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now br br except some due to local accent the performance of cast is so successful the leading role is played by <UNK> with excessive body language but anyway he is successful too br br on the other hand against limited budget <UNK> efforts of director and players are obviously giving a good mood to the film but this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with italian neo <UNK> or worth to be oscar <UNK> br br note in the real life normally the ice cream <UNK> would stop his own production and be the dealer of one of the <UNK> of brand
<START> first and foremost i am a gay man although do not live my life within the so called community and it's because of films like this that gay themed movies are not my favorite genre because 90 of them are crap like this one f i could give this a zero i would i do not understand all the positive comments unless they were all made by people who made this film i actually stopped this at the 24 minute mark when the so called straight anthony <UNK> adam outside the restaurant for no reason at all and how is the son stealing from the diner if he doesn't even live in the town wire <UNK> the acting was horrendous the sound editing listen to anthony and adam when they are sitting on the fence eating their lunch every time the camera switched between the two so called actors the sound changes like there was not a <UNK> on the <UNK> seriously do not rent or god <UNK> buy this movie horrible horrible horrible acting and just a stupid storyline
<START> contains major spoilers on the off chance you would actually care about the story line br br ok we have <UNK> that destroy a city and a computer <UNK> who the power <UNK> br br predictable schlock from the start and if that weren't enough the 5 second action <UNK> between the movie and the commercials kill what little suspense there might have been for example will they make it to the airport in time things look dim as we go to a the action shot before the ad shows them <UNK> around inside the plane well i guess they're gonna make it after then again they had to because they're good guys br br the acting wasn't any too impressive exception and welcome relief randy quaid as <UNK> tommy the effects were kinda lame the bad guys got it and the good guys came through the real disaster of this movie was the script especially the ending not only did they wrap things up happily as quickly as a soap opera given 24 hours notice of a <UNK> but they <UNK> the <UNK> as well <UNK> so he caused a <UNK> meant well and of course an uplifting final tv report about people coming together <UNK> it was everything i expected from the commercials and i'm glad i wasted my time watching it it will make great conversation at the lunch table tomorrow br br is cbs insulting us by making this we watched it didn't we did you count many ads there were for home <UNK> <UNK> during this pig br br here's hoping for the next plan 9 from outer space which gets better with each viewing this isn't it br br 1 star
<START> this film <UNK> from a long running <UNK> sitcom by the same name the sitcom lasted for half a decade roughly and brought to our screens phillip alan mrs jones vienna br br then in 1980 the film version hit the cinemas now when it did sadly richard beckinsale had passed away was replaced by only when i laugh actor chris br br i myself felt this gave the film a different feel i would have preferred if it wasn't shot as richard was a key character thats like having the <UNK> film without or <UNK> br br the film did have some classics moments definitely but it felt a bit de <UNK> <UNK> many parts were seen before in the tv series now if you saw the movie first rather than the series you would get a different feeling about it then the series fan br br saying that leonard is definitely on top form and makes the movie just like in the tv series the film has recently had a new <UNK> of life on dvd and is usually on <UNK> over a quiet weekend it is a cracking good film but for fans you may feel that <UNK> seen it similarly before br br saying that though its worth a buying watching br br 7 8 10
<START> i really hoped for the best with this one but it just didn't happen <UNK> at a very non dutch manner and still looking great with a style and pace that's very much like hollywood what i don't understand is how with all these great benefits the director writer producer still managed to make this film a completely horrible picture to watch filled with bad jokes cheap nudity and actors that just can't really talk act in the english language for pulling it off but what was this guy thinking
<START> i'm a big fan of thomas harris i read all his novels at least 5 times and the book i really love the most therefore the movie was my biggest disappointment and i really don't get it why some folks here give it a nine or even a ten either their demands are very low or they haven't read the book or both even if i hadn't read the book i'd still consider the movie as absolute average and i'd give it a five the creepy mysterious atmosphere from the novel doesn't appear one single time in the movie when i saw it first in the cinema i even fell asleep why was <UNK> <UNK> a very important character totally <UNK> why was barney shown as a dumb ignorant whose only ambition is to earn money and most of all why was the psychological process <UNK> went through in the end caused by the drugs <UNK> applied to her <UNK> not to speak about the fact that the ending was <UNK> too and totally changed well the reasons why jodie foster refused to play <UNK> again are well known and i accepted it although like surely many others i'm very disappointed 'cause i identified <UNK> with her for stories like red dragon the silence of the <UNK> or <UNK> that possess such psychological depth it is very important to identify with a character when they're adapted for the screen but as the germans say that's snow of yesterday <UNK> scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he doesn't live up to his name jonathan <UNK> had exactly the right feeling for the plot the characters and their relationships towards each other in the silence of the <UNK> he should have done <UNK> too my only comfort is that i've seen the movie only two times it's long ago and thank god for that reason i'm able not to see the scenes from the movie when i read the novel i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone
<START> i saw this film at the sundance film festival and i too was surprised that it didn't generate more notice because it was not only powerful and beautifully crafted but very original the audience was totally engaged and the greatest part of seeing a film like this at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and cast in the q a session afterward they literally had to throw us out of the screening room for the next film we could have gone on for a lot longer the film is thought provoking and hilarious at the same time it will be a shame if this film isn't picked up for wider distribution i hope it will at least become available on dvd because i want to see it again and share it with everyone i know
<START> one of the genres that <UNK> during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as the murder mystery as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays and since horror films were very popular in those years by <UNK> the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade in which the first movies of the genre were produced aspiring playwright charles saw in this <UNK> interest in murder mysteries a chance to make a name for himself after warner bros picked his three act play the wax works to create the 1933 horror film mystery of the wax museum joined independent filmmaker frank r <UNK> to keep making films and the ghost walks was one of his best br br in the ghost walks john <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK> a young playwright who wants to impress a famous broadway producer named herman wood richard <UNK> with his new play <UNK> takes wood and his assistant homer johnny arthur to his country house for a reading of his play but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm the three men ask for <UNK> in an old mansion which happens to be property of one of old <UNK> inside the house wood and homer witnesses the strange relationship between <UNK> and the house owners however this is all a plan conceived to impress wood everyone in the house is an actor playing a role in his murder mystery unfortunately the murder committed is done for real and while wood and homer think it's all fake after discovering original plan the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer br br as expected charles screenplay for the ghost walks features the classic elements of the murder mystery stories of its time as we have the <UNK> night at an old dark house as setting the obligatory group of suspects and the touch of comedy however what's interesting here is how makes the film a real spoof on the genre with the many twists he puts in his story to play with the clich√©s of murder mystery plays the dialogs are excellent full of wit and lighthearted charm and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam by the end it follows the murder mystery routine anyways it never fails to be interesting and entertaining thanks to its smart twists and specially its quirky characters interestingly there's an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical it's never <UNK> and it's genuinely funny at times br br by 1934 director frank r <UNK> was already an experienced <UNK> in the poverty row side of the film industry but his <UNK> with writer charles would give him a couple of his most interesting movies and the ghost walks was one of them while obviously done on a <UNK> budget and the typical production values of independent films of its time <UNK> manages to take advantage of his set and makes an atmospheric movie that fits nicely the mood and tone of the story the pacing is a little too slow at times but <UNK> knew that the power of his film was on script and makes the most of it letting his cast to make the most of their characters with excellent results certainly the execution is a bit typical and unoriginal but <UNK> makes an effective albeit restrained work in this film br br as written above the screenplay is filled with great lines that make the quirky characters shine and fortunately most of the cast play with this to their advantage veteran character actor richard <UNK> is remarkably funny as <UNK> producer herman wood adding a lot of charm to his character specially in his scenes with johnny arthur who plays the flamboyant secretary homer arthur is the one who gets the most best scenes and he gives and hilarious performance as the cowardly yet witty assistant john <UNK> is just effective as <UNK> nothing amazing but nothing really bad and the same could be said about june <UNK> as gloria shaw the obligatory love interest whom is just fine however donald is really enjoyable as the <UNK> terry shaw and it's a shame he didn't get more screen time br br as usual with frank r <UNK> films the low budget hurts the film badly as while <UNK> makes the best he can the film still feels kind of plain at times however the main problem is problem the very slow pace it has as even when the film is filled with <UNK> moments of witty dialogs it moves at a pace so slow that can become boring and tedious for moments it also must be said that while effective in their roles <UNK> and <UNK> are pretty dull and average when compared to arthur and <UNK> and one wishes the movie had been more focused on the comedic pair they make than on the main couple finally as written above the ending is kind of weak and not up to the high standard of the first and middle parts although credit must go to for keeping creative plot twists appearing until the very end br br one could say that charles is an <UNK> hero of the murder mystery genre as among the many horror and mystery films that came out the b movie studios <UNK> as the poverty row the ghost walks is easily among the best previous film the bat despite its shortcomings and even when it's definitely not a masterpiece of the genre it's a nice way to spend a night enjoying the way it <UNK> fun at its own origin as a murder mystery play a very recommended film if you like the genre 7 10
<START> boom boom is a rip off from the movie <UNK> i personally rate <UNK> as one of my favorites not only because it is about music which is my favorite subject but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the <UNK> works of beautiful music he produced during his life time but for his own self destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35 being virtually during his life time because of the politics played by some people particularly the italian composer who was jealous of him br br personally i was shocked to see as the director has <UNK> cut <UNK> most of the scenes from the movie <UNK> i see the worst kind of <UNK> in this movie and am <UNK> about the kind of movies bollywood keeps on <UNK> day by day the movie is a disaster the two musicians in the movie don't give you any feeling of being realistic the film is tasteless meaningless and total failure on every count the only person who makes an impact is bobby <UNK> who at least knows how to act otherwise the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs br br the irony is that while watching the movie the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are <UNK> and that any resemblance with anyone is purely <UNK> which is a blatant lie because all <UNK> are very much clear and they are very much intended i wish i could take <UNK> and co to court not only for <UNK> <UNK> but also for <UNK> a beautiful work of art
<START> well it took them 4 tries but they finally got it right in this 4th sequel to the karate kid franchise the producers really hit a home run well first of all i applaud them for finally getting rid of ralph <UNK> i felt he never did service to the role of the karate kid i would have rather have seen danny <UNK> most in that role <UNK> turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series and look where his career is now instead they put in a girl they got <UNK> <UNK> best known for playing a variety of parts in every movie she is in i personally don't care for her buck teeth but thats a personal <UNK> but still look how karate kid 4 launched her career into <UNK> she won a <UNK> oscar christmas meanwhile where is <UNK> he should put out some amateur porn tape like <UNK> or something br br anyways my only <UNK> with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate as a self <UNK> master of karate i have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5 8 years the first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls well except for <UNK> but thats kinda gay so for the purposes of accuracy i think they should have stuck with another male for this role i was thinking perhaps dennis <UNK> he would give the role the depth it requires br br perhaps they will listen to my <UNK> and make the proper <UNK> in karate kid 5 its too pat <UNK> is no longer i was thinking maybe justin is the perfect replacement for the lovable asian fellow mr <UNK> he will give wax on wax off a whole new meaning funny huh anyways if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with karate and triumph of the human spirit karate kid 4 is for you don't waste your time with 1 3 this is the karate kid for you this is the karate kid for r the ages
<START> aside from frankie <UNK> too fast to understand malcolm in the middle flashbacks this film still cannot <UNK> up a scare the idea with the <UNK> and the history surrounding her placed into the story was fun but the plot and many side plots just don't tie together plot synopsis murdering ghost <UNK> victims through video game toss in some blood and a special effects and you've got yourself another bombed out would be horror flick the ghost <UNK> resemble the ghost in the ring two far too much the acting and constant and dramatic change in everyone's emotions is unbelievable save your money
<START> i'm sorry to say that but this is actually one of the worst documentaries i have ever seen br br due to its name <UNK> nightmare i expected a documentary on problems relating to the <UNK> <UNK> in lake victoria br br what i actually saw in this documentary is a loose <UNK> of individual stories most of which have no relation to neither fish nor lake and for a large part you can hardly call them stories it's more like some <UNK> scenes that lack a meaningful connection br br why does this movie waste time on showing us non relevant information on the families of the russian pilots several minutes are wasted for example on their private <UNK> of wives and daughters mourning the death of an african child who got bitten by a crocodile as if that could not have happened without the <UNK> <UNK> showing us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport showing us strange religious events for several minutes discussing in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport talking to kids about their mothers fathers what they work and or how they died well guess what some died of hiv who would have guessed that those are just some examples i could go on for several pages br br this movie is absolutely <UNK> and does not know at all what it wants to tell the viewer if you have never heard of africa and have no idea that this continent has social health hiv violence war problems then this movie might be right for you if you haven't had your eyes closed for the last decades 90 of what this movie shows won't be new to you and the way it's presented here will try its best to make you fall asleep br br perhaps my expectations on this movie were to high but i really didn't like it even though this is a topic that i would generally find interesting if this movie wants to show how the poverty is related to the <UNK> <UNK> than it perhaps should have spent some time on discussing that matter
<START> from the start of the edge of love the viewer is transported to the striking world of ww2 london we follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie an exploration of female friendship and the <UNK> caused on it by marriage and infidelity except one of the characters is named dylan thomas perhaps the greatest english poet of the 20th century and his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish but at times truly despicable br br this movie is based on <UNK> <UNK> about love and romance these were adapted with a sharp screenplay by <UNK> macdonald <UNK> <UNK> mother the director john does claim that the three other lead characters were actual people br br all four are performed very strongly <UNK> miller is <UNK> wife <UNK> knightley is the <UNK> singer vera phillips matthew rhys is dylan thomas and cillian murphy is william the first section of the movie takes place in london during the nazi air <UNK> with vera being pursued by <UNK> a soldier waiting for <UNK> by a chance encounter dylan meets with his first love vera from there vera meets <UNK> <UNK> wife while the three are drinking william successfully breaks <UNK> guard br br the film follows their lives as vera and william are married and he is sent to war vera has become pregnant and returns to <UNK> with dylan and <UNK> there they face a gritty existence with vera supporting dylan and <UNK> with her husband's war pay through these times <UNK> and <UNK> friendship grows so does <UNK> <UNK> with vera she gives in this creates the first test for the two women br br when william returns from war he barely <UNK> his wife and has no bond with his <UNK> son things get worse as dylan <UNK> watches his friend struggle with <UNK> <UNK> post traumatic stress disorder william realizes something has happened between dylan and vera and in a drunken rage shoots up <UNK> house br br edge of love starts as a stylish romance in war torn london and ends in the stark gritty life of <UNK> infidelity and attempted murder in <UNK> the treatment of <UNK> is well done and should speak to an american audience some day see ending br br each star has a great moment miller when she is <UNK> out <UNK> in her head in response to her abortion of another man's child knightley and <UNK> when he finally bonds with his son oh hell almost all their scenes are awesome and rhys when he himself on the stand to get <UNK> husband sent to jail br br yet the real star of the movie is jonathan <UNK> cinematography and john direction they seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historical thomas is this is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time and they <UNK> their scenes with stunning shots while this isn't best picture material it is a very good movie much more engaging than the <UNK> it has a visual <UNK> that <UNK> the use of <UNK> poetry also this is clearly <UNK> second best performance of her career and perhaps <UNK> best br br i have always had a weakness for the artist in struggle whether it's <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> capote but i was stunned at how little sympathy i felt for dylan thomas his struggles with alcohol are well known but his <UNK> of william and <UNK> to gain possession of his first love vera makes him out to be a bad man br br so is this academy award worthy clearly no at least not this year it will be released state side in march 2009 making it for the <UNK> this is 9 months after it was released in britain between <UNK> miss and <UNK> <UNK> the us has had its fill of ww2 british period pieces too bad this film is better then the other ones except <UNK> but in this one <UNK> soldier does come back but as a shell of the man who left her
<START> the fact that this movie is bargain basement quality is a real shame but back in the 1940s that was about the only type of film made for theaters <UNK> to black audiences due to <UNK> so while mgm warner and all the other big studios were making extremely polished films tiny studios with <UNK> budgets were left to <UNK> by with what they had and from seeing this movie it's obvious that a lot of energy went into making the film even if it is a pretty lousy film <UNK> speaking some of the actors weren't particularly good especially the french guy the sets were minimal and the plot totally silly but the film also had some good music of varying styles from classical to jazz to rhythm and blues this is thanks to many talented but pretty much <UNK> black performers br br now as for the plot it was totally stupid and silly but still watchable in a <UNK> way i loved seeing tim moore from the <UNK> <UNK> andy tv show in drag as he made the absolute <UNK> woman in cinema history this includes the bride of frankenstein and many others this is probably due to the fact that when not in drag he was a pretty ugly but funny guy if the man pretending to be a woman actually looked remotely like a woman i doubt this movie would have worked as well seeing this ugly and rubber faced man with a cheesy wig still being <UNK> sought after by three <UNK> was pretty funny br br this isn't a great film but from a historical point of view it's fascinating and excellent viewing for young adults to know what america was like for blacks in this era a very interesting and funny time capsule
<START> i saw this movie in 1956 and again on cable a few days ago the movie hasn't improved with age quite the opposite it's a true spaghetti epic br br the <UNK> are heroic and likable the <UNK> are nasty petty and <UNK> br br so what if paris ran off with the king's wife hey love is love
<START> rachel and chuck valerie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family so they packed up their reluctant son gregory and daughter <UNK> lauren and moved back to a lake like the one rachel lived at as a child br br they say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a <UNK> feel later the <UNK> seems to be more like the people in deliverance soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces this does not keep the family from enjoying running around and messing around in the woods br br we find that they have to be super ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they get <UNK> as the <UNK> br br can the ignored young <UNK> save his parents or will their <UNK> s put his her foot in it br br this film is more than most parodies as it was played with <UNK> faces they could not have chosen better actors and <UNK> anderson was exceptionally creepy an added plus is that they let us know what is happening before the characters find out instead of pulling a clue out of the hat after the fact anyway this made for tv movie is good for a few laughs
<START> new <UNK> <UNK> with this film will recall how <UNK> of its time it is and how well cast and crew captured america new york city of that era br br norman <UNK> script the different worlds the various sub live in and direction brings out phenomenal performances all around peter <UNK> <UNK> talent is on display as never before nor since clearly it is the best character portrayal the always likable dennis patrick ever accomplished br br what i will always remember about joe is the feeling of having been in a virtual state of shock coming out of the theater knowing that what the screen portrayed was <UNK> under the surface in <UNK> throughout the five <UNK> of the city of new york br br this film needs to be remembered
<START> famed filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> morgana is <UNK> <UNK> although characters appear in the film from time to time there is no actual story the film is also not an educational or historical documentary it's a film without an accompanying screenplay br br the film consists of curious background music and a somewhat illogical narrative <UNK> the combination of which <UNK> a long string of images from mostly though not exclusively the <UNK> desert some of the images are wonderfully odd and out of the ordinary the camera captures ghostly images or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that and <UNK> br br this general cinematic trend is <UNK> by occasional <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> topics for example in one sequence a man wearing <UNK> gives us a mini <UNK> on <UNK> and in what for me was the most captivating and bizarre sequence a small room contains a man with dark <UNK> who sings in a voice that is totally distorted by the <UNK> he's using accompanied by an old lady who plays a <UNK> tune on an old piano neither the man nor the old lady seems to enjoy what they're doing how <UNK> br br <UNK> morgana does have an underlying concept one that <UNK> the wide assortment of strange images and <UNK> sounds but that concept is so subtle so <UNK> that you'll never figure it out without help from this subtle theme the film does indeed make sense without that point of reference however the film can seem tedious and <UNK> a pointless parade of random <UNK> images and <UNK> narrative <UNK> br br <UNK> redundant <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> morgana will likely either make you <UNK> with delight or cause you to throw up you'll either <UNK> on to the film's <UNK> like qualities or be tempted to smash the dvd into a thousand pieces one thing that most viewers will agree on <UNK> morgana is different
<START> i admit i was <UNK> to this one from the hype and i didn't stop to consider the sources one of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year 1999 shocking and a must have br br well i wasted my money but not all was bad in this movie they at least got the gore right as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time there is even a storyline kinda and that is about it br br but for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content but no <UNK> we get gay sex sorta we have 3 inter racial babes maybe we have a psychotic <UNK> hooker nice back <UNK> sex ok that made me <UNK> and some female version of gene simmons i don't get that part we have an honest to goodness <UNK> rates among the best of the actors in this film that is not a compliment and finally we have a government conspiracy thrown in to i don't know try to connect the vengeance random theme killing by jimmy boy to make the <UNK> psycho seem sane if nothing else this movie proves that the italians and the americans do not have a lock on this type of movie the <UNK> can make crap as well as the rest of them kudos goes to anyone involved in this accomplishment that <UNK> it and made a career for themselves
<START> you know as you get older you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger might have been because of your youth and <UNK> case in point when i saw the godfather at age 14 i thought it was boring 20 years later its an incredible movie to me in other words i grew up and began to appreciate great movies br br so i rented dirty dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request as she loved it at age 14 and i hated it at the same age but i hoped because i was young and stupid at age 14 perhaps this would be a new experience for me so i sat down with her to watch hoping to be <UNK> br br well the night after watching dirty dancing i feel a <UNK> i feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life from watching this cheese fest br br first patrick <UNK> plays a 20 year old but he looks like he is 35 and the premise of the movie is him <UNK> some <UNK> teenager <UNK> her with his dance moves really creepy br br anyway the movie is the clich√© plot where the wrong side of the tracks guy and the rich smart girl accidentally fall in love with each other of course their romance is <UNK> by the fact the rich girl can't dance a <UNK> so the poor hero teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show or something like that br br but you guessed it the <UNK> father soon enters and <UNK> the two to see each other and the movie progresses to secret <UNK> of dance lessons and love making this all <UNK> into the final scene where the entire resort <UNK> around the two young lovers while the once <UNK> father accepts the 35 year old dancer as his teen daughter's new man br br even my girlfriend <UNK> at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered i didn't press her but i did <UNK> a little and put the godfather part ii in the dvd player
<START> don't you ever miss the good old days when disney actually made great movies that really moved you growing up with disney i always found myself being captivated by the characters every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie i remember friday nights and running to turn on the tv just to watch their <UNK> movies <UNK> q was one of my all time favorites i never forgot this movie even till this day when one mentions the song <UNK> q i always remember the movie if anyone is thinking of watching this movie i promise you you will fall in love with it i don't think i will ever be able to forget it you will not regret watching it br br unfortunately it's sad to see disney movies such as the hannah montana movie come out what ever happened to disney
<START> i have a problem with the movie <UNK> who consider americans to be <UNK> semi <UNK> unable to appreciate the subtlety of the more sophisticated europeans les <UNK> les just about anybody from le to whom english is a foreign language if the humour in my father the hero is different from that in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it is because the french sense of humour is different from that of the american not better not more clever just different if you think it is crass for hollywood to borrow from the french cinema just consider how much the french cinema has borrowed from hollywood in the first place where would <UNK> and <UNK> have been without bogart <UNK> without hitchcock jerry lewis not known for his subtle and cerebral style is in france go figure <UNK> depardieu is exceptionally good as the hapless divorced father of a <UNK> 14 year old daughter on holiday in the <UNK> together <UNK> to him she presents him to the other people at the hotel as her lover so as to make herself more interesting to a boy she has her eye on not surprisingly complications ensue there are to green card and <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> inserted and m depardieu goes along with it all very good <UNK> he does a good maurice impression with thank heaven for little girls which is in fact funny and rather poignant as his audience all of whom believe him to be the lover of a 14 year old girl get up and leave two by two as he away <UNK> unaware of what is happening when he turns round at the end of the song to acknowledge the expected applause the expression on his face is priceless without him the movie would be very average indeed with his huge <UNK> figure <UNK> the screen it is a lot of fun no <UNK> no six pack just a real proper human type being <UNK>
<START> it is not generally my practice to review movies that i dislike to any great degree however one or two times a year i <UNK> set aside my rule to only comment on things i like to give a word of warning i find it more enjoyable to comment on something i like and boost it than i do shooting at bad movies but some movies cry out for the razor br br <UNK> is one of them the cinematography isn't the only aspect that is <UNK> and out of focus here an almost <UNK> plot certainly incoherent if there even is one bad acting cheesy script and awful pacing those are its major problems br br understand i firmly believe that not all movies are created equal and films should be judged according to their category it is not reasonable to judge say beach <UNK> <UNK> against gone with the wind i judge <UNK> against other movies in its weight class <UNK> against movies like <UNK> or secrets of a <UNK> it comes off very badly indeed even eye candy has to be entertaining and <UNK> most definitely is not
<START> i try to catch this film each time it's shown on tv which happily is quite often but i keep forgetting to video it as it is i practically know the script by heart but that doesn't stop me having a good cry in fact it probably adds to it as i cry knowing what's coming next it's such a lovely film well made well cast good photography i love it one of my top ten films
<START> i watched about an hour of this movie against my will and couldn't finish it i'd rate it as a 0 the writing was bad the plot predictable and one that's been done far too many times the most annoying part of this movie was the acting done by melody thomas scott this part did not call for someone appearing <UNK> but she managed in every single scene i saw to look like a sour <UNK> or someone who was about to <UNK> something extremely sarcastic or cruel br br the two romances which seemed to develop into something serious almost upon the couples meeting was a bit too much br br i should know better than to watch made for tv movies if there is absolutely nothing on the telly and this is the only choice read a book
<START> <UNK> works its way into conversations like no other movie especially during summer whether it's the song about the <UNK> in training or the cut downs or the inspirational <UNK> the rabbit or it just doesn't matter speech it pops up poor mickey <UNK> who knows where he'd wake up next such a great <UNK> of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non pc is really funny no matter who you are <UNK> and <UNK> are favorites as is the hot dog eating contest with the famous line what no <UNK> oh how many times i've <UNK> that line and been the only one laughing thank you to the writers actors and directors applause applause
<START> i taped this on sundance and had no idea that it was a miike film i thought it was just another kung fu movie br br then i saw things like the dancing <UNK> player br br who sounded like an oriental <UNK> and i knew this had to be miike br br i missed the beginning opening credits and had to wait till the very end of the closing credits to see miike's credits br br so far he hasn't disappointed me yet audition city of lost souls <UNK> the killer and the happiness of the were all good flicks and now i've found out that this was the third in a trilogy br br other than miike and todd there's nobody making interesting films nowadays
<START> what can i say about this band i was hooked in <UNK> i was a ten year old kid i grew up on the blues though my dad then these guys from the <UNK> came along a <UNK> of country rock heavy rock and blues i wish i could have got to see them live in the early years i was lucky enough to be there in <UNK> that was the best concert i've seen to date i hope a full version of that hot august night will be soon this cd gave me a chance to see the boys over and over again the song remains the same is great but this cd gets down to the <UNK> gritty br br long live the
<START> i agree with this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before i went to live in japan for a year in 1993 tom <UNK> does a fantastic job here as always and the movie is greatly humorous and educational i'm a big fan of tom and he <UNK> this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part bringing the film to life in a way i can't imagine any other actor being able to pull off br br this film featured some first rate japanese actors and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they <UNK> with <UNK> i can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie <UNK> an awesome place to go whether you want to party sight see or just try to take everything in
<START> the first of five st films although the last is usually <UNK> was based around artist ronald <UNK> characters and features the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> in drag as <UNK> as well as her own brother much of the humour is dated yet curiously touching and outrageous in today's pc world the girls drink <UNK> smoke and are later sold off to rich <UNK> yet always remain in charge <UNK> <UNK> police judges and other establishment figures as they across england perhaps because the films have been so regularly seen on tv st <UNK> still <UNK> fancy dress parties and club nights the films have recurring characters that include pc ruby gates <UNK> and flash harry george cole the <UNK> to the entire series is a charming film called 'the <UNK> days of your <UNK> 1950
<START> a terrible deception controversial film winner of the teddy in berlin 2003 <UNK> <UNK> de paz turned out to be a fiasco the actors are all <UNK> well they are not exactly actors the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a <UNK> bet it stays in the <UNK> of two guys kissing and a guy whose lover is gone it has no purpose nothing to do with the <UNK> sexuality presented in other films e g before night falls 2000 by julian technically the only thing that works is the photography otherwise the camera is put in strange angles to make it more art <UNK> and the whole film runs in a black and white atmosphere the film is so pretentious that bothers i mean it's good to be pretentious when you have talent to support it or maybe it is that it's so art cinema that it's incomprehensible the story flows slowly slowly slowly to me more form than essence superb edition it was good superb direction don't think so the film is weak it was an interesting project it's a shame it's a flaw one star out of four
<START> the banter and humorous rescue scene help to make this one of my favorites of the 14 movie series wonderful acting great cast and this movie contains one of the few <UNK> noted facts about sean <UNK> career the part where he and alice <UNK> fall off the horse into the water was not scripted but was left in since they both went right on acting after it happened br br this is a good follow up to the intense ending of <UNK> enemy
