<START> the case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price i expected a based on the true story movie only to find a shot on home video <UNK> <UNK> of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non related slaughter house scenes the video scenes had numerous <UNK> situations which were used probably to <UNK> the length of the feature rather than for effects i started this review before i was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but low and behold it only got worse if i could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one
<START> this is a story of two dogs and a cat looking for their way back home old and wise golden <UNK> shadow young american <UNK> chance and <UNK> cat sassy flee from the ranch and go into the wilderness to be reunited with their family <UNK> bound the incredible journey 1993 is a family adventure directed by <UNK> <UNK> it's a remake of a 1963 film this movie got a sequel three years later michael j fox is the perfect man to do the voice over for chance fox has some youthful energy he brings to the role sally field does great voice work as sassy don <UNK> is fantastic as shadow this was this veteran actor's second last movie also the visible actors are great kim <UNK> plays laura <UNK> <UNK> robert <UNK> is bob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays peter <UNK> <UNK> lauren is hope <UNK> kevin <UNK> is jamie <UNK> jean smart portrays kate it's quite amazing to watch these pets trying to survive in the wilderness we see sassy taken by the river and she seems like a <UNK> the bear scene is <UNK> and funny chance has no chance with that big hungry bear and his meeting with the <UNK> looks painful this is some great fun for the whole family
<START> it's been said several times not least by me that watching an eric rohmer film is like watching paint dry it seems that <UNK> rohmer <UNK> this he doesn't deny it but then how could he he just <UNK> it so much so that his new movie which may also be his last inch <UNK> is set so far back in time that it's like watching <UNK> dry those wonderful people who gave you the <UNK> vague <UNK> du cinema have already named it one of the best films of 2007 so that should give you some idea reality is not high on <UNK> agenda so that in <UNK> century france we have at one extreme a <UNK> that would not be out of place in the <UNK> valley whilst the only other <UNK> we see is a rude wooden <UNK> the story involves <UNK> and <UNK> and as he often does rohmer has cast it with <UNK> who just happened to be passing so that the overall effect is that the <UNK> class play at a school for special needs <UNK> was captured on film by accident one is almost tempted to say <UNK> back godard all is <UNK> but even this <UNK> production can't make me utter those words
<START> this engaging which it shouldn't be low grade spanish exploitation quite tame i might add looks good but huh let me phrase that again <UNK> ' actually the word <UNK> ' would be going through your mind quite a lot nothing makes sense nor does it try too i just don't know if its <UNK> <UNK> or just a convoluted <UNK> but there's no denying how <UNK> <UNK> strange and <UNK> it feels br br unrelated sequences tied like that nasty opening involving a little girl dead cat and fire in to a sparse story involving photographer mario played by a chest <UNK> john <UNK> who's mustache is a dead <UNK> for <UNK> iconic mario what's the odds that <UNK> his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady a <UNK> <UNK> patty shepard who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment where at this remote mountain <UNK> they come across some <UNK> witches br br look past the unhinged plot structure and <UNK> in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric <UNK> and growing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> directs few <UNK> unusual visuals and creepy <UNK> but for most part seems <UNK> non existent and <UNK> just like his writing <UNK> <UNK> striking cinematography <UNK> the <UNK> rich scenery as we take in the <UNK> views and let the time <UNK> <UNK> away however there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on <UNK> garcia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and overwrought score <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> dense atmosphere created the leads are capable but there's also a <UNK> bunch the pick being <UNK> israel of secondary performances br br slow with little in the way of interest but this dreamy set up that seems to go on and on manages to keep you watching until its closing
<START> i've heard people who say this movie is dull dull dull i don't think they were watching the right movie this isn't the <UNK> action movie thank god br br this is a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor that just happens to be about killing people in this way it works extremely well with terrific performances from berenger and zane who doesn't <UNK> through the movie like he has in other roles he actually looks like he's acting br br i was disappointed with the action towards the end a lot of it didn't make much sense and was unsatisfying given the <UNK> from the rest of the movie but watch <UNK> face as he <UNK> alone while berenger does the dirty work
<START> i love this show and my 11 year old daughter and i love watching it together it teaches good old fashioned values in a fun <UNK> and entertaining way albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time it's also really fun to make fun of you know <UNK> and insert your own dialog in place of the actors' br br i have my <UNK> set to record all the episodes and i happened to catch the tail end of an episode just prior to the next one starting so i don't know what episode it was but there was an absolutely terrible <UNK> mistake adam had handed sheriff coffee a small <UNK> of leather which was torn from some <UNK> coat as he tried to make his <UNK> i suppose br br well roy happened to have the coat so he laid it out on his desk and placed the <UNK> right where it had been torn from the <UNK> was exactly <UNK> which i <UNK> would be nearly impossible to tear from a piece of leather post 1950's <UNK> yes leather i don't think so well the <UNK> <UNK> up perfectly and the mystery was solved br br not 10 seconds later in the scene we see the coat again still lying on <UNK> desk but this time the <UNK> is more like the shape of north <UNK> and is now in a completely different place on the coat but still perfectly <UNK> with the hole in the coat and the <UNK> which was <UNK> <UNK> in the middle of the <UNK> is now gone as is the <UNK> in the coat my daughter enjoyed a good laugh as we played the short scene over and over and over again it's prime for youtube i tell ya br br we still totally love the show though and the <UNK> errors make it lots of fun
<START> wow some movies just leave me speechless this was undeniably one of those movies when i left the theatre not a single word came to my mouth all i had was an incredible urge to slam my head against the theatre wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half unfortunately it didn't work honestly this movie has nothing to recommend the humor was at the first grade level at best the acting was overly silly and the plot was <UNK> far fetched i <UNK> <UNK> never to see an other movie starring chris <UNK> or any other cast member of snl
<START> this film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it what really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny the actress replacing jean <UNK> <UNK> is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to <UNK> my eyes out of my <UNK> because it's a waste of perfectly good film the torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent <UNK> this second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and <UNK> the corpse out in the public square and <UNK> <UNK> not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well this film unlike the <UNK> <UNK> could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a <UNK> no script since it was apparently written and added to daily no attention to camera or shots in mind poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so this film would not even pass for a student film in basic film 101 how this pile got through no one can tell it was a big <UNK> investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our <UNK> this movie has one good part its end this film is my 1 worst film of all time finally howard the duck is no longer the <UNK>
<START> beautiful <UNK> excellent idea but ruined with a bad selection of the actors the main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring first it considers it illogical behavior no one normal would not behave the way the main character behaves it all represents a typical <UNK> way to <UNK> viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence does such a scenario or the casting director and destroy this question is on <UNK> producers cat is the main character is wonderful the main character behaves according to his friend selfish
<START> as a person who sought out an existence as a <UNK> person with <UNK> backed by a <UNK> in chemistry and ms in business management my sanity was always <UNK> <UNK> in outside <UNK> in things more artistic my post post graduate classes were always emotionally and <UNK> supported by an interest in photography <UNK> glass <UNK> metal <UNK> <UNK> and art drawing that also included <UNK> screening br br i also keep healthy with <UNK> walking and lately <UNK> to remote <UNK> in california and nearby states like <UNK> arizona and <UNK> <UNK> walking and <UNK> gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds br br within that background i was obsessed with rivers and <UNK> i was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist andy goldsworthy as well as the skills and <UNK> of director cinematographer thomas <UNK> i actually could not separate the art of goldsworthy with camera path of <UNK> br br wonderful wonderful wonderful
<START> fabulous film rented the dvd recently and was <UNK> by this stunning piece of work douglas sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of rock hudson dorothy malone oscar winner robert stack oscar nominated and lauren bacall that words cannot describe paul verhoeven brilliantly <UNK> homage to this film by having dorothy malone play sharon <UNK> murdering inspirational guru in his basic instinct what a great joke br br by turns the film is hilarious riveting campy biting trashy compelling and eye rolling it's <UNK> the <UNK> of every <UNK> big and little screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like you'll see here the camera work is smooth and polished the use of color is breathtaking the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable the one dimensional characters are unforgettable and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut br br while most older highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through written on the wind contains so much and goes by so fast that it's actually a shame when it ends thank you to mr sirk for <UNK> and todd <UNK> for drawing attention to what has now become one of my favorite films of all time see this movie
<START> scary movie 3 2003 was a bad idea to begin with the last film was a mediocre effort put it next to this load it's a comedy classic whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots at least it was funny there's nothing funny about forced humor jokes <UNK> and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool the humor in this film was <UNK> to juvenile <UNK> <UNK> laugh at anything when they <UNK> to the junior high school crowd any sense of self respect was tossed out the window ring parodies are not funny i have watched them in comedies since 1998 they're so dated michael jackson jokes are not cool either what's even worse is making fun of two broken down has been performers whose best days were never br br the death of american cinema has been a slow one films like this are the nails that are being <UNK> into it's coffin whatever happened to real humor i haven't laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time too many bad movies <UNK> the brain you want proof go to your local mega chain video rental store and see what's on the shelves this movie is bad don't believe the hype i would rather watch scary movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy ever again br br definitely not recommended unless you have a handful of brain cells
<START> forget depth of meaning leave your logic at the door and have a great time with this <UNK> funny totally <UNK> ultra campy live action cartoon mystery men is a send up of every superhero flick you've ever seen but its unlikely super <UNK> are so interesting varied and well cast that they are memorable characters in their own right dark humor downright silliness <UNK> <UNK> action and even a touching moment or two combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a true winner the comedic talents of the actors playing the mystery men including one mystery woman are a perfect foil for wes <UNK> as what can only be described as a bargain basement <UNK> and geoffrey rush as one of the most off the wall and <UNK> charming villains ever to walk off the pages of a dark horse comic book and onto the big screen get ready to laugh cheer and say huh more than once enjoy
<START> john holmes is so famous he's infamous as the three <UNK> would say this is a <UNK> like story about the events surrounding the wonderland murders of the early 1980's in los angeles the story is <UNK> together from the retelling of a few of the participants there is story from the friend's perspective namely david <UNK> played by dylan mcdermott he is a <UNK> in the robbery assault at eddie <UNK> place eddie <UNK> is a infamous drug dealer and is the suppose to be the same character alfred <UNK> played in boogie nights and is heavily into the drug scene there is john <UNK> perspective played by val kilmer which makes him out to be a <UNK> stuck between two kings with a severe case of cocaine <UNK> there is also the <UNK> <UNK> of john's wife sharon played by lisa <UNK> and his girlfriend dawn played by kate <UNK> that fill in the spaces between the two stories it is basically the same time frame that we are looking at just each character's version the only thing that is missing is the perspective from the dead people br br paul thomas <UNK> boogie nights portrays john holmes as a slightly heroic character with a tragic yet comedic <UNK> he is a caricature of a real person he was more of less a mixed up kid that got what he got through his large <UNK> director james cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in john's life into a nightmare for all of us watching the details of the real life murders make this movie even more eerie br br val kilmer took what he learned of jim <UNK> from the doors enhanced the performance for the <UNK> sea and then further enhanced that to bring us the <UNK> of john holmes through cocaine all of the actors pull off very realistic looking <UNK> of cocaine <UNK> josh <UNK> performance stands out as one of the best in the movie he plays ron <UNK> i think this character is suppose to be the same as the thomas jane character from boogie nights ron was the leader of the gang loved having john holmes around as a novelty and had a cocaine <UNK> like sharks enjoy blood the cocaine use seems so realistic as to make one think did they really use <UNK> br br where boogie nights has a <UNK> pop feel to it lots of color and 70's nostalgia wonderland is dark the action is fast and furious with a lot of jumps it is <UNK> and grainy there is no comedy just a never ending pace as if the director is trying to put us into the nervous fast paced edgy cocaine high to make us feel what the characters are feeling this is a graphic movie it has one of the most intensely violent scenes i have ever seen in a movie it actually shows the murders themselves through the eyes of john holmes at first and then from a third person perspective it is so graphic it looks like police evidence of a crime i had to pause after this scene and remind myself this was just a movie this movie is definitely not recommended for everyone i recommend it as a good alternative to boogie nights for those interested in the other sides of john holmes br br celluloid <UNK>
<START> this film is absolutely stunning a new blade runner future noir at it's most gritty the vision of paris is superb both <UNK> and <UNK> with sweeping <UNK> <UNK> set pieces and futuristic virtual reality br br the story line is quite simple with few surprises but that's not what i like most about the film it is a visual treat br br done in 3d and rendered in black and white no <UNK> with only one short spot of colour it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds there are many arty camera shots closeups and odd <UNK> but that just adds to the <UNK> of the film overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form br br i was initially under the impression that the film had been <UNK> such was the level of animation and high detail in the character's facial expressions but unlike a <UNK> darkly which suffers from or indeed is enhanced by inconsistent character definition just watch the way some of the hair changes shape renaissance is consistent and precise throughout when the character is in close up added details and <UNK> can <UNK> seen but when in mid shot or further away details are <UNK> but not to the <UNK> of character definition br br for me the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a one off project such a shame as i would like to see more of this futuristic film noir storyline and especially in this cutting edge graphic style br br oh and the english dub is great too br br all in all a great film and highly recommended
<START> watching this several times as a child was quite the experience 15 years ago and now that i've found it again it still has a film experience like few others if <UNK> it's a great display of morals and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young kids while it still holds up as an adult i was fortunate to have learned from it many times over years ago trying to find it today is hard enough but believe me it is well worth it no matter what the age anime fans especially will find this a great entry to <UNK> <UNK> filmography with impressive art work and unique designs <UNK> no <UNK> represents a worthwhile experience while some of the lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in english the musical score is nevertheless captivating but even the voice acting is far better than much released today unfortunately is went out of print in the mid 1980s from <UNK> columbia home video and has not received any new format release to my knowledge at least in the us look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied it's an <UNK> intense enjoyable and important landmark in japanese animation
<START> re pro jury br br although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story br br one may believe that middle class teen age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30 year <UNK> they barely know but i doubt it br br easily give away virginity what a <UNK> remark about this film truly br br one may believe that young high school teens are highly self confident and self assured as they interact with their <UNK> in complex social situations but my experience has been more often than not teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world br br you just aren't at all able to see the world other than through your own eyes that's sad br br one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of busy earth <UNK> and not <UNK> that some lifeless bland <UNK> is fake but i think not br br and another expert opinion drawn from experience dandy br br one may believe that 30 something year old <UNK> can enter into and hang around inside a public school <UNK> hall during a school social and make trouble but i think that school <UNK> are <UNK> a <UNK> environment and parents <UNK> and school staff would be around to prevent this br br now be a good sport and tell us at which institution you grew up br br one final <UNK> throughout hey <UNK> <UNK> the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the <UNK> there is probably an explanation why the five were the <UNK> but because it was never detailed each reference <UNK> from each scene br br of course there's probably an explanation good job <UNK> that out now i'll be generous and will help you out of your misery although it was translated as a general <UNK> the word <UNK> <UNK> has another meaning it's a sports term used to <UNK> a <UNK> or <UNK> setup a <UNK> crew <UNK> of 5 persons 4 <UNK> and a <UNK> br br this movie did not ring true for me br br we should all <UNK> to your competent and <UNK> opinion dude
<START> i just thought it was excellent and i still do i'm grateful we're still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost <UNK> us with saving grace is smart and enjoyable those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the america's bride sort of movie br br saving grace also shows that a funny movie doesn't have to be stupid i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also <UNK> questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husband's <UNK> br br in a nutshell a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing you couldn't ask for more br br 7 10
<START> it has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and <UNK> the only two movies i can think of is enchanted april 1992 and the enchanted <UNK> 1945 both movies used wonderful actors not stars in both movies all the actors gave their best romantic performances br br enchanted april is about four english women after wwi who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in italy while on vacation it is amazing enchanted april was made in 1992 it stands out as an enjoyable classic
<START> to be honest i had to go see this movie backwards didn't expect that much but hey i was not <UNK> i had a good time br br i would say this movie is way a fresh <UNK> despite some facts that they tried to <UNK> nancy drew but this made me remember these youth movies of the 60 70s from europe and <UNK> where they manage to have children getting <UNK> with adults in this case a 16 year old teenager tries to do justice by trying to solve a mystery concerning the death of an actress who died 25 years ago anyway as her dad had business in hollywood why not rent a home with a mystery behind doors well at least emma roberts does a great job here kinda like the <UNK> kid who at first is <UNK> brought to support his sister's pranks to nancy but at the end found nancy quite cool enough to stick with her even with her matters br br rest of the supporting cast is great and was happy to see <UNK> leigh cook in a different role this time a single mother she did it in family rescue but this time she plays a mature woman anyway don't dump this it is fun
<START> i'll be short and to the point this movie was an insult to any one with a room <UNK> iq sorry <UNK> <UNK> etc no women will ever be a seal they can forget about the draft or being in combat too ain't going to happen you see hard as it is to understand or accept men and women are physically different regardless of the fact it is 2007 reality cannot change things in order for people to avoid having their feelings hurt men can't give birth or breast feed babies oh i forgot about san <UNK> br br women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in a combat or other physically challenging situations how many women play in the <UNK> or <UNK> lastly i couldn't give a bloody hoot in hell if what i just wrote <UNK> you come to think of it if this does upset you that only <UNK> my heart more i didn't write one thing that wasn't the truth this <UNK> movie is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy one at that
<START> there are two kinds of 1950s musicals first you have the glossy mgm productions with big names and great music and then you have the minor league with a less famous cast less famous music and second rate directors 'the girl can't help <UNK> belongs to the latter category neither tom <UNK> or <UNK> o'brien became famous and <UNK> <UNK> was famous for her well never mind seems like every decade has its share of bo <UNK> or pamela <UNK> the plot itself is thin as a <UNK> and one can't help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for <UNK> domino little richard or others of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the movie if that music appeals to you this is worth watching if not don't bother
<START> this production was made in the middle 1980s and appears to be the first serious attempt to put bleak house on celluloid no film version of the novel was ever attempted it is remarkably rich in subplots that actually serve as <UNK> to each other so that it would have been very hard to <UNK> it down the novel was the only attempt by dickens to make a central narrator one of two in the work a woman esther <UNK> esther is raised by her aunt and uncle who in typical dickens style <UNK> her she is <UNK> but they won't tell her anything about her <UNK> later we get involved with the <UNK> sir <UNK> <UNK> and his wife lady <UNK> <UNK> dame diana <UNK> is having an increasingly difficult time regarding her private life and the <UNK> involvement of the family <UNK> <UNK> peter vaughn we also are involved with the actions of richard <UNK> <UNK> boyfriend in trying to win a long drawn out estate <UNK> case <UNK> v <UNK> which everyone even <UNK> cousin john <UNK> played by <UNK> elliot warns is not worth the effort br br dickens had been a law reporter and then a <UNK> reporter before he wrote fiction starting with the <UNK> of promise case in <UNK> papers dickens looked closely at the law mr <UNK> said it was a ass in oliver twist and dickens would consistently support that view he looks at the <UNK> as <UNK> grounds for crime in twist that the law barely tries to cure he attacks the <UNK> and outdated estate laws as well as too powerful <UNK> and greedy lawyers <UNK> <UNK> in bleak house in little <UNK> he attacks the <UNK> <UNK> he had hit it also in david <UNK> in our mutual friend he looks at <UNK> and <UNK> in the mystery of <UNK> <UNK> he apparently was going to go to a murder trial dickens was far more critical of legal <UNK> than most of his <UNK> including <UNK> br br but the novel also looks at other problems like charity and religious <UNK> the budding scotland yard detective force social <UNK> in the industrial revolution he also uses the novel to <UNK> various people leigh hunt the writer inspector fields of scotland yard and even the notorious maria <UNK> most of these points were kept in this fine mini series version if it is shown again on a cable station catch it
<START> why can't more directors these days create horror movies like the shining there's an easy answer to that modern day directors are not stanley kubrick kubrick proved once and for all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and <UNK> of all time br br so the plot is fairly simple a man named jack <UNK> played brilliantly by jack nicholson and his family move into a large secluded hotel to watch over it for the off season the <UNK> is that the previous caretaker of the hotel <UNK> murdered his wife and two girls what follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie but you have to watch it to see what i mean br br this is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as scary it's some seriously messed up stuff but in a good way one of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music music has been a major part of kubrick's movies 2001 a space <UNK> and a clockwork orange just to name a couple and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one the score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it br br finally i must comment on <UNK> legendary performance jack is <UNK> convincing as a crazy killer in fact just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie this is top notch acting that must be seen to believe br br there will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one r i p stanley
<START> once again pia <UNK> the woman who owes her entire career to her husband proves she can't act this disaster of a film <UNK> the harold robbins novel ray liotta must have been <UNK> and carried to the set to appear in this one br br avoid this at all costs i doubt even doing the mst3k thing would save it
<START> i saw this movie when i was a child it blew me away this was before the days of television so a movie of this <UNK> could send a young kid into <UNK> it so impressed me that i went to see this movie for twelve <UNK> days the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its' time <UNK> was a real delight as was rex <UNK> as the genie i found myself singing i want to be a sailor for months after the film left town i would recommend this movie to any and everyone i forgot to mention conrad <UNK> who was as villainous a character as you'd ever want to meet also june <UNK> was never <UNK> than she was in this picture the color was outstanding give this movie an <UNK>
<START> this is a <UNK> done simplistic film that explores a theme and gives each viewer something different that they take from it the premise is simple an <UNK> celebrity actor morgan freeman decides to research for an upcoming role by visiting a store and watching people he takes particular interest in the <UNK> at the 10 items or less lane paz vega who he finds an <UNK> strong and curious presence br br both actors play off each other brilliantly and bring solid dimension to characters in what is a character study not a conventional character study they each represent entire worlds the <UNK> life is <UNK> in a harsh and frustrating real world while the actor is so <UNK> in his fantasy existence that he can't do simple tasks like remember phone numbers he readily admits he's putting on a face when he talks to people and the whole point of <UNK> real people shows he's not one of them br br but not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work we see the reverse process as well several characters recognize him and make reference to how he has inspired them with his movie roles br br the <UNK> favorite song al <UNK> la <UNK> about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers instead to pay ie do honest work for boat passage couldn't have been chosen better it parallels with the vega character the only store employee with any brains or ambition who is willing to work hard to succeed that's quite an <UNK> for somebody who looks like paz vega it's an odd little film probably made on a <UNK> if you don't mind slow pacing and a talky approach this film will entertain the characters are perfectly <UNK> and the effective acting makes them endearing a nice watch
<START> i have to say that grand canyon is one of the most affecting films i've ever seen i've watched it several times now and i still feel as i did the first time that this film by itself could make up the entire <UNK> of a post graduate course in film direction br br a long time ago film trailers used to promise it'll make you laugh it'll make you cry that's a very trite and <UNK> method of describing what grand canyon does it takes you to the best places in human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell br br much of the film is paced to cycle back and forth between people being close to happiness and the same people being close to horror it's always a short step too just to manage that swing with grace and without making it look false or exaggerated is directorial genius br br spoiler of sorts coming up after getting the audience used to <UNK> back and forth through the emotional spectrum the film throws a <UNK> with a sequence that doesn't go from good to bad and back but instead <UNK> from an ordinary marital <UNK> through an accidental self inflicted knife wound that may or may not require <UNK> to an <UNK> that has the characters run from the house in the moment of their relief argument forgotten cut finger forgotten the <UNK> survived a neighbor woman calls out that her elderly husband has <UNK> the couple rushes to his aid i cried when i saw this sequence i cried every time i saw it i'm crying now it isn't sadness that does this to me it's not a particularly sad sequence what tears me up is that this few minutes of film was perfect that's perfect astounding end of spoiler br br there's so much to say about grand canyon it portrays relatively ordinary people experiencing <UNK> and it lets the viewer experience them <UNK> they aren't <UNK> or overblown and there's no long pause to examine the moment carefully the film moves on at the pace of life even when the characters do try to make sense of what has happened they are uncertain of what to <UNK> from their experience br br grand canyon is a very human film
<START> evil breed is a very strange slasher flick that is unfortunately no good the beginning of the film seems promising but overall it's a disaster the dialogue is pretty bad but not near as bad as the acting the acting is brutal and unbearable most of the characters deliver there lines horribly and even if that is on purpose the method doesn't work because the characters become annoying some of the kills are innovative but it took far too long to get to them after about a half hour through the movie we get the first death other than in the beginning and then almost every other character is <UNK> within the next five minutes the movie then turned into sort of a spoof with ridiculous looking characters unrealistic karate like fights and a scene in which a man gets his intestines pulled out of his a <UNK> none of it is funny it's just plain ridiculous the film then becomes ultra gory and ultra pointless most of the characters are clichéd even for slasher standards and are as solid as <UNK> left on the counter for 5 days evil breed isn't even laughably bad therefore it fails in it's main task watch texas chainsaw massacre just before dawn or see no evil for a real slasher
<START> a lot of people seemed to have liked the film so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review but after sitting through <UNK> minutes of it i feel i have to do so where the heck is the plot in this film i must have missed it i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didn't build up to it i forgot who was who half of the time so they didn't really develop the characters the acting was so so most of the time it was believable but i was able to see through it most of the time so without giving anything away i must say that unless you like the actors in the film there is no real reason to watch this movie i could be mistaken but i just didn't understand why there was so little or too much of the film i can't decide which one that would be so i say judge for yourselves i don't even know if renting it would be a good idea the cost and all br br plot 0 10 characters 1 10 acting 2 10 overall 3 10 i feel like that's too high really i am staying with my vote up at the top
<START> i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because i think the wild women of <UNK> is worse this is an exercise in patience it's like having your teeth <UNK> by a bad dental <UNK> there's no plot there's no logic there is certainly no acting although the shark has some quality dialogue we don't wonder about anything we don't know how people got where they got it's always amazing to me how things like this even get released i agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad i know it's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a dvd collection it's like a <UNK> or a bad painting you bought at a starving <UNK> sale it covers the crack in the wall

<START> i've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it this one ought to be a cult <UNK> the best line your dress is deeply cool says the prince to cinderella kathleen turner shines as the stepmother i also like the 1950's era cars and <UNK> the melancholy prince is a great departure from the typical <UNK> he tries to stay cool but fails to hide his love for the fairy tale princess to be her <UNK> is not glass <UNK> to the original story but cinderella loses is nonetheless but gets it back from the heir to the throne my only complaint is that it is not shown more and seems to be almost impossible to get hopefully blockbuster or amazon will start <UNK> this one sometime soon
<START> i try to be very objective when i view a low budget movie i also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions i expect near <UNK> from big budget productions and their studios therefore i apply <UNK> <UNK> to the major studio releases but this movie was just a dud period the premise was terrible the main character mary <UNK> alicia <UNK> was unbelievable as a high school senior with an <UNK> desire to solve crimes there was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world also to make this movie more mysterious the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood especially in the warehouse br br once again another disappointing movie that i could only give three points to
<START> this movie makes me think the others i've seen with combs were an accident the plot had more holes than i think i've ever seen in a movie <UNK> to be something more than a b movie the acting was so laughable that not even the memories of <UNK> past campy <UNK> were enough to save it considering the script i have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas i am thoroughly upset that i paid blockbuster <UNK> for this trash the fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movies this poor should be required to warn you of avoid this movie no matter what
<START> this movie is finally out on dvd in italy completely restored i have seen this movie so many times and i find it even actual these days 2003 when italy suffers again from a sort of <UNK> <UNK> or the us for that matter i am glad there are <UNK> as the one played by mastroianni in this movie who can sing out of tune maybe they can teach the sophia <UNK> of this world how to be strong and fight to be <UNK> as human beings br br back to the movie as most people here already mentioned the acting is wonderful but the audio background is astonishing i must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you don't understand the italian language but i can assure you that the show off of <UNK> the <UNK> of reality in that ever present radio <UNK> of the hitler visit to rome can really make you <UNK> br br a masterpiece br br
<START> after too many bad memories i took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the season 2 sequence i recently watched it again just to remind me why i've always considered this the worst st <UNK> episode with the exception of shades of gray which barely counts as an episode at all br br i keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red <UNK> by the author's writing 101 teacher show don't tell from deanna <UNK> <UNK> and everyone else's constant <UNK> <UNK> about what a charming dangerous rogue <UNK> is to <UNK> explanation about how funny her <UNK> joke is it isn't to the who cares resolution to the conflict there isn't a plot point that isn't <UNK> and triple <UNK> for our <UNK> and there ain't a believable moment in any of it unfortunately bill campbell a charming actor in other circumstances is too puppy dog <UNK> to be the center of the <UNK> of the plot on the other hand it could be that no one short of john <UNK> jack <UNK> from doctor who could pull of this <UNK> <UNK> of a role br br zero points by the way to the data subplot while i think joe <UNK> stopped being funny decades ago he and brent <UNK> had nothing to work with here although the jerry lewis bit was funny in a stupid way br br on a good day you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser original series episode me i'd rather skip ahead to time <UNK> or q who
<START> brilliant over acting by <UNK> ann warren best dramatic <UNK> lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing <UNK> the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a <UNK> selling out his boss and being <UNK> the lawyer of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i'm a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey <UNK> a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more <UNK> than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless <UNK> a <UNK> site are all time classics look for the legs scene and the two big <UNK> fighting one <UNK> this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often
<START> long before <UNK> mountain about 23 years before deathtrap was the first time i ever saw two men <UNK> kissing on screen and frankly i was shocked i understood it in terms of the plot and it didn't really upset my sensibilities not much but it was the first time i ever saw it at least in a mainstream movie i thought it was a <UNK> move for its time and took courage for them to try it especially christopher reeve in the midst of his time as pg rated superman male <UNK> on screen may have hit its <UNK> with <UNK> but it's interesting to note this much earlier incarnation
<START> this was thought to be the <UNK> work of the open source community something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as we're not stuck in the marketing trap with our <UNK> in producing fine work with open source tools after the basic version <UNK> die hard fan here on a <UNK> up <UNK> eventually got here i hit my first <UNK> media player <UNK> classic <UNK> failed to open it on my <UNK> box and then <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> failed to open it on my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> managed to run it <UNK> going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open it br br the film beautiful soundtrack superb lighting masterful camera work and flawless <UNK> everything looked real and then the two main characters moved and spoke and the movie died for me everything apart from the lip <UNK> and the actual animation of the two main characters except for <UNK> in the dancing scene looked fluid and totally alive the two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut scenes that <UNK> less realism than this br br any frame in the movie is fantastic as a frame and the thing is great if neither actors are moving i'm so glad i haven't actually recommended this to anyone i'd ruin my reputation br br oh and final fantasy had a more <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> plot br br this movie would get 10 stars if it wasn't for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen
<START> it's not like i have <UNK> fond memories of verhoeven's original pants down shocker it always struck me as a glossy well made airport novel of a movie thrilling sexy trash but trash nonetheless it was also a film that <UNK> into a certain sexual <UNK> after a decade of anti sex aids induced <UNK> a film about a wildly sexual <UNK> who thrill kills to <UNK> her sexual pleasure was pretty <UNK> stuff basic instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and <UNK> so the fact that it's desperate attempts at <UNK> are so lame can sort of be overlooked all it really had to provide was that thin <UNK> of <UNK> and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable that it <UNK> fails on so many levels and in such a way to be a career <UNK> for everyone involved is really quite extraordinary to watch let's state the obvious for starters sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual <UNK> catherine <UNK> what was so <UNK> thru verhoeven's lens looks like <UNK> dressed as <UNK> in the hands of gun for hire michael <UNK> jones who's flat drab colours and static camera render her <UNK> beauty totally <UNK> i like sharon stone a lot but if the first film launched her career <UNK> could kill it she has no chemistry with stuffed shirt david <UNK> their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch his <UNK> faced <UNK> boy of a character made me <UNK> for the <UNK> orange skin <UNK> of michael douglas supporting turns by david <UNK> and charlotte <UNK> waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and cliché heavy <UNK> and what of the much <UNK> sexual <UNK> poorly lit <UNK> <UNK> as utterly mainstream as an episode of desperate <UNK> the european sensibilities that verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed don't watch this film for <UNK> thrills there are none and what there is is tragic the film is as a whole convoluted to the point of utter confusion boring and laughable the last 40 minutes in particular where you come to the <UNK> that the film is in fact not going to go anywhere of interest at all are particularly <UNK> and hilarious in equal measure as a failed sequel basic instinct 2 will come to <UNK> similar cinematic ground as exorcist 2 the <UNK> beyond the <UNK> adventure and <UNK> as a vanity project it rivals battlefield earth in its <UNK> as a multi million dollar piece of hollywood film making it's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst
<START> as a veteran of many many pretentious french films i thought i'd taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything but not this pointless relentless violent unpleasant meaningless the film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and <UNK> dressed up as pretentious art avoid at all costs
<START> this film has its share of negative comments and i have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made true most of the films based on the works of king are pretty bad but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible there is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary it is typical king garbage <UNK> twisted around that made no sense in the first place mixed with obvious and <UNK> so called scares that are about as shocking as <UNK> <UNK> which at least is entertaining it is full of ridiculous moments not the least of which is alice <UNK> character when she goes on a rampage and starts <UNK> like the villain in an old batman tv show it is so absurd as to be sickening all the people who had cameos in this including john <UNK> are lucky they still have careers but the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at k mart the best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out act the people in the movie
<START> basically this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do rather than having to sit through it for two hours or as in my case you see it as a <UNK> hit one of those movies <UNK> the humour the plot the acting is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it <UNK> the director well the reward is u laugh your a of the fact that u have to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even more funny because u get the impression the director isn't even aware of how funny his movie is which doesn't seem likely and <UNK> lies the intelligence at the <UNK> of this <UNK> project called <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is an excellent example of early bette davis talent the production is above average for 1936 <UNK> i cannot understand why the owners of the rights to this film have not put it on dvd owners please please release it i would buy it immediately i have not seen it in more than thirty years on television but remember it well
<START> i always get frustrated by films that were obviously written by one gender especially when they obviously don't do enough research to find out when something not only doesn't ring true but rings <UNK> false br br the scene i am remembering is the one in the bathroom where jack tells his football <UNK> that he got diane pregnant in no way shape or form would a guy ever cheer another guy getting a girl pregnant in high school they might cheer about the guy having sex with the hot <UNK> but i can also guarantee that the first the football team heard about it would not be at a <UNK> br br it was obvious that this film didn't take itself so seriously and it wasn't <UNK> bad but come on
<START> this movie is about a side of ireland that americans don't normally see the narrow minded <UNK> <UNK> side of the <UNK> race in the <UNK> the movie by the admission of the inhabitants of <UNK> who are old enough to remember the events is fairly accurate though they insist that the film makers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action br br the movie was very <UNK> in ireland as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light but the simple fact is that <UNK> of the catholic church did <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> before <UNK> it was the jews br br the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland
<START> this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5 why not it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless <UNK> of the passion of the christ johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are <UNK> and neglected in areas where they should matter most like our <UNK> the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god <UNK> him through it great credit to everyone involved in this <UNK> sincere movie which will always be <UNK> by its fans at least the billy graham <UNK> rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians thanks fox for producing it as walk the line proved that it was <UNK> that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece movies are not <UNK> through popular vote as this production proves in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is <UNK> honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith
<START> paul reiser steps away from the <UNK> comedy spotlight to write a <UNK> humorous and gently tender story about family what we see and what we don't see what we expect and what surprises us the thing about my folks doesn't set any new standards for film but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents br br sam <UNK> peter falk has been a <UNK> at times pushing his wife muriel olympia dukakis his daughters <UNK> connolly and <UNK> jordan and his son ben paul reiser into the background one day muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving her daughters along with ben's wife rachel elizabeth <UNK> immediately begin the search for her <UNK> leaving the confused and hurt and <UNK> sam to sort things out on a road trip with son ben the road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members sam <UNK> for the first time in his life and introduces the now <UNK> ben to the pleasures and fun of living the trip comes to an end with a phone call about the <UNK> of muriel and why she left and the <UNK> of the <UNK> family draws the story's warm ending all is not what it seemed it's better and well different br br falk and reiser play off each other like the pros they are but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when olympia dukakis is on screen reminding us that she is one of our strongest <UNK> on film well worth viewing grady <UNK>
<START> walt disney his 9 old men put their own 1950 spin on the classic fairy tale of cinderella which i guess you could say helps form an <UNK> fairy tale princess trilogy from the classic disney years br br the plot cinderella is a nice girl who can't catch a break she is the daughter of a nice wealthy widower who loved her <UNK> but her mother passed away when cinderella was very young and <UNK> father felt she needed a mother figure so he eventually married the woman who would become known as lady <UNK> herself a widow with two daughters about the same age as cinderella <UNK> and <UNK> at first they all seemed to get along but then <UNK> father died and lady <UNK> true nature was revealed she was a cold cruel <UNK> heartless mean spirited woman and she passed those traits on to her daughters who were spoiled <UNK> and equally mean spirited <UNK> <UNK> hate cinderella because they know deep down that she's better looking and an overall <UNK> more attractive lady than themselves i e more appealing to men and their mother lady <UNK> hates cindy for pretty much the same reasons as the years passed lady <UNK> began to <UNK> the family <UNK> in a stubborn but <UNK> quest to improve <UNK> her awkward unattractive daughters to call them <UNK> would be an insult to <UNK> people everywhere while all three <UNK> cinderella to being the multi <UNK> servant of the house <UNK> her <UNK> her and <UNK> her every chance they get they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd <UNK> that brings us to cinderella in the present where she has <UNK> into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor br br cinderella gets her shot at freedom happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an <UNK> young maiden so that he can take her as a wife settle down start a family etc naturally her step family tries to keep her from attending even going so far as to physically assault her and rip up the dress she had <UNK> for herself with a little help from her mice friends the dress <UNK> to her <UNK> mother finally pushed beyond her breaking point cinderella runs out into the <UNK> and cries in despair it is at that point that her fairy <UNK> a short <UNK> jolly woman arrives and provides cinderella with <UNK> and a transformed dress after all cinderella wouldn't make a very good impression at the ball if she entered the scene looking like she had just gotten gang raped cindy arrives at the ball the prince falls hard for her but that <UNK> midnight rule gets in the way forcing her to flee but leaving behind a glass <UNK> make a long story short after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass <UNK> cinderella is found and she and the prince get married giving her the happy ending she deserves br br overall an enjoyable disney classic not without its flaws the most glaring of which is that the prince is little more than a <UNK> to help push the plot along he has very little screen time and even less dialogue so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with cinderella which is unfortunate since according to the making of documentary the prince was originally meant to play a bigger role and a few additional scenes to help flesh out cinderella herself might have been helpful there was a song that showed her <UNK> of turning into an army of <UNK> to clean up the house as well as <UNK> on her step family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy which was cut because walt himself thought it made her look <UNK> still cinderella herself is a likable enough heroine even if she is <UNK> by her mice friends and there's a <UNK> to the film that is becoming harder to find these days of course if this were being made now cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax either by picking the lock herself or making an <UNK> yet exciting jump down from her window but this is beside the point br br and for all those who say cinderella sets a bad example for young girls well consider this at least cinderella didn't go around getting <UNK> drunk and <UNK> exposed unlike some modern day <UNK> you know who i mean
<START> young and attractive japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again this time it involves mobile phones various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is <UNK> so essentially if you've seen more than 2 recent japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied br br the main attraction here is the fact that takashi miike is behind the camera so far i've been more impressed with his low key works like city of lost souls however as one missed call <UNK> along i was yearning for his more renowned <UNK> pushing of dead or alive or the overly pseudo <UNK> style of audition despite a lot of his films being essentially empty at least they do have merits such as these or at least something to keep your attention like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about in shiny suits <UNK> johnny <UNK> there's none of that in one missed call there's just very little of credit the acting is bland and average there is very little nothing in all honesty in the way of scares or suspense and in places it's just downright boring br br however there are moments where miike's <UNK> like sense of humour <UNK> through the bland <UNK> most notably with the instance of the tv show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects and the tv <UNK> more concerned about his ratings than the girls' life but aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is miike behind the camera most notably his usual visual flair has <UNK> without a trace and that includes his famous gore although it's more likely he just didn't have any enthusiasm for the project and i can understand why one missed call isn't <UNK> bad it's just <UNK> average br br miike obviously loves directing with his huge <UNK> <UNK> it's obvious he isn't going to be 100 concerned about all his projects but even with this in mind one missed call felt like he was just paying the bills
<START> feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other we haven't seen stuff like this since godzilla v king kong and the like always sounds great on paper when you're <UNK> up and in a <UNK> of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like <UNK> <UNK> then you come to writing it great ideas like all vampires are female <UNK> hot seductive deadly but in a way i want to <UNK> sort of way and all zombies are men well thats what men are like to a woman just after <UNK> been dumped or cheated on right so it all looks good up to actually making it then the <UNK> starts to set in <UNK> have fight nothing much happens another fight philosophical <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> we've found how to win big fight again and the end sounds great doesn't it if it was made an indie company it would be great but this is hollywood with the eye on the bucks <UNK> instead of what the fans want it all could have been gore <UNK> beautiful
<START> i rented this film from netflix for two reasons i was in the mood for what i thought would be a silly <UNK> sci fi <UNK> and because it is the first feature length superman film needless to say after about 15 minutes i found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised br br an experimental oil well has <UNK> about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the <UNK> lois and clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever <UNK> will no longer be in operation a day later strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for superman than clark kent it seems that the <UNK> mole men have <UNK> from their six mile deep home near the <UNK> core br br <UNK> and the mole men is a simplistic but well made piece of social realism released in 1951 starring a lead actor who served in world war ii the moral of the story seems to be that americans are just as capable of becoming <UNK> as anybody else to drive this point home in a typically straightforward superman manner reeves even <UNK> the lynch mob hunting the mole men of being <UNK> at one point br br even in the 1950s the science underlying this film was nonexistent six miles of <UNK> through <UNK> <UNK> would not have even <UNK> the upper <UNK> let alone the hollow center of the earth which in any case does not exist forgivable keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book br br the film is a little <UNK> paced although the <UNK> are interesting a bit creepy and nicely portrayed there are several corman esquire scenes which spend too much time <UNK> showing us their odd behavior the script is intelligent and <UNK> by today's standards the <UNK> is poor to fair but for its time this film's special effects and <UNK> were quite good the cinematography is also generally very good and the acting is much better than one might expect i was particularly impressed with reeves jeff corey and walter reed
<START> the bubble is an effort to make a gay romeo juliet type of story with an israeli and a palestinian although it seems to come at it by way of friends or beverly hills <UNK> the characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line the movie seems torn between fluff and depth on the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as in one example of many some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand and get answers like hey we're here to make a poster for a rave against the <UNK> don't get political beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line it's just one of many ham <UNK> <UNK> that the movie is just as hollow and <UNK> as its title suggests on the other hand the movie's main <UNK> to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of bent a play about gays in a nazi labor camp the scene on stage is <UNK> rushed <UNK> its erotic power understandable given the constraints of film time but still this could have been edited to much better effect and comes off as <UNK> as the rest of the film too bad this play deserves much better br br the characters are so one <UNK> <UNK> some even have names that <UNK> their entire though the word seems inappropriate here substance the aggressive soldier from the crack <UNK> <UNK> is named <UNK> the <UNK> palestinian is named <UNK> the <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> roommate is <UNK> anyone familiar with the <UNK> and life in <UNK> whether from real life or documentaries will find the <UNK> scenes as <UNK> unreal <UNK> well the rest of this <UNK> fantasy when a palestinian woman goes into the <UNK> labor on record israeli soldiers are <UNK> and helpful an <UNK> shows up in minutes the outcome of the birth serves to show the <UNK> as <UNK> of israeli <UNK> and even downright <UNK> altogether the <UNK> is shown as a mere <UNK> not the series of bone numbing soul <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth death or severe illness <UNK> the palestinian lover seems to get through from <UNK> to tel <UNK> with no problems no papers no <UNK> he just shows up whenever he likes when the <UNK> want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of lucy <UNK> br br against the backdrop of nice supportive <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose  except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden lovers br br gay israeli palestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to think br br <UNK> bad films  like the works of ed wood at least have some striking <UNK> to <UNK> them this one doesn't even have that going for it most of the sound track sounds like simon and <UNK> on <UNK> and even with the weird <UNK> touches to the gay sex scenes the general incompetence that <UNK> this movie plays out like a mediocre tv movie of the week

<START> <UNK> hippie past was a revelation but overall this felt like crashing a wake <UNK> stories work best around the <UNK> of a <UNK> there were just too many semi boring old friends <UNK> and too much filler stock footage i love the clash and joe for not <UNK> and selling their songs until now fu mick jones but this doc left me wanting to relate more using <UNK> <UNK> without proper explanation of who is telling the <UNK> <UNK> the viewer to some extent they should have been interviewed on their own even using <UNK> <UNK> dj <UNK> did little to <UNK> the film together and can someone explain all the <UNK> flying behind the <UNK> scenes after the awesome filth and the fury i hoped temple could deliver a joe <UNK> doc deserves better
<START> loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager the movie was presented well with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing many scenes <UNK> the imagination and created a nail <UNK> the progression of situations were cleverly written making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious too bad there have to be commercials i have told many friends to watch for further <UNK> and i of course will view again i enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue husband and wife <UNK> discussions or should i say fights were very realistic the initial situation is a common one but the <UNK> into the story presented fortunately is not i want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film thank you looking forward to the next films when <UNK>

<START> where to start i feel <UNK> thats right <UNK> i just spent 1 <UNK> of my life 1 <UNK> that i could have spent doing something more useful like watching paint dry on this so called horror flick br br its not scary its not funny its not dramatic its no action its nothing br br its predictable its boring its tragic br br i might come of a bit harsh here but watch this movie and you will feel the same way or no don't watch it unless you want to feel <UNK> also
<START> neat premise very unrealistic what i learned from this movie is that <UNK> <UNK> out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all unfortunately the same can't be said for his gal oh and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wreck br br lots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper still have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand i admit i was intrigued to see what the mysterious thing was behind the door but when it appeared i just laughed ha ha ha the girl really seemed <UNK> angry about being <UNK> personally i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that
<START> this was a disappointing horror film about a <UNK> young girl and her nightmares for a horror or thriller film and hype it's way too tame there are only a few tense moments in here not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre even those tense scenes weren't much the music made them more dramatic that they actually were br br there is a lot of symbolism in here so the <UNK> critics label this a thinking person's horror film well if they think about it i'm sure they will come to the same conclusion i did a waste of money at the video rental store br br summary a <UNK> that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised
<START> this movie pretty much sucked i'm in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible if your in the military and you see this movie you'll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad it was ridiculous they acted like a bunch of normal people with army uniforms on not knowing what to do it was a pretty gory movie i'd have to say the least there was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump i'd recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent gory movie it will be a better movie also if your not in the military i also would have to say i liked the first one better than this one
<START> absolutely fantastic br br now before a legion of cinema <UNK> choke on their <UNK> allow me to elaborate much as i enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films i have ever seen and is certainly the worst film i've seen at the cinema an impressive claim as i remember seeing <UNK> on the big screen the two leads daniel <UNK> and elisha <UNK> were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst of course they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a daphne <UNK> single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the <UNK> <UNK> the plot to stretch the term slightly was thin to non existent and the <UNK> scenes whilst undoubtedly brutal were irrelevant and laughably formulaic what plot there is revolves around a twenty something model <UNK> who is <UNK> imprisoned and subjected to various visceral <UNK> both psychological and physical the torture scenes feel like <UNK> set pieces and the emphasis was laid <UNK> upon shocking rather than <UNK> the audience whilst there really are very very few <UNK> to draw from this film its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film i have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema within twenty minutes the entire cinema was in <UNK> and remained that way throughout for my part i came out <UNK> with laughter <UNK> by a film that had <UNK> to the <UNK> of appalling film making <UNK> way you look at it this is truly a cinematic achievement and a <UNK> for future directorial <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> how not to make a film br br p s i <UNK> to mention that i managed to get in to the film free so i can afford to laugh about it i was still tempted to ask for my money back it really was that bad
<START> six for the price of one so it is a bonanza time for <UNK> isn't it here it is not one not two but all six love stories an ensemble cast of top stars of bollywood plus all stories in the genre of your favorite top directors <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> et al you will get to see every damn type of love story that you enjoyed or rather <UNK> for years now so no big deal for you do you need anything more than this no sir thank you why sir enough is enough please spare us they signed every top star that they manage to sign whether required or not so they end up making a circus of stars believe it or not too crowded every thing depicted here is exactly how it is <UNK> in bollywood <UNK> of romances plus you have to justify the length given to each story as each has stars therefore it is too long three hours plus the gags are <UNK> characters are <UNK> problems <UNK> situations resolution  yes you guessed it right <UNK> <UNK> tried and tested same hundreds of dancers dancing in colorful costumes in background why they have no other work to do all couples are <UNK> sweet fairy tale type picture perfect all are good looking each story beginning in a perfect way and therefore should ends also in that impossible perfect manner too <UNK> you can't connect to a single story here you have everything that you already seen a million times bloody fake unreal <UNK> <UNK> stories considered normal for more than hundred years since evolution of this indian cinema what a mockery of sensibilities of today's audience yes it could have worked as a parody if he just paid tribute to love stories of <UNK> but alas even that thing is not explored at least director <UNK> <UNK> should have attempted one unconventional offbeat love story but then what will happen to the tradition of living up to the mark of commercial <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> oh somebody has to carry on no imagine on one hand audience finds it difficult to sit through one such love story and here we have six times the pain i mean six damn stories i mean double the fun of <UNK> <UNK> year 2000 in this age and time get something real guys we are now desperate to see some not so colorful people and not so bright stories oh what have you said just now come on that is entertainment my advice please don't waste your time <UNK> reading such reviews go instead have some more such entertainment thank you
<START> although a tear <UNK> it is definitely a feel good movie all the actors were excellent and will smith as always does the job and does it well i could go on but pick any ten of the 10 ratings and they've said it as well and likely better than i could br br but since i must include at least 10 lines to post a comment i will say that rosario dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer her performance was most enjoyable and i look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come br br and this film demonstrates that will smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor
<START> pierce brosnan will probably be the only thing familiar in richard <UNK> new biopic the rest is new to international audiences canadian history and first nations culture br br grey owl is a light examination of how an man came to be adopted into the <UNK> of northern <UNK> learning and preaching <UNK> decades before it became politically correct to do so the film contains a love story a moral message and a man tortured by his past that torture though is not always brought to life with the dramatic impact that it might br br nevertheless it is a film which holds its audience without any violence it pays deep respect to <UNK> first nations and presents them in a <UNK> and non stereotypical manner <UNK> performance is somewhat stiff but i suspect that's just how lord attenborough wanted him br br thanks from a proud canadian
<START> <UNK> could have been good campy fun but it commits the only unforgivable sin it is b o r i n g the pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so artificial that it's next to impossible to care where it's going the story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive <UNK> <UNK> but this video should have carried a warning label caution student film fit for viewing only by relatives of the film maker
<START> this movie is the first time movie experience for several people in the cast all of them are experienced actors and have played in several tv series and plays <UNK> <UNK> is a well known comedian in turkey it's kind of strange to see him in a thriller while he is at the peak of his comedy career in turkey this movie is <UNK> <UNK> first long shot and pretty much the first experience as a director but they all did a good job we are happy to see such enthusiastic young cast they seem very promising for the future of the turkish film industry <UNK> <UNK> being long time sweetheart of <UNK> <UNK> is also a talented actress who is known for her recent play in number 27 theatrical play and several tv series
<START> it at all you have seen when harry met sally then avoid this one it will not only make you bang your head on the table as why can't bollywood even make a good remake but also annoy you with the so called funny moments in it the charm of the movie is missing <UNK> looks terrible saif tries to act like he is one hell of an actor the plots that have been picked up from the original don't look effective either the part where both of them bring their friends along and they hit a note it just doesn't look appealing what can be more disastrous you wanna waste some money this is what you can get otherwise put some more bucks and watch the original its too good to miss
<START> i don't understand the low 5 7 rating on this film it's a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark <UNK> the tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden of good and evil down to the locale <UNK> the acting is strong and i was amazed at the <UNK> of kenneth branagh's southern accent <UNK> <UNK> is great robert <UNK> is effective in a small part and <UNK> <UNK> is the bomb great full nude scene of her too br br the plot is fairly standard but effectively executed
<START> i can't believe anyone thought there was anything original or interesting about this movie i'm a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy and i can enjoy even old movies with ridiculous premises as long when they are written by someone other than a monkey see for example my glowing review of altered states 1980 br br a monkey could have explained better exactly why i should for a second take seriously the basic idea behind this movie the problem is not that the producers had a low budget it's that they didn't care br br now to <UNK> <UNK> the worthless magazines whose glowing reviews appear on the box br br chicago <UNK> br br san francisco <UNK> br br san francisco bay guardian br br actually i enjoy reading the latter two still their movie reviewing credibility has gone through the floor but i know if i ever make a movie with <UNK> camera a cheesy plot and stupid effects i'll show it to these <UNK> and remind them what they said about <UNK> <UNK>

<START> this early sci fi <UNK> by herbert george wells with music by arthur bliss is a powerful piece of film making adapted from <UNK> somewhat different work by the author it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of <UNK> the structure is that after a <UNK> pair of episodes of <UNK> and gathering clouds of war the script allows the war to happen two families the <UNK> and the <UNK> disagree about what may happen <UNK> takes a hopeful view of <UNK> automatic progress <UNK> is the <UNK> the <UNK> their city <UNK> obviously london becomes <UNK> by a war featuring tanks a magnificent war march by bliss and the end of civilization the second portion finds people living in the <UNK> of what had been the city under a boss played with <UNK> by ralph richardson whose woman lovely <UNK> scott is as fascinating a <UNK> as he is a <UNK> bound dictator type he is trying to <UNK> old wwi <UNK> so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planes etc <UNK> this is <UNK> comment on war versus progress the survivors are subject to a plague called the wandering sickness also enter a modern flying machine <UNK> by the <UNK> of the first section of the film now part of wings over the world an international <UNK> <UNK> who are planning to end <UNK> forever this flight suited <UNK> has fascinating conversations with the boss and his woman their attraction being evident then boss sends up his aircraft against them the scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the gas of peace onto the ruins of <UNK> only the boss dies fighting too hard against the <UNK> the film then shows <UNK> being <UNK> and by slow steps being made into the <UNK> of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers in section three a future <UNK> <UNK> with a future <UNK> over the morality of human science <UNK> wonders if they have a right to send men to the moon <UNK> <UNK> man's right to <UNK> and the need to expand his <UNK> the son of <UNK> and <UNK> daughter are the <UNK> being sent <UNK> a religious minded <UNK> makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the city's forum and leads an attack on the <UNK> <UNK> that is to fire the new rocket free of <UNK> gravity the climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully the denouement and ending is a speech by <UNK> <UNK> worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned it is all the universe or nothing <UNK> tells <UNK> which shall it be as <UNK> raymond massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance he is thoughtful compassionate and reasonable a true scientist as the <UNK> <UNK> who wants to end the age of science cedric <UNK> is perfect and powerful edward <UNK> playing <UNK> does admirably <UNK> the voice of convention and fear the storyline is logical frequently beautiful and always interesting given the near <UNK> of mankind the idea of a civilization run by <UNK> scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer this is a triumph for the director william cameron <UNK> for bliss and for all concerned listen to the dialogue with someone you love within its constructed limits this is a thinking man's drama <UNK> two possible human <UNK> progress or its <UNK> opposite
<START> it was meant to be a parody on the lotr trilogy but this was one of the most awful movies i've ever seen bad acting bad screenplay bad everything this is my personal opinion i don't doubt any second that there are people <UNK> like this sense of humor but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as mel brooks or the <UNK> brothers i'm working in a movie theater and in dvd shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas at the movies it was a nice but no big at all success during the first two weeks but then when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good the movie dropped very fast in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore in the last ten years the two worst movies i've seen are the ring thing and <UNK> i can't decide which one was worse but i'm happy that there a so many good movies so i don't have to think too much on this question
<START> first let me state that i do not believe in god if you want to use the word <UNK> fine but i don't like that word since it describes what i'm not not what i am but i hated this documentary the production values were damn near non existent the premise extremely shaky and whole thing seemed to be an exercise in brian <UNK> <UNK> br br the production values were terrible and brian <UNK> is clearly an amateurish director at best the narration sounded like he just narrated over the film all in one shot and he didn't practice at all there were way to many <UNK> and pauses when he should have been talking in the movie animation was also pretty damn bad br br the whole idea that jesus is a mythical character is not taken seriously by historians and biblical <UNK> as i stated before i do not believe in god and i don't think that whether or not jesus was a real man says nothing about the existence of god my personal view jesus probably was a real man but he lived in a time where there were many <UNK> look up <UNK> of <UNK> and that the stories of his life and preaching were blown out of <UNK> the <UNK> you got from his death according to the <UNK> article on the <UNK> of jesus and there's a good <UNK> for this so it's garbage virtually all <UNK> in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that jesus was a jewish teacher from <UNK> who was regarded as a <UNK> was <UNK> by john the <UNK> was accused of <UNK> against the roman empire and on the orders of roman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was sentenced to death by <UNK> 1 i was left wondering at the end of the documentary if this was more about the director's <UNK> than anything else i was left wondering if he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else the most telling example of this is the final interview he was with the religious school principal he's not even <UNK> about it the way he <UNK> the teacher is unfair and while i agree with the director partially that teaching kids about hell fire is a bad thing the way that <UNK> confronted the principal was just awkward to watch <UNK> had a chance to perhaps get a good discussion going if he was more <UNK> with his interview instead he comes off aggressive with isn't it bad to teach kids this stuff the guy cuts the interview short and i mean what did he expect the principal to say oh yes i see it is i have seen the light this will now be a <UNK> school it seems that <UNK> is getting revenge for what he feels was a wrong done to him in childhood this isn't about the documentary this is about <UNK> <UNK> and has nothing to do with the supposed topic of the documentary <UNK> shows what he's really doing here and that is the real downfall of this so called documentary
<START> this <UNK> sexy movie is a must see only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the <UNK> of this film personally i enjoy the narrator for his intelligent no subject left <UNK> style of narration the introduction grips you right away and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film he provides wonderful insight into the world of the <UNK> and allows the audience to really <UNK> with internal horror this film <UNK> the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully not only for kids but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the <UNK> and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography it surely <UNK> the word <UNK>
<START> film noir is an <UNK> expression when it comes to describing films every crime drama seems to be a noir but where the sidewalk ends really is a good example of what the genre is all about br br very briefly an <UNK> detective andrews accidentally kills a no <UNK> who works for the <UNK> the killing is blamed on the father tom <UNK> of a woman andrews meets and falls for tierney to save dad from old <UNK> andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself in br br the morally guilty cop is driven by <UNK> from the past his father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail but that doesn't excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the no <UNK> in self defense he immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he <UNK> he's already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career then at just the wrong moment the phone rings it's <UNK> partner and andrews tells him the suspect they're <UNK> isn't at home he hides the body and later <UNK> of it by <UNK> a <UNK> and <UNK> the body in the river br br what <UNK> a guy to do something so dumb okay his job was at risk but now he's committed multiple <UNK> at least i think they must be multiple i counted <UNK> of justice assault <UNK> of a body without a <UNK> <UNK> first degree <UNK> and bearing false witness against his neighbor br br in the end we don't know whether to root for andrews or not the suspect didn't deserve to die true but it was after all an accident because andrews didn't know he was a war hero and had a silver plate in his head maybe it's that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was among other things such as characteristic lighting if noir involved nothing more than black and white photography murder criminals mystery and suspicious women then we'd have to include all the charlie chan movies under that <UNK> br br andrews is pretty good he's a kind of mark <UNK> from laura gone bitter he never laughs and rarely smiles even when <UNK> across a restaurant table from gene tierney a situation likely to <UNK> smiles in many men he has no sense of humor at all his few <UNK> are put downs when he <UNK> a <UNK> into a cab and the <UNK> says careful i almost hit my head <UNK> <UNK> is that's okay the <UNK> <UNK> andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and <UNK> determination and he handles it well his <UNK> is perfect for the part little <UNK> or <UNK> project his thoughts and emotional states and i guess the director otto preminger stopped him from <UNK> bullet as boo let and police as poe <UNK> never could make up my mind about gene tierney she does alright in the role of tom <UNK> daughter a model but she's like marilyn monroe in that you can't separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits did tierney actually have such an innocent almost <UNK> persona when she answered the phone at home did her voice have the same sing along quality that it has on screen poor tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff before there were any effective <UNK> for <UNK> disorder and andrews too nice guy though he appears to have been slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service <UNK> br br the dvd commentary by peter <UNK> is <UNK> informed and sometimes amusing br br anyway this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir the good guys aren't all good although the bad guys are all bad maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie for the <UNK> only one shot is fired on screen and <UNK> head explodes sorry
<START> i'll admit i think uma thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in unfortunately that includes the horrible films batman and robin the <UNK> and this one br br this has to rank as the worst movie i've ever seen yes it ranks even lower than the <UNK> everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief br br even if you think uma is a <UNK> like i do please please don't subject yourself to this movie you'll hate yourself the following morning for it
<START> when paris is burning came out i totally <UNK> it i was not into the whole madonna and <UNK> phenomenon i thought it was going to be campy and silly how wrong i was about this movie i watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it it took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally the 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture what a terrific job i went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them if any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know br br i hope they make another documentary i loved it
<START> after watching this film i was left with a two very <UNK> about this film why did they make <UNK> character this <UNK> hit man and lee's character such an incompetent idiot <UNK> character's background is that he was raised in an underground <UNK> <UNK> for blood <UNK> fighter where they learn to <UNK> it out to the death like wild dogs this detail is pushed early on during a scene where he gets into a cab and as it starts to drive he shows how he is unfamiliar with a seat belt soon after this scene he has a similar situation at a dim sum restaurant not only is he <UNK> he is starving this is not a reference to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but to the two early scenes in the film where he is <UNK> down food one of which being rice <UNK> off the floor of the lower deck on an old ship <UNK> in the first ten minutes of the film it is established that <UNK> is <UNK> ed <UNK> and has only thing going for him his dog <UNK> fighting style of some sort despite this situation <UNK> manages to out shoot every policeman even managing to <UNK> a bullet off a metal <UNK> to hit a guy in a head whom was holding <UNK> girlfriend hostage and has somehow <UNK> a super human strength <UNK> a 50 <UNK> block of <UNK> <UNK> on the end of a metal <UNK> to the head of the police chief as he is getting shot in the chest by said chief br br now lee's character okay i get it he's depressed he's got some <UNK> but wow can he do anything right one moment they try to make him cool composed and ready to take care of business and the next moment he just got beat again first scene he runs into <UNK> and he manages to misses him from <UNK> 15 <UNK> multiple times toward the end of that scene lee watches <UNK> as his close friend and <UNK> gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full 5 seconds while holding a gun to <UNK> face at a 10 <UNK> distance even at the end of the movie lee manages to get stabbed to death and fails once again br br and my biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with <UNK> character and that he is just killing to survive that would be a lot easier if i didn't just watch <UNK> kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie of the numerous people he killed only two people had the intention of trying to kill him the police chief and lee others were just people who were eating boat owners taxi drivers and policemen trying to arrest him not kill overall <UNK> character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants even if its just a free ride did i mention he is carrying a <UNK> of hundred dollar bills throughout most of the film my 3 stars go to some of the interesting director camera work who got in some nice shots br br <UNK> one made for the nut <UNK> <UNK> fans for me dog bite this dvd
<START> there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less <UNK> than the us version the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got the us version of this show is everything that reality tv shouldn't be instead of making a few <UNK> to a house which the <UNK> could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets <UNK> i do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy <UNK> system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive the rather vulgar product placement that takes place particularly by <UNK> is also <UNK> for <UNK> than turning one family in a <UNK> area into potential <UNK> it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perhaps a place where <UNK> and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building <UNK> so that everyone can benefit should they want to giving it all to one person can cause enormous <UNK> among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses
<START> i didn't know what to expect from <UNK> <UNK> but absolutely loved it it was dark dramatic and gripping it also felt very authentic i felt that i had been transported back to the <UNK> i've never been much of a heath ledger fan having only seen him in teen type movies however he is quite compelling in this role ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity showing us how an highly spirited boy became <UNK> most notorious killer <UNK> <UNK> is great in a supporting role as kelly's society lover highly recommended and that's from an aussie
<START> this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie cheap looking and worst of all boring action scenes the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence only <UNK> minutes but it feels like it goes on forever even die hard van damme fans like myself should avoid this one
<START> this is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right the plot <UNK> might disappoint the fans of the book but really how many modern readers have read bleak house without seeing a film version first i know of only a few br br i think it is quite appalling to see reviews critical of the series which have clearly been written by people who haven't a clue about the story did you actually see the series or did you just bag a bbc production because gillian anderson was in the newer version br br the series captures the mood pace characters and plot drivers cutting out the <UNK> <UNK> which aren't needed and detract from a film treatment like the <UNK> story the <UNK> family dynamic and the extra lawyers <UNK> <UNK> etc are very <UNK> the only <UNK> that i wish had been kept was the <UNK> incident but as the first episode is already a <UNK> slow after the first episode the pace is perfect i can see it had to go br br the only other criticism i have is that <UNK> death could have been more <UNK> done i can see that would have practically <UNK> <UNK> and he's kept a little more human for not having that scene but really i think <UNK> death is one of the most poignant points of the book and i missed it even though it always makes me cry br br has <UNK> actually seen the series how did he think that esther was raised by her aunt and uncle who is this uncle i suppose someone who could mistake the name of <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> isn't really an <UNK> of english art film or literature br br i also think he mistakes the treatment of the law yes the law is drawn very badly in bleak house it fails the <UNK> of <UNK> whose valuable inheritance is eaten up by the costs of <UNK> it fails the deceased tom <UNK> and rick <UNK> and all who have faith in the suit it fails miss <UNK> in some sense it also fails captain <UNK> who is driven to his death by the <UNK> of law <UNK> work yes it <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> but it also makes men like <UNK> and <UNK> able to move beyond their station in life though not kind to social status <UNK> dickens clearly would have preferred that they weren't bound to being stuck in the station to which they were born contrast jo and the <UNK> families to the climbing out of poverty by <UNK> <UNK> br br also the law while <UNK> by <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> is actually the source of security for the <UNK> of the court <UNK> and richard and for esther who is simply <UNK> ward their security was <UNK> by the law which delivers them to <UNK> br br i can't see how anyone could have trouble following the story remember you aren't supposed to realize esther is lady <UNK> daughter right at the beginning neither are you supposed to get all the connections immediately instant <UNK> just doesn't happen in dickens br br as for seeing clearly through the fog gosh the gillian anderson had such <UNK> editing that i found it impossible to follow and i knew the plot already br br i found diana <UNK> absolutely brilliant overacting and drama don't make a good lady <UNK> but if you think they do try the gillian anderson version br br it's <UNK> and rick not kate and you get all you need of the <UNK> subplot
<START> im still in doubt if this is just a horrible movie or the worse movie i ever saw actors are painful and its impossible to get into the text br br don't <UNK> your time into this movie by <UNK> this comment you are <UNK> to the terms laid out in our <UNK> statement your <UNK> must be your own original work your comments will normally be posted on the site within 2 3 business days comments that do not meet the <UNK> will not be posted please write in english only <UNK> or boards mark up is not supported though paragraph breaks will be inserted if you leave a blank line between paragraph by <UNK> this comment you are <UNK> to the terms laid out in our <UNK> statement your <UNK> must be your own original work your comments will normally be posted on the site within 2 3 business days comments that do not meet the <UNK> will not be posted please write in english only <UNK> or boards mark up is not supported though paragraph breaks will be inserted if you leave a blank line between paragraph
<START> first off i'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit over the top a toned down maybe less <UNK> scarecrow would've made this movie much less cheesy but overall i think it's one of the better b movies <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely wonderful not to mention incredibly beautiful though this movie is missing the all important nude factor there are several other movies at which to view her but here she gets all evil <UNK> especially towards the end as she's walking away from the <UNK> scarecrow also richard <UNK> does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend yes it's a low budget b movie but out of all of them i've seen this is definitely one of my very top favorites
<START> this video is so hilariously funny it makes everything else br br by eddie murphy seem very disappointing even beverly hills cop and the nutty professor which just goes to show you how good this really is to be honest i don't think that i've ever br br laughed at something as much as this including naked gun and the rarely seen <UNK> this show is amazing although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with f that is four letters long plus its extended version beginning with m but it didn't bother me see it the funniest thing i've ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too
<START> edward <UNK> <UNK> stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor instead it's a poorly acted witless look into low budget and uninspired film making the plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish john miles who had a rather thin resume in the industry <UNK> and <UNK> throughout and everyone else acts with the same <UNK> as characters in a government made <UNK> about driver safety the movie <UNK> shows like <UNK> it to <UNK> and <UNK> knows <UNK> in its <UNK> wholesome view of new york in 1950 why the viewer doesn't even get to see anyone light up a <UNK> until some <UNK> woman is interviewed in a <UNK> halfway through the movie the only thing the movie has going for it besides its <UNK> is the excellent location shots <UNK> by william <UNK> the low budget of the film works in the <UNK> favor as the viewer is treated to well framed shots of new york city's interiors and <UNK> <UNK> unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles i suggest watching practically any other movie
<START> brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of leopold bloom stephen <UNK> and molly bloom by joseph <UNK> in <UNK> the endearing portrait of <UNK> on june 16 <UNK> <UNK> a day to be celebrated double <UNK> intended bravo director <UNK> screenwriter haines as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece <UNK> <UNK> novel the tin drum filmed by <UNK> <UNK> 1979 is another fine film adaptation of interior monologue which i <UNK> compare with <UNK> film br br while there are clearly recognized <UNK> <UNK> in the original novel and in the film there are also recognizable characters although with different names in the novel for example buck <UNK> with whom <UNK> lives turns out to be a then prominent <UNK> surgeon br br this film for all of its excellence is made even <UNK> by additional viewings br br brian <UNK> <UNK> com 15 june 2008
<START> every movie from the thirties is dated but if you were to watch only john ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others i e grand hotel is <UNK> modern melodrama with ford there's always the hard sell of someone's <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> always the over emphasis of some <UNK> badness always the poorly crafted awkward and obvious scripts this is no exception it's just a rather <UNK> device to deliver sentiment and sentiment is all this has going for it br br what ford does here doesn't make me <UNK> of lincoln it just makes me wonder how the states were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here ford went on to make decent movies this is too dated to be anything but bad it feels entirely false br br henry fonda with a fake nose is bizarre and no one from <UNK> would <UNK> the <UNK> 's ' or say <UNK>
<START> secret of the lens is perhaps a pretty campy all time favorite of mine the best and funniest from <UNK> <UNK> who is known for splatter anime and sleazy <UNK> <UNK> anime i wish he did more <UNK> like this br br my favorite scenes are the psychedelic cg sequence the parts where lord <UNK> blows up his failing henchmen the party <UNK> that bill causes one of the funniest scenes and whenever my favorite character <UNK> appears br br check this out br br warning this is not for serious sophisticated anime fans
<START> i am uncertain what to make of this <UNK> 2007 <UNK> attempting to be a new millennium cross hybrid between on golden pond and the prince of <UNK> this film ends up being an <UNK> mess shifting so <UNK> between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off the main problem seems to be the <UNK> difference between <UNK> <UNK> sentimental direction and mark <UNK> dark rather confusing screenplay the story focuses on the <UNK> relationship between mother <UNK> and daughter rachel who have driven all the way from san francisco to small town <UNK> <UNK> where grandmother georgia lives the idea is for <UNK> to leave rachel for the summer under <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with her <UNK> rules since the young 17 year old has become an <UNK> <UNK> br br the set up is clear enough but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived <UNK> of the storyline it <UNK> <UNK> through issues of alcoholism child <UNK> and dysfunctional families until it <UNK> into its pat resolution the three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic <UNK> but to varying degrees probably due to her off screen reputation and her <UNK> <UNK> voice lindsay <UNK> makes <UNK> <UNK> and manipulative tactics <UNK> although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her <UNK> behavior <UNK> <UNK> is forced to play <UNK> on two <UNK> notes as a <UNK> <UNK> daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own <UNK> in her daughter's state of mind she does what she can with the role on both <UNK> but her efforts never add up to a flesh and blood human being br br at close to <UNK> jane fonda looks great even as weather beaten as she is here and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon like <UNK> of the <UNK> georgia the problem i have with <UNK> casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one liners and <UNK> stares between this and <UNK> <UNK> monster in law it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her it should come as no surprise that the <UNK> male counterparts are completely overshadowed <UNK> <UNK> looks a little too <UNK> dude as the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> mormon whose sudden love for rachel could <UNK> his two year <UNK> <UNK> cary <UNK> plays on a familiar suspicious note as <UNK> husband an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to <UNK> the movie's ending br br there is also the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> triple play role of the wounded widower <UNK> former flame and <UNK> new boss as town <UNK> dr simon ward laurie <UNK> has a barely there role as simon's sister paula while marshall regular hector <UNK> and <UNK> paul williams show up in cameos some of <UNK> dialogue is plain awful and the <UNK> <UNK> tone never <UNK> on anything that feels right there are several small extras with the 2007 dvd none all too exciting marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark <UNK> humor there are several deleted scenes including three variations on the ending and a gag reel a seven minute making of <UNK> is included as well as the original theatrical trailer a six minute short <UNK> the three actresses and a five minute tribute to marshall
<START> i agree with the previous comment in <UNK> the film's content everyday madness but would like to <UNK> that dog days is about how women are treated in a male society the episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday <UNK> of women mostly <UNK> by age group there is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had treating her like a doll that shall act worthy of wearing the <UNK> dress there is a middle aged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a violent master further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend wife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his <UNK> s a young adult man makes clear to his friend a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of <UNK> finally there is a man in his late fifties who <UNK> his own advantage delivers a simple minded <UNK> woman to a furious client who taking her for guilty in having <UNK> his car natural beats her up to complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the master slave couple after <UNK> <UNK> her threatening and <UNK> the former in her sake for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new master during all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summer sun absolutely <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately i have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the <UNK> <UNK> that still reign in the relationship between women and men but what i have seen convincingly <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive <UNK> what goes wrong due to good <UNK>
<START> oh those italians assuming that movies about <UNK> with weird <UNK> <UNK> drowned in gothic atmosphere and back stabbing relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance are <UNK> interesting to all if you've seen one film of this type you've basically seen them all the mst3k favorite screaming skull fits the mold too and the night evelyn came out of the grave is formulaic by the numbers and dull as hell even the <UNK> erika <UNK> is put to waste here br br zero 10 br br
<START> this stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre a masked killer stalks young <UNK> girls and <UNK> them in a variety of gruesome ways none of which are particularly inventive br br it's not scary it's not clever and it's not funny so what was the point of it
<START> when <UNK> documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following the united states of america with its population of <UNK> million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to <UNK> human rights that it has its <UNK> and downside it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra <UNK> groups exist in <UNK> numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated on a per <UNK> basis europe britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per <UNK> basis the actual size of neo nazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america it is for the above reasons that it is <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very <UNK> and <UNK> presenting this ultra right wing bunch of <UNK> as being representative of american society by doing so <UNK> deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to <UNK> an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate <UNK> lie this film is clearly designed to <UNK> and <UNK> to the views of people who harbor this <UNK> and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and cliché <UNK> left wing ideology this film was made for profit not for <UNK> the truth about american society and the human condition <UNK> can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing <UNK> the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative <UNK> to the <UNK> of a vibrant democracy movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash <UNK> at its worst anti usa garbage shameful
<START> i read that this did not well that the story is not solid that <UNK> feels he has failed in some way br br i disagree first it is well executed <UNK> is doing well to not only to try a new technique but to have a focus that is worth thinking about would <UNK> <UNK> the value of life big question br br i can see he trying hard to build a feeling and he is not <UNK> this is to be <UNK> i am sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form i have seen artists <UNK> a form to bare minimum to build the intensity of a moment i identify this film with this br br further it is much more interesting than richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> story has more meaning than <UNK> later stories of a wasted life on drugs old news everyone knows it but no one does anything about it renaissance has more to offer something new to think about and there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in them that do far better br br well done <UNK> really nice work
<START> louis <UNK> a doctor from chicago moves to a large house near a small town since he is going to be giving classes in the university of <UNK> along with him is his wife rachel and their two kids <UNK> and gage as well as <UNK> cat church soon they met their new neighbor and old man named judd <UNK> judd not only warns louis and rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house that is constantly a way used by big <UNK> but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery but rachel is against to talk about death and <UNK> with her children since she has <UNK> from her sister <UNK> death br br during the first week of the family in the new house louis already has dead people to deal with victor <UNK> a student who has been <UNK> injured in an <UNK> accident <UNK> his dying words to louis personally even though the two men are strangers on the night following <UNK> death louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets <UNK> who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns louis to not go beyond no matter how much you feel you need to louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream until he discovers his feet and the <UNK> covered with dirt and <UNK> <UNK> anyway he <UNK> the dream many strange things starts to happen and church <UNK> cat dies while walking on the highway louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about <UNK> death with <UNK> but judd <UNK> with him <UNK> takes louis to the pet cemetery supposedly to bury church but instead of stopping there <UNK> leads louis <UNK> on a frightening journey to the real cemetery an ancient burial ground that was once used by the <UNK> ' indians ' there louis <UNK> the cat on <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> saying that animals buried there have come back to life and that is where the real horror story begins br br i personally find this movie very good it's not the most horrifying of all but it is one of the best horror movies i watched the way gage dies is almost impossible to not stay in your memory specially being a <UNK> it's cool to see stephen king's cameo as the minister of the funeral br br of course there are some script errors how can a rich doctor with two small kids goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house how gage has no <UNK> or anything after being hit by a truck why louis continues to <UNK> every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters things like that doesn't make any sense but i can understand that all <UNK> scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work br br a good thing i saw in this movie is the necessity to talk about death with the children no matter what is your religion or if you are an <UNK> and also that avoiding important subjects doesn't help anything because of louis being afraid to be honest with <UNK> confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn't be back again all the nightmare began
<START> i've finally seen the <UNK> after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well it surely wasn't worth waiting all this time to see it the <UNK> is strictly by the number horror film unseen killer monster is <UNK> and murdering women in a small town br br the film goes like this movie opens with killing then blah blah blah more blah blah blah then another killing even more blah blah blah continuing with blah blah blah yet another killing surprising huh blah blah blah etc br br the film is totally predictable from beginning to end even the stupid big red <UNK> used throughout the movie wouldn't convince a 5 year old and i figured out the secret identity of the <UNK> the moment i saw the character so when the shocking surprise ending arrived i wasn't shocked or surprised in fact it was so funny that i kept on <UNK> days after i saw the movie it's so silly br br anyway the film is so by the number that the rock band sequence is one of the few stand out moments in this dreary flick it's a stand out scene not necessarily because it's good but because it's so funny and pointless the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> the best thing i could say about this film is the cinematography which i actually liked but aside from that there's almost nothing worth mentioning about the <UNK> except that it's unintentionally hilarious
<START> <UNK> sees chan returning to his role of dragon from the young master not much has carried over from the first film though tiger his older brother is nowhere to be seen neither is the marshall his daughter or his son played superbly by <UNK> <UNK> in the original film dragon does have the same master though presumably all the other students have moved on to other things <UNK> <UNK> at training is portrayed heavily in this film so maybe he's still studying br br originally titled young master in love this film sees dragon for the first sixty minutes at least pursuing a <UNK> girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways his rival for her affection is his friend <UNK> named cowboy played <UNK> by the longtime chan stunt team member mars we see various scenes where their silly schemes <UNK> it is one of these scenes that we thankfully find dragon in over his head br br this film is notorious in that it failed expectations at the box office that said i'm sure the expectations were pretty high and i feel that this film has never had a fair judgment based on it's own merits but even when i try to do this i still feel that there is a problem with the film it seems quite <UNK> sometimes rushed and i think the action is too <UNK> and not as brilliant as chan's other work from this period br br the thing that really saves the film is the ending sequence as in the young master there is a fantastic final reel that it full of incredibly <UNK> action you really feel every blow and again chan goes up against the same rival from the young master is it the same character and the timing and energy here is brilliant chan's style of using every last bit of his environment to help defeat his <UNK> not just relying on pure physical ability is as apparent here as anywhere else the <UNK> they fight in is full of clever little prop gags and <UNK> this is an absolute highlight of the film and one of chan's incredible career br br it's not necessary to see the prequel before seeing <UNK> in fact it might even raise more questions than what it hopes to answer but it must be said that the original film is the superior film and <UNK> with it's focus on girl chasing and team sports does seem <UNK> luckily the few fight scenes it offers plus a fantastic <UNK> <UNK> scene push it over the line as a must see film in this genre
<START> the <UNK> is an entertaining western no doubt a classic which is actual even today gary cooper is wild bill <UNK> ideal for the role together with john wayne and james stewart they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation jean arthur is great as <UNK> jane nobody that i know played it better than her even if might not be historically accurate the film manages to capture the most important about <UNK> and about the time it takes place sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here the friendship of <UNK> with buffalo bill the selling of <UNK> to the indians by a great <UNK> to compensate for the <UNK> he would have because of the end of the civil war <UNK> and little big horn the uneasy relationship between buffalo <UNK> wife a religious woman with <UNK> a man who had killed plenty also the unusual love affair between <UNK> and <UNK> all this makes 'the <UNK> a non conventional and interesting film anthony quinn has a very short appearance that already shows what a great actor he was going to become a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time
<START> after their sons are sentenced to life in prison <UNK> debbie reynolds and helen shirley winters begin receiving threatening phone calls because someone <UNK> their sons got off easy the pair decides to move to california to escape the publicity of the trial and to start a new life they start a dance school that is soon very successful one of the students has a rich <UNK> father with whom <UNK> quickly falls in love in the meantime helen is busy raising <UNK> and becoming a little too <UNK> with an <UNK> on the radio it's only a <UNK> of time before everything falls apart and the women enter a world of madness and murder br br i can't help but compare what's the matter with helen to whoever slew <UNK> <UNK> also starring <UNK> winters where that movie seemed almost restrained in its presentation of <UNK> <UNK> madness there's nothing holding helen back in this movie it may take a good deal of the movie's running time but once she <UNK> helen is one bad mad <UNK> you don't want to mess with her winters is so delightfully demented that it was impossible for me not to enjoy her performance i'm not going to spoil the movie but the things helen is capable of are totally over the top br br as good as winters is reynolds is totally ridiculous in her role as the gold digging tap dancer i got the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would get her nominated for some award this ain't citizen kane quit acting so serious hey debbie don't you realize that you're main purpose is to be a victim of <UNK> insanity br br i just love these former female stars in the twilight of their career horror movies what's the matter with helen is as fun as any
<START> this early b entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young gene tierney on the ads and posters but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her riding in a <UNK> <UNK> train previously we've set up george sanders and bruce <UNK> in the desert as guys who barely get along but must <UNK> in the face of attack i've seen sanders as so many enjoyable <UNK> that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn however bruce <UNK> <UNK> is pretty much a mystery to me he's base and <UNK> in comparison but i've always felt he'd just emerged smiling from under a car covered in grease and a sixth grade education some people like 'em that way as did <UNK> gypsy queen character this is an action adventure filler tho and just as we've been warned of <UNK> locals with guns ready to <UNK> and attack the brits in their land there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all this feature requires nothing more than your <UNK> attention on a saturday afternoon a <UNK> that made whatever else it was paired with better it was almost more interesting <UNK> the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by dorothy <UNK> in one of her first roles a two or two and a half stars out of five <UNK>
<START> anyone interested in pop music and not familiar with british music <UNK> of the late seventies should be sure to watch breaking glass at least once the movie about a young woman's quest to make her mark in the music world captures the times perfectly from the overt <UNK> rough economic times social <UNK> to the shift in pop culture from rough and <UNK> punk to terribly <UNK> and pretentious <UNK> new <UNK> the music and fashion styles created daily in britain in the late seventies are still being <UNK> and recycled there really has been nothing new since 1980 this was a dazzling time and breaking glass both tells a very personal story and <UNK> the cultural landscape and does both extremely well
<START> but the general <UNK> <UNK> may <UNK> in mary american psycho <UNK> stylized look at the american sexual psyche as seen through the lens of the immortal queen of <UNK> bettie page br br i'll not bore anyone with a <UNK> of the iconic status of ms page a <UNK> and proper <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> who moved to new york in hopes of being an actress and ended up becoming the bondage queen of the universe nor will i run through the <UNK> bio <UNK> plot of the notorious bettie page though i offer high kudos to the technical aspects of the film a sequence of animated magazine covers springs instantly to mind <UNK> use of a period camera notwithstanding finally i won't <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of the film's themes of innocence and <UNK> freedom and control the sacred and the <UNK> they're there for the viewer to <UNK> if they wish the more things change the more they stay the same as the saying goes br br what i will <UNK> on about for a moment is the splendid performance of gretchen mol as bettie page truth is <UNK> face looks almost nothing like <UNK> nor is she particularly built like bettie although only a fool would deny those beautiful breasts and no fool i she doesn't even sport the thick dark bush that <UNK> ms <UNK> most intimate charms but the fact remains that mol thoroughly <UNK> the spirit of bettie page in every way shape and form it is a <UNK> comeback from an <UNK> semi obscurity i've never met ms page and sadly never will most likely but i've <UNK> the photos and videos and read all the <UNK> and interviews available bought the <UNK> cards and other odds and ends and to be honest <UNK> for ms page ever since i first discovered her in my <UNK> between the covers of dusty <UNK> magazines at the <UNK> shop and the five and dime mol perfectly captures the essence of the woman as i have come to <UNK> her no pun intended in what i consider to be an oscar worthy performance <UNK> tyler could never have matched <UNK> shining intensity of characterization in a million years and i for one am grateful she left the project not that i'd mind seeing her totally naked i <UNK> to add but i can't imagine that her brand of <UNK> would have translated into the innocent <UNK> of bettie page br br the notorious bettie page is not for everyone any more than bondage and discipline are i suspect it will do much better on disc than in the theaters <UNK> of devoted page fans and the curious will see to that i can only hope that the dvd will be chock full of enough bettie extras to show the <UNK> just how good a job mol has done br br beyond that a tip of the hat to a fine supporting cast especially <UNK> taylor and chris bauer as paula and irving <UNK> whose celebrity photo business was <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> br br a final note to the young <UNK> who <UNK> that ms page had no effect on his generation take a good look at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and get back to us bettie page is whether you know it or not the true <UNK> of <UNK> without her madonna and the rest of her <UNK> could never have existed
<START> this movie i've loved since i was young its excellent although it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one can't interpret certain subtleties in the film for example our hero's name is <UNK> and in the final battle between him and alexander he's shot in the <UNK> with a rocket just as <UNK> in mythology was shot in his <UNK> that's a just a little fact that is kind of amusing anyway great movie good story it'd be neat to see it <UNK> with today's special effects oddly enough gary graham had average success starring in the t v show alien nation this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated
<START> when my now college age daughter was in <UNK> this miniseries appeared on a e from 8 9 each morning my neighbor and i made a <UNK> that we wouldn't miss a minute of jane eyre and our kids were late for <UNK> every morning for the whole week good choice br br i'd forgotten how much i loved this movie until i got out my old vhs copy recently timothy dalton is very handsome but still perfect as rochester the dark <UNK> face the <UNK> demeanor <UNK> with humor and <UNK> were straight from the pages of the book although dalton eats a little scenery i couldn't sit through an adaptation starring <UNK> william hurt or grumpy <UNK> <UNK> the magic here is that women love dalton and get caught up in the romance br br i would love to know what's become of zelah clarke she is dead on as jane quiet <UNK> saying volumes with but a look the <UNK> in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped jane survive the <UNK> she endured in youth criticism of her performance as wooden is misplaced a servant in a proper english household would have <UNK> just such a demeanor but she speaks <UNK> when overcome with emotion unlike many other screen <UNK> she appears plain enough to be jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy <UNK> attraction to her br br <UNK> dialog is a large part of why the book <UNK> the script keeps much of it intact dalton and clarke capture the interplay between jane and rochester with wit and quiet intensity although jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla <UNK> she refuses to be <UNK> by the dark <UNK> rochester the two leads play off each other beautifully br br this is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever
<START> unless you are <UNK> of russian people or <UNK> this movie is a <UNK> actually i fell asleep about 40 minutes in had to fight the urge to just leave the theater i wish i had a waste of a perfectly lovely saturday evening br br even silent hill was scarier heck even <UNK> <UNK> was scarier i'm still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick br br to begin with i'm very <UNK> of movies that use <UNK> russian like this one did in the opening credits it's embarrassing to me since i brought a group of my russian friends we all <UNK> oh my god br br hmm well luckily for me probably you too this movie has already escaped my brain i just stepped out of it an hour ago so i have no <UNK> just murky visuals that go nowhere some <UNK> now dead hope that anything would happen br br perhaps i saw a completely <UNK> version of this film because i can't believe it got such great reviews here which is why i saw it ended up being so completely devoid of not only horror or suspense but overall entertainment value as well br br i give it a 2 because yes i fell asleep wanted to leave after 40 minutes but i woke up didn't leave
<START> what a preposterous story murder blackmail child sex <UNK> gays and the catholic church absolute tripe how is it that most uk based tv dramas sit <UNK> etc have to include the <UNK> gay its really getting tiresome now everybody accepts that there are gay people in society just has there are other minority groups but we don't want it <UNK> down our throats i'll pass on this one in every single show apart from the above the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story into a <UNK> the priest was a <UNK> and there are gays running about every where oh yes just to be totally pc one of the gay couple was black i am surprised at c <UNK> for even <UNK> this when he read the script
<START> get this film if at all possible you will find a really good performance by barbara bach beautiful cinematography of a <UNK> and incredibly clean but creepy old house and an unexpected <UNK> performance by  the unseen i picked up a used copy of this film because i was interested in seeing more of bach whom i'd just viewed in the spy who loved me i love really <UNK> beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little so we start with a nice fresh premise tv reporter bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a california town <UNK> that <UNK> its swedish <UNK> by putting on a big folk festival she brings along a <UNK> who happens to be her sister and another associate the late karen <UNK> plays <UNK> sister and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to it is just too funny watching bach mrs <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mrs dennis wilson going down the street having a <UNK> <UNK> anyway  <UNK> disgruntled beau follows her to <UNK> as he's not done arguing with her there's a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn't wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down the drain football career the ladies arrive in <UNK> to do the assignment for their station only to find their <UNK> were given away to someone else maybe to <UNK> boyfriend because think of it  where's he gonna stay the <UNK> ask around but there is just nowhere to go <UNK> trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum they catch the interest of <UNK> mr <UNK> the late sidney <UNK> who decides to be a gentleman and <UNK> them at his home <UNK> his wife will be happy to receive them oh no next thing we know <UNK> is making a <UNK> phone call to his wife warning her that <UNK> coming and threatening that she'd better play along trouble in paradise the ladies are eager to settle in and get back to <UNK> to shoot footage and interview <UNK> but one of the girls doesn't feel good bach and <UNK> leave her behind wondering to themselves about mrs <UNK> played <UNK> by pretty <UNK> <UNK> who looks like she just lost her best pal speaking of which  under the weather <UNK> slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot <UNK> not realizing that <UNK> has <UNK> into her room to <UNK> the <UNK> she hears him thinks he's come to deliver <UNK> and calls out her thanks <UNK> did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old <UNK> tom who didn't get a long enough look after he's left poor <UNK> <UNK> into bed for a <UNK> but gets <UNK> out of it real fast in a really decent frightening round of action by something big that has apparently <UNK> up through a <UNK> on the floor  the unseen <UNK> comes home next bach is out finishing an argument with her beau and can't find anyone in the house she knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen and on hands and knees to collect it her hair and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over the black floor <UNK>  <UNK> the unseen again well at about the time poor <UNK> is getting her <UNK> in the kitchen we do a flashback into mr <UNK> past and get the full story of what his sick sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn't smile much bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are meanwhile <UNK> has been <UNK> of the <UNK> carnage by his <UNK> wife and decides he can't let bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home he <UNK> her down into the basement where the last act of the <UNK> family tragedy finally opens to all of us br br i cannot say enough for stephen <UNK> whom i'd never seen before it's obvious that he did his <UNK> for this role studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged bach and <UNK> each in their diverse way just give the movie <UNK> not only that but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution no stupid cheap tricks <UNK> rolling dialog or <UNK> cut <UNK> a real treat for your collection
<START> i found this show really late at night and gave it a try it's a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night if you catch my drift its simplicity of values and <UNK> of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children it's something i <UNK> in whenever i find it on which is rare maybe i should actually check the <UNK> haha and the tension between joe and nick is so cute like any good chick flick you really get emotionally involved in the characters good ol' <UNK> may <UNK> still inspiring good stories so apparently i must complete 10 lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid so i guess i'll tell you a bit more the kids are played by talented actors and actresses and the settings are lovely and nature filled another thing you don't see much on television i hope everyone gives it a shot i recognize and am fully aware that it's sappy but it's good heart like i said before it's refreshing
<START> this typical mamet film delivers a quiet <UNK> paced insight into what makes a confidence man joe <UNK> good explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist lindsay <UNK> it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences the cast includes a number of the players found is several of <UNK> films steven <UNK> jack wallace ricky jay andy <UNK> allen <UNK> william h macy and they do their usual good job i loved lindsay <UNK> in this film and have often wondered why she didn't become a more noted player than she has become perhaps i'm not looking in the right places br br the movie proceeds at a slow pace with flat dialog yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which <UNK> leads to the bang up ending you'd expect a real let down at the ending but i found it uplifting and satisfying i love this movie
<START> my all time favorite movie i have seen many movies but this one beats them all <UNK> acting wonderful story you will as a normal caring person start to love george <UNK> he is an actor he is also himself and a very lovable person and <UNK> most important thing you will learn to respect look different to people with down syndrome
<START> i usually come on this website prior to going to the movies as i like to see what other people think of the movie i read many reviews which said <UNK> not a horror <UNK> this <UNK> me to give this film a try i really must take issue with these <UNK> <UNK> statements as it was neither i almost went and asked for my money back and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbish well you must be easily pleased at the end of the movie the people behind me said out loud what a waste of time and i turned to them and <UNK> i couldn't have summed it up better i kept waiting for something to happen but it didn't there was the potential for a lot of good scares or thrills if you like but none happened williams acted the part quite well but i felt he was short changed by a poor script which <UNK> around and went nowhere save your money folks this is a turkey which will be featuring at a dvd store <UNK> <UNK> near you in the very <UNK> future
<START> even though many people here <UNK> this movie i have to warn you it has no logic whatsoever i think that basinger does a decent job at acting but you can't make a thriller if there is a great lack of realism br br this scene paints a good picture for you of the movie while basinger is pursued by murderous thugs she decides to sit down and <UNK> upon a picture she finds from her pocket the picture is from her daughter and it reads we love you <UNK> who does something like that what the <UNK> and believe me when i say that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie someone stated that this is a hidden gem well i have to strongly disagree this movie has stayed hidden for a reason and it's not a gem oh and please i don't even want to start commenting about the red <UNK> it hurts my brain d usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small amounts but this movie basically is made possible only because of the lack of logic but i still give it a 4 because even though it is embarrassingly flawed in logic it has certain mood that kept me watching till the end br br so if you choose to watch this you know you have been warned
<START> not the best of actors' movies the director has concentrated on projected actor's stardom rather than giving a good entertainer may be hero himself his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it but definitely it's not worth for neutral audience the fight sequences are a total comedy the dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic the music is average this film was the biggest flop for the actor <UNK> of the hype created over the movie the movie failed miserably don't even think of watching this move even if you want to kill time you can watch some cartoon instead a good movie buff cannot <UNK> this crap for 2 1 2 hours
<START> walking home after the film i was <UNK> the familiar <UNK> music that <UNK> and alexandre were dancing to i've heard that before where ah from kubrick's eyes wide shut track 2 <UNK> it just as i arrived at the door it's <UNK> no 2 from jazz <UNK> no 2 composed by <UNK> <UNK> performed here by the city of <UNK> <UNK> orchestra yes i went and picked up the soundtrack from <UNK> what a treat the film score by alexandre <UNK> was fulfilling there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful <UNK> it's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a <UNK> film score reminds me of favorite scores by maurice <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> beginning notes of track 6 have <UNK> of <UNK> cinema <UNK> georges <UNK> and john barry there are subtle nuances of <UNK> and notes from the strings <UNK> piano and <UNK> br br emily watson and john <UNK> delivered a <UNK> <UNK> paired performance the love story their intimate connection is very much between alexandre and <UNK> his <UNK> yet <UNK> inner world and her generous and bold understanding of him a relationship alone to them both director <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> line 1996 academy <UNK> best foreign language film from the <UNK> gave us a quietly sensitive film not without its unsettling human conflicts <UNK> <UNK> family <UNK> <UNK> and respect the front end subject is the mind game and <UNK> logic of chess beneath it can be a mild <UNK> of a drama set in the late <UNK> cinematography captures the <UNK> beauty of lake <UNK> in northern italy near the swiss border br br i highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't feel like going to the movies alexandre <UNK> lyrical film score of the luzhin <UNK> is complete
<START> the ladies man is a funny movie there's not much thought behind it but what do you expect from an snl movie it's actually better than most snl movies i e superstar or a night at the <UNK> tim meadows and will ferrell were both very funny chris <UNK> was also funny in his short scene one of the funnier ones in the movie other than that the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support meadows i've definitely seen funnier movies but i've seen dumber ones too again it's not exactly a deep movie but it's good for a few laughs it was funnier as a skit though but still if you're looking for a pretty funny movie i'd recommend this one just don't think about it too much or you'll hate it br br rating 6 10
<START> greg davis and bryan <UNK> take some crazed statements by a terrorists add some commentary by a bunch of uber right <UNK> <UNK> the most extreme positions of the most <UNK> <UNK> on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a <UNK> and presents this as the <UNK> of islam maybe their next film will involve <UNK> fred <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> church adding commentary by some <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and call their film what the world needs to know about christianity ultimately this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of <UNK> don't waste your time and money just turn on your am radio and listen to rush <UNK> for a couple of days for free and you'll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis
<START> i just saw this film yesterday br br my girlfriend wanted to see it only because of richard gere br br i feel i wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it's the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actor actress is in it i hope she learned the lesson because i had trouble keeping her in her seat as of me since i paid already i wanted to see the end at least just in the hope something good would turn up but i didn't hold my breath and luckily so cause i would have been a victim of the film just the same br br this is not a black and white film it's a black and black one the main character richard gere is almost as bad as his <UNK> and all sex <UNK> are portrayed as <UNK> hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad speak of a cliché and the exploitation of a typical us <UNK> br br richard <UNK> acting was good as usual but the blond girl that's supposed to replace him was <UNK> <UNK> at best totally unconvincing for the job br br the film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap dramatic and sensational turn that just is unreal they just use sex <UNK> as an excuse to <UNK> in cheap violent acts of murders vigilante beating rape and torture something that almost seems gratuitous they even have a wolf attacking people in the film how low can you get br br i gather the film won't come out in the usa and will go straight to dvd that's were it should have stayed in other countries too but because it's hollywood and richard gere they just had to show it believe me without gere the film is not even worth a b series movie
<START> i was totally impressed by shelley <UNK> waitress 2007 this movie only <UNK> what was clear from that movie <UNK> was a <UNK> talented writer director an original and unique artist she managed to show the <UNK> of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and <UNK> tendency ally <UNK> steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge male lead <UNK> <UNK> looking like judd nelson is fine there is also a great cameo by ben <UNK> the song at the end of the movie the bastard song written by <UNK> can stand as her optimistic <UNK> br br it's a world of suffering br br in a sea of pain br br no matter how much sun you bring br br you're <UNK> by the rain br br don't let the heartless get you down br br don't <UNK> the heartless at your door br br don't live among the heartless
<START> robert <UNK> novel is about a <UNK> romantic situation on a <UNK> tea plantation so the events of the <UNK> backgrounds and <UNK> beauty are rewarding points to william <UNK> film br br the story is about a rich powerful <UNK> peter <UNK> who brings a charming and tender beauty elizabeth taylor into the jungle as his bride the plantation of course is <UNK> by some kind of wild life for this reason taylor  elegant as never in dazzling costumes  finds herself in a strange atmosphere the echo determination of a ghost the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his <UNK> father a highly dangerous disease and the fury of wild animals br br in her confusion boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face a pretentious <UNK> dana andrews who <UNK> her beauty but tries to <UNK> her love br br with echoes of jane eyre the mysterious <UNK> mansion with a brooding master and rebecca the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife elephant walk is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge <UNK> <UNK> exotic dances with rage <UNK> colorful <UNK> big bull elephants amazing mansion set on fire all in the company of an exquisite creature with an <UNK> beauty and talent br br the movie gave liz a change of scenery and allowed her more creative energy and self respect than most of her other <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit <UNK>
<START> i saw this recently and i must say i was moved by the factual basis of the story however holly as a movie did not quite work i am however looking forward to watching the documentary which the producers who <UNK> this project had made because i think that would be a much more compelling work than this film br br the international cast was composed of b class actors but their acting was appropriate and i must give a special mention for the young actress who played holly this was her first movie role and she did a very nice job considering hers is the most challenging part br br ron <UNK> was adequate but bland as patrick the american whose quest is to save holly but chris penn was good in this his final role unfortunately despite my mostly <UNK> opinion of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> both of these actors were very much forgettable and did not do their best work in this film br br i believe in the film's message and intention but i have to be fair so i rate holly 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie but i think the subject matter deserves serious consideration and i am pleased that the people behind this movie have made a documentary as well which i hope will have its debut on bbc and other tv networks
<START> this is actually a trilogy of 3 of <UNK> <UNK> short tales the first one is the <UNK> which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable after 17 years albert <UNK> is laid off from his church job because he can't read nor write so what does he do opens a <UNK> shop of course br br the second is mr know all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten until i heard the familiar introduction another 15 minute one and also very good it worked better on film than in a book for me but then perhaps that's because i was only 14 the last time <UNK> br br the 3rd one is nearly a let down almost an hour in length it simply drags it's not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 i watched the first quarter hour of it and then <UNK> forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really i hadn't missed a thing br br overall i give them 8 9 and 6 out of 10 respectively
<START> this film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients but somewhere along the way they didn't quite come together i don't know who made it but it has a slightly disney <UNK> feel while parts of it are improbable like when a pre teen runs for a public office and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously there is a healthy dose of <UNK> whatever that is to keep things balanced and in perspective the acting is alright strangely the relationship between frankie and her grandmother is convincing but the relationship between <UNK> and frankie is a bit off it's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend her grandmother and her two passions ballet and baseball being a baseball player myself it was quite painful to watch frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces i read somewhere that she isn't really <UNK> but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful overall it was a good film about honesty and ambition but its star <UNK> barton didn't quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in lawn dogs lost and delirious and her small but shocking performance opposite <UNK> joel <UNK> in the <UNK> sense
<START> most of the episodes on season 1 are awful there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limits as they programs actually had decent story lines most of amazing stories are well dull not amazing in the least go rent or buy the twilight zone series i have heard season 2 of this series is much better also for some reason on the dvd's they cut out the ray <UNK> parts which further <UNK> this <UNK> the one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering
<START> any story <UNK> a premise characters and conflict characters plotting their own play promises triumph and a <UNK> character readily lends <UNK> to this <UNK> <UNK> premise is <UNK> by the poem of the same name scripted by <UNK> <UNK> the line goes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> par <UNK> <UNK> a rough translation the delicate balance of right wrong <UNK> seen on the <UNK> of blind justice in the <UNK> has <UNK> on one plate and <UNK> on another is the <UNK> on the center a half truth br br the poem is <UNK> <UNK> in the film by <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> at a <UNK> it makes a deep impact on the protagonist lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow at the end of the film <UNK> <UNK> ends up in exactly the same situation described so <UNK> in the poem br br the film tries mighty hard to do a one up on the poem however <UNK> words are too powerful and at best the film matches up to the poem in every aspect br br
<START> i've read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict british school in the 1960's to understand this maybe that's true if so then this movie is outdated br br spoiler alert the ending makes about as much sense as all the kids <UNK> anti government and anti corporation without having any better solution that doesn't torch society to a mad max type <UNK> br br yeah the main characters could leave but they don't the reasons they go about this don't make sense there isn't enough character development to explain why what shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at it is mentioned that war is the final creative expression quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have and it makes no sense br br the characters who go on a murder spree aren't fighting the institution they're just killing people i thought they <UNK> used all the <UNK> to blow up the place or at least the <UNK> at the end that would've made greater symbolic sense but they didn't br br <UNK> dr this movie is an <UNK> <UNK> of fighting against authority that <UNK> them though in reality they need it has no moral symbolic truth or meaning to it this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in power that annoy you br br if you think a murder rampage school shooting similar to <UNK> or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and <UNK> you don't like then i guess you'll love this movie if you're like me and you're working towards making a life for yourself instead of just <UNK> very <UNK> in this movie <UNK> against the man this movie is juvenile and boring br br you can also tell in parts that funding was lacking and the story seemed to have a touch of attention <UNK> disorder br br all in all this seems like a very rough draft of what could've been an okay movie but no effort is put into the dialogue character development or moral so it's just poorly done br br if only i could get my two hours back
<START> like all cult tv shows there is a group of people who love the twilight zone so much that they rate practically every episode like they are the greatest shows ever while several of them are indeed wonderful classics the truth is for every great episode there were several that were mediocre and at least one that <UNK> however like die hard <UNK> these zone lovers insist that all of them are gold in fact this is what initially got me to review some individual episodes of a couple cult series instead of the movies i usually watch br br while this isn't the worst episode ever made nor is it among the very worst it is poor by any reasonable standard a widow watches a long <UNK> of civil war soldiers going past her home in the end a very unexpected twist is revealed and there isn't a whole lot of excitement or suspense here
<START> a kind of road movie in old fashioned trains in the <UNK> late summer <UNK> at the beginning you see someone in underwear <UNK> <UNK> from black cloth and when the same young man in his black <UNK> leaves the house with two <UNK> you see that the <UNK> part is missing on a flag of mourning <UNK> his father has died in the train he meets a young lady and almost without words but many small gestures a wonderful love story begins it's a somehow surreal very poetic and a little bizarre movie with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details
<START> uk newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know toby young the journalist on whose real life experiences this movie is based the key word here is based how to lose friends is a <UNK> <UNK> br br sidney young joins a <UNK> <UNK> magazine in new york where he proceeds to make <UNK> after <UNK> before finally getting it right and making it this involves him selling out and the movie has some serious points to make about <UNK> integrity however they are not overdone the main substance remains a comedy which <UNK> around <UNK> <UNK> the script has its cake and eats it in that sidney is a stupid well meaning <UNK> at the same time as being a smart moderately obnoxious skilled writer this <UNK> is never that much of an issue because simon pegg as sidney projects <UNK> too well br br jeff bridges <UNK> <UNK> editor a little too effectively and kirsten dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of <UNK> affections and with regard to <UNK> fox who plays an <UNK> bimbo <UNK> i can say only this just say the word miss fox and i will leave my wife sell all my <UNK> and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your <UNK> of course given that i'm a fat <UNK> year old english <UNK> you might not find my offer too <UNK> but it's there on the table anyway given how short her career has been so far one might think it is a little too soon for <UNK> fox to take on a role which mercilessly <UNK> the sort of actress she might be thought to become however she does it <UNK> with some skill and extremely <UNK> this girl will go far br br there is <UNK> support from a variety of seasoned performers <UNK> <UNK> and bill <UNK> from the uk gillian anderson and danny huston from the us br br there are several laugh out loud moments and i <UNK> most of the way through as ever the f word makes appearances when it really doesn't need to although at least a couple of these are very funny
<START> the sunshine boys is one of my favorite feel good movies i first saw it when it as the christmas attraction at radio city music hall when it first came out and loved it ever since i ended up seeing it 6 times in the theaters and if it was playing today i'd go out to see it again br br now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads matthau was brilliant but had the misfortune of being nominated against jack <UNK> oscar winning performance of randall p <UNK> in one flew over the <UNK> nest burns did win though richard <UNK> deserved at least to be nominated as well even the smallest roles were played to perfection like fritz <UNK> <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> commercial br br which brings me to my reason for reviewing this film the direction of the greatly underrated herbert ross ross who previously brought a two person play the owl and the <UNK> to the screen and made a full movie out of it does it again he opens the plays out without making them look like a <UNK> stage play he <UNK> out the story and the characters br br here we're 20 minutes into the film before we get to the scene that opens the play where ben clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special though there are dialogue from the play during the first twenty minutes the sequence itself is totally new a few years ago i did see at the broadway revival of the play with jack <UNK> and tony randall which was wonderful but i think that ross and screenwriter playwright simon improved on it it's just a wonderful film
<START> i had a feeling that after <UNK> this one wouldn't be any better i was right he must be looking for <UNK> money and not care about the final product his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him the editing is well just a grade above amateurish it's nothing more than a b or c grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented <UNK> and an ok sound designer br br like the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post production voice dubbing etc too bad cause the <UNK> actually ok for a sg flick br br i'll never rent another sg flick unless he <UNK> me asking for forgiveness br br too bad i miss kelly <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> there are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former this short caper <UNK> nothing more than what it gives to the audience it presents a simple story told very <UNK> with enough <UNK> to keep you going then just gets better and better <UNK> cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including sam <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> can easily make it on their own likeable and funny hilariously so towards the end welcome to <UNK> is a welcome addition to the heist genre
<START> i though this would be an okay movie since i like zombies and horror movies in general but i did not think it would be such a piece of sh t like it was the only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and he gets ran over by a god damn car the movie looks to be written by a porn director and filled by porn actors i wouldn't ever call them actors the costumes seems to be stolen from a local school play its seems like a road movie with almost no monsters there is no fun at all in this piece of sh t only horror but not in the way the director intended i would rather be raped by a <UNK> than see this movie ever again ugh
<START> instead go to the <UNK> buy some <UNK> and feed 'em to the monkeys monkeys are funny people with <UNK> who don't say much just sit there with <UNK> eyes are not all that funny br br black comedy there isn't a black person in it and there isn't one funny thing in it either br br <UNK> buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack it's labeled <UNK> i think they took out the topless scene they may have taken out other stuff too who knows all we know is that whatever they took out isn't there any more br br the acting seemed ok to me there's a lot of <UNK> tho it's supposed to be a city it's supposed to be a big lake if it's so hot in the church people are fanning themselves why are they all wearing <UNK>
<START> i believe they were telling the truth the whole time u cant trust anything in the wild they family went through hell those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them but still having to deal with the <UNK> as well as dealing with the lose of their little sister i cant believe this case went on for so long seems like the jury couldn't see the truth even if it bit them on the ass i feel for this family and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them i would i have no idea what they went through i cant even imagine it after watching this movie i was in tears and had to check on my little girl in bed i think everyone should watch this
<START> 8 simple rules is a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially one mature lesson about moving on after a lose which was the episode where paul died which was the first episode i have ever watched of the show that comes on abc the <UNK> clan mother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> daughters bridget <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> amy <UNK> and son <UNK> martin <UNK> look to one another for <UNK> and support after the death of paul john ritter the family <UNK> <UNK> parents james garner and suzanne <UNK> lend a hand i am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put david spade in this show since he was done with the nbc series just shoot me but all and all this show is pretty good this show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80's and 90's that used to be on abc
<START> i felt drawn into the world of the manipulation of mind and will at the heart of the story the acting by nolte lee arkin and the supporting cast was superb the strange twists in the <UNK> story are made stranger by odd details
<START> that certain thing is the story of a gold <UNK> <UNK> dana from a <UNK> house her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers but they are a loving family although <UNK> character has the opportunity to marry a <UNK> conductor she refuses and holds out for a millionaire everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire son of the owner of the popular abc restaurant chain the two marry <UNK> but the girl's dreams of wealth are <UNK> when the rich father <UNK> his son for marrying a gold <UNK> however she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own br br a rare glimpse of movie star <UNK> dana this film is a lot of fun <UNK> role is accessible natural and entertaining she displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama br br the <UNK> of the film are a lot of fun too the camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like <UNK> the title cards are also incredibly clever br br if you like films like my best girl it or the <UNK> you will enjoy this film
<START> what a wasted cast br br this is one of the most disappointing films i've seen br br usually roger ebert does not let me down but i feel cheated after seeing this movie br br the only thrill is seeing elizabeth banks in her <UNK> that is a sorry statement about this movie it held so much promise but it was like dry <UNK> a <UNK> br br this is self absorbed tripe br br i cannot express deeply enough my <UNK> at having sat through this movie and hope i can <UNK> you of the same disappointment
<START> this film had no huge stars in it but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors and gene tierney before she became a big star with george sanders <UNK> <UNK> harry carey bruce <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> you'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered most of this i suspect is because of a second rate script as director henry <UNK> was a competent and well established man at the <UNK> br br the film is set in east africa during wwii just before the americans entered the war the brits are trying to control their african <UNK> while <UNK> nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals one of the white men in the film is a double dealer working for the destruction of the british empire but lovely tierney playing a <UNK> daughter is out to help save the day for good ol' britain br br american film makers have long sided with the empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a <UNK> of pro empire films nowadays with changed sensibilities the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for queen and country seems ridiculous and it would be hard to root for either side still in its day this propaganda piece was effective in <UNK> up support for the british though when seen today the film suffers from a long <UNK> script and silly casting the one bright moment in the film is the final showdown between george sanders and the enemy agent too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk losing some of its punch
<START> this film has a rotting core of <UNK> morality and yet a quirky sense of justice so many of the regular <UNK> among us would love to stick it to the man the man in this case is represented by several different characters mr <UNK> who carla reports to at her office later paul owes 70 large to mr <UNK> the club owner and then there is paul's <UNK> officer there seems to be so much question about this last character's side story reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted <UNK> game of <UNK> <UNK> between our two protagonists <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> until their lives change dramatically they are <UNK> to each agent of the man one or both could be fired killed or imprisoned if they don't do as they are told br br the film has a sense of relief at the end carla finally gets laid her boss is forced out for being a jerk mr club owner is a <UNK> mess in his own bathroom they get the money and they need not worry about <UNK> in to the <UNK> officer because his moral weakness leads him to <UNK> his wandering wife in the basement or whatever the police found to arrest him it is a critical <UNK> trigger to the lock <UNK> that wound us up so tight never mind that someone else may get paul's file later to <UNK> his release for the moment they are free they might even get away with it br br <UNK> br br they stuck it to the man
<START> weak start solid middle fantastic finish that's my impression of this film anyway i liked simon pegg in the two films i've seen him in hot <UNK> and shaun of the dead his role here though took a completely different turn shows his range as an actor but nonetheless i really disliked <UNK> character as he was portrayed at the beginning br br there's a kind of humour i call frustration comedy its supposed jokes and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments much like the bean character <UNK> <UNK> plays there are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too i don't mean to bash them here so will not br br but do be warned that if you are like me and you dislike smarmy and <UNK> <UNK> idiots pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film it does get better however br br i read somewhere that this is based on a true story hmmm maybe the film's story stopped being annoying and became kind of a triumph of the little guy in the final third i don't need all films to be sugar and light but <UNK> as this film got better it also started to be more and more of a happy ending br br it was also a pleasure to see an old favourite jeff bridges play a role so masterfully i liked iron man but was <UNK> by the fact that <UNK> character was a villain purely personal taste of course as his acting in that was superb nonetheless he was a marvel here as the bigger than life man of vision the <UNK> of <UNK> it was nice to see him in a role that i could actually enjoy br br overall then i liked it i just wish i had come in 40 minutes late and missed the beginning
<START> i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i'm thinking matrix i'm thinking <UNK> i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we'll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud <UNK> and a hot chick in shiny black leather <UNK> a big <UNK> bike <UNK> dig loud <UNK> and hot chicks in shiny black leather <UNK> big <UNK> <UNK> right br br flashy shallow dreary formulaic <UNK> tedious dull dumb <UNK> <UNK> barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe <UNK> likes it in fact
<START> i am so upset that abc is giving up on yet another show that has the chance to be a real winner this show is so good the writing and storyline were great an actual original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show the casting was spectacular not only were the characters and actors right on but these are a very talented set of actors the concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a tv show many of us share this whole idea of connections i really love the characters of steven laura <UNK> and <UNK> but to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that i did not like even those that only were in for a few episodes <UNK> <UNK> for example the acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented i wish abc had given this show more of a chance and not interrupted the show <UNK> also it was not advertised enough truly unfair to everyone this show showed great promise i for one will let abc know how i feel and will keep sending <UNK> to keep this show alive please join me i know we can do it it worked for <UNK> by the way where is episode 13 i want that last show please support this show and send <UNK> to abc we can do it this show is well worth it <UNK> online to save six degrees http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> we can do it sign this <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this has to be the best adaptation i have seen it's my favourite and i think it stays very close to the book what really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors the wonderful timothy dalton is the best rochester i have seen on screen brooding and tragic while zelah clarke is the perfect combination of strength courage <UNK> and <UNK> as jane the story as i'm sure most people know is this the young and plain jane eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the <UNK> who <UNK> her services as a <UNK> in the <UNK> she is offered the post of <UNK> at the big mansion <UNK> hall to <UNK> adele the young ward of the <UNK> mysterious and respected owner mr rochester as the months go on he falls in love with jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if jane is as <UNK> in love with him as he is with her however there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at <UNK> hall and when it is it's effects are devastating this is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as i said earlier excellent acting especially from zelah and timothy
<START> the incredible melting man plays like an extended episode of the six million dollar man but with violence and some nudity i know this film is a bit crummy but i found it impossible not to kind of like it br br the acting and script are not the best but the effects are good for a 30 year old movie with a budget of 50 the title character takes quite a while to actually melt but when he does it's reasonably impressive we also have one inventive death scene involving <UNK> of note too is the music it's insane a cheese <UNK> <UNK> of nonsense br br notable highlights br br marvel at the slow motion nurse who jumps through a <UNK> of glass for absolutely no reason whatsoever br br be amazed by a day in the life of a severed head br br beware of the psychotic <UNK> melting <UNK> called steve br br be <UNK> when our hero takes a break from hunting the melting lunatic to have a bowl of soup and complain about <UNK> <UNK> in the kitchen br br this film is just too 70's for me to hate it it's tacky and trashy but i thought it was a lot of fun you could do a lot worse
<START> a friend of mine gave me this movie a friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to <UNK> remove a dvd <UNK> from his br br i got quit excited by the <UNK> of an other michael <UNK> movie after all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great but boy was i wrong br br first off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so i imagine the <UNK> went something like this tell me do you like fish yes i enjoy fish very much wonder full you're hired have some money br br than there is the script i have read <UNK> who i hope went blind before he could see this piece of <UNK> and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel i'm not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech <UNK> 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would have been a treat in comparison to the one liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids <UNK> out br br this is an actual line from the movie if you tell me something that you've never said out loud to anyone before than this moment becomes unique unique does it does it really off course not you <UNK> please pass me the <UNK> i'll have a whole ing strip br br the directing is well i've got nothing maybe <UNK> marshall <UNK> just got word his grandmother <UNK> or something stick to directing comedies no stick to directing commercials br br this movie is so horrible it left me <UNK> my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age i give it 2 stars because i don't wanna be the guy that watched a 1 star movie
<START> <UNK> crimes is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the absolute disaster one of the <UNK> greek series ever actors like <UNK> <UNK> and maria <UNK> showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible <UNK> laughing every viewer seemed to <UNK> the bad side of their self in one of the characters or at least a side of their self they wish they had actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in greek audience's heart my personal favourites apart the first two i mentioned are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but so many amazing actors passed by some episodes from time to time whoever around the world understands greek should find a way to watch this series even though it's been more than 5 years that it was on tv in <UNK> they keep repeating the series <UNK> in every chance there is like <UNK> or early afternoon <UNK> we'll never forget <UNK> or any of the casting crew
<START> ok the story a <UNK> loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and <UNK> havoc in their lives is mildly interesting one anyway ideas are nothing everyone has some the execution is everything br br this is what bothered me with this flick and it did bother me immensely the rhythm directing editing was slow the pace was uneven and the climax expected we have seen those <UNK> <UNK> five six seven times why norton character's troubles were seen as a childish game not enough deep to understand his problems soul blah and to root for or against him is he a coward a <UNK> or just a loony references to the taxi driver were ridiculous and unnecessary and for certain not in favor for this flick or to e n for that matter br br and imho it is cowardly executed at the end cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in mid america this guy should have killed the kid blamed the father create a real havoc or the kid should have killed the father at the end etc but no we have gotten cheesy ending where kids miss the loony the father is puzzled over his own life and relationship with them and the loony of course dies the happy dysfunctional family stays <UNK> safe and happily bored again so we could enjoy our pop <UNK> <UNK> br br and that scene where the loony enters the movie oh my god i would have to think long and hard to find something <UNK> than that you do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew creators of that movie probably thought that was a good idea but it was more than annoying again if you're a 16 years old girl somewhere in kansas nowhere or whatever where and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age ok then you might enjoy this movie and its message
<START> having enjoyed mike myers previous work <UNK> world and saturday night live my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high it became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as <UNK> and unfunny as possible i <UNK> <UNK> off after ten minutes i watched it the other day a second time to see whether i had been unfair the first time i switched it off after ten minutes i find it hard to believe how even a twelve year old boy could find this funny the dialogue is an e <UNK> myers is painful to watch as is heather graham and the succession of characters including fat bastard makes matters even worse apart from the mildly amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the worst films i have ever seen i personally recommend you avoid this like the plague though several friends of mine enjoyed it maybe they were <UNK> at the time <UNK>
<START> i had no idea of the facts this film presents as i remember this situation i accepted the information presented then in the media a confused happening around a dubious personality mr chavez the film is a revelation of many realities i wonder if something of this caliber has ever been made i supposed the protagonist was mr chavez but everyone coming up on picture br br was important and at the end the reality of that <UNK> the people was overwhelming thank you kim <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br
<START> i grew up watching the original tv series in the sixties and one thing that i can tell you right away there is no comparison this film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive a martian that took different <UNK> special effects that looked like something that a little child would create in contrast in the original characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for tim and uncle martin the only highlight in this film yes actually there was one occurred when ray <UNK> finally made an appearance at the end he wore dark glasses and made references to living on this planet for 30 years as a sort of homage to the tv series but even the real uncle martin could not save this turkey
<START> who ever wrote the two or three glowing reviews were either involved in the making of this film term used loosely or bank rolling it and should the latter be the case i would want my seven dollars back the actors again term used loosely are awful in fact almost none of them did anything ever again which is a relief the scenery and everything about this screams we had 7 dollars to work with and a day to do it in was this filmed in <UNK> back yard everything about this project says low budget the actors at best were d list do not waste your time unless of course you want to take it back and try to get the rental back the lead bad guy looks like that punk from the 70s show that ended up marrying his grandmother <UNK> moore my local blockbuster video store lists this as the movie most returned with sad commentary attached even as a 99 <UNK> rental this flick <UNK> dust someone really must have <UNK> some <UNK> this is a super stinker and i give it 10 <UNK>
<START> i've received this movie from a cousin in <UNK> and had to <UNK> it from norwegian to american format with a copied video comparing this film 1948 with the heroes of <UNK> 1965 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the struggle for the heavy water casts the <UNK> themselves playing their respective roles though actors were also cast to play the roles of the <UNK> who have given their lives in <UNK> struggle for freedom in later <UNK> the plot is in four languages norwegian along with french german and english complete with norwegian subtitles br br impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle french scientists were interested in <UNK> some two hundred <UNK> of heavy water from <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> to take back to france in order to do lab studies on its <UNK> simultaneously the nazis too were interested in <UNK> heavy water to build a secret weapon the french were worried that the nazis might take an early lead by <UNK> <UNK> and through secret <UNK> their man carefully <UNK> nazi spies on his trip to <UNK> where he received the heavy water and making it back without <UNK> he was watched by two spies as he <UNK> an <UNK> but they did not see him hop out on the other side where he crossed the <UNK> to another plane nearby where his <UNK> was waiting for him this clever trick worked by using the <UNK> as a <UNK> that the nazis later forced down in <UNK> br br however the invasion of <UNK> on the morning of april 9 1940 the nazis took over <UNK> <UNK> and it was up to the norwegian underground and british intelligence in london to take action professor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the services of eleven young <UNK> the swallow and <UNK> groups who would successfully <UNK> the heavy water production in <UNK> this was shown in detail on how they actually carried out the operation including the sinking of the <UNK> after the nazis abandoned <UNK> <UNK> to take the <UNK> of heavy water on <UNK> cars to berlin br br the quality of the film was fair though there were many <UNK> in the film i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in world war ii history
<START> altered species starts one friday night in los angeles where dr irwin guy <UNK> his laboratory assistant walter allen lee <UNK> are burning the midnight oil as they continue to try perfect a revolutionary new drug called <UNK> as walter <UNK> the latest failed attempt down the sink the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> green <UNK> into the basement where escaped lab rats begin to drink it five of <UNK> friends alicia <UNK> <UNK> in a very <UNK> outfit including some cool boots that she gets to <UNK> on a rat with gary richard peterson burke derek <UNK> frank david <UNK> <UNK> alexandra <UNK> decide that he has been working too hard needs to get out so they plan to pick him up party the night away back at the lab the <UNK> douglas robert <UNK> has been attacked killed by the now homicidal rats in the basement as walter <UNK> the latest <UNK> of serum in a lab rat which breaks out of it's cage as it grows at an amazing rate <UNK> friends turn up but he can't leave while the rat is still missing so everyone helps him look for it all six become potential rat food br br also known as <UNK> altered species was co edited directed by miles <UNK> has very little to recommend it the script by producer <UNK> <UNK> is poor coupled together with the general <UNK> of the production as a whole altered species really is lame for a start the character's are dumb annoying clichéd then there's the unoriginal plot with the mad scientist the monster he has created the isolated location the stranded human cast the obligatory final showdown between hero monster it's all here somewhere altered species moves along at a fair pace which is just about the best thing i can say about it thankfully doesn't last that long it's basically your average run of the mill killer mutant rat film not a particularly good one at that either br br director <UNK> films like a tv film the whole thing is <UNK> bland forgettable while some of the special effects attack scenes leave a lot to be desired for a start the cgi rats are awful the attack sequences feature hand held jerky camera movement really quick edits to try hide the fact that all the rats are just <UNK> sitting there at various points in altered species the rat <UNK> need to shake because of the rats movement but you can clearly see all the rats just sitting there as someone shakes the <UNK> off screen the giant rat monster at the end looks pretty poor as it's just a guy in a dodgy suit there are no scares no tension or atmosphere since when did <UNK> contain bright <UNK> lighting there are one or two nice bits of gore here someone has a nice big messy hole where their face used to be there's a severed arm <UNK> lots of rat bites someone having their <UNK> <UNK> out a dead <UNK> cat br br technically altered species is sub standard throughout it takes place within the confines of one building has cheap looking cgi effects low production values the acting isn't up to much but it isn't too bad a special mention to <UNK> <UNK> as alicia as she's a bit of a babe makes altered species just that little bit <UNK> easier to watch br br altered species isn't a particularly good film in fact it's a pretty bad one but i suppose you could do worse not great but it might be worth a watch if your not too demanding have nothing else to do
<START> while the <UNK> have gone up a lot and some of the details have become dated any <UNK> who's <UNK> with problems of <UNK> should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie i know i did br br mr blandings a new york ad executive decides to move his family to the <UNK> <UNK> and build himself a nice house there he gets into one hilarious jam after another from <UNK> to <UNK> to construction difficulties as the costs and schedule of the construction keep <UNK> out of control i thought that the funniest scenes were where blandings hires a <UNK> to dig a well for water they dig down hundreds of feet but never find water yet only a short distance away a few days later the basement of his house to be <UNK> br br cary grant and myrna loy give believable performances as the <UNK> blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined and melvyn douglas is even better as <UNK> lawyer and family friend br br the only <UNK> is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948 mrs blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive <UNK> who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing and there's a black maid horrors so don't watch this movie through the social lens of 2003 and you'll enjoy it all the more br br
<START> i didn't think it would be possible for joe don baker to make a movie as bad as his <UNK> <UNK> but this one succeeds br br i wouldn't recommend this if you're a fan of joe don <UNK> much better work but if you like to watch fat guys sweat and really really drawn out gun fights you'll love this movie
<START> do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty p <UNK> off about it br br the acting is comparable with high school plays the script is shocking there is no plot twenty minutes from the end which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching i had a headache from all the screaming crying and <UNK> the five girls make br br the majority of the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested rather than <UNK> depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of s t die in the most horrible ways possible br br i spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of yours don't do it
<START> i can't believe it's been ten years since this show first aired on tv and delighted viewers with its unique mixture of comedy and horror this is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern british humor dr <UNK> house of horrible <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the mighty <UNK> snuff box many have <UNK> this show's style and i don't deny some have <UNK> its quality but <UNK> <UNK> deserves being remembered for having started the trend with actors mark <UNK> steve <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br together they created <UNK> <UNK> a sinister small town in <UNK> <UNK> countryside where unsuspecting tourists and <UNK> by come across an obsessive couple that wants to keep the town local and free of strangers where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the job center where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows where a vet kills all the animals he tries to cure where a gypsy circus kidnaps people and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to the food to hook people on br br this is just a <UNK> of what the viewer can find in the league of gentlemen by themselves the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters the make up and <UNK> are so good i actually thought i watching a lot more actors on the show than there were but it's also great acting the way they change their voices and their body movement the really become other people br br most of the jokes start with something ordinary from real life and then blows up into something unsettling sometimes gut wrenching sometimes it's pure horror without a set up like in <UNK> <UNK> character just imagine a creepy circus owner on make up <UNK> into someone's house and kidnapping women to be his wives no explanation given it's that creepy then there are the numerous references to horror movies <UNK> the silence of the <UNK> <UNK> the exorcist etc br br fans of horror will love it fans of comedy will love it as any <UNK> entering knows there's a sign there that says <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> you'll never leave ' any viewer who gives this show a chance will agree once you discover the league of gentlemen you'll never want anything else you'll never forget it
<START> quote by nicolas martin <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> fine film but dvd <UNK> for tv 8 april 2002 this is a charming and <UNK> film on the other hand the dvd i purchased has been <UNK> to fit your tv by the <UNK> at columbia <UNK> there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic <UNK> trash that it is so used to producing what a shame br br what a criminal shame indeed however there is another version out though see here for details http www <UNK> com film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br wonderful performances by the two main actors the king and <UNK> btw
<START> and so the great <UNK> of history continues hollywood style br br this was senseless ridiculous rubbish br br its shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived poorly acted inaccurate film i have ever seen it is appalling br br <UNK> <UNK> brief <UNK> with serious acting appears to be over i can only assume that leaving las vegas was a <UNK> in an otherwise <UNK> of dreadful films br br diane <UNK> proves that her performance in <UNK> was no <UNK> she really can't act br br harvey keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such tripe br br only recommended for those either recovering from a recent <UNK> or people of an opinion that america invented the world
<START> as a psychiatrist <UNK> in trauma i find this film a beautiful shown example of a severe psychic trauma even a trauma it not only explains the enormous difficulties those people have to cope <UNK> but that even love is sometimes not enough but she tries
<START> this is not a love song is a brilliant example of the chase genre which many people think has an underlying meaning the love between the two main characters may be more than <UNK> i believe that <UNK> is in love with spike but spike is too naive to see this br br i really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences <UNK> shows great <UNK> towards spike with intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing <UNK> name on the top of his letters br br one thing i've noticed when looking at <UNK> reviews is that when the film has been <UNK> the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film as they haven't even mentioned the possibility of <UNK> having sexual feelings for spike i also get the feeling that some of the reviewers haven't <UNK> it when they use phrases like who is <UNK> what's he doing with a <UNK> like spike this person however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark spike shows noticeable signs of having a d d although i don't think this person has realised this as he seems to be using the word <UNK> as a <UNK> term br br i really enjoyed this film although it is not for the faint hearted the film is exceedingly character based after the shooting until the end there isn't much but dialogue between the two anti heroes unless you are used to watching such deep gritty films stay well away
<START> this film has a lot of strong points it has one of the best horror casts outside of the lugosi karloff <UNK> circle lionel <UNK> fay <UNK> and dwight frye plus leading man melvyn douglas it's got all the right ingredients bats a castle with lots of stone <UNK> a mad scientist <UNK> waving <UNK> and hunting vampires an <UNK> type character a beautiful girl even a goofy haired <UNK> the soft focus camera work is moody and imaginative there's even some good comic relief nicely <UNK> throughout the script br br but it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in <UNK> little castle the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist nicely played by <UNK> who values his work more highly than human lives br br it's not top <UNK> material because of a ho hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye but it's worth a look if you like early b w horror pictures
<START> this is one of those films that makes you want the time you spent watching it back and then some like the time you spent accidentally picking it out the time you spent getting to the video store etc br br first off the look it's grainy it's low budget now that in itself doesn't make for a bad film but the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural so that's kind of distracting br br then the story 3 <UNK> go on a <UNK> weekend away from guys of course as everyone does when going on a camping trip they stop on the way to get <UNK> when they arrive at the area in which they're going to stay they get pulled over by mr ranger sir who <UNK> them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car at fire season and then drives them where they're going a remote cabin of course 2 cute guys wander into their <UNK> and <UNK> yes <UNK> and <UNK> are immediately smitten but apparently <UNK> is smitten by anything with two legs <UNK> is rather disappointed by this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting about her ex by getting sh faced and stoned with her gal pals br br oh and i almost forgot there's a mean old <UNK> that lives up that way that's perhaps someone to not <UNK> with and the area cabin in which they're staying have a sort of reputation br br so of course sooner or later unfortunately much later some of our weekend wood <UNK> begin to die and find various <UNK> traps although a couple of them actually hit a little lower than that and of course the remaining <UNK> are understandably upset no cell phone reception of course who would miss out on a chance to check their cell phone for reception in a movie anymore mr ranger sir keeps popping up at odd times his behavior seems a bit odd but he has said he will get help br br there's a fantastic twist to this that you just won't want to miss too if you're still awake pray that you wake up to a blank screen br br the acting in this is terrible the production values are terrible and the whole <UNK> is just lame i find it amazing this was even released avoid at all costs 1 out of 10
<START> i was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that i went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was <UNK> rated <UNK> here in the uk to my <UNK> this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes which is not a problem to me as an adult but not good for watching with children this film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes getting hit in the <UNK> etc and for the most part of the film not very funny br br the premise of the film is that <UNK> <UNK> who is a <UNK> midget gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a <UNK> <UNK> so the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby getting into this <UNK> house so he can get this diamond back br br up until now i have enjoyed most of the <UNK> from the wayans brothers but this film is certainly taking the <UNK> br br a bit of good advice wait till it comes on tv or cable
<START> i don't like using the word awful to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time effort talent and money is spent in its creation but <UNK> attempt to adapt charlotte <UNK> novel <UNK> <UNK> is a total waste of time br br the script is lacking in <UNK> and power everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms leaving little to the imagination the lead actors are woefully miscast clearly hired for their star names and the musical score <UNK> and dull charlotte <UNK> and william hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all she is like a wet <UNK> worse even than joan fontaine who at least was capable of some <UNK> of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion and william hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any <UNK> of life to this flick br br joan <UNK> mrs <UNK> is like some disney creation who keeps popping up to <UNK> scenes in which she would have been best left out br br there is no mystery surrounding the story of <UNK> first wife the role of the would be second wife played like a <UNK> doll by <UNK> <UNK> is an empty <UNK> br br <UNK> shaw a very great actress is completely wasted as jane's aunt mrs reed she would have been better cast as mrs <UNK> only amanda root as jane's beloved school teacher evokes any authentic sympathy or believability br br i saw this version of <UNK> <UNK> after viewing robert <UNK> for british television made in 1997 starring <UNK> <UNK> samantha morgan and <UNK> jones there is no comparison <UNK> vital romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding <UNK> compared to <UNK> wet <UNK> br br i will be interested now to see the 1970 version with timothy dalton about which i've read some very good things on this web site i am amazed at how many people liked <UNK> <UNK> picture book br br about all i can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored beyond that it is a complete dud
<START> okay as a long time disney fan i really hate direct to video disney sequels walt himself didn't believe in them he believed in and they lived happily ever after being the end of it but this one really <UNK> the <UNK> there were so many <UNK> of other disney films in this it wasn't funny quick summary if you don't already know melody the daughter of ariel and prince eric is born <UNK> sister <UNK> who basically looks like ursula if she were to <UNK> herself green and go on the ally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shows up and after trying to do the <UNK> <UNK> in and failing <UNK> doom for the characters after that ordeal ariel goes into a <UNK> of being like her father and refuses to tell melody about her mermaid <UNK> and later on <UNK> her to go near the sea well surprise surprise melody finds out being the stubborn brat she is and runs away then makes a deal with morgana to become a mermaid in exchange for something gee does that sound familiar she becomes one but in her half of the bargain has to retrieve her <UNK> <UNK> and bring it back to the sea witch while doing this she runs into a couple of <UNK> animals a penguin and a <UNK> named timon and <UNK> huh wait no that's not timon and pumbaa or is it could of fooled me anyway i'd like to reveal more but pretty much anything that could be guessed to happen does ok so long story short this movie borrows too much from other better disney films and does it horribly come on tip and dash why not just make dash <UNK> <UNK> and make it an even more obvious ripoff ugh not to mention the total character <UNK> of <UNK> persona she's gone from being a <UNK> <UNK> woman to a clone of her father not good at all they're basically telling us the sweet <UNK> little mermaid we've known to grow and love is dead plus melody herself isn't such a great character either she's damned annoying and <UNK> not to mention what they've done to <UNK> ugh anyway if you decide to see this piece of created mainly for profit reasons no imagination <UNK> <UNK> c t i suggest maybe waiting <UNK> its on the disney channel or some other tv station because it's not even worth the price of a rental br br out of stars
<START> a pre code <UNK> with stanwyck playing a <UNK> whore who sleeps her way to the top these pre code flicks really let it all go with nothing left to the imagination stanwyck is outstanding as <UNK> the daughter of a <UNK> owner father who sold more than booze to his <UNK> <UNK> after the old man dies good <UNK> heads for the big city for better things she uses her female attributes to sleep her way to the top john wayne makes a poor cameo and proves that actors get better with age and an acting coach i loved the banter and strong lines between the actors i highly recommend this film to all film buffs and to watch stanwyck who is great and beautiful as <UNK>
<START> i watched this film sort of by accident having bought it as the b side on the <UNK> man dvd the <UNK> man was a bit of a disappointment except for the beginning which was clearly the inspiration for 28 days later the rest of it is just the stuff of tv movies but soylent green is in a whole other league i bet this is one of <UNK> favourites there are at least 3 scenes in the film that i've never seen anything like before heston casually getting into bed with the furniture while discussing something else completely unrelated a whole crowd of people being <UNK> up by a fleet of mechanical <UNK> a priest taking confession and being shot by the <UNK> ok maybe that's been done since but there aren't many films that are so consistently original like this and what the heck is going on between heston and edward g robinson is this the most unlikely gay couple ever or what luckily i saw this film without knowing the ending which apparently is rare then i watched it again and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile a very nice script and some great sets too just when you thought you'd seen everything
<START> br br i'm not sure who decides what category a movie fits into but this movie is not a horror movie as for the story it was fairly interesting but rather slow i was especially disappointed with the ending though br br spoiler br br tell me why on earth does she run over to her <UNK> home without at least calling the detective or the police first she knows exactly what's going on at that point plus she has a video tape as proof instead she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying i know everything i have proof you didn't expect proof did you then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he's going to harm her well duh of course he's going to harm you idiot you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything what a dumb ending
<START> there isn't much in the way of spoilers since there isn't a plot to reveal but still i guess i describe some of what happens so this is it this is the most nonsensical film i've ever seen there are simply no words to describe this movie although bizarre ridiculous and ego trip are pretty close the opening half hour or so are really really weird music videos with absolutely no plot or continuity apart from that <UNK> falls into some from the previous one of the highlights of this part of the film in the section where <UNK> is flying a merry go round <UNK> through what seem to be half <UNK> bond intro rejects and sections cut from yellow submarine dear lord you could not make this up br br then with a little over an hour remaining the film begins with a lot of <UNK> some of it really creepy <UNK> our hero and chasing him looking for an <UNK> obviously this leaves our as of yet mute <UNK> songs lead somewhat worried and he manages to <UNK> lose them fortunate for him because it means he can witness a falling star and and again i'm not making this up turn into a <UNK> rabbit he uses this cunning disguise to try and sneak past them but for reasons i can't recall right now they see through it oh no and the creepy chase begins again cue another song big shock there br br shortly after the end of the chase <UNK> somehow brings the rabbit to life until he is <UNK> by a policeman in the middle of the desert because it is apparently illegal to dance there br br the rest of the film is equally as strange highlights including <UNK> cleaning up a bar to the tune of smooth criminal including shooting a man with his finger not only killing the guy but burning his shadow into the wall a la nuclear <UNK> weapons another good moment is when <UNK> seeing mr big joe what the hell happened to his career at this point <UNK> kidnap one of the children he was friends with magically creates a tommy gun and in another moment of violence that pepper this film seemingly at random opens fire at everything that moves a final moment i shall mention is when <UNK> surrounded by mr big and his private army seriously this guy has dozens of people working for him and they're <UNK> out more like <UNK> <UNK> rather than <UNK> which i guess they are how does he get out why he turns into a robot complete with weapons and shield this is the third of four <UNK> he makes almost always when backed into a corner and or on the run br br this film is quite quite surreal with little in the way of plot and virtually no continuity
<START> i'll say this much this director is all about raw images things most of us are not ready to confront head on images of sex suicide murder and people <UNK> themselves are constantly <UNK> the viewer which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release although i don't think that i could ever see this movie again i will say that the director does have a good eye there were some really nice shots and picture moments in the film the fans the wire fish in their hair but the story left me needing more strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves what the heck did we just see br br note if you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily don't see this film
<START> did not know what to expect from from van <UNK> partner friend <UNK> and his fight choreographer for most of his films it was nice to see him act as <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and other van <UNK> films now he's on his own he and his wife make a great team in this one <UNK> is the action director and lead bad guy and he's good really <UNK> his wife was the writer producer and directed most of the scenes which didn't require action she also did good job editing the film together they did a great job the story made sense the fight scenes were edited well the leads were real fighters and looked good together the story came together well and if you can <UNK> it no bad language no sex just action a new one on me check it out
<START> paul verhoeven has one of the strangest <UNK> of any major director he started off making art house films in his native <UNK> before moving to hollywood where he began making <UNK> genre pieces which are often seen as mere <UNK> by the mainstream crowd <UNK> the fourth man was the last film he made before moving to the u s and it seems to have been a <UNK> film for him br br from the beginning of the fourth man it's clear that the film will be seen from the perspective of the famous albeit <UNK> author gerard in a seeming homage to carol <UNK> similarly titled 1949 film the third man the film begins with an author making a trip to speak to a crowd of literature <UNK> the similarities end there however as gerard runs into no major complications before arriving at the <UNK> and the speech itself goes fairly smoothly in spite of the relative ease with which he <UNK> this function we know that the author is somewhat troubled as he has realistic fantasies about murdering his roommate before leaving his house and he also has a surreal fantasy involving a hotel he sees advertised and a detached <UNK> growing out of a <UNK> <UNK> that he sometimes has trouble keeping his fantasies separate from reality is made all the more clear when an <UNK> he tells is exposed as untrue and he admits that he lie s the truth until he no longer knows whether something did or didn't happen br br the fourth man is full of surreal fantasies and dreams which are made all the more disturbing because it's very easy to see how they relate to events which we have seen occur and because they sometimes <UNK> events which haven't occurred yet between the <UNK> of the unreal sequences and verhoeven's careful editing style this ends up being the most atmospheric film this side of don't look now and like that film this one is full of ambiguity unlike that film the fourth man is also <UNK> funny as <UNK> deeply held catholic beliefs <UNK> into every aspect of his life including sexuality he naturally associates a female hair <UNK> he knows <UNK> with the biblical <UNK> though he fears she'll remove an even more important symbol of <UNK> with her <UNK> in an erotic fantasy sequence that would make luis <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> a man he's attracted to for a life size statue of christ on the cross br br the fourth man is a horror film which manages to bring the viewer into the mind of the protagonist while still maintaining a certain ambiguity it certainly seems as if gerard is in danger but it may just be more of his lying the truth the film is also full of both subtle and not so subtle visual symbolism which helps make it a unique and satisfying cinematic experience
<START> i went to see this film based on the review by <UNK> and ebert not only did i get <UNK> but i took some friends along and had to spend the rest of the day <UNK> <UNK> for making them sit through this pointless crap after this i never went to see a movie based solely on <UNK> <UNK> advice
<START> henry fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed abraham lincoln was like it is a <UNK> through <UNK> performance we are led to believe on the surface that abraham lincoln was a country <UNK> but through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings you can see that beneath the exterior <UNK> is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him br br in this movie henry fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor it is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years when he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect there is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard he shows this gift again in the lady eve in 1940 br br the ending by john ford is absolutely brilliant with henry fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the civil war he goes forward into history the movie is fiction but the insight into lincoln is tremendous definitely worth seeing again
<START> great cast great acting unpredictable story line for the first half br br hour or so i was really wanting to know what was going to br br happen to each of these <UNK> characters and how their br br seemingly <UNK> lives would become <UNK> but when br br the writers took out the <UNK> to start connecting the players they br br <UNK> used super <UNK> and brought the movie to a <UNK> br br for the last two hours i kept thinking it would get better but it only br br got worse don't believe the reviews this is a waste of time br br think about it tom cruise made ugly why the gorgeous br br hunky bartender wearing <UNK> why i know it had to do with br br the plot but without them at least there would have been one br br attractive cast member to remember
<START> if you ever watched the dukes of <UNK> you know that you never had to worry about drugs or <UNK> or crude behavior being seen by young children if you've seen the movie you know that is no longer the case this movie was horrible main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what i call entertainment they took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash daisy who was a little <UNK> in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services i was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out 15 minutes into the movie i was ready to leave i stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute i wish i had never seen this movie it <UNK> a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when i left do yourself a favor go see something worth your money cause it's not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back
<START> just kidding i rented 12 monkeys the other day because i am a huge bruce willis fan and i heard some things about the film some good and some bad but it was one of those films you had to pay attention to every second so i was a bit worried just because i felt like for a minute if this was going to be one of those films that i had to watch several times to get but i watched it last night and i was really impressed this movie had everything in it action drama sci fi history dark humor and even a little romance the actors all did a terrific job i give a lot of credit to bruce during his scene in the car with his psychiatrist he really got to me but brad pitt i'm just amazed with how much of a great job he did he didn't over do his character who was crazy and just made it work and was extremely believable the story was just scary but very good and a wake up call br br james cole is a man in the future where a virus broke out in the past and killed 5 billion people and only 1 of the population survived including him animals are now <UNK> the ground above while the humans are down below but scientists send james to the past of 1990 really meaning to send him to <UNK> to find out about information of the virus james gets put into a mental institution meeting his new psychiatrist dr kathryn <UNK> and another mental patient jeffrey <UNK> he tells them the future of course no one believes him he goes back to the future but the scientists send him back to the correct year to where the doctor is kidnapped by james but he tells her more and believes him now they are set on trying to prevent the virus from ever happening br br 12 monkeys was an incredible film like i said the story was so scary just because it's not at all hard to believe that we are not far from that happening but the whole movie was just great the cast the sets just the whole picture was a great one it had a terminator type of feel to it where we might loose something precious one day ourselves if we don't listen to others what is right and what is wrong who knows but i would highly recommend 12 monkeys it's a great movie that if you give it the proper chance i'm sure you'll enjoy it br br 9 10
<START> what i love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and it's a blast to experience their everyday love humor and adventure the literature of magic is so diverse portraying the ideas of classical medieval and modern <UNK> like harry potter and sabrina with sabrina the teenage witch this show is so fun and unique because it lets us experience a lot of that modern <UNK> seven seasons worth this show has so many great qualities and it's a joy to watch sabrina live her daily life in the mortal and other realm i would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean funny and adventurous classic
<START> i just love <UNK> documentaries they are so <UNK> and simple but still so fascinating i have no idea why this documentary works it is about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> people live there and nothing happens really but still <UNK> manages to make it fascinating and interesting his love for humanity even racist or <UNK> people is so overwhelming that you just can't help but also to fall in love with them too br br <UNK> filmed most of it in 1979 he came back 6 years later to see what had changed this would have been a good film without the material 6 years later but this small addition makes it great it may sound like <UNK> was just doing what has been done in the up series but in fact it is not the up series are about people <UNK> emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person but what has happened to this community and the change is great 1985 is the reagan era and the <UNK> are suffering once a proud community now no one sees much future at all and parents hope their children will <UNK> them self and do something else than <UNK> br br this documentary is quite relevant today our financial <UNK> today started because of what was happening then just take a look to these final words in the film spoken by an older lawyer from the town in 1985 br br well i have high hopes for this country because the things that are going on right now can only be <UNK> in my mind as an obsession with greed and a nation doesn't live long with that obsession and particularly a democracy that there's good there's good a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they aren't gonna they aren't gonna <UNK> to this philosophy of greed that's going on now it's horrible br br unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened
<START> i swear when i first saw this movie i cried my eyes out a star is born is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles john norman kris kristofferson and esther streisand face you also experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie streisand and kristofferson have such great chemistry together and the music is fantastic when streisand sings with one more look at you watch closely now it's just pure magic this movie made the song <UNK> one of my favorites and queen <UNK> is such a fun song also i love the fashion of the '70s except <UNK> <UNK> besides that she's a beauty a star is born is my number one favorite movie this movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart <UNK> at the end
<START> the night of the prom the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic and so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head <UNK> <UNK> event occurred in their <UNK> lives br br there really is no excuse for prom night there is less than nothing original about it and i truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on imdb the only part of my viewing that i enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of <UNK> it was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them br br the plot was basically some guy going on a rampage and the thing was it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame <UNK> williams <UNK> with a baseball cap i might have sat there feeling slightly anxious the fact that i cared less about the characters than i did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't really add to the effect either and to make matters worse the rest of the characters were equally one dimensional and oblivious the hotel staff didn't seem to notice or care that one of their <UNK> had <UNK> and are further proof that a murderer is <UNK> after he has had a <UNK> i was incredibly surprised that the bitchy stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was she realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs <UNK> herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint <UNK> nice one br br the worst thing was i hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest he really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening shocking and the music don't even get me started it was almost as appropriate as <UNK> at a funeral br br i really wish that prom night was a joke it was terrible and <UNK> predictable no one in their right mind or otherwise has any reason to see this film mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this <UNK> the situation if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film hear my <UNK> don't do it there are better things to spend six pounds on like a sheet to play ghosts with
<START> for those who never saw a chorus line <UNK> and their only exposure to the story was this film this film is ok as movie musicals nothing special just ok i have seen the show on broadway 4 times and even <UNK> for a <UNK> company of the show once and for someone who pretty much <UNK> the original production the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that i don't even know where to begin first of all for those who have never <UNK> for a theatrical production let me assure you that <UNK> when you audition for a play the director producer and choreographer never ask personal questions and don't give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer a real theatrical audition whether it be for a play or a musical rarely takes more than five minutes if you're <UNK> as a dancer you get shown a 64 bar dance combination once you do it and then they decide immediately whether you're in or out michael <UNK> original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the <UNK> the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little the play is about these dancers first of all director richard attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by <UNK> up the cassie <UNK> relationship and by casting michael douglas as <UNK> in the play you never see <UNK> he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with cassie is barely touched upon cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to larry a character who is not even in the play was all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about major musical numbers were cut or <UNK> the opening number in the play i hope i get it shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated in the movie they jam three hundred dancers <UNK> together and show them in <UNK> to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who can't dance can you say audrey <UNK> goodbye 12 goodbye 13 hello love a brilliant vocal exploration of these <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> memories was <UNK> as surprise surprise mainly a vehicle for the late <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> the show's most famous song what i did for love which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance becomes just another standard love song in the film performed <UNK> by a miscast <UNK> reed as cassie jeffrey <UNK> choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and doesn't hold a candle to michael <UNK> original staging and when you're making a movie about dancers the choreography has to be special there are a couple of good dancers in the film the previously mentioned <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> michelle <UNK> as <UNK> and janet jones as judy but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do yet audrey <UNK> who can barely walk and chew <UNK> at the same time is given one of the show's best numbers dance 10 looks 3 i will admit that the finale one is dazzling but you have to wait almost two hours for that i would say that if you never saw a chorus line <UNK> this film might be worth a look but if you are a <UNK> of the original broadway musical be afraid be very afraid
<START> that's a <UNK> of choice dialogue delivered by the evil <UNK> lady assistant of a famous scientist to her <UNK> maid just before she <UNK> three incredibly dumb college girls to a mansion for behavior <UNK> experiments meanwhile at the local bar people drink and dance to lame 80s rock songs a biker punk has sex with a cycle slut on a <UNK> table in front of a crowd of people then tries to rape the <UNK> <UNK> daughter jessica debra hunter who is in love with another biker <UNK> <UNK> from pet sematary who in turn is in <UNK> with the assistant back at the house the <UNK> <UNK> swim shower change clothes and have sex with men from the bar a small silver ball part of the experiment flies into victims mouths and turns them into <UNK> killer zombies br br if that isn't enough to entertain you there's a hilarious theme song nightmare fantasy roller <UNK> some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet that warns danger danger just like the lost in space robot and <UNK> <UNK> as one of the best ways to pick up men br br this filmed in florida mess is so mind numbingly awful that multiple viewings are recommended to <UNK> it all in and hey isn't that <UNK> <UNK> detective jill <UNK> turned <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> thompson as one of <UNK> nude <UNK> sure is supposedly this was started in 1982 and new footage was added later for the video release in 1985 br br score 1 out of 10 and i mean that in a good way
<START> amongst the standard one liner type action films where acting and logic are checked at the door this movie is at the top of the class if the person in charge of casting were to have put good actors in this flick it would have been worse <UNK> richard dawson who actually did act well if you can call playing yourself acting i love this movie the running man is in all <UNK> god's gift to man okay maybe just men definitely the most <UNK> movie of our time so i'll part you with my favorite line it's all part of life's rich pattern brenda and you better f g get used to it <UNK> more people have been called brenda for the sake of <UNK> this film than i can possibly imagine
<START> this is not just a bad film it's one of the worst films ever it's so bad that i found it to be quite enjoyable the acting oh my god the script you gotta be <UNK> how can you imagine the writer coming up with things like a kid who makes fireworks in school fireworks so <UNK> that when someone gets hit by it they fly a hundred <UNK> backwards and explode a girl is trapped in the <UNK> the killer is trying to break open the door she gets a <UNK> but the wire isn't long enough she first makes an <UNK> <UNK> oh the horror and then when she's done she <UNK> through the door and <UNK> through the head of the killer wow and there are plenty more examples like that oh yeah and what happened to george kennedy he used to be great <UNK> and <UNK> cool hand luke
<START> carlos <UNK> carmen is one of the finest achievements in world let alone spanish cinema it manages to <UNK> interest in flamenco in its wonderful staged adaptations from <UNK> with powerful physical force at the same time we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of carmen on the choreographer director and the principle dancers the fine line between life and art is dazzling
<START> judging by the hype and other reviews on this site i was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on <UNK> what i got was complete crap focusing on <UNK> i wonder if there's another movie called <UNK> that these people reviewed there are only 3 main characters and none of them struck me as well written or well acted basically the whole movie i just spent shaking my head and <UNK> at the stupidity of these drug <UNK> br br do yourself a favor don't rent this movie rent cabin fever or some other decent horror movie hell rent mary <UNK> the animated <UNK> are scarier and more convincing than anything you'll find in <UNK>
<START> can fake scenery ruin a picture you wouldn't think so but it actually for me in here listen i have a lot of classic era movies and i know pretty much what to except such as the drivers <UNK> <UNK> cars in front of a screen etc but a lot of that hokey business has to do with action scenes to have fake scenery fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in <UNK> gets insulting after awhile br br as far as the music entertainment went this is always <UNK> what songs one person likes another may not so that shouldn't be a big part of judging a film whether someone likes the songs i could blast this movie for its corny 1950 songs dances romances and characters but that was the <UNK> and a lot of people liked this sort of things musicals did very well in the <UNK> me i liked the <UNK> and <UNK> with the great <UNK> by the <UNK> tap was out and this new stuff which i can stand was it does that make this a lousy movie no it just makes one i didn't care for very much br br despite the good cast good director and high expectations this film bombed at the box office and with me i should have liked it more being a <UNK> myself and that's a nice part of this story i am not the cynical type and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds awful appeal then why couldn't i connect with this film part of it also was the dancing i don't care for the stuff that replaced tap dancing on screen but no the thing really turned me off what that staging there was no scotland no <UNK> just a hokey looking background to make it look that way and it turned me almost from the start score one point for today's realism where they go on location most of the time
<START> 1 2 pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis adam scott philip baker hall directed by richard shepard br br a well <UNK> story and film all together brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his bond movies after <UNK> after the sunset his <UNK> role brings in the laughs and a great time professional hit man so to speak julian noble on a job in mexico city winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man danny wright kinnear possibly one of his best roles also on business there the two on screen duo produce a <UNK> charged laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs davis in one of her best roles since american <UNK> gives another charming and witty performance one of the years most enjoyable and best films my final rating 9 10
<START> bread very <UNK> <UNK> the conventions of horror movies in general and night of the living dead in specific and is constantly inventive the production values are a little rough at times it's a student film after all but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain hey george romero liked it enough to include it on the <UNK> dead video tape <UNK> and dvd that should tell you something
<START> just saw it yesterday in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> film festival just before going i came here to see how it was rated and at that time it was 7 4 a pretty nice rate br br after 15 minutes i was dying to get out never did this but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening br br i did not like at all the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere the characters are <UNK> than the dialogs nothing lead anywhere and the worst and worst plenty of <UNK> and <UNK> advertising on the movie despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself i still have to be <UNK> by the main character <UNK> on the internet and <UNK> mobile popping up all the time on her lap top or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have <UNK> <UNK> displayed enormously on the screen all of this would be bearable if the plot characters romances anything was good but was bad really bad a don't know how to do sex in the city br br don't waste your time or money
<START> it should first be said that i have read the manga and therefore my argument is based on the differences br br this anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and <UNK> what it left behind was merely a <UNK> of what it could have been many of the characters lacked the depth that is seen in the manga <UNK> is not the sympathetic character that secretly wishes for death <UNK> story lacks the betrayal and the nazi villains that plot to <UNK> the world in war are completely absent instead the anime provides the gary <UNK> villain <UNK> who is defeated against what appear to be all odds br br my primary complaint is not that the anime <UNK> from the manga but that it does such a poor job
<START> come on get over with the <UNK> bashing guys bollywood can not only make brilliant movies but can seriously affect a generation of viewers br br i am a huge bollywood fan but anti <UNK> movies just make me <UNK> too much to enjoy screenplay cinematography action sequences everything br br i'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are <UNK> propaganda and there are movies like main <UNK> <UNK> out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its bollywood <UNK> but also because it tries to say give peace a chance and shows that there are <UNK> out there on both sides who do not represent the masses
<START> in this movie <UNK> supporters either <UNK> and not <UNK> just lie about a dramatic situation in our country br br they did not say that the conflict started because of <UNK> <UNK> firing a lot of <UNK> best workers just for political issues br br they did not say anything about more than <UNK> tv <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> during only 3 days in <UNK> <UNK> a kind of <UNK> o private tv <UNK> each one with about 20 minutes of duration br br they did not tell us anything about the <UNK> <UNK> made by general en <UNK> lucas <UNK> romero inspector general of the army forces who is a traditional <UNK> of <UNK> even now in despite of his <UNK> he is the <UNK> de interior y <UNK> after <UNK> return he <UNK> the charge of <UNK> del <UNK> equals to defense secretary in us br br they did not say anything about <UNK> orders about shooting against a <UNK> people concentration who was claiming for <UNK> br br they did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by <UNK> supporters either civilians and military official forces br br they present some facts in a wrong order in order to lie br br they did not say anything about <UNK> <UNK> society thats are even now claiming for an <UNK> in order to solve the crisis and <UNK> actions in order to avoid the <UNK> br br that's why i tell you this movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie
<START> the running man is one of those films that if <UNK> would become boring and depressing even br br my advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks br br in todays climate of tv media <UNK> and the <UNK> mode in society it really does work as a <UNK> social commentary post 1980s boom forget that though there are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film br br <UNK> is on top form as ben the butcher of <UNK> richards and the inclusion of bond <UNK> one liners was completely inspired <UNK> are truly leg end <UNK> with his rant to <UNK> over a camera the main highlight br br the design of the <UNK> is <UNK> american and mirrors the characterizations seen in the pc <UNK> tv show and the wwe as well buzz <UNK> grisly end will chill any viewer to the core as a foot note why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat <UNK> with a bitter sense of humour br br jesse <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are great as backing muscle and are <UNK> <UNK> in real life and its even got mick <UNK> in it too what more could you ask for br br i highly recommend the running man if you're looking for a great piece of entertaining action with a <UNK> finish and some great characters just don't expect an education from it at least on surface value br br quality i bloody love it actually you will too unless you're a <UNK> 7 10
<START> the fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script is beyond me this really must be one of the worst films in addition to haunted highway i have ever seen bad actors and a really bad story there's no normal reactions to any event in this film and even though it's halloween normal people would have bigger reactions when they're witnessing their father being killed not to mention <UNK> people with tape covering their <UNK> not being able to breathe in a room with at least 50 people i might add and some person dressed up as satan dragging dead people out of his house even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person not to mention the fact that no one could possibly be that naive and dumb to believe the reality of satan and <UNK> appearances on the same day like this kid does when i was 8 i sure had more brains than that br br but the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling for this mute satan look alike as well no questions asked the question throughout the film is is it really satan or is it some crazy person killing people off whenever he feels like it well he's got human hands arms built and whatever so i guess he's supposed to be in the movie as well otherwise they did a lousy job <UNK> it then with this person being human and all he was able to kill an old lady a man and his mistress 5 cops all with guns and training i presume and a few other people and obviously everyone was just standing there waiting for him or what br br the whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing i've seen and i would never recommend anyone to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total crap
<START> welcome back <UNK> sutherland it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie and what a movie this was was it 24 no but very intriguing especially with a pro like michael douglas in the lead as the <UNK> secret service agent <UNK> character is the one chasing michael douglas the whole movie <UNK> partner is eva longoria the desperate <UNK> wow she can actually act besides <UNK> all day and look good i wish though that kim <UNK> had a bigger role but other than that i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish this movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller everybody played their part to the <UNK> nothing was revealed to <UNK> in the movie so as to keep you guessing at all times and i really think that <UNK> did one heck of a job here in this movie but in my opinion michael douglas had the <UNK> performance of the day thumbs up
<START> we went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled it is without doubt one of the worst movies ever it is not that i don't like cult movies i do but nothing happens in the film one does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever endless times without dialog and the car how do <UNK> carry a huge <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and clothing for every day in that car it is a two <UNK> i have to say however the scenery is beautiful but not in a movie the director should have made a <UNK> of the movie so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time in with nothing happens anyway br br i would not recommend it as it is a waste of your time
<START> this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing it is shot on video not film i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's when late night networks showed movie of the week <UNK> <UNK> shot in video it looks like a bad soap opera and that is paying it a compliment some of the actors give it their best shot michael des <UNK> does okay with what he is given to do which is to act like a sex addict out of control i can't say that it is pleasant to watch br br <UNK> kinski as the <UNK> sits in a chair for practically the entire film with very little variation in camera angles i can't fault her for someone else's poor <UNK> but she is totally unbelievable in her role her little girl voice works against her here and i consider myself a <UNK> kinski fan she is certainly <UNK> and exotic but she's outside her range with this br br alexandra paul is <UNK> overwrought every line she delivers is with three <UNK> points someone must have directed her to scream at all costs why would michael des <UNK> want to have sex with such a raging <UNK> br br finally <UNK> arquette as the sweet <UNK> wife comes off okay and probably the most believable of the bunch but that is not saying much br br this has to be the worst film i have seen in years
<START> i purchased this video quite cheaply ex rental thinking that the cover looked quite nice and it was nice but the movie is trash i can handle b grade i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp ie <UNK> nazis must <UNK> is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be but this was just bland bland bland incredibly dull scenes were broken up too <UNK> by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences this movie has very little to offer
<START> the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and i've seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are what really made it for me <UNK> <UNK> father running around all <UNK> with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine it's your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as <UNK> had me on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think it's one of the better one's out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfied br br performances <UNK> raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part she's beautiful to look at and her chemistry with <UNK> felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldn't help but love him martin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john carradine <UNK> <UNK> arthur kennedy sylvia miles deborah <UNK> jerry <UNK> richard dreyfuss jeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as <UNK> he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli <UNK> christopher <UNK> do well as the bumbling detectives beverly <UNK> has one chilling scene that i won't spoil br br bottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look br br 7 10
<START> it's a rehash of many recent films only this one has fewer stars lesser complications and a more fuzzy feel to it <UNK> and <UNK> played by <UNK> khan <UNK> <UNK> respectively meet at a friend's wedding where their own marriage <UNK> to them begins its process of being arranged within no time the two strangers are married and sent of to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples going through the motions similar to theirs as they spend time together secrets are revealed hearts broken and or <UNK> and love <UNK> br br if you've seen honeymoon private limited and or <UNK> e <UNK> then you've seen this film the plot twists are the same there is not a single element of surprise in the entire two and a half hours of the film everything is predictable i only enjoyed it because i had seen <UNK> also starring the leads <UNK> khan earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry in that so i said why not when my sister suggested we rent <UNK> <UNK> as well br br see it because <UNK> <UNK> co stars and is her usual darling self in it br br skip it because you've had enough of all this couple fest nonsense br br c
<START> a movie you start watching as a late night cable porn it is hot in that department but it has even a lot more it has a sense of humor some action in and out of the bed and it has reasonable acting as well as a story worth watching a definite adult only movie but well worth watching
<START> the reviews i read for this movie were pretty decent so i decided to check it out bad idea this is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends the story is stupid mix two parts <UNK> with one part prom night a <UNK> of i know what you did last summer and add a tiny dash of single white female now blend until completely nonsensical there is nothing new to this plot and <UNK> the clichés i've grown so fond of wasn't even entertaining this time this movie jumps to and from the past too much and once i made sense of it all i realized it still didn't make much sense characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye speaking of characters they are all your stereotypical favorites the greedy selfish lawyer the <UNK> actress the has been baseball star the video <UNK> the bitter girl the spooky quiet chick the <UNK> than <UNK> nice girl a <UNK> black cat and i didn't care about any of them perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work there were some decent scenes in it but overall this movie was a mess i should also mention a certain <UNK> <UNK> that would have been impossible to shoot br br this movie isn't the worst asian horror has to offer by far but it is still pretty bad if you just want to see some creepy images in the dark or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting or just want to yell you're stupid at a movie screen or just want to have another asian horror flick up your <UNK> when someone asks you how many you've seen this movie is for you br br those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere
<START> 1st watched 5 27 2009 4 out of 10 <UNK> harold young the 3rd universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer's perspective the story is similar and the results are ho hum this time the story's location is the u s as the egyptian <UNK> new <UNK> sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill <UNK> of those who opened the original tomb this time the mummy is played by <UNK> <UNK> which doesn't make much of a difference because he's really not asked to do much acting for this character the new priest becomes a <UNK> keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the <UNK> <UNK> juice again a girl gets in the way as the priest falls for one of the <UNK> fiancé and wants her yes to be immortal with him haven't we heard this before the plan is of course <UNK> as the <UNK> hunt down the mummy with <UNK> similar to the frankenstein monster and the burning of the creature ends the story how do they get a sequel i guess you'll find out with the next one in the series or not
<START> despite its stereotypes virtually <UNK> <UNK> cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright much better than i expected it to be i was skeptical at first the idea of a computer virus that can also <UNK> people seemed a little ludicrous to me but in the end i thought the film handled the concept well even if some scenes were a little clichéd br br the cast was quite good and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously i couldn't help thinking though that <UNK> turner is a bit of a <UNK> davis look a like maybe it's just her face or the make up hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept <UNK> at the back of my mind the whole time br br while it's not a <UNK> <UNK> or a great film by any standard <UNK> <UNK> is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end
<START> <UNK> from family ties goes from clean cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie the film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave using <UNK> to help out and while the plot is corny and cliche the <UNK> for example an evil green fog taking off a girl's clothes and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious and great and of course there's nothing like <UNK> <UNK> playing a preacher who's asking what happened to the love song definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh and while you're at it make it a double feature with <UNK> party massacre 2 there's an evil rocker as stated on the video box <UNK> killer in black leather w <UNK> a must see for cheesy movie fans
<START> creative use of modern and mystical elements 1956 <UNK> <UNK> to transport evil stepmother kathleen turner john <UNK> serial mom and the 2 twisted sisters queen <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> david warner evil in time <UNK> in <UNK> at court cinderella she's a babe <UNK> coal into an <UNK> <UNK> cinderella and her prince charming both look like and act like rock stars <UNK> of man locations
<START> kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film mainly through cinematography but also using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that <UNK> over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine <UNK> from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes of course it doesn't hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances i've ever seen a <UNK> authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be nice but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time <UNK> <UNK>
<START> carrie fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem and she doesn't remember very much of it that would explain why she made this film but it doesn't explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did i can't believe that everybody had a coke problem this has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made and that's saying something the blame can't be laid at the feet of director tim <UNK> or writer buddy <UNK> as it is obvious that this picture wasn't written or directed by anyone apparently it just <UNK> came together as there is little evidence of <UNK> <UNK> design plot sense intelligence or anything else what is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this <UNK> co star robert joy has done good work in other films and composer <UNK> <UNK> and cinematographer arthur marks are both industry veterans marks also having been a director and not a bad one why they got involved in this steaming pile of <UNK> is beyond <UNK> tim <UNK> the alleged director has made quite a few low rent sci fi and horror films and having seen most of them i can tell you that not a one of them is any good this one though is by far the worst thing he's ever done and that is a major accomplishment on his part everything absolutely everything about this movie is <UNK> rate at best the cinematography is terrible the acting is laughable the special effects make plan 9 from outer space look like spider man the story is trite derivative and stupid don't waste your time even looking at the video box cover let alone renting it a complete utter annoying total dud
<START> i had the misfortune of wasting 10 <UNK> buying ss new movie on dvd attack force now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this a <UNK> of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the <UNK> watching a <UNK> late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single <UNK> male like me i bought this film thinking i'd see cool martial arts and shoot em up br br did i hell segal is old and <UNK> the plot was ludicrous even by ss standards and to cap it all off <UNK> acting such as it was to start with is exceptionally dire so dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded nothing like him either ss cant act no more a <UNK> point of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they couldn't record the sound properly the voice would flick back and forth between mr <UNK> segal and the man who does voice overs for <UNK> <UNK> br br plot wise isn't the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one nothing new there the usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away br br avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a <UNK> train or a dose of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br utter garbage br br 1 10 br br this has been a public health warning
<START> the part where meg visits the mechanic and he says is the <UNK> firing short <UNK> poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée was hilarious i love meg ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie very lovable and very intelligent too her innocent <UNK> expressions have you wishing she was yours the hero handles the garage mechanic to <UNK> transformation well einstein had a romantic side to his psyche the puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well it's awfully underrated and deserves <UNK> and attempts at a revival it loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the us <UNK> i don't see why it doesn't figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century great movie it has the presidential seal of <UNK> on it
<START> well let me go say this because i love history and i know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and julia stiles became my 1 favorite actress after seeing her in the '60s and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history
<START> i sat through this movie expecting a thought provoking fact based film but instead was given some of the least thought out arguments against the christian faith imaginable for instance in an effort to prove that christianity is <UNK> violent the narrator constantly quotes the bible without giving context and thus <UNK> the meaning of the text jesus is <UNK> as commanding the execution of those who <UNK> him when in fact the quote is from a <UNK> jesus told involving a king who is then <UNK> thus the narrator makes it appear as if jesus says one thing when he is actually telling a story where one of his characters says it this is <UNK> in a very obvious form is this really what <UNK> has to offer the world this film also attempts to use the success of the passion of the christ over jesus christ superstar and the last temptation of the christ as evidence that christians are <UNK> he makes no mention of the fact that the passion was the most historically accurate bible film to date he makes no mention of the fact that it was actually the best liked by critics of the bunch he then edits in a series of violent images from the passion as if to hammer home his point ironically he makes no mention of the texas chainsaw massacre which came out a few months later and plays violence for entertainment versus dramatic effect br br one thing that really bothered me was his mockery of people who actually knew more about the subject matter than he did all the christians he interviewed were average <UNK> in the parking lot of billy <UNK> new york <UNK> <UNK> he interviewed for the film were notable authors and <UNK> he asked the christians how the christian movement started and of course they said it started with the holy spirit coming to the <UNK> at <UNK> which is correct acts 2 he then gives the commentary isn't it funny how so few christians seem to know the origins of their own faith and proceeds to explain that the <UNK> paul started christianity after being stopped on the road to <UNK> the poor <UNK> seems convinced that acts 9 happens before acts 2 more deception or is this simply ignorance he also throws around nonsense that paul didn't believe jesus was a real person are you kidding me 1 <UNK> 15 describes jesus death and <UNK> being witnessed by people whom paul names in the passage for the <UNK> to question if they are in doubt br br there are many many other examples of how full of crap this <UNK> is but because i don't have time or patience to go into them all i'll skip straight to the end it's obvious throughout the whole movie that the narrator has an emotional <UNK> against his upbringing in the church and the climax interview is his childhood principle in a last <UNK> attempt to <UNK> the christian faith the narrator tries to make a fool out of someone who gave him a <UNK> as a child is this what passes as an intellectual documentary for the <UNK> community surely there are intelligent <UNK> filmmakers out there who can make a documentary that isn't a load of made up crap passed off as <UNK>
<START> the movie is pretty funny and involving for about four dates then it becomes a blatant commercial for some guy you and even his friends really can't stand it is a pretty interesting concept film dates on a quest to find true love in modern la the problem is that it feels incredibly and badly scripted at times and blatantly self promoting it is difficult to care about and be drawn into any of the characters because the writer actor is so <UNK> <UNK> untrue and simply unlikeable you end up feeling sorry for his dates
<START> i recently watched the first guinea pig film the devil's experiment and i must admit to being disappointed br br this film is <UNK> included in any list of the <UNK> films and maybe i was expecting more because of the hype the truth is though i don't rate it br br if i'd been watching it believing the opening text to be true i found this tape i might have been a bit disturbed by it thinking it was real even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though i think i'd have worked out that it indeed wasn't br br throughout the film the girl's reactions to what is being done to her just aren't what they should be she should be screaming like a <UNK> in pain the fact that she isn't means that it's obviously not real i wouldn't want to watch it if it were real but if she were to be more convincing in her acting the film would be more disturbing br br and then there are the notorious scenes nothing affected me at all up until the <UNK> in the hand the hot oil <UNK> and <UNK> just didn't bother me i'm not saying i'm hard just that i wasn't able to suspend my disbelief partly because of the girl's <UNK> br br the <UNK> made me <UNK> a little but the hammer to the hand just made the hand look rubber and the final scene with the eye was again a little <UNK> but nothing more i didn't want to look away and neither did i feel <UNK> br br perhaps it's because the film is twenty odd years old or perhaps i'm just jaded the truth is i didn't find this film at all disturbing br br it's the kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a loop as a modern art <UNK> and as an exercise in <UNK> away characters story etc and just leaving the torture it works on some levels as a disturbing piece of film though it didn't work for me at least br br i watched guinea pig with my wife who is of the it's just a film bent and she wondered what all the fuss was about we got to discussing why i watch these films and my reasons are many but include a desire to be affected by a film she said that she didn't think any film could be so convincing as to <UNK> her and challenged me to do exactly that i played her the fire <UNK> scene from <UNK> and she was indeed disturbed br br i'm not sure i have a point other than that both of us were more disturbed by a scene in a non horror genre film than any film thus far which sets out to <UNK>
<START> some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it <UNK> too far from the shirley jackson story in it's attempts to be <UNK> and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for <UNK> special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the <UNK> of terror in the older version much more
<START> i watched this movie last night and was a bit disappointed a lot of the time facts were off at the beginning of the movie the grandfather made a comment to this <UNK> and his friends about how they felt when 9 11 hit this movie was supposed to be taking place in 1994 also one of the <UNK> friends was wearing an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jersey he hadn't even been <UNK> as of yet the story line was good but the facts and <UNK> of the time frame was so far off base that it made the movie seem cheesy my boyfriend is an avid reader of wwii books and <UNK> i rented this movie hoping that it would be good the acting was so so the dog was cute but the way that this movie was carried out made me glad that i only paid 4 dollars to rent it as opposed to the 50 it would have taken me to watch it in a theater i hope that who ever reads this understands that i mean no <UNK> to those who fought the war but the facts and time frame should have been a little more closely <UNK>
<START> first of all i would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch <UNK> story of the ghost ship that is also called the flying <UNK> in this film you will not see a single <UNK> boat you will not see sailors ghosts or anything remotely exciting it is not the story of the ghost ship and i wish they had <UNK> it in the main credits or i wouldn't have watched it because i really thought it was the film about the legend it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship since the film is listed on the <UNK> page for the flying <UNK> legend i don't understand why it is maybe based on the resembling legend called the wandering jew or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes unfortunately it is the only battle scene of the film then you see daniel <UNK> who was <UNK> in city of lost children for about two seconds and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting unfortunately he is very bad in the film the same thing can be said about italian actor <UNK> <UNK> who was one of <UNK> best actors ever and who here is condemned to <UNK> a crazy bird <UNK> with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the wise man of the film and boy does that film need <UNK> every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in <UNK> yelling torturing others in <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> or laying in <UNK> some more just for the fun of it it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in <UNK> at a point or another coming from a dutch director you might think that extreme <UNK> and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoeven's film flesh blood such a great film the thought of flesh blood would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight forward would be good unfortunately and unlike flesh blood there is no dramatic progression no fights no good acting and put simply no flesh and blood the photography as the opening sequence unfolds is well done and <UNK> this too stops very early in the film the music from <UNK> <UNK> of la <UNK> e <UNK> fame is repetitive and annoying when not irrelevant it sometimes implies that there is <UNK> in a sequence while on screen the actors are <UNK> in <UNK> dung throughout the first act of the film which lasts nothing less than an hour the film takes place within the same <UNK> which is around the farm where the main characters live the characters play with <UNK> a lot <UNK> in it play in it a long period of time <UNK> through numerous <UNK> to allows the main character a young boy who loves to play in <UNK> to become older and play in <UNK> some more the bird man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian spanish <UNK> speak french nothing makes sense everything is confused and takes hours to happen then there is a second act called the ship in which we see what might have been a ship a long time ago but which is now remains of a ship covered with <UNK> did i mention the main character while walking a bit further away from the farm just happens to run into it and decides it's really cool so let's live in it the <UNK> who lived in it before is trying to kill him but he doesn't really mind because did i mention he's not very bright he thinks the ship can <UNK> and hopes to <UNK> on it until more <UNK> show up at least they seemed to be <UNK> because of the don <UNK> style hats but as i've said it's really confused who's who make the <UNK> a prisoner along with the retarded <UNK> and they burn the ship to the ground the last part of the film which is really hard to bear for the <UNK> because it just consists of even more <UNK> with even more retarded middle age <UNK> fighting in it takes place in a mad asylum yet more torture and drowning each other with <UNK> yet more <UNK> for the director who seems to have definitely given up on his job or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job in the end a lot of the mentally challenged new friends that the <UNK> made die the woman he had sex with who was his brother's wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son the <UNK> and his son talk the film ends after two hours of <UNK> images and <UNK> acting and technical performances then the credits roll and the <UNK> <UNK> immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends while they are nothing but a mere <UNK> of how full of <UNK> some films can get when they don't have enough <UNK> powers to put battles instead or even horses
<START> in conception a splendid film investigating the tensions that occur in family life in the <UNK> setting of <UNK> island off the coast of british columbia the <UNK> <UNK> is marred by the fact that it has been <UNK> as a made for tv movie <UNK> itself throughout by the addition of <UNK> music over potentially powerful scenes as if to get ready for the <UNK> of commercials a pity really
<START> is this the movie is this what indians are trying to show i think this is one more effort from a sick minded director to turn down <UNK> soldiers and in fact country but what we <UNK> know that we are always ahead of india in every part of our lives not only in armed <UNK> br br well this is bad filmed as that of border in early 1997 and director and writer just tried to overcome a shame of defeat in <UNK> by <UNK> armed forces by creating films like these br br one thing is very clear whenever there will be an encounter between <UNK> and india we will win so mr <UNK> try to make some good movies instead of nonsense movies like this
<START> i read thru most of the comments posted here all i can say it that most of these posters have major problems in life this show unlike most game show was fun mr shatner whose <UNK> in all that he does was again the hit of the show he's genuinely <UNK> personality shines like a <UNK> where ever he goes he's fun makes you smile that's exactly what the show does also the dancers questions the round about fashion they're presented only add to the shows appeal and even though there's a great deal of money at stake it's fun the pressure stress that exists in most game shows does not exist here several people who posted messages complained how much time is <UNK> with the dancers choosing questions c like millionaire doesn't have similar time <UNK> all i can say is most of you have missed the whole concept the idea here is to have fun enjoy yourself there's something for everyone <UNK> to test your knowledge eye candy the dancers suspense mr <UNK> wonderful fun filled personality well if that doesn't <UNK> up guys up then i feel bad for you and if that's not enough you can get rich i really miss the show out of all the games shows that have ever been on to be quite frank i hate game shows this is the one i really liked truly miss the only other game show i ever liked was match game
<START> if you have any clue about jane <UNK> production <UNK> now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage marriage and marriage in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring but i like <UNK> characters because they all have a certain personality and typical <UNK> they like to repeat as also in emma the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow <UNK> very good in her leading role also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie <UNK> seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious
<START> ok i have watched the original french version but i can't imagine this being better with subtitles br br all i have to say that this is the most boring movie i have seen in a long time there are almost no redeeming qualities to this film that's why i can't understand all the positive reviews it might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left <UNK> br br i usually like slow paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie <UNK> <UNK> is extremely slow paced but it allows <UNK> and sets the mood of the film for example but in this case the movie is just <UNK> with mindless dialog that manage to tell us little about the characters none of which i could identify with or care for in a lot of the scenes i found myself thinking when are they going to shut up the acting was pretty bad not in an overacting obvious kind of way but it seems none of the actors cared about their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scenes this might be due to the uninspired dialog they were given also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical going from one scene to the next it seems this movie was just written badly but never directed br br this is one of the few films that i can say generated no emotional response from any of the scenes no suspense no fear no anticipation no sorrow no <UNK> no intellectual <UNK> no interest what so ever br br a perfect example of what i call an anti movie
<START> like most of the festivals entries <UNK> makes for an interesting watch a film thats all ideas and little execution although impressive for it's obvious low budget the film <UNK> in it's final twist and becomes dreadfully long during it's drawn out and obvious conclusion the film is about a family of murderous <UNK> trying to survive after there parents have died they kidnap people drain the blood from them and feed something locked away in their basement there's some nice darkly humorous performances from <UNK> and <UNK> and the rest are just so so the film never feels realistic or very disturbing for that matter but for the first half <UNK> into an oddly humorous and dark mixture which is a surprising accomplishment the next half isn't so successful as it <UNK> into film oblivion with unrealistic twists into a ridiculously cocky finale that turns the entire film into utter crap it's a shame though there is no doubt that some talent was involved with this production and although deeply flawed it remains original and creative too bad that when it comes to the delivery it completely fails on every level br br 5
<START> midnight cowboy is one of those films thats been <UNK> a masterpiece with good reason it really is one of the finest films ever made in america its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial no wonder it was a huge success when initially released but be warned its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made the characters are memorable well developed and ultimately tragic the filmmakers should be <UNK> for not giving us the hollywood ending something which was basically mandatory by the 80s still this is why i treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for american film its a time when well made innovative and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that hollywood could offer all this was over by the time star wars was released br br the direction by john <UNK> makes the material work it combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects midnight cowboy has aged quite well its still as powerful now as it was when initially released the acting however is what makes this a masterpiece the characters' backgrounds are never fully explained but the performances make them completely developed both jon voight and dustin hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic despite their sometimes <UNK> actions plus being a fan of vintage exploitation films i loved the scenes set on the <UNK> sleazy <UNK> street midnight cowboy is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made 10 10
<START> this has to be hands down hats off one of the most <UNK> comedies ever made starting with the animated blowing popping <UNK> the entrance to the daytime awards the usual phony drivel <UNK> by the stars on the red carpet the <UNK> and badly acted acceptance speech the <UNK> comments <UNK> by the actor's jealous co stars and producer under phony smiles now that is only in the first few minutes then all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous ridiculous in a good way no make that a great way this was the first time i'd seen the always charming <UNK> <UNK> while i may not be a <UNK> of desperate <UNK> she herself is always watchable same goes for lois clark not a huge <UNK> but if i run across an episode i'd watch it robert downey jr does a great turn as slimy smarmy <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> barnes the producer who'd give his right eye to see sally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> leave the show if only to finally get to get it on with cathy <UNK> montana <UNK> br br <UNK> absolutely shines in this movie just as she had everywhere else she's appeared here all she has to do is scream i hate you i hate you you creep or give one of her anti <UNK> co <UNK> an evil grin and she has me rolling in the <UNK> yes cathy <UNK> is a very gifted actress and one hell of a <UNK> sally field <UNK> <UNK> from the usual 70 <UNK> sized lifetime tragedy of the week movies and we're all reminded why she is who she is today having started off in comedy afraid of nothing her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor but like a <UNK> in a <UNK> the brilliant <UNK> she is had <UNK> and it was <UNK> to see her as hilarious as she was the thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy serious roles that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen br br how lucky were the producers to land carrie fisher if only for a <UNK> cameo she doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen she takes a role which in the hands of a lesser actress could easily have been forgotten but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself br br how lucky was <UNK> <UNK> to get thrown in the middle of all this at the time she wasn't really known for much adventures in <UNK> was kind of cute yes i was dragged to an evening show for which i had to pay full price but she didn't hold my attention much but here she makes the most of her character <UNK> niece who falls in love with the <UNK> ex co star and lover who of course turns out to be the <UNK> father and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother br br i'll stop there i feel i practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy or at least a <UNK> if you've seen it then <UNK> if you haven't you've missed a real classic but not really the dvd's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years and this movie is timeless so what the hell
<START> i love this movie but can't get what is in this movie <UNK> is not to like people who don't like this movie must be richard <UNK> and roger ebert but i can't believe that is mr carrey behind all that makeup and i am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie has made film before this and there is a new face in the movie taylor <UNK> who plays cindy lou who as the opens the grinch jim carrey comes out of hiding and causes some mean fun to the <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> we know that the <UNK> love christmas while the grinch does not like christmas and even makes fun of little cindy lou who taylor <UNK> who is the daughter of the town's <UNK> bill irwin the movie was directed by ron howard and the <UNK> voice is done by anthony hopkins and jeffrey <UNK> muppets from space is cast as the mayor of <UNK> who doesn't like talking about the grinch close to christmas time
<START> this night <UNK> is better than people are generally saying it has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this the whole thing feels like one of those <UNK> this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of <UNK> <UNK> so there are no flashy endings or earth shattering revelations no showdown scenes thank heaven you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your <UNK> and your expectations of what makes a <UNK> good movie williams isn't terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no one as he is the <UNK> the <UNK> by which we ourselves enter the story toni <UNK> performance should be nominated for an oscar even if she maybe shouldn't win it give it a shot for quality and content alone the night <UNK> is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days
<START> one of my favourite films it has everything <UNK> soundtrack courtesy of eddie clark ex <UNK> loads of action loads of laughs totally ridiculous plot and the most wonderful <UNK> stereotypes as characters eddie the put upon nice guy who just wants to be left alone to be different leslie about as wet as they come <UNK> the rock burn out <UNK> mom pathetic roger the geek and <UNK> as the preacher surely he exists in america then there are the boys rich vicious and stupid and the girls <UNK> vain and stupid what more could you ask for br br well first of all there's sammi <UNK> the rock star an <UNK> of every <UNK> <UNK> rocker you can think of what about that rocket firing guitar then there's the scene where sammi pulls the old lady through the tv screen and <UNK> her up and what does roger do why hoover her up just like a good geek would my favourite scene is where tim <UNK> gets his long <UNK> reward from sammi via the wet finger in the plug magic br br if you were into rock in the <UNK> or just love ridiculous films like i do then check this one out it's available on dvd and very cheap so trick or treat yourself
<START> this <UNK> <UNK> sci fi movie is most definitely a must see while it takes huge influence from the <UNK> candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise it's handled with the <UNK> skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive despite it being basically a re run of an earlier film it's good to know that films like this are still being made even if they aren't getting wide releases and cypher is refreshing for that reason the plot twists and turns which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of <UNK> mystery the plot follows morgan sullivan a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with <UNK> that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons to him unknown however his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita br br this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic <UNK> of the future this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type with it's only real close <UNK> being kubrick's a clockwork orange the plot is also very efficient and <UNK> character development in favour of the more stylish and more thrilling plot developing you never quite know where you are with the plot which serves in making it all the more intriguing the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars jeremy northam and lucy <UNK> northam very much looks the part of the quiet and <UNK> man at the centre of the tale and does well with his role lucy <UNK> is an actress that has a resume that doesn't quite fit her talent but she has a look about her that just fits this movie br br cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent but on the whole if you want an inventive recent sci fi film cypher is the way to go
<START> this a <UNK> awful movie it make so little sense that it starts to make a kind of weird internal logic of its own well it would if it didn't keep <UNK> off up side <UNK> until eventually <UNK> under the weight of its own <UNK> the movie can't make up its mind whether it is a straight forward <UNK> turns into <UNK> flick like all those 1950s 'the incredible insert <UNK> ing man' movies or a ghastly big business conspiracy theory movie or a mystical <UNK> contact story or or what take your pick it's just a mess <UNK> over the top and firing off in all directions leaving loose ends <UNK> all over the place it was as if tobe hooper had been taking david lynch <UNK> unfortunately he didn't take enough
<START> diane keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets diane keaton natalie the family stone <UNK> who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words can describe she always called her and told her surrender dorothy which was an expression used in the <UNK> of <UNK> 1939 a sudden car accident occurs and natalie gets herself deeply involved with her daughter's friends and lovers as natalie <UNK> the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter great film to view and enjoy especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors
<START> i voted excellent for how well the acting was not for the content it still gives me chills after reading the book then watching the movie two ex cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison during the ride the tension begins to <UNK> as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation after the killers are done with their work at the farm the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend the blood <UNK> scream as the scene pans onto the <UNK> with the cut <UNK> really made my blood run cold and gave me chills that the killers met their just <UNK> is a small comfort for this doomed family robert blake was excellent in his portrayal of perry smith the book was also excellently written by truman capote
<START> for that matter one of the worst films ever made plot goes as follows <UNK> through jungle looking areas for 10 minutes or so have bo go somewhere and strip <UNK> through the jungle some more give bo another excuse to strip back to the jungle oh look there's a tarzan looking guy strip bo strip kill the <UNK> people tarzan looking guy has a fight scene saves bo bo <UNK> run credits run credits run
<START> this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn't that great sure chaos and inside man are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense but i found chaos more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film <UNK> the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find a <UNK> in the u k and u s a br br it's true that this film makes lots of <UNK> to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films but that doesn't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch br br watch it if nothing else is on t v but you'll probably get bored with after awhile
<START> our song is a marvelous example of passionate movie making at its aesthetic best it is in fact a genuine wonder of a movie a <UNK> and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner city crown heights brooklyn girls during a particular summer in their lives when the <UNK> of their approaching <UNK> will <UNK> each of them to make a number of difficult life <UNK> choices that will likely re define who each of them is as well as how they will continue to relate to one another in years to come br br jim <UNK> writing direction is <UNK> and <UNK> there is no sappy gratuitous sentimentality nor are there cliché ridden <UNK> in this film what we see here seems at times to be heart <UNK> real there is a <UNK> a credibility if you will in our song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre including american <UNK> and <UNK> high br br much of the credit for the film's spirit goes to its principle actors the combined presence of <UNK> <UNK> maria <UNK> washington <UNK> and anna simpson <UNK> is <UNK> powerful it would be easy and of course blatantly <UNK> to dismiss as some apparently have the performances of these three as <UNK> or <UNK> in fact their quiet charm their <UNK> sense of dignity and their raw sometimes unconventional intelligence throughout the film are absolutely riveting one would have to be completely out of touch with or completely indifferent to the behavior of teenagers to miss the <UNK> authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen likewise the supporting cast particularly marlene <UNK> as <UNK> mother <UNK> the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film br br our song is a film not to be missed by anyone of any age
<START> as a long standing barbra fan any <UNK> like this will be biased that aside this film ranks as a classic it has it's flaws <UNK> in other <UNK> but gives a glimpse of a time late 70s that will never be there again and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen br br streisand fought hard to make this movie her own i don't think she was ever satisfied but it gives her fans a new barbra for the time with live singing a young fresh appearance and some very heavy duty acting br br the story is rough but exciting and holds your interest throughout the extended one frame finale is hard for most non barbra fans to sit through but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent br br
<START> horror movies can be a lot of fun with low budgets bad acting and a bit of <UNK> i think the film is just missing <UNK> because one <UNK> dull scene after another people make laughably harmless claw handed grabs at the air if it weren't so boring it might be funny br br a horror film can go a long way with a tired concept like college kids in a haunted house in much the same way the evil dead movies had a lot of fun with a similar standard <UNK> <UNK> end unfortunately doesn't go a long way actually it doesn't go anywhere it spends the better part of an hour setting up <UNK> and anonymous characters with what seem like endless <UNK> drama i have nothing against character development not even in a horror movie but these are strictly one dimensional characters the <UNK> male the <UNK> the um throwaway characters that exist mostly for sex scenes spending forty plus <UNK> <UNK> minutes with them was more horrific than when the bloodshed started br br well implied bloodshed anyway when the college kids turn into whatever they dressed as for their haunted house one's a vampire one's wearing o r <UNK> and some white <UNK> they look pretty much the way they did in their amateur haunted house costumes the dead hate the living using a similar theme is a <UNK> in comparison there isn't really any gore to speak of nor are there any real scares br br i've thought about this one from almost every approach if it was supposed to be a tight suspenseful horror movie which would explain why things moved so slowly the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would <UNK> it if it was supposed to be a genuine blood guts horror movie which would explain the schlock where's the blood and guts and the <UNK> is one of the <UNK> endings to a movie i've ever seen it's the kind of movie that though it doesn't have a narrator through the film is <UNK> by voice overs because all of the meaningless dialogue just wasn't enough br br this was a hard one coming out of it i wonder if i've just sat through a christian horror film maybe the i know hell exists of the opening wasn't meant that way but there are some hints or <UNK> i'm not sure which for all the profanity in the film a line like gosh <UNK> comes off a little absurd and so does most of the <UNK> <UNK> god <UNK> and satan <UNK> especially after some <UNK> t a sex scenes one <UNK> one lesbian br br if it a christian company <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even has a bit of a <UNK> resemblance then this film <UNK> in heavily for the <UNK> camp an <UNK> being can't be this bad a filmmaker br br
<START> what were they thinking at cannes one of the most irritating films of all time every detail of this film no matter how meaningless was shown if i had to watch her put on those boots one more time i think i would have <UNK> if the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life <UNK> had then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running but no we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over the whole thing was filled with un likeable and unsympathetic characters they deserved the misery that was <UNK> and to think i passed up <UNK> to see this over hyped film of boredom it was like watching grass grow only that is more exciting
<START> although i didn't like stanley <UNK> tremendously as a film i did admire the acting jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie i haven't always been a fan of <UNK> work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can't care for him anymore that will break your heart i wouldn't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment but i will say you won't see much bette acting anywhere
<START> okay the story makes no sense the characters lack any <UNK> the best dialogue is ad <UNK> about the low quality of movie the cinematography is dismal and only editing saves a bit of the <UNK> but sam <UNK> directed the film somehow his direction is not enough for those who appreciate <UNK> and his great work this movie is a disappointment even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort br br the proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director san <UNK> james <UNK> robert duvall burt young bo hopkins arthur hill and even gig young bring to their work watch the great <UNK> films skip this mess
<START> if you like deep purple you will enjoy in this excellent movie with stephen rea in main role the story is about the most famous rock group back there in 70s strange <UNK> and they decided to play together again but of course there is going to be lots of problem during theirs <UNK> jimmy nail and bill <UNK> are great and song the flame still burns is perfect you have to watch it
<START> this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage straight from lethal weapon gary busey <UNK> shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless <UNK> it can't help but <UNK> and entertain there are tanks <UNK> machine gun battles <UNK> and ice cream <UNK> and if they aren't good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one danny <UNK> and if you don't know who danny <UNK> is then you probably won't like this film
<START> jean harlow and clark gable were a great on screen team and this may be their best movie together br br yes hold your man can be cheesy and predictable but that's not what i love about the movie i love seeing harlow and gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful it is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes this such a wonderful film br br the witty dialogue great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this such a good movie i loved this movie the first time i saw it and on each subsequent viewing i always notice at least one new detail to me that is a mark of a great film br br the dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period early 30's i adore classic movies but i admit that most of them are just average and at times don't hold my interest hold your man is one of the exceptions br br this has a lot to do with the fact that hold your man is a <UNK> <UNK> movie the <UNK> code was not <UNK> until a year after hold your man this movie could not have been made under the code well it could have been made but it would have been an entirely different story thank goodness the code was not <UNK> until 1934 otherwise we would have missed out on this gem
<START> that word <UNK> in this film's title got my alarm <UNK> <UNK> they <UNK> <UNK> when a title card referred to america's civil war as the <UNK> between the <UNK> the <UNK> preferred by die hard <UNK> jesse james thief slave <UNK> and murderer is described as a quiet gentle farm boy br br how <UNK> is this movie there is no mention of slavery far less of the documented fact that jesse <UNK> poor <UNK> mother owned slaves before the war and that jesse and his brother frank <UNK> fought to <UNK> slavery according to this movie all those civil war soldiers were really fighting to decide whether <UNK> is a northern state or a southern state that's all <UNK> it's a candy <UNK> it's a breath <UNK> black people are entirely absent from this movie except for two glimpses of a pair of <UNK> one of whom wears a help the poor sign that's very <UNK> <UNK> instead of <UNK> some shots of 19th century <UNK> are inaccurate too with 20th century type <UNK> br br this film has a weird flashback structure there's some very impressive stunt riding and some fine work by stunt horses and one excellent montage i <UNK> one line of dialogue <UNK> of those boys will never taste <UNK> again ' the movie gets a few facts straight <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> mother <UNK> her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of <UNK> here called <UNK> in which jesse <UNK> real life mother suffered <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of her lower arm some errors here are <UNK> during his <UNK> days the real jesse james accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger but robert wagner in the title role here does not have a <UNK> i've seen a photo of jesse <UNK> real wife if she had looked half as glamorous as hope lange looks in this movie jesse james might have stayed home more br br there's plenty of <UNK> here and most of the male actors wear 1950s <UNK> but many of this movie's errors were <UNK> jesse <UNK> mentor william <UNK> is mentioned several times but all the actors <UNK> his name we see jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two <UNK> house where he will soon die after paying a rent of 18 actually jesse <UNK> last <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> street st joseph <UNK> was a simple one <UNK> <UNK> renting for 14 there was no upper <UNK> so when jesse james is killed his wife could not come running from upstairs as hope lange does here she was actually in the kitchen br br one continuity error robert wagner with no stunt double does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back but when he gets up the rope <UNK> his <UNK> has <UNK> br br the screenplay does some weird and unnecessary <UNK> of dates following the <UNK> robbery attempt jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday the actual <UNK> bank raid by the james gang 7 september <UNK> was two days after jesse <UNK> birthday maybe he meant next year's birthday later we see jesse and his wife moving into their st joseph home on a fine summer day while jesse tells her what he plans to do when christmas eve arrives but in real life mr and mrs jesse james moved into that house on 24 december <UNK> so this scene should be on christmas eve these errors were entirely <UNK> br br some of the <UNK> here don't make sense according to this movie the <UNK> bank raid failed because one fictional henchman was late in cutting the <UNK> <UNK> if this had actually happened it would indeed have <UNK> the james <UNK> <UNK> but it wouldn't have affected the robbery itself which failed for other reasons br br there are good performances here by jeffrey hunter as frank james <UNK> alan hale <UNK> as cole younger and by stage actress <UNK> <UNK> in a rare screen role i was disappointed by robert wagner normally an under rated actor elsewhere wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes villains and morally ambiguous characters here he can't seem to decide whether to depict jesse james as a <UNK> or a baddie so he doesn't much bother john carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional <UNK> preacher who <UNK> jesse and his wife at their wedding in fact jesse james was <UNK> in childhood by his uncle a <UNK> minister but perhaps this second <UNK> is a <UNK> up br br jesse james was no robin hood i doubt that robin hood was robin hood either but that's another story there is not one single documented instance of jesse james ever sharing his <UNK> with anyone beyond his own family after some of his hold ups he didn't even split the <UNK> with the rest of his gang in this movie jesse gets <UNK> down right after he <UNK> to give up his <UNK> ways forever in reality the night before his death jesse james and the ford brothers stole horses that jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the <UNK> city bank as <UNK> for most of his <UNK> jesse james stole horses from local <UNK> the same poor folk who in the inaccurate legends were supposedly the <UNK> of his <UNK> i <UNK> at one scene here in which the fictional jesse james is so <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that he <UNK> of an oil painting which <UNK> depicts <UNK> br br 'the true not much story of jesse <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> about a <UNK> murderer and likewise <UNK> about the civil war for the very impressive stunt work one good montage and a few fine acting turns i'll rate this <UNK> <UNK> movie 2 points out of 10
<START> although there's flying <UNK> as part of the title of this movie it has no connections to the original flying <UNK> 1975 and its sequel flying <UNK> ii 1978 the two originals are masterpieces of kung fu movie and still stands out as a classic this is a much inferior copy of the original and even as a regular kung fu movie it's below average br br first of all this movie doesn't have much acting it's one senseless fight scene after another and flying <UNK> doesn't even play a major part in them story is about some shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains who've took off with a sacred book and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot the same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying <UNK> on them br br there are four movies with flying <UNK> as part of its title this in my opinion is of least quality the design of the flying <UNK> in this movie is different from the other three <UNK> that this movie was produced by a different <UNK> from the other three br br the movie has no chemistry <UNK> from being unintentionally funny due to poor production br br best skip this and watch the two originals
<START> spoiler warning br br first of all i rated this movie 2 out of 10 br br the idea is good but there are too many stupid errors in the movie failing to make it the <UNK> drama that it might have been first of all she never fights alone after an initial very strange doubt from her mother which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie the rape victim is not alone br br she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the <UNK> strange traps br br her friends are unbelievably nasty br br the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his <UNK> ethan is very much the leader of the crew hey they even say so and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn't manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong everyone just simply hates him why the movie provides no explanation how did he ever become the leader br br a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in two actors from the same successful tv series a cheap way to get viewers
<START> ned <UNK> is such an important story to <UNK> but this movie is awful it's an australian story yet it seems like it was set in america also ned was an australian yet he has an irish accent it is the worst film i have seen in a long time
<START> <UNK> the budget and time constraints of serial production batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any cliffhanger list utterly lacking the style imagination and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor batman br br the producer sam <UNK> was known as king of the <UNK> and like his director spencer bennett seemed more concerned with speed and <UNK> than with <UNK> excitement unfortunately this team also produced the two superman serials starring kirk <UNK> with their tacky flying animation <UNK> music and dull supporting players the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come thoroughly inane titles robin <UNK> batman batman vs wizard mechanical music <UNK> on and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks <UNK> <UNK> with its devil's <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fits so poorly that the <UNK> has to <UNK> it during the fight scenes his <UNK> belt is a <UNK> strip of cloth with no <UNK> from which he still manages to pull a <UNK> and an <UNK> tube at critical moments br br in any case the lead players are miscast robert <UNK> displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman he creates the impression that he'd rather be somewhere anywhere else john <UNK> as robin has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue he is too old for the part with an even older <UNK> filling in for him out of costume <UNK> and <UNK> are as exciting as tired <UNK> <UNK> out for a drink without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas <UNK> in the 1943 serial br br although serials were not known for character development the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast this one offers a group going through the motions not that the filmmakers provide much support not one of the <UNK> stands out and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever the wizard great name actually they are led by someone sporting a curtain a <UNK> and a sack over his head with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing the prime suspects an eccentric professor a radio <UNK> are simply annoying br br even the established comic book <UNK> are superfluous it is hard to <UNK> much romance between <UNK> <UNK> and bruce wayne despite the <UNK> she faces <UNK> displays virtually no emotion <UNK> gordon is none too bright unlike in the previous serial alfred the butler is a mere walk on whose most important line is mr wayne's <UNK> they are props for a drawn out gimmick laden incoherent plot further <UNK> with uninspired repetitive music and amateurish production design the wayne <UNK> exterior resembles a suburban middle class home in any sitcom the interiors those of a cheap <UNK> motel the <UNK> is an office desperately in need of <UNK> the costumes are kept rolled up in a <UNK> <UNK> br br pity that the filmmakers couldn't <UNK> more effort into creating a thrilling adventure while the <UNK> of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious <UNK> one should not be fooled by the excellent <UNK> on the box they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of batman and robin combined br br now for the good news this is not the 1997 version
<START> when i first got my <UNK> when i was five or six i fell in love with it and my first game was super mario 64 and i loved it the graphics were great for it's time a good plot great <UNK> and above all the best music i heard in a <UNK> game br br i don't remember the plot completely but i think princess <UNK> was kidnapped by <UNK> and mario has to rescue her the object of the game is to get <UNK> stars from the <UNK> in the castle each had about five or six <UNK> to get the stars there are <UNK> parts of the castle where you can get more stars but of course you have beat <UNK> i think there are three levels to beat <UNK> on lets start with the characters mario is the main character and gets helpful advice from <UNK> so he is basically one of your only <UNK> i heard that <UNK> and <UNK> are in the game towards the end the main villain is <UNK> and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and <UNK> the characters are really great br br next how about the graphics people say <UNK> is more important then the graphics and i agree completely but with he great plot there are great graphics especially for it's time i have a whole bunch of other <UNK> games like <UNK> and their graphics don't compare to super mario bright colors great effects and awesome sound effects i found the graphics in the water <UNK> very very good next to the <UNK> world ones it has the best graphics in the game br br now the music this is my favorite part of the game growing up when i played this at a young age i'd gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep especially the music from jolly roger bay which was peaceful and wonderful there are others that are great too especially in once again the worlds with <UNK> are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites br br this game was my favorite past time as a developing <UNK> and i love it this game gets 10 10 or 5 5 go play the game
<START> the producers made a big mistake casting mark lester who couldn't act or sing in the title role aside from his very bad acting all of <UNK> singing had to be dubbed by a girl i don't know why they cast him at all since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well <UNK> <UNK> was far too old to play nancy who was only supposed to be 16 the current west end version is so much better than the movie in every way ross <UNK> is the best <UNK> <UNK> of all time and he is certainly far better looking than jack wild ever was it was clearly political to award this old fashioned musical so many oscars after the <UNK> events of 1968
<START> spoilers like other posters i felt that the ending was a bit abrupt i would have liked to have seen the crew <UNK> to life back on earth after their return i suppose the writers anticipated this problem by front <UNK> some voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode of course that time line has been <UNK> so it's all <UNK> i did like how <UNK> <UNK> died for the voyager crew as fans we get to have our cake and eat it to by having <UNK> both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on i admit that the scenes of <UNK> and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp fortunately <UNK> s pulled it off
<START> simple meaningful and delivers an emotional punch i regularly trail through dull short films and it's always nice to come across something that has a simple and <UNK> message without <UNK> or self indulgent directing br br a boy at school has to attend a lesson when his friend plays <UNK> and is given the most important lesson of his life only to find that when there are not enough copies to go around he has to share with the school bully br br unlike most short films featuring children or actors these kids hold their own and it's believable the soundtrack nicely <UNK> the emotion of the piece and the punchline of the film works well
<START> after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that <UNK> and formulaic but the u s propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves <UNK> that it's the work of humans call me a conspiracy <UNK> but quotes like we have to steal the <UNK> of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage <UNK> lines like i would never use the <UNK> of independence as a <UNK> chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took <UNK> before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and there's also a bonus side plot of <UNK> with dr whatever her name was being <UNK> by all involved for never <UNK> up she's clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point <UNK> character says don't you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking <UNK> down at her hands like she's a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy
<START> and it falls <UNK> into the category of <UNK> bad ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of i was at the sci fi movie festival and all i remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered other <UNK> will better describe this movie's <UNK> nature and i felt oh so bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up obviously to <UNK> the audience's reaction what he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience and after a serious anime movie i think it was sky blue the audience was in a <UNK> mood and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the <UNK> i will bullet point the worst parts br br script the funniest and worst part of this movie it <UNK> along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill thought out aside rubbish but <UNK> laughable br br animation poorly done and put together if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually <UNK> costumes for the heroine i know i can then watch out for the montage where she <UNK> from a swedish <UNK> girl into lady death br br characters so one dimensional its painful there is a brief <UNK> with side splitting lines of dialogue and little light is <UNK> on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters br br so in a nutshell if you've got a captive audience and a few <UNK> lying around try and make sure they're alcoholic to ease the pain then slip this movie into the dvd and get in a mystery science theatre 3000 mindset there is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it and its not meant to be a comedy do not watch this movie alone it could possible be even more boring to watch solo than new world with colin farrell as you won't be able to have a laugh at the <UNK> with a friend or two
<START> sam <UNK> excellent pick up on south street is the pick of the bunch from a number of early 50's cold war influenced low budget noir vehicles with a running length of under 80 minutes pick up on south street is tough gritty explosive and endlessly entertaining br br widmark stars as <UNK> skip mccoy who has already been picked up three times yet mccoy can't keep his wandering fingers out of trouble and trouble is exactly what he <UNK> into when he <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> candy jean peters <UNK> <UNK> contains a roll of <UNK> <UNK> to the communist movement and it's her last job for ex boyfriend richard <UNK> to make the delivery however when widmark lifts it peters must do whatever it takes to re claim the film she initially knows nothing about br br it's a tasty set up with <UNK> character while not the psycho of kiss of death a real live wire unpredictable and tough yet curiously charming when bogart or mitchum stepped into a film noir role you knew what you were going to get a lone anti hero maintaining his moral integrity and winning out in the end bogart or an overly <UNK> guy who allows himself to be drawn into a trap mitchum with widmark you just don't know what you are going to get and with his incredibly modern acting style his films always hold up well he is amazing to watch here he is torn between making a big score for himself by selling the film or <UNK> it over to the police and fighting the <UNK> on the right side of the law and he still has to pretend he never <UNK> peters to avoid the fatal fourth rap on his sheet br br peters gets her best role as the <UNK> with a heart of gold candy <UNK> <UNK> is perhaps best expressed in his scenes with peters the gorgeous tramp quickly and rather unbelievably the romance angle is rather rushed falls under <UNK> spell yet widmark <UNK> between kissing her or <UNK> her around peters hard edged beauty yet lack of over <UNK> hollywood <UNK> <UNK> turner would never have worked well in this role is a major asset to the film candy is not innocent yet she's very vulnerable constantly being passed between and slapped around by men widmark knocks her cold on first meeting and wakes her by <UNK> beer over her face yet by the final act he's a lot more tender to her after she cops one hell of a going over from <UNK> the scene in the hospital with peters and widmark shouldn't work but it does br br thelma ritter is brilliant as <UNK> moe well deserving of her oscar nomination <UNK> performance like everything else in the film is gritty real and <UNK> honest her death scene is stunning <UNK> camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting fuller loved a good close up and pick up on south street is full of uncomfortable <UNK> tight shots that only enhance the tension of the plot fuller isn't afraid to let the camera <UNK> on a shot for longer than standard old hollywood really allowed yet stunningly pulls away from <UNK> death scene to give the audience maximum impact the urban locales and unusual confronting camera angles give pick up on south street a bold <UNK> modern look br br 10 10
<START> an excellent family movie gives a lot to think on there's absolutely nothing wrong in this film everything is just perfect the script is great it's so real such things could happen in everyone's life and don't forget about acting it's just awesome just look at frankie and you'll know what i thought about this picture is a real can't miss
<START> yes it's over the top yes it's a bit clichéd and yes <UNK> marie is a total babe and worthy of seeing again and again the jokes and gags might get old and repetitive after a while but the show's still fun to watch since it's a family show the humour is toned down and the writers have <UNK> family values and ideals in between the gags br br george lopez is funny don't take him seriously and the show's a winner i'm sure he didn't intend his character to be serious or a <UNK> of virtue his <UNK> and shouts of glee are hilarious br br i do have to say that the one big dark bitter spot is benny i hate the character so much so that anytime she's on for more than 30 seconds i mute the tv just so i don't have to hear her there is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes as a mother she has to be the worst out there and i am just shocked and surprised that george as the character would stand by such a <UNK> person for so long br br even so anytime i get <UNK> off at seeing benny i think to myself seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the bill <UNK> show now there's a bad sitcom
<START> i rented this film thinking it was the <UNK> sad 1959 version i saw as a kid it was not i was therefore very disappointed with what i felt was <UNK> acting poor character development and most of all failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog in this version the dog of <UNK> is just a cute aside to the movie get the 1959 version
<START> as the film begins a narrator warns us the screaming skull is so terrifying you might die of fright and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed well i don't think any one has died of fright from seeing this film but a few may have died of boredom the screaming skull is the sort of movie that makes ed wood look good br br very loosely based on the famous francis marion crawford story skull is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances once <UNK> in his home she is tormented by a half wit <UNK> a badly executed portrait <UNK> and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot and to her credit actress peggy <UNK> screams rather well br br unfortunately her ability to do so is the high point of the film the plot is pretty transparent to say the least and while the cast is actually okay the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired you'll be ready to run screaming yourself true the thing only runs about sixty eight minutes but it all feels a lot longer add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you are br br there are films that are so bad they are fun to watch it is true that the screaming skull has a few <UNK> but the film drags so much i couldn't work up more than an occasional giggle and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from <UNK> if it weren't for peggy <UNK> way with a scream this would be the <UNK> cure for insomnia give it a miss br br <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> i have to agree with everyone else that has posted br br i watched it quite a while ago but i'll tell you whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling i got when watching it and it does make me cry such a happy yet sad feeling i do however find that the love story in it felt <UNK> rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience br br i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research and watch the ending a few more times and i found all my answers and a whole lot more i love how they <UNK> historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more i've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime br br i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely i'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characters some mysterious and a bit of fantasy action br br also even though this was based on a h game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way i have no problem with mature anime in most cases i prefer it
<START> brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature particularly the nature of addiction which still <UNK> strongly today br br as for the movie eh nothing special the cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> around everything making the viewer quite <UNK> why the director didn't put a stop to this is beyond me but maybe he was too busy trying and somehow failing to draw good performances from these normally excellent but <UNK> cast actors all in all a weak adaptation your three hours would be better spent reading or re reading the book
<START> just <UNK> this i don't want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than i ever could but i did want to say a few things br br i didn't know which was funnier redgrave chasing tiny <UNK> and <UNK> over her nurse close <UNK> that her precious boy whom she and the mr had decided was a drunken loser has been turned into <UNK> that the tone deaf ann <UNK> with peggy lee or the horrid cgi of crypt keeper annie <UNK> at her younger self br br i never bought danes as the younger redgrave i didn't buy richardson and collette as sisters either if meryl <UNK> daughter wants to be an actress she better get mama to give her a few lessons i had zero idea why any girl or buddy would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du <UNK> harris <UNK> daughters are as whiny and <UNK> as she luc is a retarded <UNK> on crack and i didn't give a <UNK> about any of them evening gives chick flicks a bad name
<START> one word boring br br the young <UNK> looks good but she's pregnant point for that d the movie is not scary at all br br the first scenes looked little crappy i could render better clouds with my <UNK> and after effects but that was then and now is now some movies do not get old well this is one of them br br not worth renting or buying get something better instead like the exorcist br br next d br br oh the drama part in the beginning just and simply <UNK> d
<START> i generally don't give worry much about violence in films or a vast amount of philosophy symbolism or psychology all this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us there is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature a good setting of characters a good direction this film could be voted for as a good film however it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting br br first of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film not movie violence i am talking about real violence this violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two the message of the film was not mere <UNK> about the directors twisted relation towards women not that we all don't have some real twists with women respectively men but the conclusion of the film ruins it all br br spoiler our heroine finally dies by here own hand if i remember correctly i saw this film years ago and it <UNK> me now the guy is out with a new film witch i am certainly not going to watch and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon nature growing over her in particular her sex of course it is the director who kills the women heroine women have to die especially if men are attracted by their sexuality that seems to be the final conclusion end spoiler br br well well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself but to use big pictures artsy directions cruelty to living creatures just to say men can be frightened of women and men are cruel to women thats just not enough i knew when i saw this film it would achieve good critics for the philosophical eastern and artistic and whatever approach but to me this film is just totally marred
<START> this movie provided nothing new or worthwhile after seeing it my wife and i both agreed that the studio simply <UNK> this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining this is a good example of a concept only film they have a concept about a film and the other details are <UNK> because <UNK> know it will make just based on the initial concept br br the movie starts with cruella getting out of prison and going on <UNK> she no longer hates <UNK> but has been <UNK> to adore them she simply couldn't hurt a flea this doesn't last too long after her release and she's back to her old ways period br br the most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters eric <UNK> as the voice of <UNK> the bird made me hate him and that is tough considering i am a die hard python fan it was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money there can't be any other reason <UNK> low self <UNK> servant tim <UNK> was funny in the black <UNK> shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny and it must have cost a few bucks to get <UNK> depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well there were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were i am trying to block them out of my mind br br overall you'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel
<START> i love movies i love independent efforts and major studio productions i love films with stars and i love those featuring <UNK> i love dramas comedies action adventures science fiction mysteries westerns any genre except horror i love foreign films as well as those in english i love good movies and i even love bad ones because almost no film ever fails to entertain or <UNK> on some level except for even <UNK> get the blues br br when i attended a late night showing of <UNK> i joined an audience of around 10 less than halfway into it i alone remained soon not even i could tolerate the disturbing mess unfolding before my eyes and i left as well to this day <UNK> remains the only movie i have ever walked out of br br i don't quite know how to describe this incoherent vacuous trashy meaningless film or how to adequately convey its lack of redeeming value suffice to say that it ranks as one of the worst major films of all time preposterous and <UNK> on every level it tries to be clever but its conception of <UNK> seems hopelessly <UNK> it tries to be funny but its humor is coarse and cringe worthy this is one of the few films which manages to <UNK> its own <UNK> by depicting protagonists in so off putting a manner that you revolt against them and their values if you want to watch a movie watch <UNK> <UNK> anything but this except for the new alexander if you're choosing between that and this read a book instead
<START> the <UNK> was uh interesting it certainly didn't kill me during its hour and a half duration but it didn't impress me much either a group of kids are <UNK> in an alley by <UNK> mutants in a scene featuring <UNK> least convincing head <UNK> sound effect and taken to a fancy house in the <UNK> here dr divine and his team are performing brain <UNK> for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again hey this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as <UNK> who knew that when you transplant an old person's brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice with all this talk of <UNK> <UNK> and the use of a glowing green serum you can almost see visions of from beyond and re animator dancing in the <UNK> heads but the production literally doesn't have the guts to pull it off i've never understood why when someone is making a low budget horror film that they don't pack it to the edge of the frame with gore the acting is uniformly terrible with the only good performance coming from clarke <UNK> as the assistant dr price he has a nice evil laugh the only other thing of note about the <UNK> is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts seriously most of the cast takes some serious <UNK> for old folks
<START> historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war new orleans starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin this is not just a story about the exploitation of black women because these were free people they may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their <UNK> than their slave <UNK> the young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives whether to give into the <UNK> of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community i enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were <UNK> anna <UNK> and marcel
<START> dark angel rocks the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off me and my friends have <UNK> to watch every da episode takes like 4 days but it is worth it it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that <UNK> the hell out of me
<START> doris day never lets a bad script get her down even in the most trying of circumstances day gives 100 and usually comes out <UNK> this comedy perhaps inspired by a real life new york city black out in 1965 but actually adapted from a late <UNK> french play by claude <UNK> gives doris little to do but spoof her own <UNK> <UNK> image and in the second half be <UNK> <UNK> which is amusing because of the spin day gives to the situation there are some funny lines here yet the <UNK> of the material has obviously been carried over from the play and instead of <UNK> up some amusing incidents within the big apple we get stuck in the <UNK> <UNK> co stars patrick <UNK> robert morse and terry thomas are not well suited to her and neither is the <UNK> <UNK> they've got her wearing still it's not terrible it features a few big laughs and for day buffs it's a must see from
<START> i had no idea what this film was about or even knew that it existed until about 1 month ago when i stumbled upon when i was searching for other films that <UNK> dominic <UNK> i thought this film was a strange insight into the mind of a none sleeper and what his her mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the world around them is asleep it was an interesting film and a good part was played by dom i believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere well i've never seen it anywhere you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance
<START> a stunning film of high quality br br apparently based on true events which as told has the clear ring of truth about it this movie is highly emotional and deeply moving br br an abused and neglected child often becomes <UNK> in <UNK> as one of life's failures be it as a gangster drug addict or burden on society br br antwone fisher as a young adult in the navy is troubled he is on the brink of being a loser he is <UNK> in therapy by a psychiatrist and it is that relationship which takes center stage in the play br br in flash backs and therapy the source and <UNK> to <UNK> angst are revealed br br outstanding performances from the whole cast the story is in effect a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment all the actors give full blooded performances with conviction and realism br br one message from the movie is the importance of raising children <UNK> br br the real antwone deserves success to have endured <UNK> as a child but to rise above that shows a magnificent character br br and to all those out there who have endured such torment but to have survived and succeeded you are all winners 10 out of 10
<START> in theory films should be a form of entertainment while this <UNK> documentaries and other experimental forms of film making most movies specially genre films must not only tell it's story or message they must entertain their target audience in some way all this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values or low budget a bad movie is one that is boring br br <UNK> or asylum of the damned as is known in the u s is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving and <UNK> boring and tiresome while it has a very good premise it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting doesn't make things better on another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic b movie but here it is just a bad attempt at film making br br director philip j jones tells the tale of james bishop matt <UNK> a young <UNK> resident who just got his dream job at st andrew mental hospital but the old asylum seems to hide a secret after the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices james decides to find out what is going on only to find the <UNK> of his boss dr <UNK> bruce payne who believes that bishop is going as insane as his patients br br while the premise is quite interesting the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired in an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every cliché of the genre of course there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clichés but in <UNK> every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving resulting in a boring and predictable storyline br br the acting is quite mediocre for the most part with one big exception bruce payne gives a top notch performance that makes the movie look <UNK> of such good acting matt <UNK> is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances br br despite all this flaws one thing has to be written about <UNK> it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big budget <UNK> horror productions also the make up and <UNK> are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good sadly the rest of the special effects are awful and outdated making a huge contrast with the make up <UNK> br br <UNK> is a movie with a few good things <UNK> by its serious flaws with terrible results hardcore horror or b movie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience 3 10
<START> a romance without feeling a drama of issues without point or drama this film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account as if it isn't trying or as if the director editor scriptwriter team isn't really trying the actors are able they need better support br br one element that doesn't fail is the score by george <UNK> beautiful and moving what a shame it's attached to this film in a good film actors' words and movements and music <UNK> and enhance the impact this editor <UNK> on music with no regard for dialogue and movement the love scene is particularly grating in this respect an insult to the talents of the lead actors br br there is another element in the film that works location photography notably one moment in grand central station i'd guessed in advance what was going to happen but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking br br some <UNK> on this board have pointed out that us <UNK> of criminal nazi scientists actually happened during these years of the <UNK> scare the moment the film seems to start looking seriously at american society it switches into conventional romance before any human feelings can move us it's away on a predictable <UNK> <UNK> br br just as the film insults the talents of the actors it insults the issues it's pretends and fails to take up br br you are warned
<START> i feel the movie did not portray smith historically the goal of this movie was to tell smith's life in a way that would be comfortable to the lds church leaders historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern the movie was designed to be a faith promoting experience not a balanced view of smith as a man i have taken it upon myself to study smith's life and have read both lds works and none lds works the movie like most lds projects was beautifully filmed and well acted however this was not a realistic portrayal of either the <UNK> of <UNK> or smith's relatively short life br br a significant period of time was given to <UNK> an accident that smith had when he was seven while this event was no doubt important in <UNK> his mental <UNK> it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of joseph smith another point is in portraying smith's teen years the film is silent regarding the smith family's involvement in magical practices during the <UNK> another problem is while the movie shows joseph smith good <UNK> entering into wrestling <UNK> it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent br br i could go on and on this movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man i would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment
<START> <UNK> <UNK> jr gave us the book <UNK> for a dream and co wrote the screenplay to <UNK> movie of it that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate and <UNK> portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the <UNK> that destroyed them last exit to brooklyn still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives but it hardly does them the same justice <UNK> did br br the film seems laughably anti gay at times especially when in the film homosexuality equals death one gay character gets stoned is launched <UNK> by a <UNK> car and lands dead on the <UNK> another is <UNK> and still more are simply beat up another exaggerated piece of shock value that might actually have been compelling if it were done well are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike <UNK> who'd have thought a drama about <UNK> would feature action sequences and truck explosions br br the director <UNK> <UNK> has a skill level like that of a tv director but he is far below the cut for real movies the film is clunky that can't even seem to settle on a genre lake is given a useless role that any <UNK> could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally <UNK> part and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead a <UNK> hooker named <UNK> believe it or not i'm not joking her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is and also takes the real edge off the more provocative bits a failure
<START> as an actor i really like independent films but this one is amateur at best br br the boys go to <UNK> for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree were the directors aware that palm trees are not in <UNK> <UNK> yes <UNK> no and the same for the wedding service again nice <UNK> of palm trees br br when the boys are leaving <UNK> they apparently could not get a ticket on any major <UNK> since the plane that is filmed is federal express did they ship themselves overnight in a <UNK> come on guys little details like this separate an <UNK> film from totally amateur br br the christian brother is far <UNK> than arthur with his <UNK> hair and <UNK> band <UNK> the two should have switched roles br br the minor characters are laughable and <UNK> something terrible br br applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time
<START> this is your only spoiler warning what a sad state of our cinema when <UNK> junk like this is considered oscar worthy br br i <UNK> material into three levels the first is the stage theatre here the viewer is <UNK> and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and most importantly in the power of the writer a good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better the best <UNK> know how to create imagery that the <UNK> stage cannot show br br the second level is film in this medium a weaker writer can be used but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time with film the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing furthermore film can manipulate <UNK> elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal br br the final level is literature in this context everything is imagined by the author translated onto paper and then re imagined by the reader far more detail can go into a novel than is <UNK> for a film studio br br this is why adaptations can go up but never down <UNK> are never better than the base film see the dime per dozen ones at your local book store whereas the film cannot convey the same power as the original book catch 22 and lotr movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies br br as for 'the last picture <UNK> it fails it is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right the characters talk the same and act the same it's pure <UNK> add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film br br i saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> about how sad the movie was what is sad is how such <UNK> work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious had this been in color the scenes of <UNK> the pool party and the old hooker would be considered great comedy look what lucas did with <UNK> <UNK> a few years later br br the american secondary education system needs to start teaching about film rather than trying to teach with film two visually powerful downbeat films apocalypse now and barry <UNK> rely on them not this it's the <UNK> i want to see of it 1 out of 5
<START> dennis hopper and <UNK> walsh steal the show here cage and boyle are fine but what gives this neo noir its juice is <UNK> creepy violent character and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br a drifter gets mistaken for a hit man and tries to make a little <UNK> out of it but gets in over his head br br i found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when cage walks into a trailer in <UNK> to get <UNK> work with the help of his buddy and the opening scene in <UNK> mountain when the character does the same thing but that's another story br br dennis hopper is at his best here cocky one step ahead villainous <UNK> and <UNK> violent <UNK> walsh rip is also great as the man with a dark past trying to live <UNK> well almost br br there are only 4 real characters of note here with the exception of the hard working deputy in the town of red rock <UNK> the first twist hits early on and from there it's a nice neo noir adventure in some sleepy little town satisfying 8 <UNK>
<START> first let's get the <UNK> out of the way hedy <UNK> was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen here we have hedy as a young fresh faced 20 year old speaking in her native <UNK> i recently bought a 1990 <UNK> version of this 1932 3 classic yes we see a brief close up of hedy bare from the <UNK> up but although she filmed the swimming runaway horse scenes naked the director <UNK> <UNK> uses the cover of <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene so don't go imagining there are any <UNK> close ups or <UNK> her boyfriend pierre <UNK> keeps his clothes on at all times yes fairly daring for its day but how <UNK> it looks now through 2003 eyes br br as other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> statements it makes with pictures of drops of water <UNK> a <UNK> on the surface of a pale of water farm <UNK> landscapes etc sweet sounding strings run for most of <UNK> length and the film has a feel of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept the script is highly <UNK> and <UNK> the story being mainly <UNK> through the medium of facial and <UNK> gestures with just a few words of german spoken by the actors with english subtitles beneath even these few words seem almost <UNK> in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film br br put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man why we are never told and what did eva see in him anyway money who is then trapped in an <UNK> and <UNK> marriage she then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law after a ride on her horse eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her <UNK> <UNK> however her horse gets romantic notions itself and <UNK> off to <UNK> its <UNK> hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her <UNK> but an engineer at work sees and <UNK> the horse then looks around for its owner and so the romance is born her husband seeing that his rival must win eva later decides to shoot himself but i thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous <UNK> relationship with eva br br despite being a 1990 <UNK> title on vhs the sound being 70 years old is a bit soft and with background <UNK> in line with films of its age after a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with eva he <UNK> her as a mother with an <UNK> so we have to assume they live happily ever after just let the <UNK> wash over you and <UNK> your mind of the style of films even of late 1930's vintage this is a lyrical piece that can be <UNK> for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title i gave it 7 10
<START> i liked this movie very much although this movie doesn't <UNK> of big or even known names its very charming its one of those feel good types where you know that <UNK> gonna be just fine in the end my favorite scene is with the baby elephant part i rate this movie at 7 5
<START> i saw this picture in 1940 for 11 and i would like to secure a dvd in 2006 the film was the greatest adventure of the time and like all epics is still an entertainment marvel b w and all you get a sense of real <UNK> friendship in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of sam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are outstanding this could not be done today i particularly liked the ending where the colonel <UNK> the end of <UNK> poem over the body of gunga din and tells the <UNK> you're a better man than i am gunga din they don't make movies of this character today the only cast member that is still alive today is joan fontaine
<START> just a dumb old movie first <UNK> son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way in an effort to save him stanwyck gets unlucky yet again and comes across an escaped convict she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way in the end her husband is saved and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is <UNK> well than ends dumb br br i could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in hollywood's <UNK> oriented golden era that nose is so <UNK> so <UNK> the film is mercifully short running a little over an hour it's as though the director <UNK> that he was making crap so he thought it best to keep the crap short
<START> ok so the musical pieces were poorly written and generally poorly sung though walken and <UNK> particularly walken sounded pretty good and so they <UNK> the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his <UNK> sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of <UNK> in boots when they by rights shouldn't have even known about it br br who cares it's christopher <UNK> walken doing a movie based on a fairy tale and he sings and dances his acting style fits the role very well as the <UNK> mischievous <UNK> who seems to get his master into deeper and deeper trouble but in fact has a plan he's thought about seven or eight moves in advance and if you've ever seen walken in any of his villainous roles you know the ogre bit the dust hard at the end when walken got him into his trap br br a fun film and a must see for anyone who enjoys the unique style of christopher walken
<START> it's rare that i sit down in front of the tv specifically to watch a particular programme it's even <UNK> when i actually enjoy the programme in the end but last of the blonde <UNK> was one of the best movies i think i've seen br br a remarkable cast led by dame <UNK> <UNK> and ian <UNK> and an excellent witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience i can't really express how good i thought it was so i won't try i'll just say if you get the opportunity please see it i only hope it comes out on video
<START> if the lion king is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge his father's death the lion king 1 and a half is the total opposite full of <UNK> and cheer the lion king told the story from the side of <UNK> the young lion 1 and a half is from the view of <UNK> and pumbaa a less than perfect duo made up of a <UNK> who left home because he could not dig <UNK> without <UNK> his friends and neighbors and a <UNK> who has an <UNK> issue the movie is a little short on substance but disney does a good job of filling time with various sketches starring <UNK> and pumbaa as they watch the movie with us my favorite is the sing along that happens halfway through the movie make sure you watch the <UNK> bug disney has advertised 1 and a half as the rest of the story though it really isn't it is just a different perspective of the lion king without all of the serious stuff that <UNK> most of the second half of the original disney classic credit nathan lane as <UNK> and ernie <UNK> as pumbaa for their voice work without their efforts the movie may not have worked the sing they entertain and they make us laugh they also give us a reason to avoid a hot <UNK> with a <UNK>
<START> rko studios decided to borrow both william powell from mgm and jean arthur from columbia for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of the thin man they succeeded to some degree br br a lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than nick charles bill powell also played in a few philo vance films in the title role so by this time he was pretty well set in the role doctor <UNK> is not doing as many <UNK> <UNK> as nick charles but the basic <UNK> nick is still there one difference is that while nick charles married an <UNK> doctor <UNK> works for a living as a <UNK> that helps in his <UNK> of detective and in fact it does in this film br br he's got two murders to solve a <UNK> falls off a horse coming into the <UNK> of a big race and dies for no apparent reason the <UNK> suspects something <UNK> but he's <UNK> off by the more conventional method of a bullet this is after he comes to bill powell for help br br myrna loy was a more <UNK> influence on bill powell than jean arthur was arthur plays it as more of a <UNK> dame than loy did but it works here and she and powell have good chemistry br br the ever <UNK> james <UNK> is the police inspector in the sam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> role all they needed here was <UNK> and possibly eric <UNK> as <UNK> butler was <UNK> that part br br if powell and arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of <UNK> films
<START> the running man is often <UNK> as being just another arnie action thriller full of explosions bad <UNK> and <UNK> and to be fair there is a lot of that in it people used to look at it and compare it to the terminator series saying it was one of the <UNK> <UNK> films br br but give it 18 years and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light rather than just being another brainless action film it works very well as a parody of reality tv it is quite different to the stephen king book true but i doubt whether hollywood with its love of upbeat endings and so called <UNK> <UNK> who turned out to have the skills of a trained <UNK> would have accepted it in its current form br br but on with the review br br ben richards arnold <UNK> is a cop working in a <UNK> united states where democracy is a thing of the past and the entire country is ruled by a government media <UNK> <UNK> the economy is in <UNK> food is <UNK> and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic <UNK> for them to watch like jumping for dollars where people jump for money over a pit of <UNK> dogs and the most popular one is the running man a <UNK> <UNK> by the slimy <UNK> <UNK> played by the entertaining richard dawson where supposed <UNK> are hunted down by theatrical pro <UNK> esquire <UNK> br br some however try and speak up against the government when a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of <UNK> california a helicopter <UNK> by richards is sent to <UNK> i e kill the protest when richards refuses to fire on innocent people he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd he is sentenced to a slave <UNK> camp but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader <UNK> <UNK> and goes on the run br br however his freedom does not last long and after he kidnaps network employee <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in an attempt to escape those pursuing him he finds himself taken prisoner again but this time he is forced to appear on the running man br br and there of course the entire film kicks into standard arnie mode richards is launched into the post apocalyptic <UNK> of los angeles why is la always destroyed in these <UNK> worlds and forced to run from the <UNK> along with two other prisoners who escaped from the <UNK> camp with him <UNK> also becomes curious about <UNK> <UNK> of innocence and discovers he was framed guess what happens to her then so as <UNK> richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the <UNK> we soon become aware that richards is no ordinary cop he's super arnie the <UNK> one man army who can collapse evil corporate <UNK> and fight <UNK> men covered in christmas lights all while being just your average american guy with an <UNK> accent br br yes the remainder of the film becomes dumb loud classic 80's arnie fun there's a lot of exciting fight sequences the trademark dreadful <UNK> <UNK> had to <UNK> being my favourite and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending it's a lot of fun watching <UNK> react to it in the typical <UNK> <UNK> host way as well and some of the funniest moments in the show <UNK> around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly <UNK> host watch out for the <UNK> old lady and the cold <UNK> man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings br br if you expect a high brow intelligent film you'll be disappointed but if you want a great 80s flick well this is it but the great thing about this film is it was quite <UNK> br br if you look at the entertainment we have today you'll have noticed the way reality tv is going nowadays shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame and producers all too willing to let them <UNK> themselves on tv it's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile tv <UNK> out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on tv we've already had that however with the <UNK> al <UNK> hostage <UNK> videos posted on the internet it seems that in the current climate at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets br br with that in mind and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s you have to be impressed by the far <UNK> of this film of course we haven't reached there yet as it's terrorists rather than the mainstream media who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death but you just have to wonder how long it is before some <UNK> decides to see if he can find a way of <UNK> a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to <UNK> their morbid curiosity
<START> it's <UNK> the mind how this movie was nominated for seven oscars and won one not because it's abysmal or because given the collective <UNK> of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated <UNK> honor disappoints some would argue that old hollywood <UNK> john huston had lost it by this point in his career but i don't buy it only the previous year he signed the superb under the <UNK> a dark character study set in mexico that ranks among the finest he ever did <UNK> honor on the other hand a film loaded with star power good intentions and a decent script proves to be a major letdown br br the overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hit man <UNK> the quirky <UNK> that caught hollywood by storm in the early 90's but the script is too convoluted for its own sake the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly it's trying to be a romantic comedy a crime drama a gangster saga etc jack nicholson doing a brooklyn accent that works perfectly for de niro but sounds unconvincing coming from jack and kathleen turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode just going through the motions almost <UNK> their way through some parts <UNK> huston on the other hand <UNK> better but her performance is <UNK> by her character's motivations she starts out the victim of her <UNK> father's disdain she proves to be supportive to her ex husband then becomes a <UNK> bitch that wants his head on a plate br br the colours of the movie have a washed up quality like it was made in the early 70's and <UNK> direction is as uninteresting as everything else there's promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it could've been <UNK> to something better but what's left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making
<START> it's a refreshing breath of air when a movie actually gives you a story line with a beginning a middle and a end a nice clever mystery with an appealing heroine for all ages who wins us over with her wit and charm andrew <UNK> film is indeed a modern marvel a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in hollywood he puts away the over <UNK> on special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a terrific film with a very capable young actress and a talented supporting cast br br the film is based on the old books but it has been given updated enough to put in this century however the props might be different the heart still is a good mystery and there is clever one here one that ties the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth emma roberts is an old fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others details that are sorely missing from today's films she is still good enough to get <UNK> <UNK> but she also knows how present <UNK> and self respect she earns her <UNK> by working hard and is not afraid to show a little <UNK> when it is needed to achieve her goals br br while taking a vacation to california our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play suddenly she is visited by her ghost and this sets off a series of events that might solve the mystery or result in something dreadful for herself what makes the movie quite entertaining is the little details as she discovers that her <UNK> world is nothing compared to the california scene and this is well presented without <UNK> to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or overtly sexual eventually the director has enough control to make it all very <UNK> to all types of audiences from the young ones to the adults in the audience it is a movie that deserves to be seen appreciated and enjoyed a film that is rare and delicate and it's not afraid to be classified as fun five stars
<START> ben masters <UNK> thomas dream lover <UNK> plays a sort of mike hammer character a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy <UNK> of good looking <UNK> <UNK> makes one big mistake when he stops morgan <UNK> laura cassidy eva <UNK> arizona summer '73 from getting beaten up and raped <UNK> takes laura home to his pad and when he wakes up she is out on his <UNK> eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home by the way <UNK> sleep in his bed and laura slept on the couch for this particular scene laura is mixed up with all kinds of <UNK> and there are some hot scenes between <UNK> and laura all said and done this is a lousy picture and i purchased the dvd for only 1 50 and i really got ripped off
<START> and it's not because since her days on <UNK> explains it all that i've had a bit of a crush on melissa joan hart who at the time this show was popular was already well into her <UNK> but was still able to get teenage roles sabrina the teenage witch was <UNK> next big leap after her <UNK> days based on the comic strip sabrina <UNK> is you guessed it a teenage witch who attempts to balance her witchcraft antics with the demands of everyday teenage life she is aided in her <UNK> by her two aunts and a wise cracking black cat as she goes from high school to college and finally to her career in <UNK> br br as usual hart is the show's heart soul sabrina the teenage witch is quite moving and very funny and it's a shame that it took me so long to realize how great it was i only wish there were some newer episodes that we could all enjoy br br 10 10
<START> le <UNK> the tenant is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made polanski stars as a <UNK> a <UNK> file clerk living in paris who answers an <UNK> for an apartment only to find that the previous tenant attempted suicide by <UNK> from the apartment window <UNK> is compelled to visit her in the hospital and there he meets stella isabelle <UNK> <UNK> immediately moves in when the previous tenant dies and at first is quite pleased with having found such a nice apartment his happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his <UNK> who seem to be trying to <UNK> <UNK> into repeating the previous <UNK> suicide this film is great polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of dread and paranoia plenty of brilliant moments such as the classic scene where <UNK> discovers the previous <UNK> tooth in a hole in the wall or the fever dream where he wanders into the <UNK> bathroom to find the walls covered with <UNK> the photography by <UNK> <UNK> is truly beautiful the tenant is a neglected gem it may be difficult to track down but it is more than worth the effort
<START> in a lot of his films citizen kane <UNK> report touch of evil orson welles gave him the role of an <UNK> men in the lady from shanghai it's the only time i see him holding the role of the victim the role of the <UNK> he gave it to rita hayworth i guess it's because he was in love with her therefore it's an interesting film but i find the story excellent too the direction is genius as usual with welles two scenes are particularly brilliant the one in the <UNK> and the final one with the mirrors this film is brilliant 10 10
<START> the plot sounded like it had promise to be honest i did not watch the entire movie after about an hour into the movie i had to make a decision is this movie worth watching until it conclusion the answer was clearly no it was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without <UNK> it nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human wolf transplant it was because the movie was badly written acting lacked emotion and i did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and <UNK> when he was running to the <UNK> with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the <UNK> gate the saying if you can't run with the big dogs don't leave the <UNK> kept running through my bored mind save yourself the time and skip this movie i can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack <UNK> as i did wondering why anyone waste money time energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to american cinema
<START> i haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time i got to go to an advance screening and was thrilled because i had been dying to see it i had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie the audience all shared my laughter and was <UNK> and yelling throughout most of the movie br br kudos to steve <UNK> who i had already been a fan of he proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy he has a style that i haven't seen before and catherine <UNK> is excellent as always thank god there wasn't a cameo from will ferrell love him but saw him too much this summer br br there were parts of comedic genius in this movie partly thanks to <UNK> and partly thanks to the writing also <UNK> the <UNK> scene and the speed <UNK> with the obvious problem were absolutely hysterical br br i will definitely go see <UNK> year old <UNK> when it's released my advice go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it
<START> i confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies and while i sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror but when it comes to comedies they really need to be crazy to be funny <UNK> her dead <UNK> seems to take <UNK> a little bit too seriously and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect i can think about the story is completely unbelievable of course and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register the choice of the principal actresses was awful while paul rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as eva longoria seems too aged sorry for him and lake bell seems too unattractive sorry again a romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start jason <UNK> and lindsey sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles the rest is uninteresting and uninspired with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from <UNK> tv comedies nothing really worth watching nothing to remember
<START> french director jean <UNK> isn't exactly known for great films and this confusing mess is one of the reasons why one of the most confusing things about this production is the title for a director who is well known for directing erotic films about lesbian vampires you would expect a film with the word <UNK> in the title to be a particularly bare <UNK> one but in fact there's not a lot of nudity here at all instead of erotic lesbian vampires with no clothes on we've got a <UNK> plot about a man who wants to <UNK> the secret to <UNK> a young woman whose <UNK> might hold the key and a suicide cult who don't get to do much the film starts off <UNK> with a sequence that sees a young girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks under the <UNK> eye of a young french man who also happens to be the son of a man of importance through his investigation he soon discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady and as he <UNK> deeper into the cult he discovers that cannot be killed by bullets drinks blood and can't go out in daylight sounds like a clear cut case of <UNK> to me br br jean <UNK> keeps the fantasy atmosphere going throughout the film but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so badly executed it is possible to keep up with what's going on but only because there's so many other films that follow similar plots to this one the director seems to know that he's messed up the plotting too as the climax is basically an excuse to explain the film to the audience there is a twist thrown in at the end also but the film would have been better without it i guess this was jean <UNK> attempt to be a little original but it comes off as a ham <UNK> attempt at such rather than a logical <UNK> of the story the cinematography is fairly neat with lots of the plot taking place in suitably gothic locations the girls on board complete what is a pretty picture and what <UNK> film lacks in logic and <UNK> it somewhat makes up for in style in the film's <UNK> it was made in 1969 which somewhat explains the lack of shocks but i can't recommend this movie as it doesn't have much about it that is worth taking note of
<START> more a <UNK> of the most popular <UNK> of all time than your typical dragged out biopic this fun and fabulous film has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indie type film i think the tendency would be to portray bettie page as some sort of sex <UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> but if you've truly looked carefully at <UNK> poses she always looked happy not a you wish you could get with me <UNK> look nor the i'm just doing this because my acting career didn't work out look of a porn star and so the ladies involved with this film three female producers a female writer director female co writer and the lovely gretchen mol who i'm sure helped shape this role with her own <UNK> influence really captured the idea of a sweet somewhat naive southern girl who really enjoyed having her photo taken and hoped that good ol' <UNK> wouldn't be too upset with her br br gretchen mol turns out a career high performance she may just have the most perfect breasts ever which i am happy about because she did have the curse several years ago she made the cover of vanity fair when no one really knew who she was <UNK> her as the next it girl and let's be frank that was a bit <UNK> i mean unfortunately she has never made it to gwyneth status though not for lack of talent making a few poor film choices when you are a pretty blonde in <UNK> hollywood <UNK> you forgettable i'm afraid if this doesn't put her back on the a list well i'll be a <UNK> uncle br br intensely private bettie herself has not seen the film yet bettie left the <UNK> party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame jesus whatever <UNK> your boat honey you were one <UNK> woman i hope you're happy wherever you are br br <UNK> mary harron you've done our cult idol justice
<START> i wasn't expecting to be so <UNK> by this film portraying a family just like the one you'd expect to be living next door they are ordinary flesh and blood people not like the typical hollywood fare they face an all too common problem <UNK> illness but the story line grips the heart with a powerful lesson casting script direction and acting flow together with a <UNK> that draws the viewer deep into the story give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire
<START> i've seen a slew of 80s rocker horrors over the years from rubbish like terror on tour to ridiculously fun gems like <UNK> party massacre 2 somehow i managed to keep putting this one off which is strange because it's probably the most popular and well received one well i finally caught up with it and it's easily the best of this mostly awful but almost always endearing <UNK> the plot which was pretty much lifted in the film black <UNK> concerns a <UNK> <UNK> named eddie whose <UNK> by all in his high school for his taste in music he loves 80s metal especially his idol sammi <UNK> played by the late great tony fields after sammi is killed eddie favorite radio dj gives him <UNK> final recording once eddie plays the record backwards he discovers he's a bit <UNK> and bad things start happening to those who <UNK> him is <UNK> music possessed trick or treat is well made and a total hoot the special effects are awesome even though it does feature the typical 80s laser <UNK> i grew up in the 80s and while i wasn't a fan of heavy metal i do remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards hearing the sounds of satan <UNK> haha i also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both kiss and <UNK> <UNK> satan so it's very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio dj and a anti rock priest if only i had seen this film as a kid while the film seems to poke fun at the popular connection in the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal the viewer never really finds out why sammi <UNK> is back from the dead creating havoc and killing whoever gets in his way this is movie's weakest point but if you can overlook that it's loads of fun
<START> bette <UNK> cockney accent in this film is absolutely appalling i totally understand that americans and other <UNK> <UNK> realise this and that's fine but believe me it's about half as good as dick van <UNK> cockney accent in mary <UNK> and that was a right load of old <UNK> slipped into london <UNK> there many apologies br br the remarkable thing to me is that the strange accents and exaggerated acting styles don't detract from the <UNK> power of human bondage is a fascinating piece of cinema despite its superficial faults it also has to be viewed in perspective the technical and cultural limitations of film making at the time have to be appreciated and given those limitations john <UNK> does a very good job directing the camera and allowing the narrative to develop <UNK> rather than solely via the mannered acting and stilted dialogue a fine example of his <UNK> direction is the scene set at victoria station it is beautifully conceived shot and edited note too the stark shots of the <UNK> mildred towards the end of the film they owe more to the early days of artistic film making than the <UNK> formulaic world of the studio that was about to dominate br br the themes of the film are universally familiar and compelling ones sexual obsession <UNK> love <UNK> passion self loathing manipulative relationships social <UNK> and youthful <UNK> though the dialogue is often rather hackneyed the difficult task of portraying these themes and the inner lives of the characters is <UNK> well albeit in a low key way some of the scenes of obsession and emotional <UNK> are uncomfortable to watch but the story doesn't <UNK> into cliché we're aware that the characters even the <UNK> mildred are both victims and <UNK> and that their actions are motivated by their <UNK> of each others feelings as well as by <UNK> <UNK> whilst naive in style the story reaches to the complex heart of the human condition and the mannered nature of the acting and the occasionally grating <UNK> don't <UNK> the <UNK> of the work br br of human bondage was one of the films that got bette davis noticed in hollywood and whilst watching it you are conscious of being witness at the birth of a celebrated career her unconventional beauty and screen charisma no one <UNK> or did disdain quite like ms davis grab your attention from her first appearance whilst hers is definitely the memorable performance in the film leslie howard is also excellent as the sensitive and fragile student philip carey they are a good combination though why oh why didn't he help her with that terrible terrible accent
<START> who loves the sun works its way through some <UNK> subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging but often hilarious it's been a while since i've found such a thoroughly touching thoroughly enjoyable film br br the film is gorgeous drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and <UNK> landscapes the peaceful imagery <UNK> wonderfully with the tension between the very human very flawed and yet very likable characters due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic br br i recommend who loves the sun it's a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can <UNK> on each other and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness
<START> an absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book crude and inappropriate humor some scary parts and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book 3 8 <UNK> olds don't waste your money your time or your good judgement
<START> do you like really inventive comedy or do you love the wedding <UNK> if the answer is the latter stop reading now i can't believe this movie is not higher rated basically meadows plays a character not unlike austin powers there are so many inventive moments in this <UNK> from <UNK> leon playing with himself on the <UNK> the ex boyfriend tricked into eating oh well to inspired <UNK> clown sex the broadway routine the voice over meadows is great as the childish but very sweet natured leon some great lines don't blame the wang freaky <UNK> sex world too many why this movie wasn't huge is a mystery great comedy
<START> <UNK> really moved me with its deeply drawn characters while being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers it was not simply about hate or jealousy what i liked most about the movie was how i could identify with the feelings <UNK> was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into to see this character who <UNK> so hard between his artistic dream and his <UNK> sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave and as in real life most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children i could even identify with <UNK> the brother who while being the more self assured and elder brother had so many <UNK> a really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry
<START> there's a lot going on in the college girl murders a mad scientist creates an almost <UNK> <UNK> gas before he can <UNK> the <UNK> of his discovery the scientist is killed by a <UNK> whip <UNK> monk after a co ed is killed in a church by the gas scotland yard is called in to investigate but the killing continues who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he <UNK> in and out of the college br br what works br br the killer what's not to like about a killer who <UNK> around wearing a vivid red <UNK> looking outfit complete with red <UNK> the white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red <UNK> although the idea of a killer in a <UNK> red <UNK> head outfit <UNK> around a girl's school is fairly far fetched it's one of the more sinister looking costumes i've seen br br <UNK> 60s music i really would like to track down the title music to the college girl murders it's got a <UNK> hip 60s feel to it that i just loved br br bizarre touches beyond the killer's red <UNK> and hood the movie features a <UNK> <UNK> a pit of <UNK> with a cage <UNK> <UNK> poison <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> placed <UNK> mini <UNK> go go boots and mile high hair i would describe it as a cross between the 60s batman tv show and an italian giallo the college girl murders is a real treat for the eye br br the end let's just say that there are more twists than a mountain road just when you think the killer has been <UNK> here comes a <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> another br br what doesn't work br br chief inspector sir john i know the guy was meant to be comic relief but his <UNK> character has way too much screen time br br why have <UNK> previously i mentioned the <UNK> in the pit and while they are a nice touch they serve very little purpose why go through all the trouble and not use them br br plodding plot some of the college girl murders has no flow or rhythm to it there are far too many moments throughout the movie when things come inexplicably to a <UNK> halt better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable movie br br i haven't seen many of these german <UNK> but of the few i have seen phantom of <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> castle dead eyes of london this may be my favorite this one has a real funky feel to it that i really go into had the plot <UNK> a little better i could have easily given the college girl murders a 7 10
<START> this movie kind of reminds me of a mary kate and ashley movie only worse just the rich sisters kind of thing i think even though <UNK> more the actress in this movie amanda <UNK> was okay sometimes but <UNK> acting <UNK> i think that after high school musical they needed to come up with <UNK> better and this definitely wasn't it the story line wasn't that great and i think they should have gotten two other people to play taylor and <UNK> i'm not a big <UNK> <UNK> fan and this movie didn't make me like her any better i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do which sadly i didn't
<START> spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse and native americans the film focuses on the friendships and <UNK> that a wild horse spirit encounters during his life br br very well done in the presentation using the technology available today to deliver stunning visuals that are breathtaking in their depth and realism br br the music is fantastic with songs by bryan adams and music by hans <UNK> who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 disney hit the lion king br br the story is not very deep but the fact that it isn't quite as in depth as some movies doesn't in my opinion detract from the film as a whole br br an excellent film which i enjoyed immensely and that is suitable for all the family not one to be missed 10 10
<START> lost 24 <UNK> desperate <UNK> the list goes on and on these and a bunch of other high quality shows proves that we're in the middle of a golden age in television history lost is pure genius incredible layers of personal and psychologically <UNK> stories <UNK> by sublime cinematography incredible to use this word when describing a tv show a killer score great performances and editing anyone who isn't hooked on this are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever it may have its problems when watching only one episode a week but the dvd format is actually an incredible way to watch this hope they keep it up as i'm sure they do
<START> well because i'm a musician i thought maybe i'll check this movie out on <UNK> nothing else good on one of the worst mistakes of my life so far and it's only half done i seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting crappy filming and crappy effects but nope i don't even get the pleasure of that even the musicians weren't very good i was hoping for maybe some laughs but i wasn't sure if they were attempting to throw in one liners or not but now i have to sit here and watch the rest just until pulp fiction starts or maybe something better and now i get to sit here <UNK> until i have 10 lines
<START> a young basketball playing professor of <UNK> is doing research on the genetic sequence using human <UNK> he hopes to be able to find a cure for all <UNK> and aging he's <UNK> into <UNK> his research because he hasn't published so the university is having trouble <UNK> funding him i think br br he does a trial <UNK> on a monkey which quickly dies he then tries it on himself he starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy she's the one who had been demanding results from the research br br initially he seems to have no effects from the <UNK> except some new strength he then realizes that he had some memory loss and starts <UNK> what happened additionally he starts to appear very <UNK> br br since the movie is named <UNK> he does eventually change into something else you won't believe your eyes either what he turned into or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he's turned into incredibly there's a further change in store the end of the movie is really really absurd br br about the only thing this movie has going for it is that laura <UNK> is in it but she has a very small part br br i'd once seen a the video box for this with a <UNK> plastic form glued to the <UNK> possibly it might even have had some <UNK> in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie the copy i watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the <UNK> had held on the plastic which had been removed the novelty <UNK> if it still had it would have been the only reason i would have held onto this movie i'm definitely getting rid of it
<START> a young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an <UNK> on himself so he won't turn out like his father all the stock characters are in place the nice couple the funny guy the tough but sensitive hood the smart girl she wears glasses that's how we know the nerd and two no personality <UNK> it all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life don't ask and kills people i knew i was in trouble when after a great opening scene we jump to 20 years later all bad horror movies do that br br the dialogue is atrocious the acting is bad except for <UNK> <UNK> why <UNK> and the killings are stupid and or unimaginative my favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he's fully dressed a real bad stupid incoherent horror film avoid at all costs
<START> i love jack's jokes like 'the cliché is ' or over the top cliché guy black <UNK> skin kinda spooky he is just hilarious <UNK> starting to catch up on him to good thing jack's not on the team anymore in a way or else it would have been sarcasm <UNK> i just love all the plots season 8 a little less i have to admit the characters are great the actors are great i'm starting to pick up facial expressions and more from jack daniel and <UNK> it just all <UNK> possible and exciting <UNK> their i go again sorry i'm also starting to pick up traits from carter and all of this is driving my parents <UNK> well to conclude i think it's good for another three seasons or so especially if they keep on <UNK> the episodes with all this humor drama action and so forth
<START> this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen i'm still not sure if it was serious or just a satire one of those movies that uses every stupid who <UNK> cliché they can think of <UNK> br br don johnson was pretty good in it actually but otherwise it sucked it was over 10 years ago that i saw it but it still hurts and won't stop lingering in my brain br br the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is i won't ruin it for you should you want to <UNK> fate by viewing this movie but i <UNK> you a <UNK> moment at the end with a few in between if you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh then maybe it might be worth your while additionally if you're forced to go on a date with someone you really don't like suggest watching this movie together and they'll probably leave you alone after they see it that's a fair price to pay i guess
<START> why a good actress like elizabeth <UNK> stars in this <UNK> movie the cast gives some good performance elizabeth <UNK> as a <UNK> girl <UNK> <UNK> as a girl without mother and justin <UNK> a guy <UNK> <UNK> by his bother but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original i can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen julie corman the producer are you crazy
<START> this film is pretty poor the acting is abysmal and completely forced furthermore by shooting the film as a <UNK> doesn't necessarily make it more believable you can't get out of it that easily mr <UNK> don't let my comments <UNK> you however as i would recommend you watch this film as it does shed some light on the psychology or non existent psychology behind the <UNK> of such crimes however the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish there is no other way to put it it pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere what takes place does not translate to me any feelings of desperation panic fear or dread that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances no instead it leaves you with jaw dropping was that it <UNK> from your tongue and by no means are you haunted by these boys actions rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film that started with potential but ended up falling flat on its face at the most crucial point zero day indeed <UNK>
<START> i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason <UNK> <UNK> constant <UNK> on experiment many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused <UNK> <UNK> of overacting yet as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being <UNK> done jason <UNK> is obviously not <UNK> <UNK> and his overacting is exactly that br br most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors minus <UNK> and the <UNK> if you watch this movie you would have noticed <UNK> shouting almost every line that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke <UNK> out his nose br br the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one in <UNK> there isn't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie
<START> franco proves once again that he is the prince of surreal erotic cinema true much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with <UNK> <UNK> he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his <UNK> creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious <UNK> <UNK> in his work jerry van <UNK> splendid score <UNK> as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a <UNK> artist <UNK> who may be <UNK> or may indeed as one mysterious character states be a devil attempt to come to terms with the world she <UNK> a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema
<START> spielberg's first dramatic film is no let down it's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an african american woman it also proves that not all movies that have the african american <UNK> as the center of the story have to be <UNK> by an african american director br br what i love about this movie is spielberg's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book furthermore danny glover was excellent as mr and usually he's just himself throughout most of his movies but in this he completely <UNK> out and is someone else for once but the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from whoopi goldberg she is excellent as <UNK> you will never forget these characters once you've seen this movie br br now i heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well and all i can say is i hope it's about as good as this one is because this one is a film that shouldn't be missed
<START> i firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons br br 1 host steve martin was at his most <UNK> i saw the <UNK> help michael moore into the <UNK> of his <UNK> and i'll better not mention the gay mafia in case i wake up with a <UNK> head in my bed br br 2 surprise winners no one had <UNK> <UNK> down for best actor genuine applause or roman polanski for best director genuine <UNK> and <UNK> but they won br br last year's award ceremony wasn't too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and i was happy to see return of the king <UNK> the awards even if it wasn't the best in the trilogy <UNK> was much better but what let the bbc coverage down was jonathan ross getting a few of his <UNK> mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but so when i heard sky were doing the coverage for british tv i was expecting barry norman and mark <UNK> to be doing the <UNK> but instead we ended up with jamie <UNK> and sharon <UNK> oh <UNK> if british tv are desperate for film critics obviously they are i'm sure both bob the <UNK> and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers br br chris rock wasn't too bad but he's no steve martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in not much of a <UNK> <UNK> in my opinion the main problem i had with the ceremony was the format with the minor oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats there's no such thing as a minor oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design they're as well deserved as best picture or best director all the winners should be allowed to march up to the <UNK> what a bunch of arrogant <UNK> the academy are becoming and i quite agree with the comments that this format is <UNK> and if it wasn't for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history as for the awards themselves br br best supporting actress <UNK> <UNK> no great surprise for a <UNK> category br br best supporting actor morgan freeman no real complaints since freeman is one of america's greatest living character actors br br best actor jamie foxx most predictable award of the night yawn br br best actress <UNK> <UNK> major surprise since everyone thought <UNK> <UNK> was going to win simply down to academy politics but <UNK> did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night br br best director clint eastwood major surprise since everyone thought scorsese was going to get the award simply because he'd never won one actually i'm glad about this because if he didn't deserve it for taxi driver raging bull or <UNK> he didn't deserve it for the <UNK> br br best film million dollar baby again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while i thought the hollywood friendly plot of the <UNK> would have made it a dead <UNK> for best picture while <UNK> controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off br br what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven't done in the past i mean a beautiful mind beating the <UNK> of the ring for <UNK> sake and long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts
<START> this is a really fun movie one of those you can sit and <UNK> watch as the plot gets more and more twisted more and more funny sally field <UNK> <UNK> in her hey day kevin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> robert downey jr it's all these well known quality actors acting as if they are soap opera stars producers if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought how on earth did they come up with this idea you will love this movie i have seen it multiple times and each time i watch it the more i appreciate the humor the more i realize just how well acted it really is don't expect oscar quality this is a fun movie to entertain not some artsy attempt at finding man's inner man etc sit back relax and laugh
<START> it just seems to run true to form any movie starring dolph lundgren is bad i don't know if it is the fact that the storyline in full of holes or that dolph is such a bad actor no spoiler here he seems to <UNK> the pushing and <UNK> and grabbing and touching thing in this movie in my opinion it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to get in the can and to the theatre
<START> it's this one very cool premise right off the bat br br has an excellent first scene gotta give credit where <UNK> due br br has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me whenever the ghosts appeared which i really liked by the way how it was done how it looked the only thing was the <UNK> relationship because of the way things went down in the first scene you'd think their dynamic would be different br br things <UNK> down a little too much in the middle i felt and the <UNK> spider scene was just not good but then the ending is actually very good sure 'the <UNK> basically told the same story with a polished lens but no <UNK> and that's what i liked about this movie <UNK> br br please someone one with a <UNK> style remake this movie br br fans of <UNK> <UNK> would absolutely love this movie
<START> how amazing this film is i've seen it over and over throughout the years and i'm always <UNK> by it the reason why the film is so easy to re watch is of course the <UNK> performance given by the young bette davis she not only steals every scene that she's in but is actually much <UNK> and better photographed here not to mention <UNK> than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio warner brothers this film was made by r k o radio pictures she wears a very <UNK> make up and has very attractive <UNK> and oh those lovely big eyes especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in <UNK> <UNK> her body was so <UNK> when she was young get a load of it in the cheap <UNK> that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with leslie howard and oh boy she is an absolute <UNK> in that scene howard is a little too nervous throughout but he does captures the hero's sensitivity frances dee scores as the sweet pretty young sally who truly loves him max <UNK> score is both charming and poignant splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel
<START> this game was really great and quite a challenge it has a great spooky story line and the graphics are also very good i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me br br a truly great game for <UNK> and <UNK> fans br br
<START> this movie is so bad you almost feel <UNK> by it actually there is a strong sense of relief when it's over relief that you can now put the <UNK> back in the <UNK> and rush this back to the video rental store before it <UNK> the rest of your video collection i <UNK> suggested when we rented it that it looked like the kind of film where william hurt would phone in his performance i meant that he would not be trying very hard but lo and behold in a huge number of scenes in this film bill hurt is actually on the phone our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess the cinematography and editing are murky and <UNK> the story is chaotic and the soundtrack is barely <UNK> there is a very slight resemblance to falling down but that film had a <UNK> disturbing story line great writing and acting and an engaging soundtrack <UNK> man is just some kind of broken down old european tourist trap and watching it is like driving along some unfamiliar back road in an unknown country where you don't speak the language in a steady rain just after <UNK> as the <UNK> keeps <UNK> up you get the picture don't get this one
<START> what a dreadful film this is the only reason you would want to sit through this mess is the <UNK> sight of miss <UNK> the painful overacting of mr <UNK> which became embarrassing at times ruined what might have been a reasonable film if the correct actors had been cast mr <UNK> is no tom cruise the actor he obviously wants to be
<START> i think this show is <UNK> funny it's not for every taste and i'm not going to elevate or <UNK> the folks that don't get it i'm sure they're wonderful bright people that operate at a different <UNK> but if you like it you really like it sarah plays a self <UNK> loser named sarah silverman who often finds her self in <UNK> <UNK> that's <UNK> as in <UNK> <UNK> br br i remember sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the early 90's i liked her immediately then and i go out of my way to check out anything she's done br br this show is choke on your food and wet your pants funny therefore i always fast before watching it and wear adult <UNK> check it out
<START> home room really surprised me in comparison to other movies that were written regarding <UNK> high school this one is the best home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town the movie <UNK> on two opposite characters <UNK> busy phillips and deanna erika christensen <UNK> is an <UNK> who witnessed the entire shooting she seems to show no emotion about it deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim <UNK> is forced to visit deanna at the hospital in order to graduate meanwhile the police are investigating <UNK> as she might have known the shooting was going to happen <UNK> and deanna are very different and do not get along at first eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends very much in the style of the breakfast club home room beautifully shows the power of <UNK> and turmoil after a school shooting i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone
<START> in cold blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the hollywood film industry capote <UNK> the phrase <UNK> novel to describe the book on which this film is based and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script which he co wrote despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film richard brooks elected to present this film in black and white to <UNK> both the <UNK> of the landscape and the <UNK> of the story this is the first problem with the tv remake color changes the tone of the story in addition the <UNK> of shooting a film for tv makes <UNK> the <UNK> of how the shots are framed and focused as a result we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film police interviews trial <UNK> and execution so claustrophobic on the small screen it's just another version of law and order spin offs br br hollywood's search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age usually that's a mistake and this is no exception br br all of the actors are competent the script is ok the directing doesn't get in the way it's just that the movie doesn't work as well as the original <UNK> <UNK> it doesn't hook the viewer into the <UNK> toward smith and <UNK> that the original film <UNK> at the end of the tv version we are left with the feeling ho hum who cares br br see the original first on as large a screen as you can then watch the tv version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967 br br wouldn't hurt to also go on line and read a bit about capote and the original book it will help you to understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material and also some of the controversy surrounding both the book and the movie br br i actually only gave this a 4 because i save the bottom 3 <UNK> for true bombs the kind that <UNK> you about having been sucked into spending an
<START> as a collector of movie <UNK> i had to buy the movie poster for this film which now that i've finally seen it has to be the best thing about it there's nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a <UNK> inch image of the melting man however there's nothing more awful to put in your vcr than an hour and a half long image of the melting man at first i thought this movie was pure garbage but then i realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh the character of dr ted nelson has to be the most <UNK> <UNK> persona ever brought to the big screen his dialogue is so trite it's unbelievable it's incredible he seems to be getting stronger as he <UNK> br br and could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time steve has left before he <UNK> completely and exactly what their plan is to help him if this movie was meant to scare its audience i think it missed its calling
<START> this film offers absolutely no imagination in it's premise nor in it's execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so called comedy that has no energy to speak of story is about <UNK> <UNK> over <UNK> insurance risk manager <UNK> <UNK> ben stiller who finds his new wife lisa debra messing cheating on him with a <UNK> <UNK> hank <UNK> after only one day on their honeymoon upon returning home <UNK> and his best friend sandy philip seymour hoffman go to a party and run into polly prince jennifer aniston whom they went to school with years earlier br br spoiler alert polly is <UNK> and sloppy and lives <UNK> which is the opposite of who <UNK> is as a person but they start to date and <UNK> starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as <UNK> dancing and eating <UNK> <UNK> but one day lisa comes back and wants to remain married to <UNK> but he really doesn't want to but polly decides to leave as she doesn't believe in marriage to begin with br br this film is the second directing effort by john <UNK> who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in <UNK> and meet the parents but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel it's very easy to say something is not funny but i think with this film it's even easier to figure out why this film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if it's only happening because of the <UNK> of the script <UNK> who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as there's something about mary but instead the events seem incredibly forced did anyone really think the blind <UNK> was funny if you do your easy a few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to <UNK> everything but all they achieve is <UNK> the obvious stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesn't work as a comedy or as a romance
<START> this movie was long and boring surprising that it was selected for cannes although they tend to like <UNK> point is that contrary to other dutch stars of the arty genre like <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> feels utterly empty even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever a long opening shot doesn't mean cinematic depth it's just a long boring shot the story wasn't interesting and the characters had problems i couldn't identify with at all the actors didn't shine under her direction and seemed lost at times leopold tried but she is not the talent i hoped she would be where are <UNK> and <UNK> they really made some waves in dutch cinema leopold just made another attempt
<START> scooby doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world so what happens when you've been everywhere and done everything with the formula you switch it up right wrong you stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again keeping the core of its success intact that is to say stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular <UNK> to it this to me is why what's new scooby doo worked they want back to the classic scooby doo formula which had only successfully <UNK> a decade earlier in a <UNK> named scooby doo but for the most part had not been <UNK> since the original scooby doo where are you br br the first sign to me of a weak offering is the inclusion of <UNK> characters there might be a few fond memories from past <UNK> but generally if you think scooby doo you aren't thinking of film <UNK> <UNK> doo or scooby <UNK> even worse the <UNK> of the other core members of mystery inc generally indicate a group of production people who don't understand from a kids point of view how the show works the basic premise has always been a group of people who are <UNK> opposed getting together and through their own individual stereotyped qualities manage to <UNK> the tasks given at hand br br this next paragraph is just my <UNK> so skip it if you want i hope that i can explain why i think <UNK> around with the basic elements of the show are <UNK> with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole fred represents the driver i think in general it is the purpose of fred to give the group direction organization and sub tasks fred isn't a happy go lucky teenager he's your boss your teacher your dad your authority figure fred moves without <UNK> and is driven by tasks problem always equals solution for fred in many ways fred is the <UNK> to shaggy shaggy is your best friend that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are he <UNK> you to be brave to not be at the back of the pack shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from <UNK> to fear <UNK> represents rational thought she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are <UNK> in pieces by the other members of the show left on her own would <UNK> solve a mystery the group often finds itself in situations where truths aren't obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task chance is represented by daphne at one point i think it is the first scooby doo series she was known as danger prone writers have used daphne to link unrelated events together through accident she frequently is the one who finds the secret door collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together finally scooby himself represents us the <UNK> he is always in the centre of events capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate scooby doo works because all these <UNK> elements of problem solving are immediately <UNK> and entertaining br br maybe i'm over thinking things but in my life i've seen a lot of scooby doo being a 30 year old self <UNK> nerd it kind of rolls with the territory to me there is a magic with the classic scooby doo formula that should never be messed with br br as many have pointed out scooby doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a <UNK> bowl of breakfast <UNK> messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else something lesser
<START> in an otherwise ghastly <UNK> would be <UNK> comedy br br i was the lone victim at a 7 20 screening tonight 3 days after the movie opened so there is some satisfaction in knowing that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the bloom is off jon <UNK> rose the <UNK> double <UNK> isn't his fault but <UNK> his geeky kid <UNK> in another bad wig simply isn't working it would be another crime if this were to be eli <UNK> last screen appearance diane keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck basically because so few will have seen her in this the very worst vehicle she's chosen in the last few weeks br br sitting alone in the theater tonight i came alive laughed even whenever daniels was given the <UNK> in which to deliver the film's sole three dimensional character he really is among our very best actors br br in summary even jeff <UNK> work can't redeem this picture
<START> this amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in <UNK> <UNK> system <UNK> lawyers and judges despite tremendous difficulties lack of means the desperate poverty of the people multiple languages and multiple legal <UNK> depending on the region of the country and the religious ethnic background of the <UNK> and <UNK> these brave strong women are making a difference br br this is a rare thing a truly inspiring movie that <UNK> a little bit of faith in <UNK> despite the atrocities we see in the movie justice does get served thanks to these passionate <UNK> women br br i only hope this film gets a wide release in the united states the more people who see this film the better
<START> homicide the movie proved to be a good wrap up to a well written well directed and well acted series loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season the entire series and especially the movie provided a life like look at life and death in <UNK> a <UNK> unique city with an extremely high murder rate my attraction to the series began long before i moved to <UNK> but once i experienced life here for myself i realized how realistic it was and the movie certainly <UNK> that spirit i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city
<START> wow what a great premise for a film set it around a film maker with writer s block who decides to take up tango lessons hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who s interested in tango gosh i wish i had that knack for genius yes i m being sarcastic br br it <UNK> me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made come on unless you re a <UNK> tango fan i do <UNK> they do exist judging by the comments or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club there s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it even if you re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting <UNK> or a man in wheelchair going along a road br br coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he s seen gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters <UNK> in sympathy as he gets yet another <UNK> letter from a film company fall in lust as he takes a bath and <UNK> soap over his well toned body the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to <UNK> the movie br br ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter
<START> although the production and jerry <UNK> direction are definite <UNK> airport <UNK> isn't much better than airport 1975 slick commercial rubbish <UNK> this time literally a decent cast jack lemmon is the pilot of a packed <UNK> which gets <UNK> by art thieves and crashes into the sea all the publicity claimed it was near the <UNK> triangle but there's no mention of it in the film itself when the rescue ships come to raise the airplane out of the water we see all their <UNK> dropping rather <UNK> into the ocean and it's hard not to laugh imagining the <UNK> <UNK> the plane the passengers and the <UNK> script nbc used to air what appeared to be the director's cut with at least an hour of extra footage mostly flashbacks <UNK> into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a <UNK> island episode most exciting moment is the plane crash and some of the players have a little fun lee grant is an obnoxious drunk brenda <UNK> a no nonsense <UNK> joseph <UNK> and olivia de <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> still the personality conflicts and the excruciating military detail eventually tear at one's patience from
<START> if you've had drama in your life either your own or by someone close to you the stages of pain this woman but in my opinion it could easily have been a man too goes through are very very real it is a movie about not being able to cope with your pain about not knowing what to do to help yourself get through it obviously it then also is a movie about not knowing how to help someone close to you get through their pain it is a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering it is a movie that might push someone over the edge which hardly sounds like a recommendation i'm not sure i would recommend someone to go see this film especially someone close but for me it is a movie that puts things into perspective that shows real pain and is therefore much relevant to being alive it makes you realize that hey you or the person close to you have lived through pain that hey all the things you worry about now are of so little importance
<START> wow this has got to be the dumbest movie i've ever seen we watched it in english class and this movie made absolutely no sense i would never ever watch this movie again and my sympathy to those who have ever paid to see it
<START> since <UNK> rita julie <UNK> has been one of my role models and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man she loves get in <UNK> with his feminine side is magnificent i would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress but <UNK> pulls it off with gusto and <UNK> adrian <UNK> gives his best performance to date in the male lead
<START> a film about <UNK> never <UNK> and less than heroes making it against all odds where have we heard that before but when the <UNK> are the <UNK> the blue <UNK> and mr furious you know this is not your conventional <UNK> to <UNK> story br br a classic performance by eddie izzard as tony p one of the disco boys leaders and geoffrey rush as arch villain shows actual thought went into the casting br br even greg kinnear at first glance an odd choice for the role of captain amazing turns out spot on br br watch this film if you're sick of comic gone film stereotypes why couldn't anger be a super power
<START> this film is a massive yawn proving that americans haven't got the hang of farce even when it has already been written for them the original film <UNK> over <UNK> is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate 8 10 it isn't just about a <UNK> translation but certain absurd chains of events are <UNK> entirely robbing the film of its original clever <UNK> nature and turning it into a cheap <UNK> there go my <UNK> style of farce
<START> first an explanation on what makes a great movie for me excitement about not knowing what is coming next will make me enjoy a movie the first time i watch it case en point <UNK> there are also other things that go into a great first viewing such as good humor john candy in uncle buck and the great <UNK> good plot with good resolution <UNK> and <UNK> imaginative storytelling all star wars episodes george lucas is the man and good music again all star wars episodes wizard of oz sound of music what makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theatre and buy a dvd or vhs tape characters with that said i present cindy lou who and the grinch excellent performance taylor <UNK> and jim carrey the rest of the cast was very good particularly <UNK> <UNK> bill irwin molly shannon christine <UNK> and josh ryan evans but every single scene with cindy and the grinch together is excellent and very funny and or heartwarming cindy lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon the grinch has a strong plot good conflicts and a very good theme i can't get started because i don't want to spoil it jim carrey was very funny as the grinch particularly when he <UNK> with cindy and the music wow excellent music by james <UNK> i loved his selection of <UNK> and the compositions very good job jim carrey i didn't know you could sing taylor <UNK> <UNK> your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once on your solo where are you christmas is your voice really as high as it sounds sounds like an f that is an obscene range for a 7 year old obscene meant in the best possible way great job this is the best performance by a child i have ever heard in a movie taylor beat out the von <UNK> children no small feat and now to the actors jim carrey was great funny and surprisingly very sensitive this really showed through in his scenes with taylor <UNK> taylor <UNK> <UNK> expressions one of the secrets to a good acting performance are very strong she really becomes cindy lou who and when she does dialogue she is even stronger br br danger spoiler alert br br examples expression when she first sees the grinch this is a classic quote you're the the the and then filled in with the grinch line da da da the grinch after which she <UNK> into the <UNK> and then is rescued by the grinch the thanks for saving me quote and subsequent response by the grinch was also very good br br my favorite part of the movie is when cindy invites the grinch to be holiday <UNK> this scene is two excellent actors at their best <UNK> and expressing with each other little taylor <UNK> completely holds her own with jim carrey in this spot i sincerely hope we see taylor <UNK> in many more films to come all in all everything was great about this movie except maybe the feet and <UNK>
<START> to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too <UNK> but this here is an undeniably <UNK> combination of <UNK> 1939 1944 via les <UNK> 1954 while still watchable in itself it's so cliché ridden as to <UNK> chuckles instead of the intended chills however thanks to the dire <UNK> in which the british film industry found itself in the late 1970s even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract 10 star names cliff robertson as the conniving husband jean simmons in the title role jenny <UNK> as <UNK> artist half sister simon ward as the enigmatic <UNK> ron moody as an ill <UNK> doctor michael <UNK> as <UNK> business partner judy <UNK> as <UNK> best friend and <UNK> wife <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> david <UNK> as the <UNK> reading <UNK> will and most surprisingly perhaps jack warner as a <UNK> <UNK> although most of them actually have nothing parts i'm sorry to say

<START> remember the early days of pay per view i do and i can almost remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your t v as a kid we always wanted to rent playboy but this meant actually calling someone from <UNK> and asking to rent it and then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on <UNK> and i remember almost every scene that was in the add i've been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them it's one that when its on its hard to shut off all star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right there are plenty of spoof bank <UNK> that are good and this one has to fall in that category it has enough action and laughs to sustain it check it out if you dare
<START> if this could be rated a 0 it would be from the atrocious wooden acting to the dull plodding pace the <UNK> exploitation angle and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> added purely for the sake of the sad viewers this is a disaster of a film br br the plot is predictable as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will <UNK> from a boring <UNK> beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending every single presence in this film is wasted and every <UNK> <UNK> of talent <UNK> up for this turkey is <UNK> br br if you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish <UNK> watch one of the <UNK> films at least they're <UNK> and up front about what they're trying to do how something this <UNK> bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or <UNK> standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes br br it's not scary it's not interesting and above all it's not <UNK> in any sense of the word it is in my opinion a crime it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence and even more a tragedy that it is still <UNK> by some woefully misguided viewers br br not even <UNK> cheerful personality and joking ways could <UNK> the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is avoid it at all costs
<START> one of frances <UNK> earliest movies at 22 she is absolutely beautiful bing crosby is in great voice but the songs are not his best martha <UNK> and bob burns are interesting but their comedy probably great in its time is really corny today roy rogers also appears in a singing role in my view only worth watching if you are a frances farmer fan and possibly a bing crosby fan
<START> a good film with for its time an intense <UNK> rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john ford's the <UNK> though not so brutal the story starts fast and doesn't let up with several scenes of really good dialog between stewart's jeff <UNK> <UNK> castle and sheriff gannon this film is in some ways reminiscent of bend of the river <UNK> also a mann stewart work but i found it far less sentimental and more interesting there are a few <UNK> a too quickly wrapped up and rather sentimental ending 24 year old <UNK> <UNK> is not very convincing as a naive french teenager and of course the film takes place in the <UNK> west a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics don't apply but these are trivial concerns james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark <UNK> man who thinks he cares for no one but himself and the mountain scenery can't be beat a fine western costume drama
<START> i can't say too much about kalifornia as sadly i have yet to actually see the whole thing i've only managed to see it in bits and pieces on <UNK> but what i have seen is absolutely awesome i am a fan of brad pitt but i admit not all his earlier movies are well good but this role i just his acting is great his character early seems so normal well okay creepy dark weird but you know normal for a <UNK> of that type i guess and juliette <UNK> performance although i can see how some may be annoyed by it i think it's amazing sadly i have yet to see the end but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good but disappointing i have to admit that i wish david <UNK> sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect was a bit flat but for him it was okay his wife's character was better and i thought her performance while not the best in the movie was pretty good a portrait of the avant <UNK> older sister type particularly the scene where early and brian go to play pool and adele and carrie are having their one on one time together i've watched that scene at least twice now and i still think the acting in it is just wonderful one because of the emotion that adele portrays after talking about being raped by the three guys and how she feels about early and <UNK> reaction to it everything about that i think is just so perfect i mean maybe it's because i can relate a bit i'm not sure br br as for brad pitt who plays the serial killer that we actually get to see for once i thought he was great some movies with pitt that i've seen were just average or not worth seeing i don't think i've ever seen a terrible pitt movie or if i have it's not because of his acting it's other factors this movie was not one of them he turned out a great performance in kalifornia i swear i'm not just some random i do like him for his acting not just because he's good looking i mean his character in this movie isn't exactly handsome or cute by any means pitt is dark brooding and downright scary at times yet he's also cheerful funny nice and even loving towards adele granted there are some spots that made me want to reach through the tv and <UNK> him but that's probably just me and the character pitt played in the movie but it also shows how good <UNK> acting was in this movie it made me forget that he was playing a character that is what good acting is supposed to do br br at any rate i wish i could say more but that's all i can really say without having seen the ending i have seen most of the movie through what i've caught on <UNK> and as i'm writing this i'm <UNK> it on <UNK> so hopefully i can write a more complete review later i just wanted to share my thoughts on a movie that i thought was something really cool and something that seems to have gotten overlooked it shouldn't have
<START> the running jumping standing still film is not a film as such but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme this <UNK> got richard lester <UNK> and <UNK> the way for him to direct the first beatles film 'a hard day's night br br richard lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959 this film was entitled the running jumping standing still film it was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production since the film was intended to be viewed by lester and his partners alone a small amount of money and time was invested the sole purpose of this film is entertainment but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera the film cost <UNK> to make and it was filmed in <UNK> toned film stock in a field on a couple of <UNK> all of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production the finished production is eleven minutes in length br br the running jumping standing still film is a comedy about english <UNK> and the small <UNK> that people do to pass the time all of the events in this film take place in a field a few of these comical events include a woman <UNK> a lawn a man running around a tree <UNK> with a <UNK> to play a record a photographer developing film in a pond an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a <UNK> face a man building a <UNK> an <UNK> running over the <UNK> and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun not only does the film poke fun at the <UNK> that people do to pass the time away but it also <UNK> fun at english culture when compared to american culture another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a <UNK> which has been constructed out of the flag of the united kingdom one of the men jumps inside the <UNK> while the other men attempt to fly it and the <UNK> breaks according to neil <UNK> author of the films of richard lester this event <UNK> the united kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the united states during the space age according to this scene the british fly primitive <UNK> while the americans the world power after world war ii fly highly advanced rockets and space <UNK>
<START> have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to <UNK> a dragon oh you have was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey did water flow <UNK> and <UNK> of great cities <UNK> on the horizon i didn't think so br br i stumbled onto this movie by accident and i'm really glad that i did it's one of the most beautiful movies i've ever seen much like the pixar movies it's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today's world the animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen and this attention to detail is <UNK> the scene where the <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> green smoke whilst the characters walk <UNK> in the background is one of my favourites the monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action br br although the plot may not be entirely unique the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching our protagonists are likable and interesting <UNK> the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise <UNK> everything in its path of course hector is the character most will fall in love with a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and english hector provides comedy relief in a way jar jar <UNK> could only dream of br br in summary i'd recommend watching the dragon hunters if you get the opportunity watch it for the incredible animation the breath taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that's unlike anything else you've seen on a cinema or television screen at the very least it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half no matter if you're nine or twenty nine which in fact i am
<START> i caught this movie on fx last night and as i was sitting there watching it it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever bad acting bad cinematography bad sound totally unbelievable fight sequences stupid characters all these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie i've ever seen it was so bad i was enthralled by it's sheer lack of anything semi competent that i had to keep watching and they made a sequel
<START> i should put out an alert all over saying that the movie shouldn't be watched it fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men the special effect were horrible i hadn't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology how can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of <UNK> rounds per minute fire at 1 <UNK> the speed how can soldiers fall forward when a <UNK> explodes in front of them how can people survive when there are <UNK> <UNK> falling as close as 20 feet away how come the <UNK> <UNK> fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself br br not only did this <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> me it was the cliched situations and the <UNK> of the dialogues which had me screaming murder there were the standard dialogues like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> se <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> me <UNK> and <UNK> cross <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stupid to say the least br br what <UNK> de had written is true the director worked without a script and it shows there is no flow to the movie there is no <UNK> progression from one battle to another it is just one <UNK> after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war the <UNK> scenes are awful the chief of army staff looks unconvincing to make matters worse the theatre people had <UNK> cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours
<START> dull haunted house thriller finds an american family moving into a 200 year old house in japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred br br novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of motel hell the film <UNK> zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall br br one obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned the monk <UNK> the history of the house which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence and then the film simply cuts away to something else earlier the monk had offered to help well where is the help the family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier try to drive the spirits out of the house although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care br br there are some probably unintentional campy laughs in seeing the american actors at the end become possessed by the japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts i say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's motel hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing but on the whole this is a forgettable dud
<START> i stumbled across <UNK> <UNK> of this show several years ago and fell in love with it it features <UNK> <UNK> and holland taylor and kept me laughing one episode after the next i guess it didn't make it so big and was cancelled after a few seasons but i believe it was a good run and would suggest watching it if the opportunity <UNK>
<START> edmund burke said that all evil needs is for good me to do nothing hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films this movie was uplifting story of the loss and <UNK> of faith it had no violence no <UNK> and did not deserve a pg rating the western scenery was filmed well and some of the <UNK> were simply breathtaking actors were a bit young for their parts but otherwise believable and talented music score was too loud and in some places drowned out the dialog completely i'm seldom surprised by movie endings any more but i was pleasantly surprised by this one sometimes the good guys do win and they win by honest efforts we liked the movie and the message and would recommend it for the entire family
<START> the writing of the <UNK> and the required over eager reckless press officer and <UNK> grandma was ham <UNK> and cliché ridden br br i cant blame the actors but surely someone must have said are you joking i cant say this br br this episode had a press perspective and police perspective while the police perspective was standard enough the press perspective and characterization was <UNK> exaggerated and at points <UNK> unbelievable br br i notice that this was an hbo co production if so then perhaps the <UNK> stereotypes can be explained in that light br br i was completely cringing during the press <UNK> scene it lacked any credibility and did not remotely ring true 40 minutes into the first episode and i am still waiting for the suspense br br skip five <UNK> the 2008 9 production with these characters is far better and more suspenseful even if the crime is over the top br br this story had unforgivable moments which can only be described as <UNK> unbelievable br br for a press officer to start a press <UNK> without an investigating officer present to take press questions br br so unbelievable it felt like amateur hour br br i then began looking for <UNK> called scoop and for perry white to make an appearance br br i saw the 2009 hunter before five days made it to australia not realizing it was a prequel and was looking forward to <UNK> and <UNK> going around again br br head <UNK> awful
<START> for a long time 'the <UNK> was my favorite <UNK> <UNK> episode though in recent years it has been <UNK> by <UNK> on the edge of forever ' what i used to prefer about <UNK> was that it's more hard core star trek with this fascinating back story to the then current trek storyline i still think it's fairly ingenious the way gene <UNK> <UNK> the original pilot into a two part episode though the <UNK> part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others and us to watch the pilot the idea of spock being court <UNK> is a clever one you can poke holes in the plot if you want for instance given the <UNK> mind control abilities and captain <UNK> condition why is it even necessary to physically bring <UNK> back to their planet and there are other confusing questions about <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy <UNK> only two <UNK>

<START> the movie has very much the feel of a play right from the start i think it would make a better play than a movie because the set and <UNK> make a movie version seem a bit too artificial but still it's carried out fairly well and the story especially the dialogue are interesting they've taken the dialogue pretty much exactly as is from the actual play perhaps it's a good introduction to <UNK> plays br br the main character <UNK> has her head in the clouds and a flair for the dramatic and helena bonham <UNK> acting does a good job here her fiancé <UNK> is a bit too cartoonish when he is really supposed to be an extremely handsome dashing figure her parents are entertaining enough
<START> love trap is not a short it's quite obviously a full length feature film with a running time of <UNK> minutes br br while i'm writing this i might as well talk a bit more about love trap i'm frequently asked what makes love trap different this is how i respond to that question 1 it introduces characters one in particular that have never been seen before in film period br br 2 it reveals more truth about love and <UNK> more deeply into the very concept of love than any other u s film ever made in my humble opinion br br 3 <UNK> as in the way the story is told it is unlike any love story you've ever seen br br 4 it offers extremely <UNK> insights on various cultural issues both within and outside the black community br br over time people will come to see love trap as about as wholly an original work as possible in this era delightfully refreshing authentic and honest it is a rare morality play full of food for thought br br please visit www <UNK> com for complete and accurate info about this film
<START> start with the script i have seen cartoons with more depth than envy anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen and was not funny the first time a movie is in deep trouble which envy certainly is a movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere christopher walken especially would like to forget this bomb because his character is so weak ben stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies <UNK> with disaster and <UNK> immediately come to mind be certain that envy is not a black comedy there are no double meanings just total nonsense envy deserves it's low rating because like it's subject matter it stinks <UNK>
<START> the godfather part i was a stunning look inside the fictional <UNK> family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of the godfather part ii shows that young man's acceptance of his new role his <UNK> of character as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he <UNK> deeper and deeper into a life of crime the first two parts of this saga of this transformation of michael <UNK> make for one of the greatest <UNK> in cinematic history br br then along came the godfather part iii michael <UNK> is now the aging don of the <UNK> family he shows <UNK> for his previous actions not through subtle <UNK> but by trying to use his powers for good and <UNK> all his <UNK> and regrets to others very cliche and <UNK> of the complex character that is michael <UNK> michael's plans to use his powers for good are <UNK> by an ambitious young <UNK> and his enemies michael's daughter is eventually a <UNK> of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to michael realizing that his entire life as don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in protecting his family br br the godfather part ii ends with michael <UNK> reaching the lowest of the <UNK> having his own brother killed before part iii was made the godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man's journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of michael forgetting his roots and <UNK> the one thing that has always <UNK> most to him and those around him family loyalty part iii paints the picture of michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of <UNK> this greatly <UNK> the meaning of the first two films br br the godfather part iii is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made the only solution to the problem that is this final installment of the godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with michael's shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed
<START> previously i wrote that i loved titanic cried at its ending many times over and i'm a guy in his 60's i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was <UNK> by so many critics was given only a 7 0 rating by imdb com users br br well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings while <UNK> 0 of all votes gave it a 10 rating 10 7 gave it a 1 rating these 10 7 of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to 7 0 br br in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden <UNK> in 1 ratings with a high 10 rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly <UNK> course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for <UNK> <UNK> believe me i've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who <UNK> him left and right they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much and gave it a 5 or a 6 etc everyone has and is entitled to his her own taste but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7 0 overall for titanic pulled to that level by an <UNK> number of ridiculous 1 ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture br br let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these 5 will prove my point <UNK> gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb <UNK> ratings were 23 2 10 ratings and 9 2 1 ratings overall rating of 6 1 big top pee wee 1988 got 4 3 10 ratings and 9 9 1 ratings overall rating of 4 5 cat people 1982 got 6 1 10 ratings and 2 6 1 ratings overall rating of 5 8 blind date 1987 got 3 0 10 ratings and 2 8 1 ratings overall rating of 5 3 <UNK> jack flash 1986 got 4 4 10 ratings and 3 7 1 ratings overall rating of 5 2 what do all of these films have in common with titanic all of the <UNK> of their 1 ratings are lower than titanic and none of these <UNK> ever was nominated for a single award again titanic got 10 7 1 ratings compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned br br can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor br br
<START> before the devil knows you're dead starts off <UNK> setting up a simple heist that goes awry told from varying perspectives in <UNK> style at around the hour mark sidney lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts it eventually <UNK> into a multi <UNK> family drama exploring the full realm of human emotions relations as the story comes to its chilling climax br br as is the case with lumet he manages to <UNK> exceptional performances out of his star <UNK> cast without any notion of over acting or <UNK> philip seymour hoffman in one of his best roles is a complex mysterious and interesting character and <UNK> <UNK> ethan hawke who plays his brother hank that's not to say that hawke is not bad in fact he is quite above adequate in a troubled role that suits his style marisa tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance the fact that she <UNK> her flesh adds to this albert <UNK> character andy and <UNK> father is the most intriguing and in my opinion he deserved a bit more screen time amy ryan also performs her job adequately br br before the devil knows you're dead is not an exceptional movie but it proves that lumet is still near the top of his game at the apparent twilight of an <UNK> career many of his characteristics and <UNK> appear here not least of which involves the use of his characters <UNK> with a killer script no pun intended smart dialogue and pacing and a decent score before the devil knows you're dead is a must see a truly underrated gem 8 10 3 stars out of 4 should just enter my top 250 at <UNK> highly recommended
<START> deathstalker is directed by john watson and it stars rick hill who is some kind of body <UNK> and famous of that if i have understood right the plot follows as deathstalker hill tries to get something back from the evil lord and he has to travel to the <UNK> cave he meets many <UNK> and monsters during his journey and the settings are very close to <UNK> and of course conan the barbarian this is a rip off of huge success of conan and even though this is very stupid film it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and <UNK> film <UNK> br br there are no many cinematic merits in this film couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating but what deathstalker concentrates to show are nude females and huge <UNK> of hill females are usually helpless victims and very stupid too so this is very macho film and thus may not please many <UNK> the fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull and the monsters are not either anything special and all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done but what did you expect from low budget effort like this this tries to be as great as conan but fails pretty miserably as i said this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else this belongs to the category it's so bad it's great br br deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be and as a turkey film i appreciate this almost as much as other <UNK> enjoyable ones of course if bad films are your cup of tea then try this and have fun but if you don't understand <UNK> bad films then stay away and if somebody can't stand large amount of nudity then stay away as well there is more nudity here than violence and due to these scenes the film has an r rating otherwise this could be some safe pg family film br br 4 10
<START> <UNK> action movie with an interesting premise a young mafia would to be killer chandler must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service so he goes to california to take some lessons with a very known professional killer <UNK> first and most important task to kill a young woman lee that is a completely strange for all of them but is she a easy target the movie goes on and on based upon this principal idea but the result is just bad routine even the weird twist at the end does not save the movie good performance by chandler i give this a 4 four
<START> oh well this movie starts off well it's kinda funny and seems like it could be a fun movie then it becomes a bit serious and goes off the <UNK> it sort of wants to be <UNK> <UNK> but it can't achieve it if only it stayed with the tone of the first quarter of the film
<START> you know our spirit is based on that revolution it's asleep i can explain i think well until that happen on <UNK> april 1974 our freedom was limited we didn't had liberty of speech but when we got it at the revolution it seems that portuguese people lost his opinion we don't use our liberty of speech that's all a consequence of the revolution i think that's clear about the movie i think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting but by the way i use to watch on portuguese movies it's quite good i like it very much
<START> ok i had higher hopes for this <UNK> movie simply because it seemed like the sequels were getting better as they came out i did like <UNK> 2 better than 1 i figured well this one is newer so it must be better right well i quickly learned i was wrong i was extremely confused with the casting they brought back rick dean for another spotlight character and michael macdonald as a police officer now for rick dean lol in <UNK> 2 i thought he fit the role pretty well and wasn't really annoyed by him now in <UNK> 3 wow they placed him as an elite soldier now we are getting goofy here the movie actually started out pretty good with a decent gun fight and <UNK> escaping out of there little <UNK> <UNK> but as soon as scott <UNK> team showed up we had a mix of a romantic comedy with very funny performances from retarded and <UNK> dinosaurs br br i'll start with the <UNK> first they had there <UNK> drag the ground which in the second one they were up in the air which looked more common for a dinosaur that can run up to 50 60 <UNK> now when they ran they <UNK> back and forth and the heads didn't move at all there hands were <UNK> all over the place and since they were extremely poorly shot by the director they looked stupid and out of place br br the t rex was extremely pathetic they would of been better off using the one from the previous 2 movies at least that one looked somewhat frightening the one in this film looked like it was smiling all the time the legs when it walked was hilarious like it was john wayne in the old west all stiff <UNK> and stuff lol another thing i noticed is that the hands did not move they were stuck next to its body so it looked and sounded god the sound effects were awful retarded now if i was the director and realized that i had this to work with maybe i would of maybe tried a little bit harder to hide the <UNK> fact as for the rest of the movie well this was the <UNK> and <UNK> military team i have ever seen the weapons they used wouldn't make sense for the scenario they even had an arm wrestling scene inside the warehouse where the <UNK> were <UNK> now i was <UNK> at this scene because i thought that while this stupidity was going on that the <UNK> would get in there and cause some damage instead the director wasted about 7 minutes of our time i would like to look at this movie as the 3 stooges of dinosaur movies you have retarded military retarded dinosaurs retarded scenario and you have a wonderful <UNK> minutes to spend of your day watching this br br now i'm not saying i wouldn't watch this <UNK> actually i do recommend everyone see this movie that wants <UNK> minutes of pure entertainment it may seem like i'm <UNK> but really i'm <UNK> this movie up to what it is its really a lot of fun to watch because while watching this you think to yourself did the director really make this seriously
<START> it was on at 7 <UNK> too close to school to see very often the animation computer graphics were spectacular for the time the idea of <UNK> ordinary people casually throwing around space vehicles robots was amazing maybe it inspired treasure planet br br unfortunately it's really boring in the dvd format the shows are all basically identical when viewing non <UNK> episodes on a dvd you're stoned by <UNK> 3 by today's standards the animation is <UNK> we don't notice the computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny the characters are instead br br the bright spots are the heroine characters they were a lot more believable took themselves more seriously than modern <UNK> and weren't corny they actually saved men
<START> i know john <UNK> a smart guy <UNK> he made <UNK> n the hood so how did he write and direct this it's like the pilot of a bad going away to college for the first time teen soap a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial <UNK> i guess who would've guessed the date rape victim would dump <UNK> for <UNK> the angry loner would be <UNK> upon by a group of neo nazis and would be <UNK> up with a black and a jew just for laughs even laurence <UNK> creepy <UNK> history professor just irritated me and i love the guy it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot except <UNK> <UNK> of course big ups
<START> most folks might say that if one were to spend a saturday night watching a movie you must be really bored actually i had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the tv and there it was paulie br br i had missed the opening credits so i didn't know the name of it but i saw that it had cheech <UNK> in it so i naturally thought i had tuned into born in east l a when i saw him talking to a talking parrot i was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night br br happy to say it was better than that as you know if you don't already paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner seems it's taken years to find her what should be <UNK> advantage is actually a <UNK> advantage in ways people come across a <UNK> parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves br br while cheech <UNK> character is making money from him he's not mean to him the dance sequences with the <UNK> are something kids will find cute i found them amusing br br paulie who's <UNK> learns quickly that not all humans are nice people especially the owner of an animal research lab the man lies to him saying he'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal <UNK> research paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a <UNK> to others of <UNK> vocal ability br br throughout the film <UNK> telling his story to the <UNK> janitor who ends up <UNK> him several other animals and finding the location of <UNK> owner it's a touching reunion br br 8 out of 10 the wing <UNK> scene should have been assumed and not shown that part might bother younger children otherwise it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart end
<START> spoilers a bit <UNK> made for tv movie has sexy and middle age gold <UNK> isabelle collins susan <UNK> doing a number on every man she comes in contact with in the movie first winning over their hearts then their <UNK> and then when their no longer any use to her thrown in the <UNK> basket like a used up <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> first victim is non other then her abusive on keeping isabelle from <UNK> his bank account husband stewart john <UNK> it's later in the movie when isabelle gets very friendly with former <UNK> and now <UNK> salesman richard davis philip <UNK> that she without really telling him has the totally love sick richard get a contract out on her unsuspecting husbands life getting this ex convict in fact as soon as he's released from prison <UNK> nicholas campbell to do the job on stewart richard soon finds out that he didn't get exactly what he paid 15 000 00 in cash for br br getting a little too greedy <UNK> not only blew stewart's brains out but took a solid gold watch that stewart offered him in order to <UNK> his life as well the watch was easily <UNK> to <UNK> as he tried to <UNK> it at a local jewelry shop where he was quickly arrested with <UNK> <UNK> his guts out on who hired him to <UNK> stewart it doesn't take long for the long arm of the law to arrest stewart's by hiring <UNK> killer <UNK> husband to be ex <UNK> and <UNK> salesman richard davis <UNK> arrest by the police happens just as he and isabelle took the <UNK> of <UNK> in a local church br br isabelle <UNK> everyone exclusively men that fall head over heels for her to her advantage by getting them to do her dirty work always playing the part of the naive housewife or widow or lover or even client isabelle seems to live a <UNK> life always one step ahead of the law and police no matter what she does isabelle covers her pretty behind so well that it's almost impossible to pin her down on any in having others do them of the many crimes that she commits through a second party in the film br br after <UNK> <UNK> as well as literally her first husband steven her second husband for less then ten seconds richard and finally her or <UNK> attorney <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de los <UNK> isabelle knows that it's only a matter of time before the police get wise to her with the d a getting both richard and <UNK> to turn evidence against her isabelle now knowing that everything is fast closing in on her makes her final move getting everything in order by <UNK> all her cash overseas isabelle and her 10 year old daughter ruby lauren collins shoot down to the <UNK> office in order to get <UNK> <UNK> to get out of the country br br it's then when the <UNK> and clever isabelle makes her first and possibly last and fatal mistake in the movie isabelle is told by the <UNK> clerk don <UNK> she'll have to wait a full 48 hours for her and <UNK> <UNK> to clear just enough time for the police to find and arrest her outlandish ending that goes against almost everything and every <UNK> that's in a film noir or crime movie an ending that will not only blow your mind but your concept of what's right and wrong in the world
<START> i did not see this film in the theater i confess to an anti <UNK> <UNK> bias who the hell was john travolta to be making movies i remember the oscar broadcast that year with travolta looking absolutely <UNK> when he didn't win how dare he when there were real actors in the running i'm sorry john you should have won after catching this film on cable years ago i fell in love with the entire movie bud sissy uncle bob wes all wonderfully done i also confess to never passing it by when i channel surf i have to stop and watch over the years i've learned to do most of the dialogue dance with my thumbs in my <UNK> and learned to appreciate travolta more the only disappointing thing to me was the <UNK> on the soundtrack of some of the music from urban cowboy looking for love <UNK> the film but urban cowboy was chock full of classics that didn't make it to the soundtrack it should have been a double cd
<START> my wife and i both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made certainly in the top ten of those i've watched all the way through at least plan 9 was enjoyable br br i did really enjoy christine the dead zone <UNK> carrie and some of his other films i didn't care much for <UNK> only because the sound was so bad on versions i've seen and i often couldn't tell what people were saying or pet sematary pet cemetery br br but this mess was a total mistake in every way possible the creatures themselves seemed designed by a 9 year old no offense to 9 year olds br br even the one liners made us <UNK> and weren't remotely amusing
<START> yes i have rated this film as one star awful yet it will be in my <UNK> of christmas movies <UNK> this truly is so bad it's good this is another k gordon murray production read buys a really cheap bad mexican movie spends zero money getting it dubbed into english and releases it at kiddie <UNK> in the mid 1960's it's a shame i stumbled on this so late in life as i'm sure some mood <UNK> would make this an even better experience i'm not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said a christmas movie with <UNK> the devil mechanical wind up <UNK> and some of the most pathetic child actors i have ever seen bar none i plan on running this over the holidays back to back with <UNK> <UNK> a christmas carol truly a holiday experience made in hell now if i can only find to all a <UNK> aka <UNK> on dvd i'll have a triple feature that can't be beat you have to see this movie it moves so slowly that i defy you not to touch the fast forward button especially on the two dance routines this thing <UNK> like an expensive <UNK> cheese guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the days is a typical family drama with a little catch you must relate to the character's emotions in every way possible in order for you to truly appreciate the show br br possible spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the show br br the story obviously for all the people who has watched the show is the world of cooper day the middle child of the family he records his days with his family and hopes to become a rich and famous writer one day because of his observations his family includes a mother a father a perfect sister and a genius little brother the first episode which is going to sound a bit stupid since john scott shepard has created this situation both the sister and mother gets pregnant that's the first situation the writer hits then the father <UNK> his job at the law firm the youngest son gets a panic attack the middle child gets in a fight with the sister's boyfriend this is all in a day's work br br spoilers br br i admire this show i don't know it's a bit crappy but i like it first i thought the camera work was a ripoff but then i got used it and started to like it i liked the quiet conversations under a dark light i liked the intimate feeling of the show i liked the low budget style i liked the acting i admire the story then i find myself wanting a second season of the days i slowly became a fan of it as the 6 episode airing on abc came to an end it's a really good show and it's nothing like the <UNK> the two have nothing in common so i hope fans will stop comparing them br br and if you can relate to either <UNK> jack natalie cooper or even <UNK> you'll like this show a lot
<START> but the fun is in the journey br br i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times br br yes it's predictable and yes it's a cliché romantic comedy but the point is that it's a sweet story the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways br br the dialog is dead on and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect the <UNK> scene is worth it's weight in gold the actress there deserves honorable mention for those that <UNK> it for being predictable if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing then you want a thriller this is a romantic comedy it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth every effort along the way br br great date movie great movie for a happy cry
<START> hey arnold is a slow paced and slightly boring movie the plot is not very creative the paul sorvino character <UNK> is buying all of the <UNK> low <UNK> buildings in order to build a gigantic mall shopping complex and office buildings this plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies it is boring paul sorvino is not very exciting either so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary <UNK> remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the movie is about the last <UNK> hours when arnold and <UNK> must find the document with the undercover aid of <UNK> whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to <UNK> mall the kids must move around town on <UNK> and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly but <UNK> how this movie is written for very young kids hey arnold the tv cartoon is usually very entertaining and it has enough humor to appeal to adults the tv cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie hey arnold the movie is about five times more <UNK> and a good way to put anyone including <UNK> to sleep hey arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending if you want to send your kids to a totally non offensive movie this is it i get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie the producers started out with a 30 minute tv cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes this mall story definitely could have been covered in the tv cartoon hopefully arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel
<START> this film caught me off guard when it started out in a <UNK> located in arizona and a richard <UNK> rex dead easy <UNK> decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot sexy waitress while rex steps out of the <UNK> he sees a state <UNK> and asks him are you fast and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one nancy allen maggie <UNK> dressed to kill <UNK> is a tv reporter and is always looking for a news scoop to broadcast maggie winds up in a hot <UNK> and rex comes a calling on her to tell her he wants a show down western style with the local top cop in town this is a different film however nancy allen and richard <UNK> are the only two actors who help this picture together
<START> possible spoilers br br the spy who <UNK> me is a <UNK> overrated and over hyped sequel international man of mystery came straight out of the blue it was a lone star that few people had heard of but it was stunningly original had sophisticated humour and ample humour always kept in good taste and had a brilliant cast the spy who <UNK> me was a lot more <UNK> advertised and hyped about br br ok i'll admit the first time i saw this film i thought it was very funny but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws the acting was ok but heather graham cannot act her performance didn't seem very convincing and she wasn't near as good as liz <UNK> was in the first one those characters who <UNK> in the first one scott evil number 2 etc are thrown into the background hear and don't get many stand alone scenes the film is simply <UNK> with cameos br br in particular i hated the way they totally <UNK> some of the scenes in <UNK> when they killed off vanessa at the start and had basil sat that he knew she was a <UNK> all along what was the point of that they killed off number 2 in the first one and now they bring him back with no explanation whatsoever this is supposed to be a spy spoof i don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the film it just goes on a trail further and further away from the point br br the new characters are very <UNK> the whole mini me make fun of my <UNK> joke gets old very quickly fat bastard is just a lame excuse for gross out humour in total there's about two or three good jokes the rest are either tasteless or <UNK> from <UNK> br br if this were the first movie of the series then i'd probably be easier on it but the series started on a note of dry wit and then <UNK> down to a level of gross out humour so i say only watch this film if you haven't seen its predecessor because the spy who <UNK> me is one ultimate disappointment
<START> this movie has no plot and no focus yes it's supposed to be a slap stick stupid comedy but the screen writers have no idea what the movie was about even the title doesn't go along with the movie it should have been called cool ethan or <UNK> never win or something like that the characters are not developed and no one cares what happens to them the girl roommate character from that 70's show was the only person worth watching she was hilarious and stole every scene she was in the others need to make sure that their own college <UNK> are in the works since they'll need a career other than acting
<START> i was one of those few americans that grew up with all of <UNK> <UNK> marvelous creations thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it br br i expected it to be a romp but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group like lost in space this could have been both visually stunning and exciting it should have focused on more action adventure and the goal of the original series saving people in trouble br br instead it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers who were cast too young anyway vs the original the <UNK> part was lady penelope and parker i didn't care too much for the characters in the original but i was grateful for them in the movie they stole the show br br i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the high tech than the stories and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool <UNK> br br but then i'm just a big kid
<START> this dvd appears to be <UNK> at someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background it's organized as a series of music videos of the grand canyon set to various pieces of <UNK> dream music br br unfortunately the <UNK> music is dull and the transfer to dvd looks rather <UNK> and dim too expensive a dvd for what it is
<START> i started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it original movie was kind of childish and i was just looking for some sci fi show while waiting for the bsg new season br br but after few episodes i became a fan i've loved the characters the not so stupid as you think he is jack o'neill the not only smart samantha carter the glorious <UNK> women and kids favorite and brilliant dr daniel jackson br br of course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting it's about helping your friend even <UNK> your life for him it's about we don't leave anybody behind struggling to the end when all hope is lost about the free will and all good qualities that makes a human human br br and now it's breaking a record going <UNK> season and still doing good
<START> okay during this past <UNK> break whilst having the whole family together everybody decided to go see a movie and since fred <UNK> was voted majority thats what we went and say br br to start off the movie had so many plot holes it was pathetic simple explanations of why a certain event was happening was void example who the heck is trying to <UNK> <UNK> santa <UNK> is it some sort of corporation a little explanation would of been lovely br br second the movie tossed you flimsy characters that <UNK> no sympathy from you about their feelings or actions example the little <UNK> named willie and the only tall girl in the <UNK> village they see each other twice and then they are a couple and i could of cared less because this movie didn't make me care br br third i suppose this was suppose to be a family film its rating was low at just pg for a family film there were several <UNK> of suggestive conversation it didn't bother me but if i were a parent i could see a problem br br through the whole movie paul <UNK> looked extremely bored with his role but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies <UNK> frat boy nothing against vaughn he's been good in other movies br br so this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me just because somebody had to put in the effort to produce film and release this flick br br in my opinion i would definitely pass on this flick or if you have to see it save it for a rainy day rental
<START> usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply <UNK> it and is annoyed it doesn't have a lower rating and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating this is not the case here br br <UNK> is a perfect example of a 0 10 film it does nothing right and it doesn't have the chance to because it doesn't really attempt to do anything there are <UNK> of a bad d d novel kind of plot which doesn't hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort because even a completely <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hard work would amount to more a truly awful film
<START> i wasn't going to watch this show but i'm glad i did the critics of this just don't get it it's one of the funniest and most entertaining thing on t v at the present moment though when the interviews were done with common folks they probably seemed useless but put them in the mouth of animals and insects and it's a laugh riot i laughed so hard i had tears in my eyes the pig with the babies <UNK> and her mother is priceless the husband and wife birds talking about health problems and the male bird taking a crap after the wife said she was <UNK> completely broke me up creature <UNK> is the most imaginative show i've ever seen in awhile hopefully it will be back next summer when this run is over
<START> i grew up in <UNK> and was nine when this movie came out as a result i don't remember anything about the movie but i do remember the sensation it caused from <UNK> and the mechanical bull to johnny lee's hit song <UNK> for love which still brings back memories of childhood whenever i hear it br br however a few years ago i saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all i can say is i was blown away few movies have hit me harder this movie is as raw and real as you can get from uncle <UNK> ranch house the chemical plant in texas city <UNK> dance hall and bud and sissy and maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal but no matter how you feel about country music i for one can't stand it despite my <UNK> roots urban cowboy is a unique slice of american pie for that reason i love it
<START> i love ashley judd and think all of her movies are great ruby br br in paradise is one of her best it is a very understated movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it a story of a woman trying to make it on her own and <UNK> to give in to <UNK> that would make her life easy some of her movies such as kiss the girls and time to kill probably did better at the box office and video <UNK> they were very good movies br br also but take the time to really look at ruby and i think you will agree it is one of <UNK> best br br
<START> this warning against anti <UNK> is well meant and may have had its purpose at the time but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film the director has no idea about <UNK> en scene the cast <UNK> from bad till even worse br br the great <UNK> comic hans <UNK> is wasted in his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy that is designed as a set from <UNK> <UNK> des dr <UNK> one wonders whether the makers had all their mental <UNK> br br the restored copy i saw dutch <UNK> gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place but may be the original editing was bad as well
<START> the king maker is a film about a series of real <UNK> needed events that occurred during the portuguese <UNK> in <UNK> br br although the costumes and art direction are commendable the movie still fails to impress the viewer the acting in particular was extremely poor some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents both real and fake are extremely irritating the storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson the movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century old air and it looked more like a <UNK> attempt to make an asian version of elizabeth br br final say costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air but the execution was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural bursts of emotion in short the movie sounded more like <UNK> than a script
<START> this show probably won't appeal to everyone sarah does what she wants she doesn't ask for <UNK> and she doesn't apologize this is a sitcom with zombies robot dinosaurs flying cars and a team of <UNK> stealing male <UNK> the star of the show is not a hero she is a spoiled <UNK> <UNK> if you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers the show probably isn't for you everyone should at least give this show a chance it brings together the comedic <UNK> of sarah silverman brian <UNK> the comedians of comedy jay <UNK> mr show steve <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the creative <UNK> of rob <UNK> and dan <UNK> heat vision jack monster house it also showcases the best talents of the <UNK> online community <UNK> com if you're into this show keep an eye out for the department of acceptable media on <UNK> this march it'll be drawing from the same talent pool br br watch sarah <UNK> show this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment
<START> i don't know what you guys are talking about the first time i watched this movie with two of my friends we couldn't stop crying this is one of the funniest <UNK> i've ever seen that comment about the porn is so right though <UNK> br br yeah this movie actually is the worse but it did bring tears to my eyes due to the phony characters poor dialog and acting not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it it looks like one of those movies out of my drivers ed class the props look like they came out of a high school drama show the music sounds like it is from an original <UNK> system game the only thing that even came close the <UNK> me about this movie was that it had a killer clown which who isn't <UNK> out by fat lurking <UNK> <UNK> if someone were to ever watch this though they need to look out for the actors verbal errors like <UNK> on words and some of their facial expressions <UNK> i died br br susan
<START> this movie was messed up a sequel to john carpenter's vampires this didn't add up right i'm not sure that i enjoyed this much it was a little strange stick to the first vampires it's a good movie vampires los <UNK> wasn't a good attempt of a sequel br br 4 10
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> is a drama about growing up in multi ethnic britain rather like <UNK> it like <UNK> or more closely <UNK> is <UNK> with which it shares a 1970s setting the tone is <UNK> <UNK> in spite of the <UNK> black country accents but the film lacks <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and the result seems rather thin and trite moreover the portrayal of the film's central relationship between an asian girl and her white friend is <UNK> deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it i have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story <UNK> is <UNK> was fun and sharp <UNK> and <UNK> seems obvious and dull in comparison
<START> well i was excited at first to <UNK> an animated open source movie only to be ruined by a <UNK> reel the animation is excellent the lip <UNK> is awful and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what's going on only to realize nothing is going on you feel no emotion for the characters only pity for the creators for wasting their time i have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time this could of been an excellent short film if they had just taken the time to hire a real director i'm sure everyone over at <UNK> is excited to showcase their <UNK> and its rendering <UNK> but sorry guys story telling is what makes a movie
<START> george brent is a reporter sent to interview an <UNK> she is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune he interviews her on her <UNK> they fall for each other in bathing costumes br br it turns out quite early that she is not an <UNK> she part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream br br the movie follows the ups and downs of their romance br br the supporting cast does little to <UNK> it up davis and brent carry the picture though it's fairly predictable it is also fairly entertaining it's far from her best but especially considering its obscurity in her <UNK> it's not one of her worst either
<START> i really wanted to like this film and i don't think i was terribly disappointed being an american history teacher i felt an <UNK> almost to see this film and as far as the history went it wasn't bad sure there were a few mistakes here and there especially with the <UNK> the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year not over six years of actual fighting but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent unfortunately the movie also included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor <UNK> and a rich <UNK> for the most part it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed tacked on like a plot device instead of a real honest to goodness romance in fact as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb cliché of love at fist sight it was kind of annoying the more i think about it br br however in spite of this romance the film is truly interesting and inspiring plus in so many ways it seems as if the much later film the <UNK> was copied from this griffith film both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the british and using horrible and evil tactics against the civilians and both having the secret intention of using this as a <UNK> to starting their own nation in the america the only major difference is that this film is set in the north and the <UNK> was in the <UNK> it sure would have been nice if mel gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to d w griffith for the story ideas it just doesn't seem all that likely that the two stories were created <UNK> of each other br br ps despite me liking this film and some other of <UNK> films he does deserve to once again burn in hell for his having white actors portray all the black servants in the film this is a sick and <UNK> thing that griffith did in so many of his films especially in birth of a nation i gotta assume based on this and the way he portrays blacks that he was a ok with slavery and was quite the <UNK> for this quaint institution don't get mad at me this is meant as sarcasm
<START> this movie got off to an interesting start down the road however the story gets convoluted with a poor <UNK> of ancient black magic <UNK> the male lead was very good even though he gets the worst end of the stick in the climax in comparison this is <UNK> meets <UNK> br br
<START> this movie is not for everyone you're either bright enough to get it or you're not fans of sci fi films who don't take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie i recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies everyone i've recommended this film to has enjoyed it if you enjoy monty python or mel brooks films you'll probably enjoy this one the voice characterizations are done in a tongue in cheek manner and the one liners fly fast and furious
<START> while i have a great respect for disney's animated films as of late they haven't really been what i would call must see atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer and thankfully lived up to my expectations br br atlantis is a more mature disney film in the sense that it lacks songs a very unusual <UNK> for a disney film indeed and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent disney offering the world of atlantis hidden beneath the <UNK> core is fantastic presented as desolate <UNK> with ruins and then slowly developing into actual <UNK> which while usually containing some reminder of <UNK> become more and more intriguing until the <UNK> paradise itself is reached the presentation of simply <UNK> landscape and setting without some <UNK> <UNK> song gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance the inclusion of an <UNK> language as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real life ancient <UNK> adds to this and works fairly well br br also with the exception of some scenes involving <UNK> practical jokes there didn't seem to be much of a childish element that i usually associate with disney films instead the main elements were the struggle to get to atlantis and the constant discovery that occurred at atlantis as milo the <UNK> was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the <UNK> discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about part of this involves the <UNK> <UNK> which is used in a very action packed climax which is for lack of a better word quite exciting br br granted not all of the story makes full sense and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer generated visual effects but aside from the toy story movies this is the most entertaining disney film i've seen in years
<START> i may have seen worse films than this but i if i have i don't remember or possibly <UNK> them out who knows if i was to <UNK> <UNK> i may remember them along maybe with been <UNK> by aliens as a child or other <UNK> if so i would happily exchange those memories for the ones i have of watching this film br br i should give the film some credit it did produce an emotional response i actually started to become angry at scenes that <UNK> other films and tv programs that this travesty was <UNK> them by association i am terrified that i may be unable to watch films like dr <UNK> again without this film <UNK> across my minds eye
<START> i sat through this at <UNK> only because it was quiet and i could <UNK> what a waste of time beverly <UNK> and william <UNK> wtf were the lady who played <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> busy or something br br truly a piece of unfunny garbage the characters were stereotypical without meaning to i think and wooden most of them seemed like they were on <UNK> the so called hilarious situations described in some of the other so called reviews were so hackneyed i <UNK> for the writers br br i'm confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time seriously i'm only giving it 3 out of 10 because in order to be a 2 or 1 it would need to be either five hours long or feature more kelly <UNK>
<START> if you <UNK> seen this movie i highly recommend you do it's an excellent true story i love alison <UNK> she is so talented side note i also loved her in <UNK> heaven the whole story line is amazing and the way they chose there characters <UNK> awesome the acting in this film is br br very awesome
<START> question how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in full furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode answer quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as george burns does here br br i know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine richard benjamin is very funny as straight man trying to get at burns through the window etc even the small parts are great br br there are so many funny scenes <UNK> messing up the commercial burns repeating his answers as if <UNK> br br a delight br br <UNK>
<START> i went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about and i was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6 oscars and 7 9 rating on imdb as of today br br kathryn <UNK> should be the <UNK> director ever to win the best picture and best direction oscar for this sort of a really really bad movie and i wonder why did the totally unrealistic <UNK> bomb <UNK> man storyline mean anything to somebody that i failed see why did i keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad western movie about a cowboy doing <UNK> <UNK> in the wild wild west infected with <UNK> red indians but just that it was set in a different background this time was it given the oscars because the director being ex of james cameron and made it a nice underdog <UNK> story for day time tv shows to <UNK> on or was it some sort of <UNK> clothes syndrome where most people realized it was junk but just couldn't say so because others didn't seem to be saying it out <UNK> br br and finally what was with that sniper scene where they showed the shell <UNK> dropping in high resolution super slow mo as if to convey a <UNK> <UNK> or something something in the lines of <UNK> guys make good <UNK> all of a sudden and they will get the filthy terrorists all the <UNK> was it just me who felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie <UNK> in for no apparent reason and you can get the oscars for editing and directing for that br br if you haven't seen this yet don't waste your money on tickets wait till they run it on tv in a few years you are not going to miss much
<START> here we have a movie which fails in pretty much every way it is possible for a movie to fail terrible script lousy acting amateurish directing laughable special effects it's just an utterly awful movie not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you'll realize the whole thing doesn't make a <UNK> of sense after spending the whole movie wondering what in the world is going on here when things are finally explained you realize the story has been built on a foundation which is <UNK> impossible in one of those hideous villain explains the whole movie sequences we are told that our villain has done something which quite simply can't be done and which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever oh and after that we see that there also appears to be some kind of <UNK> o monster involved i'm sure drew barrymore would very much like to pretend this movie never happened if for some <UNK> reason you are ever tempted to sit down and watch this movie may i suggest instead taking that time to bang your head against a wall for <UNK> minutes that would prove to be a much more <UNK> experience than sitting through this garbage
<START> william powell is philo vance in the <UNK> murder case a 1933 film also starring mary <UNK> paul <UNK> eugene palette helen <UNK> and ralph morgan a dog show in which philo has entered his scottish <UNK> captain serves as the background for a locked room mystery with too many suspects the mystery is very clever and the denouement both complicated and interesting since the <UNK> are still quite young the camera work is a little static but michael <UNK> does a good job directing the action br br the supporting cast is excellent the entire cast brings the film up a notch lots of actors have played philo vance including paul lukas basil <UNK> <UNK> hyde white edmund lowe james <UNK> alan curtis warren william and others powell played it the most five times and is the best fit for the role very relaxed but serious at the same time this was made before the thin man <UNK> him to big stardom he had spent about 12 years in film by then beginning his career on stage in <UNK> at the age of 20 a remarkable man a remarkable screen presence and a remarkable actor who lived to be nearly <UNK> we're so lucky to have his films available on dvd and on tcm today the <UNK> murder case is a great story and a fun film don't miss it
<START> in the seemingly endless quest to find well made well acted horror films it is all too rare to find one that even comes remotely close to hitting the mark needless to say i was very pleasantly surprised when i stumbled across burned at the stake on a u s cable network while i was flipping channels the premise is reasonably simple in <UNK> young ann <UNK> swift is the most vocal witness against alleged witches <UNK> <UNK> charges against anyone who earns her <UNK> <UNK> her for his own ends is <UNK> <UNK> peters who also serves as the <UNK> guide on matters <UNK> to witchcraft and <UNK> things get complicated when ann starts <UNK> members of the <UNK> family of witchcraft <UNK> of 1980 or so <UNK> graham also played by swift begins having unusual visions shortly before she visits the <UNK> witch museum a strange man in <UNK> century <UNK> tries to <UNK> her there and the building he continues to stalk her while strange <UNK> begin to involve her more and more soon it appears that she is becoming possessed by the spirit of ann <UNK> unfortunately further description gets rather involved and would give too much away though the film is not action oriented and would likely be of little interest to many viewers the performances are good and the <UNK> century dialogue used in the film's many flashbacks sounds very convincing the production values are solid with the possible exception of some of the special effects in a side note the film's technical <UNK> was laurie <UNK> <UNK> official witch viewers who appreciate a well made atmospheric but understated horror film may appreciate this the writer director bert i gordon has had a long career in horror and science fiction filmmaking and is best known for his work on a number of big bug films and similar works years earlier
<START> this ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies i've seen so far on <UNK> on demand they seem to pick up every straight to dvd crap fest they can find and put it on here br br why who knows apparently anyone with a digital camera and a <UNK> budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on tv to be honest this looked terrible from the moment i saw the trailer but i did give it a real chance br br i always try to have an open mind about low budget movies some of the best movies i've ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be great br br this is not one of those movies br br you know the plot by now i'm sure if you're reading this either you heard about it on <UNK> on demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom it's about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad heavy metal music video whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting but it really really doesn't anyway she kills herself then she possesses someone then some killing starts it's really <UNK> and as completely average and boring as possible when the first <UNK> goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping was that the best sound effect they could come up with i could find a better sound effect to use for free with no <UNK> on the internet right now br br don't let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you they are obviously either <UNK> of the film or maybe even the director trying to con you into thinking this piece of junk is worth buying br br laughable
<START> i did not know for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not what in fact drew my attention what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that i have ever seen was of the <UNK> bravery and the honor to have served in her <UNK> service this film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should be however i cant say enough for the courage <UNK> by sgt cutter in defense of the uniform that he too would of sacrificed his life to save from peril of the sort that they and the <UNK> were threatened with the <UNK> of this <UNK> group br br to be certain sgt cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this <UNK> belief not only in each other but in her <UNK> the queen of england i think for all of his lust for money and the such that that character was great a reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know fear i think grant was excellent in this role truly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that he wore i never felt <UNK> was a shoe in in fact there was so much confidence in there <UNK> that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a picture what do i mean this picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what or why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attention both <UNK> and <UNK> are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a <UNK> daring as to there jobs as men in the service of her <UNK> these three seem to bring things off rather well and i believe it is a useful even enjoyable <UNK> when <UNK> has a date with destiny or so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it <UNK> is it believable i don't know i think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the <UNK> of death in <UNK> and they are dragging there <UNK> as they are approaching the main gates to the <UNK> post when <UNK> allows the other two to know that he is leaving the service and getting married and going into the tea business <UNK> says he could sign up for another 9 years it will make a man out of him i like that sentiment br br i don't think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave <UNK> courageous soldiers representing your very best interests where does this end in fact it may never end those interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that i enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps i enjoyed the picture when i was ten years old i had never known about the <UNK> of this film up to recently when i went into history and found the information about <UNK> there is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the <UNK> of <UNK> this motion picture takes on a quality that i refer to as intelligence this is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attempted i think this is an excellent film george stevens directed br br there is a few items to be aware of i don't think all the information will <UNK> with history however when the journalist is addressed as mr <UNK> things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is <UNK> <UNK> george stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurred the information is honest compelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love gunga din there is in the distance the black watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the <UNK> can be warned sgt cutter is seriously wounded and <UNK> as well as <UNK> are restrained din having a deep wound at the base of his back as the result of a <UNK> thrust deeply into his body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the colonel of impending peril with a effort worthy of our most <UNK> desires in this life time din slowly climbs and manages to scale the <UNK> which rests as the top of the <UNK> temple the sound of gunga <UNK> horn allows the approaching army to be <UNK> a very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is <UNK> it is so dramatic and tense filled position that as gunga din lay dead on a pile of rocks which his bullet <UNK> body now shows sgt cutter says good work soldier i don't know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the <UNK> is <UNK> of the impending peril br br the end is far from being anti climatic it is the telling of who gunga din is and what he means now to the <UNK> men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificed <UNK> knows his heart and asks the colonel to take care of his <UNK> papers and this makes <UNK> quite pleased with the colonel being honest places the <UNK> papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate time the colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough <UNK> for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defense <UNK> says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a <UNK> <UNK> this is a very sober point and then he comes to din now here is a man who has no actually status so i am going to <UNK> him a <UNK> and his name shall be written on the rolls of our <UNK> dead the poem is read as though it was just penned by <UNK> himself who stands by the <UNK> with the colonel and the rest of the men gunga din bravo
<START> i picked this film up at my local library having met the director at a film festival late last year i was curious to check out his work i was pleasantly surprised br br the film takes a fresh look at familiar subjects love infidelity friendships jealousy it can be a bit <UNK> at times but never so much as to completely sink the film i enjoyed watching a love story with characters that clearly belong together and watching them make conscious decisions rather than <UNK> falling into something as important as love br br the contrast between this film and the average low budget shoot <UNK> up black film is quite distinct check it out if you're lucky your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine did good stuff
<START> sergio <UNK> <UNK> in his grave if there was any film that <UNK> upon a man's life work its this one the lead character's lone wolf <UNK> is uninspiring and lame and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education <UNK> idea this was should be horse whipped the only reason i'm spending time <UNK> it is because there's a 10 line minimum sergio <UNK> family should sue not because its crap but because now it's <UNK> as crap by <UNK> 3000 shame disgust i blame hollywood at least gary busey makes crap that wont offend anyone but cocaine users and weapon experts this film is pure <UNK>
<START> really really bad how does a film this bad get made i kept waiting for some redeeming plot point interesting camera work or at least some gratuitous nudity but i got nothing i had just watched cabin fever and i thought it was an train wreck except for the nudity and <UNK> but it looks like genius compared to this dreck the best script doctor in the world couldn't have saved this <UNK> pile of of <UNK> poo br br the only thing going for this film is that it ended br br i've got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something ugh i'm glad i only paid 5 for it and it will soon end up in a <UNK>
<START> revenge is one of my favorite themes in film <UNK> the <UNK> of revenge is one of my favorite themes in film having seen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 2002 i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme instead this film is a weak half hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus br br spoilers the end scene a gratuitous male on male rape torture scene came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy however the film doesn't even follow through with this instead the drawn out scene which far <UNK> the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was <UNK> is <UNK> with a shot of <UNK> face in an expression of either regret or this didn't fix anything while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background br br my problem with the scene wasn't one of shock but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience i mean do we feel bad for the rapist do we <UNK> in <UNK> revenge are we disgusted by the brutality of it all do we feel <UNK> moment of <UNK> clarity aside from this failing the film is really sort of <UNK> paced with more style than substance character's are thin dialog is monotonous etc br br normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent didn't really seem to know what those were thumbs down
<START> i will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about to prevent it from happening again i agree with the comments from the gentleman from uk the movie was pretty terrible all cliché no real plot historical and technical inaccuracies abound look up the technical <UNK> on de <UNK> or any <UNK> class <UNK> <UNK> and you will see what i mean i now its black history month in the us and im going to be called a racist just for saying this but the history of this ship is not that great they did some <UNK> work chased a submarine that turned out to be a hulk that they <UNK> sorry but black people did a lot more in wwii then this silly movie gives them credit for this movie makes them look like <UNK> let the name calling <UNK> i can handle it
<START> usually when we use the word <UNK> we mean it <UNK> warren <UNK> big screen version of dick tracy proves that <UNK> can be good this is truly one entertaining movie as the eponymous yellow clad <UNK> title character beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate ready for action but not without his weaknesses br br from there the rest of characters are almost a world <UNK> themselves tess <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is as glamorous as one would expect the <UNK> of any crime fighter to be breathless <UNK> madonna is possibly the most <UNK> person imaginable big boy <UNK> al pacino is the average villain ruthless but cool other characters include the speech challenged <UNK> dustin hoffman the over musical <UNK> keys mandy <UNK> and the kid charlie <UNK> charles <UNK> james <UNK> dick van dyke <UNK> parsons catherine o'hara seymour <UNK> paul sorvino and kathy bates also star br br oh wait a minute i haven't even explained the plot the plot involves tracy trying and failing so far to find some way to <UNK> big boy simultaneously some very bizarre events have been going on in town the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks br br of course the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch if warren beatty was having trouble acting his age then he made good use of that here dick tracy is one cool movie
<START> ok honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great its really not there were two good things that came out of this movie 1 jack's performance he was very good i can tip my hat for him 2 <UNK> performance he was good no other then that it got pretty stupid and what was stanley kubrick thinking <UNK> <UNK> as the wendy she was so bad she looked the same every time she got scared the problem with this movie was the ending i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently and the over all movie was just stupid the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off 3 10
<START> i saw this film at a pre release screening at the writers <UNK> theater in beverly hills as i recall the film's producers and director were in <UNK> presumably to gage our reaction br br many scenes <UNK> <UNK> of laughter from the audience which would have been fine if it had been a comedy but it was supposed to be a horror film br br if the audience wasn't scared it seems the filmmakers were they <UNK> release for over a year out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they'd re cut it as far as i can tell they hadn't it was the same lousy movie just a year older br br it almost qualifies as so bad it's good but it's slow paced and boring
<START> warning mild spoilers ahead br br yes i realize it's tough to spoil an historical documentary but i do reveal some of the <UNK> and methods br br this is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage but also due to the story behind it because the <UNK> did not set out to tell the story of 9 11 but rather that of a rookie <UNK> the men's emotions and the viewer's connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard <UNK> br br in a filmmaking sense 9 11 is <UNK> if the events were an actual script they would be superb as the characters are established then thrown a <UNK> to which they must react this is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to <UNK> through to piece this story together br br the first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station specifically how a rookie <UNK> himself into a crew of veterans that part alone is quite good and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course it probably would have been solid the brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a nyc <UNK> br br then of course all hell breaks loose the chaos following the <UNK> attacks is vividly seen as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations seeing not only the attacks but also the first hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion br br the aftermath in which <UNK> are discovered to be lost and found is human drama at its peak life and death hang in the balance unlike many movies the viewer not only doesn't know who will live and die but genuinely cares about them br br the only negative thing i have to say about this is that the robert deniro whom i like <UNK> were <UNK> unnecessary and didn't advance the story at all they were probably added just to attract more television viewers br br bottom line the best documentary i've ever seen <UNK> portrayals of raw human emotion and drama 9 5 out of 10
<START> this movie is amazing the plot was just wow br br i was very surprised by <UNK> and <UNK> performance after growing up in the american world of the actors who can't sing and singers who can't act br br in this movie a young sho gackt comes across a vampire <UNK> hyde over time they form an unlikely friendship <UNK> is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others the half life of a vampire br br it's a sad movie but not sappy the plot was very unique and contrary to your typical vampire flick the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very <UNK> br br the only fault i would say the movie had despite it's lack of a happy albeit <UNK> would be it's multiple languages i had the <UNK> version i'm lucky that i understood it all save some of the <UNK> so i would recommend getting something with subtitles br br all in all the movie was just awesome
<START> marilyn miller made only three films before her <UNK> death the marvelous sally <UNK> the comedy her <UNK> love 1931 and this <UNK> sunny 1930 it is quite poor both as an early <UNK> and as an attempt at a musical although she has four dance numbers she only sings two songs who and one man alone the rest of the score including the <UNK> title tune are <UNK> although we can hear the latter in the background <UNK> miller looks overweight and amateurish here no star quality at all even her dancing is <UNK> the film is very badly written stock full of stale and unfunny jokes and stupid situations if you're interested in miller as a performer by all means check it out but for general entertainment stay away
<START> exceedingly complicated and drab i'm a bright guy but this was just too much for a tired brain it would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing probably better for the us market <UNK> himself hinted that this alone did not supply his oscar and you can see why br br still the sand <UNK> are pretty the nail pulling is nasty the <UNK> drunk dad is a mystery the <UNK> is good to see br br very difficult to write the required ten lines on this despite it being over 2 hours long thank heavens they <UNK> it admittedly we don't get to the pictures much but the last film we saw walk the line was 10 times better and i don't really like johnny cash my wife says george still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there's that am i nearly there yet br br how about now
<START> one of the best true crime movies ever made and very faithful to truman <UNK> book which invented the true crime novel genre haunting <UNK> jones musical score and terrific acting by scott wilson and robert blake as dick and perry the killers why wilson didn't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me br br the black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch the re creation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off the movie was filmed in the actual clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders the movie has a very documentary feel besides the scenes at the actual clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to nancy <UNK> beloved horse babe is even in the movie will <UNK> has a great turn as the <UNK> in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real clutter murder <UNK> portraying themselves as the jury for the movie br br this is a solid movie scary every time you see it
<START> first of all this movie starts out on a really dumb note a 10 year old girl playing around in a moving vehicle decides it would be funny to cover up her mom's eyes with her hands and then causes a horrific accident which kills the mom duh i am sorry there is positively no 10 year old that dumb the rest of the movie does not get much better after the death of the mother by the apparent dumbest 10 year old on the planet the dad moves the family to <UNK> italy where he is to teach at a local university but here is the <UNK> he does not speak a word of italian then the little girl has visions of <UNK> who she killed and often subsequent night <UNK> which always always end by the father holding and <UNK> her then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found followed by of course more <UNK> and crying to the point that i was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid ignorant people off the planet do not get me wrong because i love <UNK> but an indie about dumb people and i mean really dumb is simply ridiculous and pointless it is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters <UNK> in such retarded scenarios because the locale was interesting
<START> within the first 17 minutes of director <UNK> <UNK> darkman iii die darkman die we have already been subjected to a silly <UNK> and accompanying voice over on the first two films hilarious over acting about three minutes of footage simply ripped from the second film and re edited slightly to seem like new footage and a lengthy <UNK> the <UNK> and tormented title character watches about universal theme parks universal being the company that distributed this film yes darkman iii die darkman die is quite the handful when it comes to cheap cash ins on the success of a previous film br br this time around the <UNK> anti hero <UNK> <UNK> aka darkman portrayed by mummy actor arnold <UNK> locks <UNK> with evil crime lord and lousy husband peter <UNK> played in a brilliantly over the top performance by jeff <UNK> and over the course of the <UNK> minute film grows to develop an affection for <UNK> wife and daughter once again learning to care for another person br br blah blah blah br br this film is basically just a silly way for the studio to make some more money off of sam <UNK> original film which i consider to be a great action suspense film br br oh yeah and there are also a number of silly sub plots including a <UNK> who supposedly was one of the original doctors to save darkman following his <UNK> and her <UNK> our hero into thinking she is an ally before revealing her <UNK> plot to help <UNK> create more super human powered thugs like darkman apparently she can't just do the same <UNK> on the thugs that she performed on darkman why i can't really explain it because the movie certainly doesn't br br there's also an assassination sub plot involving a district <UNK> who is threatening to bring down <UNK> organization and some other very silly things going on br br but it doesn't really add up this film feels like two or three episodes of a television show edited together more than an actual film the direction <UNK> between pretty good and downright sloppy a scene where darkman rides his train like vehicle and <UNK> a rocket <UNK> is just plain silly and the editing is a mixed bag the film just moves too quickly for anyone to really care what's going on and without spoiling it the final 15 minutes of this movie and indeed the entire series is just kinda i <UNK> another 15 minutes of mixed bag footage br br in fact commenting on the editing one of my favorite things in this film is watching for footage re used from the previous films and then looking for footage within this film that is repeated multiple times yes it's that cheap it's one thing to do a re cap at the beginning of the film and maybe repeat a shot or two but in the sheer volume they do it minutes of footage repeated from previous films it's just sloppy and amateurish br br also i have to say that <UNK> psychedelic montage freak outs are a bit overdone in this film they are so stylized and overdone that they do work but only in light doses and in proper context as <UNK> did in the original film here there are at least four or five and they feel very abrupt and out of place br br that being said the film is not without some good points a few action scenes are well done the cliché story of darkman yearning for a real life works suitably for a direct to dvd feature some of the acting is nice particularly from <UNK> wife portrayed by the beautiful <UNK> dawson also while no danny <UNK> composer randy miller <UNK> some nice music that builds off of <UNK> original themes br br but overall the film is too quick cheap and silly to be taken seriously arnold <UNK> seems <UNK> bored and <UNK> from scene to scene and <UNK> while a joy to watch as an over the top villain just doesn't quite fit in with the series br br like darkman ii i would recommend this to fans of the original who will surely get a laugh otherwise you need not apply a four out of ten
<START> <UNK> s <UNK> was in charge of production but that made him the so called line producer but who produced this epic filmed not in arizona but in <UNK> <UNK> desert where <UNK> have made off with all of the <UNK> of the gold temple the <UNK> <UNK> the british <UNK> at <UNK> the village of <UNK> etc the minor technical faults can and must be forgiven what's unforgivable is the lack of an oscar for best music although maybe the academy didn't offer such at the time a single theme was played in various <UNK> including <UNK> march and sweet mood setting brilliant one of the curious aspects of the production was the widow <UNK> demands an actor playing <UNK> appears briefly before and after the battle scenes in the initial release his scenes were cut per mrs <UNK> demands later they were included and <UNK> a connection of <UNK> immortal poem to ben <UNK> screenplay interestingly this very typically and pro british story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the british
<START> i ran across this movie at the local video store during their <UNK> sidewalk sale while <UNK> thousands of videos hoping to find a few cartoon movies for sale i came across this movie i read the back of the movie and knew it was god's hand at work for me to purchase this movie you see i have a sibling group of three foster and soon to be adopted children living with my family immediately my foster children made a connection with the three children starring in the movie the movie helped them better understand their own circumstances for the first time also the oldest of the sibling group 7 year old female decided to open up to me a little bit about her past and the trauma she had experienced she has been fighting the entire trust issue this is also the first time i had seen her cry after watching the film i asked her what it meant for a child to be adopted she <UNK> it means to be happy a must see for families who are <UNK> children and are considering <UNK> it certainly opened the lines of communication with us
<START> <UNK> is incredibly slow and i'm a david mamet fan the movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very <UNK> <UNK> film after that the movie started to lose me deep and profound not really the movie <UNK> being made in <UNK> has the problem of having no ending this greatly parallels <UNK> which also lacks an ending in my opinion br br i was lucky enough to catch this movie at the <UNK> film festival i had fairly high expectations having just watched y <UNK> mama <UNK> and several other great movies i was also looking forward to jason <UNK> performance but it was not an easy film to get into if you're not into 60's sci fi or slow movies that go no where skip it br br <UNK> feels like a student film if you want a recent sci fi <UNK> indie film rent <UNK> <UNK> it won't put you to sleep
<START> how is it possible that a movie this bad can be made bad acting bad script just an embarrassment all around this is just one bad cliché after another br br this movie actually has some big name stars in it unfortunately they're singers and not actors br br this movie made hardly any money for a good reason the appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there it's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell br br this movie actually has some big name stars in it unfortunately they're singers and not actors br br this movie made hardly any money for a good reason the appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there it's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell

<START> on his birthday a small boys tells his mother he is not her son and that he wants to go home to his real mother br br in some ways comedy de <UNK> feels like it comes from a different time of movie making perhaps the 60's or 70's certainly it reminded me of <UNK> secret ceremony 1968 and richard <UNK> full circle 1977 both of which deal with loss grief and relationships between parents and <UNK> children curiously both films star <UNK> <UNK> br br all three films are populated with unsympathetic characters who behave in strange and unexplained ways all three films have a <UNK> feel both emotionally and literally all three films focus on mother child relationships and ultimately all three films pose the question <UNK> is real what is imagined ' br br beautiful but flawed it offers no easy answers and leaves much hanging unexplained and strange
<START> the movie is wonderful it shows the man's work for the wilderness and a natural understanding of the harmony of nature without being an extreme <UNK> i definitely plan to look for the book this is a rare treasure br br
<START> my life is about saving animals i do <UNK> work with a cat rescue organization i am a <UNK> because i couldn't kill an animal even to sustain my life i can't even kill a spider i put it <UNK> the scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies with sooner <UNK> in an attempt to be accepted by the other children made me sick and has haunted me ever since it simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance the ending the foster parents adopt sooner does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty why would anyone want their child to see this film
<START> a demented scientist girlfriend is decapitated so he brings her head back to life honest this is the plot of the movie he <UNK> to get her another body he <UNK> through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body for some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet at his cabin the sleaze style of the movie is laughable no one in the movie can actually act including the head the closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell the plot is slow weak and the ending is so badly done watch the mystery science theater 3000 version of this move believe me folks i wouldn't watch this movie on its own
<START> this for lack of a better term movie is lousy where do i start br br <UNK> this was perhaps the worst i've seen this year it looked like the camera was being tossed from camera man to camera man maybe they only had one camera it gives you the sensation of being a <UNK> br br there are a bunch of scenes <UNK> thrown in with no continuity at all when they did the <UNK> <UNK> it was absurd everything was <UNK> flat it looked ridiculous br br the color tones were way off these people need to learn how to balance a camera this <UNK> is poorly made and poorly done br br the plot you got to be kidding if i was an ss agent i'd sue the producers looked like the marks brothers with <UNK> and guns sutherland was in his <UNK> mode i can see this for free eva longoria would have been better with a little less on and a lot more showing as an action bimbo she wasn't much br br i couldn't see a real plot other than douglas <UNK> the <UNK> wife never did say why the <UNK> were trying to kill the <UNK> i just don't see the president of the united states running for his life in the <UNK> <UNK> of a building like a rat in a <UNK> p l e a s e br br hollywood is dead this movie is the proof i like 'the big <UNK> have since i was a kid many more <UNK> like this and i'll quit going whats the matter hollywood made so many chick flicks forget how to make a real movie if i owned a theater i'd start running the old movies the one with real actors good story lines and good <UNK> br br this <UNK> is a dog don't waste your time or money on it i rate this <UNK> a zero douglas isn't suited for this role i can over look his age but his just is to much of a <UNK> to carry this off
<START> still crazy has been compared to the spinal tap since both are comedies about wash up r r groups actually here the similarity ends because still crazy is much better written and acted out whereas spinal tap script <UNK> from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes <UNK> and <UNK> to appear sophisticated in comparison still crazy is formulaic but the <UNK> of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to <UNK> the a <UNK> predictability of the movie people who expect spinal tap like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light hearted nature of the movie but i'd take a successful self ironic romp of still crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is spinal tap
<START> this is one of the dumbest films i've ever seen it rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all br br there's not a single good line or character in the whole mess if there was a plot it was an <UNK> and as far as acting goes there's nothing good to say so ill say nothing i honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released does somebody somewhere not at some stage think <UNK> my god this really is a load of <UNK> and call it a day its crap like this that has people <UNK> <UNK> the trailer looks like a completely different film at least if you have <UNK> it you haven't wasted your time or money don't waste your time this is painful
<START> i first saw this movie back in the 1980's and now in 2006 this movie still is one of the best movies i have ever seen i would recommend anyone to look at this movie you will not be sorry it is well acted out so real and never a dull moment the acting is superb and the location makes the movie seem like you are there from the beginning right up to the end this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention the actress does an excellent job of portraying the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the amazon and it shows how she managed to survive in the amazon all alone it is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions this is why this movie is so appealing the fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming i find this movie one that i can watch over and over again and one that i never get tired of this is indeed quite a compliment as i have hundreds of movies i would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best i have ever seen
<START> superb comic farce from paul <UNK> richard dreyfuss plays jack <UNK> a fairly successful actor who is on location shooting a film in a <UNK> latin american banana republic <UNK> ruled by the fascist <UNK> <UNK> who unfortunately has <UNK> of a heart attack after <UNK> in too many local <UNK> <UNK> julia plays the <UNK> chief of police who forces the reluctant <UNK> to <UNK> the just deceased dictator who <UNK> bears a remarkable resemblance <UNK> <UNK> plays the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mistress who gives <UNK> a few lessons in how to <UNK> like a dictator jonathan <UNK> literally rounds off the cast as a cia man in <UNK> posing as a <UNK> salesman can <UNK> win over the people of <UNK> and hold off the rebels and give the performance of a lifetime without losing his in the process sammy davis <UNK> has a cameo as himself who <UNK> <UNK> the national <UNK> of <UNK> as well as begin the <UNK> frog number one <UNK> <UNK> pops up as a kindly servant <UNK> is also on hand as a <UNK> maid the score by maurice <UNK> is excellent
<START> i searched out this one after seeing the hilarious and <UNK> challenging clueless 1995 perhaps alicia <UNK> best known effort from early in her film career true crime has kevin dillon which should be helpful in <UNK> most film projects in fact everyone in the cast does a good job the only disappointment i think the movie has for me is an awkward feel to some of the scenes coming from the need to run a quite <UNK> grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a <UNK> adventure br br alicia <UNK> is pretty good in this one she carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing <UNK> that affects mary <UNK> as she <UNK> towards the truth behind the serial murders i <UNK> her characterization of <UNK> has some <UNK> in it too the <UNK> of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law <UNK> it could be really interesting for an older <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> at a time of crisis later in the <UNK> life just a thought br br true crime shows its director in a good light pat <UNK> also has the writing credit i don't know of any other film work <UNK> has done i can only wonder what happened after such a promising start br br like most productions this one has a largely unknown supporting cast although bill <UNK> detective jerry <UNK> is hardly that over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances i recall seeing him recently in <UNK> 1998 a made for tv presentation with a military theme bill <UNK> played captain <UNK> fans of the classic us tv comedy show who's the boss may also have an interest in <UNK> because the leading player is <UNK> light remembered with affection by many because of her lengthy involvement with the show br br true crime could easily not have worked but it does ok i think it is an entertaining story worth seeing
<START> while not as bad as his game to movie adaptations this hunk of <UNK> doesn't fare much better br br boll seems to have a <UNK> inability to accept that he doesn't make good movies one of these days he'll run out of money and stop <UNK> the world with his bombs br br the acting was sub par the dialog sounded like they were reading <UNK> and <UNK> special little <UNK> were seen throughout the whole thing br br like all uwe boll movies this one just shouldn't exist br br plain and simple br br just like uwe boll himself shouldn't exist
<START> yes mtv there really is a way to market daria what started as a clever teenage angst comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their <UNK> teenage life sitcom now mutated into a how you should deal with your problems <UNK> i used to watch daria all the time and loved it now sitting here after watching the so called movie i can only wonder what the point of this all was daria tells us how to lead out life in college excuse me didn't the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it this entire thing reminded me of the scene in reality bites the movie channel shows the <UNK> for the first time
<START> oh dear lord how on earth was any part of this film ever <UNK> by anyone it <UNK> of cheese from start to finish but it's not even good cheese it's the <UNK> <UNK> most tasteless cheese there is and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually truly enjoyed it yes if you saw it with a load of drunk stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen i watched it with an up for a few laughs guy having had a few beers in <UNK> to chuckle away at the film's expected <UNK> we got the <UNK> plenty of it but not the chuckles it doesn't even qualify as a so bad it's good movie it's just plain bad very very bad here's why look away if you're <UNK> the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death ok i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was but i think i <UNK> the <UNK> guy is a bit of a <UNK> who you don't want to mess <UNK> message behind the ingenious scene oh and a guy witnesses it so we already have our ultra evil bad guy and <UNK> but cute apparently good guy cue hero big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish i e hero is <UNK> to bullets everyone else falls over rather clumsily cue first plot hole how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was or that he'd watched the murder perhaps this and the answers to all my plot hole related questions was explained in the 2 minutes before i got into the cinema but i doubt it in fact i'm going to stop <UNK> holes in the plot right here <UNK> i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese so the <UNK> a very generous word to use good guy must get to la evil guy would rather he didn't hero sam stands between the two cue scenery for the next vomit inducing hour the passenger plane as i said no more <UNK> at plot holes i'll just leave it there passenger plane next the vital <UNK> up until now missing from this gem of a movie and what makes it everything it is snakes <UNK> oh pause first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have hot horny couple see if you can guess how they die dead before any snakes even appear british guy those <UNK> brits eh cute kids and jo brand for all you americans that's an english comic famous for her size and <UNK> now that we've met the cast let's watch all of them die except of course the cute kids don't expect anything original it's just snake bites on various and ever increasingly hilarious really not parts of the body use your imagination since the film makers obviously didn't use theirs br br so that's most of the film wrapped up so now for the best bit the ending as expected everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face yep ice cool sammy included but wait we're not all off the plane yet the last guy to get off is good guy but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things clearly this one had been hiding in mr jackson's hair the whole time since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier despite the <UNK> <UNK> the one that ate that <UNK> british <UNK> being unable to so sam shoots him and the snake in one fell <UNK> at this point i <UNK> that the movie was about to make a much needed u turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a <UNK> of some sort but no in a kind of <UNK> on the cake way but with stale cheese remember it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof <UNK> how anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their <UNK> is beyond me but it did well in <UNK> up the film br br actually we're not quite done yet after everyone has sucked face uncle sam with leading actress good guy with <UNK> token black guy with token white girl and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of <UNK> it's time for good guy and hero to get it on in <UNK> nope it wasn't at all exciting the <UNK> marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll yes the final shot of the film is a <UNK> surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to <UNK> a few times that's it this is the first time i've ever posted a movie review but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this <UNK> of cinematography if you like planes snakes samuel l jackson air <UNK> bad guys surfing dogs in <UNK> or english people then please please don't see this movie it will <UNK> your opinion of all of the above so far that you'll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again go see united <UNK> instead that was good
<START> any screen adaptation of a john <UNK> story deserves a mainstream hollywood approach and robert altman is about the last director i would go to for a mainstream take on anything but this southern fried pot <UNK> is pretty good while it's not among altman's best it certainly isn't among the films he's made that leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking br br altman had <UNK> his hat to the mystery thriller with noir overtones before in his 1973 film the long goodbye the <UNK> man is nowhere near as good as that film but it holds up fairly well on its own kenneth branagh is a cocky attorney who finds himself framed for murder after he gets involved with a client <UNK> <UNK> who has <UNK> his help in protecting her from her <UNK> father robert duvall the film is set in <UNK> georgia during the approach of a <UNK> storm which lends the film an oppressive atmosphere that i very much liked the twists and turns toward the film's end become <UNK> and <UNK> and altman proves himself to be not all that <UNK> at staging <UNK> but overall the film is not a bad addition to altman's <UNK> br br also starring robert downey jr <UNK> hannah tom berenger and <UNK> <UNK> br br grade b
<START> so finally i know it exists along with the other uk <UNK> on here i saw this on what must have been it's only uk screening in the 70's i remembered the title but got nowhere when i mentioned it to people it <UNK> me that's 2 <UNK> but when you go to bed with doom <UNK> about your brain and listening all around for impending terror then isn't that what a truly classic horror movie is all about i can barely remember the <UNK> of the movie but what i do <UNK> is my <UNK> flesh and <UNK> senses can anyone confirm my <UNK> that this is black and white again if anyone has any info on how to obtain a copy of this please get in touch
<START> another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story within 15 minutes the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines so there is absolutely no mystery which <UNK> a whole <UNK> of the suspense the only half way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film so we're left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things low budget films can't afford expensive special effects so the cgi portions are <UNK> unimpressive but were at least a valid attempt the creature suit is terrible as seen when it falls to the sidewalk and the director keeps <UNK> the eyes which aren't even the red color shown in mirror shots the dialogue is clumsy and uninspired with some lines reminiscent of aliens or terminator the last action sequence takes place in a police station also a rip off from terminator with everyone hiding in the one glass <UNK> office that the <UNK> doesn't smash into in the end the girl calls the hero a good <UNK> but he gets both his partners the original <UNK> and at least three other civilians not to mention a dozen cops all killed without getting a decent shot off in spite of an <UNK> of silver bullets and a <UNK> gun but here's the real <UNK> for bad writing they could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes instead they took it into custody
<START> i like british humor i believe it's one of the best in the world i like almost every british sitcom okay maybe not <UNK> python some of the jokes were great but some of them i didn't understand but this league of gentlemen is just something good to make you sick this show was good in some way it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel i'm not hungry anymore this is really just disgusting sick and not even funny tv show and i wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff i watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off it was so disgusting watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and <UNK> on the car i mean what's so funny about that it makes me wanna <UNK> no humor just disturbing images and cheap toilet laughs i don't know if you like this stuff you go ahead watch it but to be honest people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems garbage
<START> this is a cute and sad little story of cultural difference <UNK> is a beautiful japanese woman who has run to california to escape from a failed relationship in japan ken is a japanese american <UNK> <UNK> with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little <UNK> to offer a potential partner <UNK> marries ken in order to be able to stay <UNK> in the u s with the understanding that although they will live together until she gets a green card the marriage will be in name only it soon develops that the parties are not on the same <UNK> or perhaps in the same time zone hence the title of the movie as an <UNK> attorney i have seen such <UNK> take on a life of their own so i was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation
<START> absolutely one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time it starts off badly and just <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is woefully miscast in a <UNK> role and leo <UNK> <UNK> struggles with what is essentially a cardboard <UNK> character the only cast member with any enthusiasm is tom <UNK> who <UNK> it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role the script is dire the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double <UNK> bus through it is also the most sexist movie i have ever seen <UNK> <UNK> character is completely unsympathetic she's seen as an evil <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> the poor innocent married man to cheat on his wife it is implied throughout the movie that she's <UNK> and the message that <UNK> that plot <UNK> just <UNK> belief at the end she isn't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who's obviously ha become demented with rage and guilt but the script allows him to kill himself thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere horrible don't waste your time
<START> there are really two sections of this film firstly there's the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and <UNK> that it would almost feel appropriate that the 'the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> should be doing the narration br br then the rest of the film begins starting off with a title song which really doesn't fit in with the rest of the film which while technically ok is killed by a vague inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters but characters that make no sense br br this is especially so with mickey <UNK> <UNK> who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the <UNK> the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly <UNK> decision to take him along when breaking out in that case he would've been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character which in the end he still is br br the overall problem of the film is that it's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy it's as if the filmmakers didn't have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an <UNK> and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions br br put simply the film fails on all levels
<START> this is a great example of a good dumb movie no it is not high art by any means nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks but so what the killer tomatoes series four movies and a cartoon series are basically good natured <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the kind of territory the <UNK> ruled before they switched to making serious flicks br br as the title suggests this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france in this case professor <UNK> john <UNK> 3rd time in the role has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the <UNK> king of france steve <UNK> returns as <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> who wants to be a <UNK> and who just happens to be a dead <UNK> for the long lost true king of france obviously he also plays the aforementioned l l t k of f happily <UNK> the french language br br <UNK> them is the <UNK> fuzzy <UNK> like the others <UNK> was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon and his human allies mark price recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series plays a <UNK> disguised version of himself passing himself as michael j fox as a way to win the girl of his dreams and angela <UNK> is a dream as marie <UNK> <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> sexuality and borderline <UNK> oh that the former miss <UNK> had had more of a film career another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick <UNK> now best known as the hapless title subject of who wants to marry a millionaire like co creator john de <UNK> <UNK> works both in front of and behind the camera in this series br br what can you say about jon de <UNK> not much really except that he had a <UNK> vision and managed to pull it off and having done that has apparently dropped into obscurity john if you ever see this thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes br br the script is heavily but not <UNK> aware that this is just a movie like return of the killer tomatoes the action occasionally <UNK> off the set and into the middle of the film crew and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former <UNK> michael j fox this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send off to the series okay the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series which was also quite clever but cartoons just aren't the same
<START> unfortunately many <UNK> who write reviews for imdb <UNK> low budget with not good whatever else this movie might need more budget really isn't part of it big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another lara <UNK> movie what we have here is a step or two better than that br br the nearly unknown alexandra <UNK> is captivating as the enigmatic modesty and this is crucial for this movie to work her wise little smiles and knowing looks are <UNK> and you find yourself wishing that the camera won't <UNK> her face it makes it <UNK> that the bad guy <UNK> played by also little known in the u s at least <UNK> coaster <UNK> might take an unusually cerebral interest in her something modesty can exploit she is able to <UNK> his <UNK> her with just a <UNK> and spitting out stop wasting my time then <UNK> off between his heavily armed yet suddenly <UNK> henchmen making a scene like that plausible doesn't happen by accident br br probably the biggest problem i have with the <UNK> thin <UNK> playing modesty is it just isn't very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and <UNK> looking guy like coaster <UNK> and beat him she just ain't a <UNK> wilson or a <UNK> up <UNK> <UNK> type actress who can throw a convincing punch coaster <UNK> letting himself be <UNK> by <UNK> looks like he's just <UNK> with his little sister br br since this is not really an action film this isn't a big flaw i just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels
<START> this movie is just a lot of fun i've seen it a couple of times but it always has something funny that i remember the <UNK> and <UNK> car scene is one of my favorites and i still quote <UNK> versions of certain words br br there are so many running jokes that it's amazing but i love michael keaton anyhow
<START> the movie was a big car commercial br br but who cares i went to the theater to view the <UNK> <UNK> angelina cage br br so i guess it was a good movie <UNK> br br
<START> i saw this movie when it came out when i was 17 years old and into classic rock still am br br i never liked opera before because i hate soprano voices but he changed all that he was adorable in the movie and had such an amazing voice br br i heard on <UNK> that he died tonight at home of <UNK> cancer he will be missed and he definitely left his mark on this world br br i hope to buy this movie if i can find it watch and enjoy smile maybe i should head over to amazon com and have a look before it's sold out
<START> five minutes after watching this i <UNK> on to imdb to warn all of you out there not to bother with this movie genre horror it had moments of mild suspense and throughout the whole movie i was thinking to myself somethings gotta happen soon it did not when the movie ended i felt so embarrassed for the writer director i've never been the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this sorry excuse of a horror flick i've gone from not been the biggest fan to will not watch another of his works br br i was taken in by the plot summary please don't make the same mistake br br i gave this movie a 2 for the actors they were not bad and it wasn't there fault they got such bad direction
<START> i don't think this movie is for everyone but i saw it this weekend in seattle and i thought it was so funny i haven't laughed that hard during a movie in long time i thought the entire cast did a great job you will find yourself laughing from the first moment through the very last scene i suspect some <UNK> especially the ones who take themselves way too seriously will be turned off by this brand of humor not me the movie was a real surprise and the entire theater was rolling with laughter throughout the showing i went to which makes me think that a lot of people enjoyed themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies for a change i cannot wait to see it again if you're in the mood to lol then this is for you funny funny funny funny
<START> there is a reason why jay leno himself will not acknowledge this film it consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time the acting is horrible the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn't seem sure on which way to take this film a buddy film an action comedy mystery seems half way through he gives up and is just along for the ride jay leno and pat <UNK> are talented and dedicated performers it is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie jay leno and pat <UNK> prior to involving themselves with this had spent years <UNK> out their <UNK> on the hollywood circuit mr <UNK> had already been a star in his own right acting <UNK> since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult tv and movie classics as happy days and the dismal but <UNK> mr t and tina and won the hearts of america with his roles in the powerful film <UNK> the karate kid and a host of others mr leno can been seen on tv shows dating back to the mid 70s and was a top performer in the comedy <UNK> of america he can be seen in countless tv spots and in major films it is a shame that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense
<START> this movie had no parts that were hilarious mostly just average funny <UNK> but it did not have any parts that were really bad either the worst part was the voice of sid his <UNK> <UNK> was just too much for me by about 5 minutes in i was sick of hearing him talk aside from the annoying <UNK> voice the movie was good there were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better this is a good movie for kids it has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids this one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them
<START> utter dreck i got to the 16 minute 27 second point and gave up i'd have given it a negative number review if that were possible although <UNK> is a more fitting word unlike the <UNK> you could see and practically feel between macmurray and stanwyck in the original the chemistry between dumb ol' <UNK> crenna and whats her face here is just non existent the <UNK> becomes an unattractive <UNK> <UNK> there's no <UNK> lighting by <UNK> and i thought i'd be sick when they have a <UNK> looking and rightly so believe you me lee j <UNK> as <UNK> practically <UNK> <UNK> his way through the explanation of his little man to mr <UNK> no <UNK> to the non <UNK> but it looks as though a <UNK> of blind men ran <UNK> with the set design of both the <UNK> and <UNK> houses the same goes for those horrid <UNK> pants that <UNK> wears and <UNK> how much does <UNK> make that he lives <UNK> a huge <UNK> this folks again all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes if you can get through more of it you have a much stronger <UNK> than me or you are a <UNK> but please take some <UNK> <UNK> first or you will develop a little man of your own that may never go away proceed with caution obviously
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> that thinks like a man is back now being driven by maggie <UNK> lindsay <UNK> a young woman who hopes to become a <UNK> champion the only thing standing in her way is the current champion trip murphy matt dillon who will do anything to stop them br br the original love bug wasn't that good even as a kid i remember not liking it very much i had some hope for the sequel though i mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie unfortunately <UNK> is no better now than he was before the film is <UNK> weak for people over the age of 12 it will probably entertain the kids but that's all br br i realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting there were very few laughs and it got boring near the end most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too lindsay <UNK> was alright as maggie <UNK> she usually gives better performances like in freaky friday and mean girls matt dillon gave the best performance out of everyone he was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with justin long <UNK> meyer and michael keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special br br angela robinson directs and she does an okay job she tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script thomas lennon and ben <UNK> wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for taxi and the <UNK> these two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable it's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder in the end <UNK> is a safe predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid everyone else is better off skipping it rating 4 10
<START> i've seen thousands of movies and have never written a review but the red eye i witnessed is so at odds with the glowing <UNK> posted here that i'm compelled to offer my two cents in protest and vote the lowest score possible just to bring the average closer to reality br br this is a dull boring stinker of a film that is memorable only for its <UNK> depictions of the <UNK> target a john <UNK> esquire bully <UNK> who's really a great guy don't you know and of the oh so handsome and popular dr phil whose <UNK> book one learns is read by frequent <UNK> worldwide the only real red eye i experienced was from <UNK> my eyes in disbelief br br before you <UNK> out 10 or so dollars for this b movie read the selected <UNK> from trailer ' above and ask yourself if you'll really enjoy a movie in which these were the <UNK> lines to be found unfortunately nothing else in this film is any better the basic premise is goofy as hell the acting is bland and uninspired completely lacking in pro antagonist chemistry the potential for suspense is <UNK> at every turn except during the last five minutes by poor directing and <UNK> editing the script is <UNK> with <UNK> like early reveals of the heroine as a university <UNK> star are called into question when she later battles the antagonist with a field hockey stick and the plot holes are wider than first class while character development is strictly coach br br and then there are the moments of extreme <UNK> like when the daughter of a high level public servant does not head straight for airport security at her first opportunity to warn them of an assassination plot against the both the head of <UNK> security and her father or when that same woman runs hell bent for leather along slick airport <UNK> arms <UNK> and <UNK> in her neck <UNK> while wearing 4 inch <UNK> heels or when her <UNK> chases likewise with a sucking wound in his <UNK> or when terrorists use a fishing pole to bring up their weapon from the freaking harbor bottom i'm always willing to suspend disbelief but i'm not going to leap from 30 00 feet without a <UNK> br br the one good thing i can say of this movie is that it portrays women who are capable even in bimbo form of handling the most extreme <UNK> the kind of gender <UNK> sorely lacking in american movies other than that this movie never really takes off and is no more thrilling than the red eye flight from boston to ny remember the last time you got <UNK> by <UNK> trailers and glowing <UNK> in this forum or elsewhere this is one of those times wait for the red eye video and don't watch it then either
<START> wow speechless as to the making of this film i can't say much the <UNK> at the local <UNK> should've said it all nothing but 6 actors actresses who get lost on the set of scream and decide to shoot a movie br br the acting was apparently not in the budget but they were able to afford nudity and good looking actors style over substance almost makes its mark here except most of these acting class failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they were reading this script after only 4 or 5 kills by the so called masked murderer and a confusing tie in plot about a murder club which the dumb lead actress thinks is a real club that she can join only if she can get over a girl <UNK> into her car you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself never to get overly excited by a possibly good movie such as this br br i feel bad for the people who bought this film and can't find anyone to take it off their hands another example of what's wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases with no thought put into the <UNK> throw it away if you did buy this

<START> an older man touches a flower in his wife's <UNK> that seems to be <UNK> he gets <UNK> by it or bitten by something on it he quickly becomes ill and at the hospital <UNK> out a large <UNK> white <UNK> of some kind a later attempt to <UNK> him with <UNK> results in a splatter of blood br br a cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot out somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors as well as an <UNK> who is brought in there are several young kids wandering around the hospital who i suppose we're supposed to find adorable but who are extremely annoying little <UNK> they happen to wander into the room where the <UNK> is being kept and happen to dump a growth <UNK> on it horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this but they're never even in any danger br br the <UNK> grows and starts <UNK> people run away from it and sometimes towards it for some reason the hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be br br there are no really compelling characters in the movie and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster it was fairly boring clearly it owes something to the alien movies with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth there's also a character named bishop and the lead actress has <UNK> <UNK> hair
<START> the sopranos stands out as an <UNK> dynamic exploration of american life and how the american experience is shaped and defined by money by setting the story in the <UNK> of the underworld david chase <UNK> all <UNK> to a <UNK> low to the ground and outright mean <UNK> of the post modern era br br every character represents a <UNK> of american industry tony soprano <UNK> the <UNK> working stiff torn between <UNK> duty and a need to keep his business on an even <UNK> the <UNK> of these two things is the <UNK> that keeps the story moving forward the characters of christopher paulie and bobby reflect the loyal but self serving <UNK> present in every enterprise who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit with the character of ralph joe <UNK> <UNK> a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath a twisted businessman who's <UNK> of violence are <UNK> <UNK> by his stunning <UNK> power and dominic <UNK> is the ultimate symbol of the <UNK> old guard which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up and <UNK> to <UNK> blame br br though <UNK> and occasionally disturbing the sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate tv drama br br ps a good companion piece to <UNK> series would be the shield another violent drama that manages to make the <UNK> of characters interesting
<START> <UNK> has finished running his naked mile and is now attending <UNK> house crazy stuff happens people run around naked and <UNK> are made fun of and this series is dead in the water the naked mile was a crap film but i found it to be significantly better then band camp it seems they've gone back to what didn't work for them and it shows that they don't care either you can tell where the target audience is and they nailed it perfectly young teenage boys who like to see naked women crude humour and beer drinking will love <UNK> house everyone else can pretty much look away br br star wars became a massive success that stunned audiences with it's ahead of its time special effects lord of the rings created an entire world of mythical creatures and massive battles that <UNK> the eye the matrix changed the way action and sci fi films were made specifically with the cutting edge special effects with all the <UNK> in technology we eagerly <UNK> the next big thing that will have our jaws dropped to the floor then comes american pie <UNK> house which pushes the boundaries of what technology can do when people have created <UNK> landscapes and creatures using cgi <UNK> house decides to use this technology to create <UNK> yes the thing that creates life the thing you see so many times in pornography films is created and time slows down to show us the white <UNK> shoot across the room onto a teddy bear is this funny disgusting neither <UNK> house shows more nudity then the naked mile which is surprising considering the previous <UNK> title does the film need it of course not does it ever advance the plot does it ever does it ever get a laugh does it ever get young boys <UNK> yes the women are beautiful but if i am the one who thinks there is too much nudity then you might as well just have made a porno br br the female who catches the affections of our main character is pretty and doesn't annoy the viewer like previous girls have done in the series but not once did i ever believe this character would ever do what she does i'm pretty sure every action from the characters in this film are far from realistic the american pie series has fallen from a realm of reality into a fantasy world none of the events in this film would ever happen if they ever did then i need to attend this school immediately is this film suppose to make people feel like they are having a good time well it doesn't we are watching them have a good time by the end of the film we hate them for all the fun they are having br br there is a deer hunter scene in the film but to make it funny for today's audience they decided to substitute bullets wit horse <UNK> are you laughing yet instead of shooting themselves with said <UNK> in the head or face they place the gun in their mouths are you on the floor laughing yet the first time we are introduced to <UNK> roommate he's having sex with his girlfriend are you cheering at the nudity yet the film at first seems like it will be about the boys trying to get into the frat house but then it shifts to them already being in the frat house but needing to perform certain tasks then it shifts to a competition between <UNK> and the boys it goes a little revenge of the <UNK> on us for a bit and it seems out of place i honestly do not know what these film is about because it goes all over the place br br most of the comedy seems forced for shock value even at the beginning with the dad showing his son the list of people he has had sex with the joke is in there somewhere i think it might be the fact that his wife is not the last name on the list or it could have been that one of his son's friend's mother was on the list either one it doesn't work br br i guess if you haven't guessed it yet this film is not funny nor does it seem to be focused the story is pathetic and the so called crude humour that the series has been known for doesn't shock skip this lame installment and any future ones as well i do not know why i have seen all the entries in the series but for some unknown reason they seem to have found their way to my eyes
<START> this cannon movie tale is the worst of the lot and is positive proof that a five minute fable does not a full length film make poor sid <UNK> as the vain emperor is made to look so stupid it's hard to watch him as the sly <UNK> robert morse hasn't an ounce of charm neither does his hapless nephew jason carter the songs are dreadful and only slow what there is of the plot down the direction is practically nonexistent and the supporting characters add very little <UNK> anthony is pretty as the <UNK> daughter but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason a fate shared by many of the minor players and the film <UNK> at a <UNK> pace hans christian <UNK> must have been turning <UNK> in his grave when this appeared it can honestly be said at least of this movie tale it's no surprise that it went straight to video oblivion
<START> and finally old old michael <UNK> falls over and goes <UNK> ' who really did the writing for this last installment of the godfather saga probably the same staff who does as the world turns this flick doesn't deserve the title godfather at all let's call this one the <UNK> of our <UNK> or all my <UNK> as someone who's encountered a number of mafia people in my business life i can say without exception that i've never met any mobster as <UNK> conflicted and <UNK> as michael <UNK> let's face it these guys are in the mafia solely because they're greedy nothing more in this film don <UNK> spends lots of time <UNK> his past deeds and his bleak future perhaps even the <UNK> then <UNK> remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time <UNK> he is deep down then there's his failed marriage after the break up scenes in <UNK> we may hope that michael kay will reunite as man and wife but here they seem to just become very good <UNK> friends who can laugh cry share intimate thoughts about their lives it's as if the screenwriters try to make michael into a woman it's bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for 9 years there's some <UNK> here and there or perhaps they're sins of <UNK> poor old country beautiful sophia coppola is <UNK> with a hopeless role with too many short lines in the film that don't fit what a young woman would say in casual conversations was given remarks rather than lines to <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> scene with andy garcia looks like something from a bad teen sex comedy as they chew their open mouthed kisses and <UNK> each others <UNK> on the kitchen <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> sex was brought off wonderfully by glenn close and michael douglas but it's just laughable here then there's <UNK> character <UNK> <UNK> who's also given a difficult <UNK> role to play he's expected i guess to be the new new don <UNK> but he's almost handed the job on a silver <UNK> and has to do little to <UNK> his position unlike michael's <UNK> hits on all 5 families in <UNK> this hand me down process may be an authentic way of <UNK> power in a mafia family but why is so much made of this boring routine certainly don vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday but there's little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man sadly <UNK> did such a fine job of quickly <UNK> developing michael's character in <UNK> but <UNK> has no economy in it's story telling and we suffer through drawn out <UNK> until we just want to take a <UNK> <UNK> george hamilton was also handed a <UNK> task in taking over as family lawyer after <UNK> duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as tom <UNK> george wisely <UNK> his role so it came off without damage to the actor the development of connie <UNK> character is interesting but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands she could well end up sleeping with the <UNK> if this were the real world but it's not all bad the assassination scene in the hotel <UNK> is nifty also they keep pulling me back in or words to that effect is a great line and we recover some old country feel as we get to go back to <UNK> even if it's all done in 1989 and they've got modern cars <UNK> the plot lines involving the corrupt <UNK> of the catholic church are pretty interesting since it's based on some actual financial <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> in the 1980's but it's brought too far again with the too spectacular death scenes etc the grand opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed but the death scene of mary toward the end is an <UNK> attempt of emotional manipulation at best all screenwriters need to learn that we don't always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion you feel sorry for kay that her daughter is dead she plays her grief so well but michael's reaction is hammy hammy hammy then michael dies sometime in the 21st century in <UNK> alone on a grand estate of heart failure no <UNK> to play with before his demise no wife to <UNK> for him what should have happened in the last 1 2 of this movie is michael being <UNK> down by someone like <UNK> <UNK> put on trial all his dirty family's sleazy little <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> brought into the light of day michael then convicted under rico <UNK> and sent to federal prison for life then he can <UNK> over dead from heart failure while <UNK> a floor in <UNK> that's how mafia <UNK> were ending their careers in the late 80's and early 90's and they got much better treatment than what they deserved
<START> i have seen the short movie a few years ago after that i watch all sequels the first one is really not the best but it's the most popular one i've already watch the making of guinea pig 1 it's really great what these guys did also the sequels are excellent in the special effects take your chance to watch it
<START> well it was a nice surprise after all its trailer did not predict a good film at all it was even a bit misleading especially the part of jeff bridges was a positive surprise well written <UNK> and funny less real though i do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such <UNK> towards everything that his current company stands for one does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again the ending of the film during the showing of <UNK> <UNK> was too corny cliché and quite disappointing and of course a guy like <UNK> character would not last past his first week in a <UNK> new york magazine like this i hope one day i will see a decent role written for <UNK> fox here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo and by the way i do not see why she is the sex symbol of the year i see <UNK> girls on nearly every cover of every magazine
<START> and the series lets you forget all that i am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series born in 1958 i learned to drive during the first gas <UNK> and got my first post college <UNK> job during the second gas <UNK> in 1979 the 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young <UNK> competing for after school minimum <UNK> jobs with laid off thirty somethings dreadful music worse clothes br br the funny thing is this series doesn't ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun even for those of us old enough to know better it manages to look the 70's directly in the face complete with time authentic clothing and yet fill the show with the <UNK> of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times then there are the parents the two young lovers in the show eric <UNK> and donna <UNK> truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions <UNK> parents red and kitty are not exactly june and ward although they are conventional for the decade they represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the <UNK> during the 1970's <UNK> parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness <UNK> <UNK> friends <UNK> <UNK> and jackie round out the group representing <UNK> well meaning incompetence and <UNK> respectively hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the <UNK> but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely <UNK> and <UNK> parents i highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does <UNK> a bit due to the absence of eric
<START> i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole susan sarandon is such a good actor that she made an interesting strong character out of mediocre writing the true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome
<START> slaughter high is <UNK> your <UNK> 80s slasher flick a prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt a few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the 80s slasher flicks is that it has some <UNK> flaws and <UNK> errors br br the acting is horrendous however actually not as bad as one would suspect though it doesn't help that every character in the film are so <UNK> and unlikable the lead carol <UNK> caroline <UNK> is the easily the biggest <UNK> of them all and she's the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for not to mention the geeky guy is almost too geeky and i think that even stereotypical <UNK> themselves would be <UNK> <UNK> and just downright <UNK> by how geeky he his so when he gets <UNK> does anyone really care br br there is much unintentional laughter potential <UNK> lack of acting talent is quite apparent which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast however the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose <UNK> who is in her mid 30s at the time as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers and then when it comes to later life and <UNK> is playing around her real age the rest of the cast do not pass as adults this all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal <UNK> accompanied by <UNK> laughter and a voice <UNK> i'll get you with that being said slaughter high really isn't a very good slasher flick but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it perhaps an essential for hardcore slasher fans but don't expect dilemma suspense or any credibility from it horrible
<START> this is not a commentary on the actual movie but on the <UNK> dvd release for north america i don't know if there have been different releases and <UNK> but the <UNK> we rented had a 2000 <UNK> on them if that means anything anyway the sound mixing on these dvd's was absolutely horrible the levels often <UNK> <UNK> ed up and down when the scene cut to a battlefield <UNK> the <UNK> track would thunder so <UNK> that i didn't know which would blow out first my <UNK> or my <UNK> when it was time for dialog the volume would usually drop to something barely <UNK> occasionally the orchestra and <UNK> work would stay loud while the dialog was <UNK> at a much lesser level my wife and i found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these dvd's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously <UNK> the volume and like another user has already commented when we selected english audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between russian and english and occasionally when the characters spoke in french on the native track the dubbing was in russian so you're <UNK> if you understand neither ultimately we gave up watching after the first <UNK> before you <UNK> out 50 for this movie on dvd for your own library i'd <UNK> recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when <UNK> by such bad sound particularly if you've never read the book and really want to understand the storyline
<START> if one would see a <UNK> <UNK> film with the kind of distracted semi attention which is the rule in tv watching one might be better off doing something different br br watching le million with all attention focused upon what takes place before eyes and ears will reveal a wealth of delightful details which keep this musical comedy going from the beginning to the end with its explosion of joy br br in the danish newspaper <UNK> <UNK> a journalist once wrote in my younger days i saw a film which made me feel like dancing all the way home from the cinema this film is on tv tonight see it
<START> i showed this to my <UNK> grade class about 17 years ago and the students loved it i loved it too the story of the <UNK> and their interaction with their environment is amazing the cast of creatures is deep and they all play their parts well the battle between the two cold blooded <UNK> is truly classic footage br br alan root has done some incredible camera work and this should have won the best documentary oscar the copy i have doesn't have orson welles <UNK> it derek <UNK> and it isn't called the mysterious <UNK> of clay just <UNK> of clay this makes me think that it must have been done with welles added for star power and an oscar push br br i was lucky enough to find this vhs just recently and it is now my children's favorite movie they brought it to the latest family gathering instead of a disney movie if you can find this movie you are indeed lucky
<START> the acting is some of the worst i've ever seen the characters are totally unconvincing this could be overlooked to some extent if the plot was interesting which the plot to the <UNK> was not it's sort of a bad mix between fresh and animal house except that both of those movies were good
<START> first of all this was not a three hour movie two hours ten minutes last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie perhaps though it should've been a two <UNK> for a total of about 3 hours yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and <UNK> i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen because of this movie i do now but i'm not so sure that's a good thing everything here no one really needed to know this was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made but it was made and the reason is because lucy <UNK> are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars that is definitely so not true and very very sad br br anyway what was shown here in lucy was pretty good two complaints the actress who played <UNK> vance not great casting at all and the switch from <UNK> <UNK> to rachel york <UNK> like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person that wasn't too great but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy <UNK> no the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a <UNK> to this movie because like i said this focused mainly just on lucy <UNK> had there been more time had the story been more about <UNK> entire life then maybe the kids <UNK> been there more but they weren't so we got to see the likes of gable lombard red <UNK> and buster keaton very briefly instead wow that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool his presence and influence in <UNK> life really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more oh well what was explored was done well for the most part honestly i don't think i'll ever watch this again and i don't think this <UNK> be that memorable for someone who <UNK> i love lucy but isn't an enormous lucille ball fan this should be an interesting watch my grade for this b
<START> <UNK> 1982 starring michael <UNK> <UNK> jordan robert lloyd martin <UNK> edith clever <UNK> <UNK> and the voices of <UNK> goldberg <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> director hans <UNK> <UNK> br br straight out of the german school of film the kind that <UNK> tons of symbolism and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> came this 1982 film of <UNK> final masterpiece <UNK> written to <UNK> with good friday <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> opera house this film follows the musical score and plot accurately but the manner in which it was filmed and performed is bold and avant garde and no other <UNK> takes the crown in its bizarre cinematography <UNK> is known for controversial films prior to this film he had released films about hitler and <UNK> richard wagner and his personal anti <UNK> and a documentary about <UNK> wagner one of his grand daughters this film is possibly disturbing in many aspects <UNK> sung by <UNK> goldberg but acted by michael <UNK> is a male throughout the first part of the film and then after the <UNK> of <UNK> kiss is transformed into a female this gender <UNK> element displays the feminine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nature of the quest for the holy grail which serves all mankind and <UNK> it through <UNK> blood in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there are photographs of such <UNK> sinister figures as hitler <UNK> <UNK> wagner and <UNK> mistress <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> flag hangs outside the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film the <UNK> flower <UNK> are in the nude <UNK> is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt mary <UNK> or eve from <UNK> played by edith clever but beautifully sung by <UNK> soprano <UNK> <UNK> ultimately this film is for fans of this type of bizarre <UNK> european symbolic <UNK> and for <UNK> who appreciate the symbolism the history and lovers of wagner opera indeed the singing is grand and compelling <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater <UNK> of the stage james king <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and today's own <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a sensual voiced dramatic and exciting <UNK> <UNK> into her tormented state perfectly while the production is certainly <UNK> and as un <UNK> as it can possibly get <UNK> concept was christian <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> spears <UNK> knights and wounded kings a dark <UNK> darkness turning into light etc typical <UNK> themes it is still an enjoyable art house film
<START> the storyline was okay akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie kareena kapoor looked bad there was so <UNK> and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good <UNK> i don't know why the hell did anil kapoor accepted such a bad role there was nothing much to do for him in the movie just because it is a <UNK> film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is said ali khan was alright i think that it is high time that indian directors and producers start thinking of indian customers as intelligent lot what are we fools what do they think they will show 2 men taking on a <UNK> squad to <UNK> and we will believe them is the indian police so stupid that they are trying to <UNK> some criminals they take an entire squad of 100 policemen and no one was there to surround the palace the action was crap and i have never seen such bad action akshay kumar was between a circle of 30 40 policemen all shooting at him and he shooting back at them none of the <UNK> bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen crap crap br br i think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement br br i strongly recommend not to see this movie
<START> i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall i liked it it showed great potential i guess most people here are <UNK> this film because the film did seem <UNK> together by the <UNK> own admission on the official site the short was <UNK> as a rough cut br br but nonetheless it was an easy going comedy i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy all they are supposed to do is make you laugh that's all i did just that at its showing so it succeeded on that level just my 2 cents anyway
<START> this movie <UNK> me it may be that i'm just a stupid american but i really just don't get 400 blows everything i've read about this movie has been a total rave but i just couldn't stay interested i'm sure that it was as revolutionary in film making as all the critics say but when it <UNK> right down to it it's just really really boring maybe it's the language <UNK> may i'm just not sensitive or artsy enough but whatever the case is i hated this movie the story itself isn't bad it's about a young french boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility that in itself ought to be interesting and it was at first there was nothing wrong with the dialogue but then again it's hard to say because half of the conversations weren't subtitled and for no apparent reason so i didn't always know what was going on but for the dialogue we could understand it made enough sense the actors were believable enough but it's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations so you feel for the main character but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think well that sucks the plot isn't even your typical plot each time he gets in trouble he gets into more trouble than the last time but the reasons never <UNK> too much and through the entire film you realize that there's nothing the main character can really do about it so it's more like just waiting to see how it ends the ending by the way was completely over my head it's way too artsy for me and i just didn't get it leading up to the end was easy enough to follow the structure was certainly there and it made sense as well but everything was really drawn out for the amount of dialogue and significant moments the movie could have been an hour shorter it just didn't end part of it was the unnecessarily long shots none of which were especially memorable for example the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds now i'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere but for the average viewer i'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running like doing my <UNK> or taking a <UNK> br br final verdict br br the feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson if i could only get what the director was trying to say by <UNK> unique decisions as it was i just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life
<START> although robert knox <UNK> has his fans i'm not one of them his films are <UNK> and amateurish and and just not very funny unless you're a 14 year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor br br he's certainly not famous as him immature fans would like you to believe by <UNK> people at <UNK> or <UNK> the ratings votes here at the imdb he's certainly not been <UNK> by any major media <UNK> which speaks volumes about his and his <UNK> fame br br <UNK> does have some slight skill at limited animation but he needs to get away from his young <UNK> and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer as of this moment though he's just a kid with a camera and it shows
