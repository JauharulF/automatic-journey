<START> there were only two redeeming features about this movie the beauty of <UNK> and its architecture and the way they depicted the transformation from human form to wolf form forget about the plot or storyline from the book they're completely absent from this movie in fact about the only things carried over from the book are the names of the main players even then you'll barely recognize the characterizations if the film makers had made a good movie even though unrelated to the book i wouldn't have been so disappointed unfortunately they did not the plot and storyline are typical of low budget horror flicks the acting is wooden and the directorial efforts mundane oh yes the way the bow to their leader is pure <UNK> i suppose a nod of recognition is due for the animal <UNK> the wolves were beautiful animals and well managed in their roles
<START> there seems to be a whole sub genre of cheap tired old sex comedies out there that say the same old things about middle class couples sort of like friends but with more soft porn and no wit this film is no exception it had situations so familiar i died from <UNK> <UNK> people sat on <UNK> spinning out clichés about sex and relationships check <UNK> versus cheating with some woman man who would never look twice in reality at some other woman man check porn the baddies <UNK> check some guy girl in it who happens to be the only reason you're watching this rubbish check the lesson seems to be when it doubt make a tired old sex comedy about people no one cares anything about in order to make some statement that everybody has already heard three thousand times before that'll get your film made it'll even attract some sitcom nobody in a bad wig
<START> i loved this movie jack black and kyle <UNK> have probably made one of the best comedies since up in smoke this movie has something for everyone rock drugs and satan what more could someone want i suggest this movie to anyone that wants to sit back and forget all the trouble in the world and have a good laugh even if the movie does not do well in the theaters it is sure to become a cult classic i do suggest anyone going to see the movie pick up the <UNK> first album because a lot of the jokes are made only funnier if you have heard the songs such as obsession with sasquatch and the epic battle against the devil the movie still is laughs even if you have not heard their music but the songs are so great you can't pass them up
<START> as valuable as king <UNK> tomb ok maybe not that valuable but worth hunting down if you can i notice no one has commented on this movie for some years and i hope a fresh post will spark some new comments this is a film that i remembered only snippets of from childhood and only saw recently when i tired of waiting for fox to honour its own past and hunted down the korean dvd in english but with korean subtitles i won't go through another long plot description suffice to say that seeing it for the first time in its proper widescreen format left me <UNK> at the <UNK> and the scope of the film the <UNK> paintings still hold up and the palace sets are truly breathtaking but it is the smaller scale details that lend this film its depth and <UNK> offering a glimpse into the <UNK> of poor as well as its elite the <UNK> <UNK> houses and <UNK> are as fascinating as <UNK> throne room while errors abound on the large scale most notably the <UNK> succession the details are more <UNK> <UNK> than the vast majority of hollywood's films visually it's not without its flaws the interiors are often too overly lit and colourful to blend <UNK> with the <UNK> nevertheless this is a movie that should be credited for being as <UNK> in the small as it is in the large tedious in parts absolutely <UNK> <UNK> yes both though might be a more apt description too long absolutely not i wished they had spent more time with experiences in the house of death and among the and less with his <UNK> with though historically inaccurate yes that too but so was shakespeare nobody <UNK> him for it i appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next guy but ultimately it has to be remembered that cinema is theater not a history lesson
<START> a whole bunch of teenagers gather around to discuss their fears but an <UNK> guest has showed up and is killing everybody off br br probably the worst horror film of the 90's camp blood 1999 is the only film that could challenge it for that title has some of the dumbest characters and situations to ever grace a television screen the so called surprise ending is awful as is the rest of this film mildly entertaining on a <UNK> bad it is good level my rating 2 out of 10
<START> is beautiful enough vanessa is beautiful enough i liked the storyline but i went in with the expectation to see lots of energetic hot <UNK> dancing i was disappointed there needed to be more dancing especially <UNK>
<START> i was very disappointed in this film the director has shown some talent in his other <UNK> but this just seemed to be filler there may have been a deep meaning behind it but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys br br i would highly recommend his other works to people but certainly not this one as i watched it i kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period but it never did at the end of the movie i was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way i could only say to myself what was that br br there were a few really striking parts of the film but not enough to warrant sitting through it again
<START> the ultimate gritty heist film elements of <UNK> welles sinatra will leave you <UNK> satisfied in comparison it really <UNK> the proverbial apple <UNK> to see recent films such as <UNK> eleven remake reviewed in such high regard especially in europe films like <UNK> must be shown spoke about and kept alive to remind younger pathetic critics what true classic noir is br br <UNK> should be <UNK> in their flawless and classy transfer
<START> i'm no jane austen <UNK> but why make a film like this if you have nothing to say br br <UNK> <UNK> was so wrong for the part it is difficult to know where to begin wrong personality modern make up completely wrong hair there is no way a young lady of her age would have around in public with her hair loose and like that she didn't seem particularly meek nor put upon by the family and i didn't understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly <UNK> or kind br br the <UNK> <UNK> for the ball was so low budget it was embarrassing to watch and missing out the section completely destroyed the point of the piece as well as losing scenes which could have added a gritty <UNK> to that oh so claustrophobic pink sitting room br br to those responsible if you haven't the imagination even the budget doesn't matter so much as the imagination to do something meaningful with an adaptation please don't pretend to be producing jane austen br br it was about 10 <UNK> park and 90 nothing much at all br br ps edmund was very good
<START> what can i say the little kid inside has always had great affections for the following giant robots giant monsters and a <UNK> <UNK> lead villain and this movie delivers on all counts as an adult it's easy to point out the many flaws in this film and to say hey it's really only a bunch of episodes taken from a children's tv series strung together despite all of this i find the ending very moving and the content surprisingly adult in nature tremendous fun if a little nonsensical at times
<START> i missed it at the cinema and have rented it on dvd if you get the chance i would recommend it as it´s better than nearly everything <UNK> seen at the cinema or on dvd this year that <UNK> to say it´s one of the best films ever or anything it´s just <UNK> seen a lot of rubbish br br <UNK> really add to <UNK> already been said except 8 10
<START> i didn't really think this movie was bad sure the detective kinda sucked at what he did and he usually happened upon capt <UNK> by accident but he got the job done capt <UNK> himself was pretty scary the make up artist did a great job i really liked seeing dee dressed up all geeky i laughed so hard when i saw that i personally don't see how someone can sit through crap like texas chainsaw massacre and call it a great movie and then watch which is more disturbing because a lot of it could actually happen with the internet being so popular and call it bad i personally think that texas chainsaw massacre was loads of crap probably one of the stupidest movies that i've ever seen i enjoyed it was a very disturbing movie because almost all of it actually happens
<START> it <UNK> me that anyone would find <UNK> shore entertaining he is basically one joke that gets stale real fast he has his little california jerk <UNK> and a basic stock of lame jokes mainly he is just obnoxious br br that said i watched this movie because i was up sick and there was literally nothing else on but <UNK> otherwise i would have turned it off after 30 minutes anyway the film could have been ok if <UNK> could have just turned off his <UNK> and just played it as a comic actor instead of well <UNK> br br anyway i'm sure <UNK> fans will like it anyway but if you are not a <UNK> fan stay away from this <UNK> of <UNK> br br i had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this film a 10 10 maybe it was <UNK> personally i gave it a 3 10 because they didn't have any mike in frame shots didn't drop the camera and the supporting cast was pretty good
<START> i ended up liking this movie but it was not the <UNK> to get through what makes the movie great is the music and the scenery the songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented a great job was done to show different settings for the <UNK> people br br however the viewer was not guided enough a more in depth history of the <UNK> people would have been nice only a <UNK> of the of the spoken words were given english subtitles in addition more explanations about the settings and who was their and some of their challenges would have been appreciated too it would have helped if there were a narrator too explain about customs dress and music
<START> though it hardly <UNK> to other sci fi film giants like 2001 a space odyssey or close encounters of the third kind <UNK> does work as a totally <UNK> and bizarre <UNK> of science fiction and horror elements somehow despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same it manages to work because of a few highly different elements br br loosely based on colin <UNK> 1976 novel the space vampires this film from director tobe hooper <UNK> the texas chainsaw massacre focuses on a joint us british mission aboard the british space <UNK> <UNK> to study <UNK> <UNK> led by an american commander steve <UNK> they discover an alien <UNK> in the <UNK> coma and when they investigate the interior of the <UNK> they find alien <UNK> that look like giant bats later on the <UNK> reaches <UNK> <UNK> but no response is given from radio calls <UNK> from the home base the space research center in london columbia is launched to <UNK> with <UNK> but they find the entire ship <UNK> by fire all except for the alien beings <UNK> in glass who far from being <UNK> by the fire look absolutely perfect the aliens are bought back to earth and that's where the incredible happens br br these space vampires escape from the space research center and instead of <UNK> their victims of blood via bite wounds suck their <UNK> <UNK> totally out of them one of them is the space girl a thoroughly nude <UNK> played by <UNK> may <UNK> the only actual survivor from <UNK> is bought in by the chief frank <UNK> and a british special agent peter <UNK> to track may who is in <UNK> contact with him pretty soon however the vampires have turned london into a scene of pure holocaust people are either being <UNK> or turning into zombies and the threat by <UNK> to the city with <UNK> radiation <UNK> large <UNK> finally catches up with may and sacrifices himself by <UNK> her with a large metal <UNK> br br undoubtedly disjointed <UNK> uneven but nevertheless worth watching <UNK> despite the frequent <UNK> of its script and its acting benefits from some drop dead excellent special effects work by john star wars some of the best ever seen the other working element and a surprise one it is is the incredible <UNK> score by henry <UNK> almost <UNK> in the same way john <UNK> score for star wars was and <UNK> like williams before him uses the london <UNK> orchestra to boot br br largely forgotten these days and a critical and box office disaster in 1985 <UNK> if for no other reason should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre there had never been a film quite like it before and there will certainly not be anything like it again
<START> <UNK> heard a lot about this movie except it being national award and oscar entry its a <UNK> movie n i cant make out apple from orange in <UNK> but when i saw the movie playing on late sunday night i just got glued now i am no judge of cinematic techniques and acting skills but i have watched a good number of movies of various genres and for an average viewer i will highly recommend this movie the feel is very <UNK> and realistic though there are some melodramatic moments watch it to feel human lately haven't seen any movie which touches heart especially in hindi cinema the <UNK> achievement of the movie is when the young kid returns home the camera moves around to reveal the kid wearing black glasses having lost his eyes the kid hears the other kids <UNK> in the water and starts <UNK> i was <UNK> and the two hours i spent watching the movie very much worth it
<START> the royal <UNK> has <UNK> been one of my favourite events and i've been a wrestling fan for a good few years now the other shows may have better matches but i've always found the actual <UNK> match to be full of excitement br br i'm not going to reveal the winners of any match as i don't see it as fair to ruin the results on a review i will comment on the quality of them though br br we have the standard 4 matches and then the big <UNK> event two from <UNK> and two from raw br br shawn michaels and edge open up for raw this proves to be a good match from two talented guys this is a match i'd recommend watching it's hard to sum up without giving away the winner br br next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster be whoever it is giant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> well this time it's its also a <UNK> match typical undertaker fare watch if you're a fan i have to admit i am purely for the entertainment factor it can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match br br the next two matches are the title matches for once <UNK> manages to <UNK> raw their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable but with a anti climax and let down to end it <UNK> match is a pretty dull and boring affair which is a pity as i'm a fan of both guys involved br br now to the main reason i love the event the <UNK> it's a pretty good one this year coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win and it may not prove a big surprise but hey its very enjoyable there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated there is the token guy who doesn't make it to the ring the <UNK> who is ridiculous and we all want to see <UNK> and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated <UNK> it has its usual <UNK> and <UNK> and i loved the ending in particular the vince <UNK> entrance br br i'd recommend this show not the wwe on top form but its still good add it to your collection
<START> story of an ex navy seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art russian sub with a nurse this is to answer a call for help set off by a dying member of the original crew the sub has been <UNK> by terrorists who are bent on destruction so we see the duo try and gain control back and this happens with the fear of the us naval forces is about to <UNK> everything it has got on the terrorist sub to prevent it from <UNK> its <UNK> be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie a couple of unexplained scenes towards the end watch it when you have the time nothing to miss out even if you let the show run while you go get yourself a cup of coffee slow moving
<START> can a film be too faithful to the book upon which it is based judging from the time <UNK> 2007 adaptation of huge 2003 <UNK> the answer is rather ironically yes like many i was enthralled by the book an impressive first effort by the <UNK> american writer <UNK> so obviously were director marc <UNK> stranger than fiction and screenwriter david <UNK> who pay <UNK> attention to the most significant details of the story within the film's <UNK> minute running time yet the <UNK> <UNK> of heartfelt events in novel often comes across as episodic and <UNK> because <UNK> and are sincerely trying hard to remain true to the full scope of the story within the time constraints part of the challenge is how carefully used symbolic acts to provide literary then and now <UNK> to what is essentially a three act story a technique that can come across as somewhat contrived on screen br br however the filmmakers do the most important things right specifically giving the viewer an intimate look into a hidden culture <UNK> conveyed through <UNK> news reports <UNK> authenticity by having characters speak in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> language and capturing the emotional <UNK> of the complex narrative the first part of the movie is set in 1978 afghanistan before the soviet invasion and the eventual <UNK> of the <UNK> the focus is on the relationship between <UNK> the son of an <UNK> businessman named <UNK> and the devoted <UNK> the son of his father's servant connected by their mutual love of <UNK> running the two are thick as thieves until a tragic event <UNK> them <UNK> unable to find the courage that comes so naturally to his father <UNK> is crippled by guilt for not having rescued <UNK> from an <UNK> act performed by a trio of local bullies <UNK> makes especially <UNK> the ethnic tensions between the and the in afghanistan br br upon the 1979 invasion by soviet troops <UNK> and <UNK> flee to the u s where the story picks up their story nine years later in california a suburban <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is reduced to working in a gas station and operating a flea market <UNK> <UNK> meets a local <UNK> girl and marries this is the film's least interesting passage since treatment gives short <UNK> to <UNK> characters like wife and most <UNK> <UNK> is portrayed by necessity as a <UNK> young man with a <UNK> cast toward his self <UNK> the final section flashes forward twelve years where <UNK> upon <UNK> of his first book is <UNK> back to <UNK> <UNK> afghanistan to rescue <UNK> son from the <UNK> as a means to <UNK> for his <UNK> years earlier there is true suspense and fear generated in this portion of the story as shocking revelations and old <UNK> come back to haunt <UNK> during his journey br br a british actor of egyptian <UNK> the lead <UNK> in united <UNK> has the central role of <UNK> as an adult a challenging role since he has to convey a constant sense of shame and <UNK> self worth until the end the other professional actors fare better shaun tony <UNK> in the current iron man as business partner khan who holds the key to the truth <UNK> quietly affecting as and best of all iranian actor who brings pride and dignity to <UNK> three young non professionals were <UNK> from school system to play the key child roles and all are quite good is up to the challenge of the <UNK> part as young <UNK> and ali danish <UNK> is poignant as <UNK> nearly <UNK> son but it's the sad eyed moon faced ahmad khan who will break your heart as the young <UNK> especially in the devastating <UNK> throwing scene it's fair to say his performance is on par with the young <UNK> in <UNK> de <UNK> classic <UNK> thieves br br the technical aspects are well done in particular <UNK> clean cinematography western china convincingly <UNK> for afghanistan <UNK> <UNK> score and even the cgi effects <UNK> the <UNK> in <UNK> flight the 2008 dvd has a solid set of extras beginning with an insightful commentary from <UNK> and although some of their dialogue seems rather forced there are two <UNK> included the first is the 14 minute words from the <UNK> runner which focuses on connection to the story and the development of the novel and the second is the 25 minute images from the <UNK> runner a more standard behind the scenes look at the production <UNK> out the extras are the original theatrical trailer a few previews and a <UNK> from on how to help the <UNK> during their current time of need
<START> just watched hair after a <UNK> of 20 years it struck home for those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of <UNK> and power who <UNK> the <UNK> of the johnson <UNK> <UNK> who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in vietnam every single day until finally the us beast died and <UNK> for all who said no in many different ways it's remarkable how <UNK> we were how large the real table was on which treat <UNK> how driven the wizard behind the curtain we were 20 22 24 we didn't know the nature of the enemy the size of the monster who for the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world how could we even with smoke and the bat the bat in our hand like treat we were too young too middle class too invested too much a part of the actions we hated br br but there was a moment as andre gregory <UNK> in my dinner with there was a moment or two somewhere back there in the late 60's and early 70's when perhaps we could have found something besides the yellow brick road something not <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> and dick something <UNK> something innocent and critical at once something with dance br br but we missed it like kong <UNK> a the revolution was turned in on itself into <UNK> racism <UNK> and class <UNK> politics until we got to w treat would have hated w and iraq and the <UNK> lies if they were in that film then but the moment passed and w was almost inevitable <UNK> incompetence riding the drunken raging bull into children's lives and china <UNK> br br we should have done something more something better but we clearly didn't know what br br now what
<START> and i bought a vampire motorcycle <UNK> all over that line like a drunk with his tied together some <UNK> films are quite enjoyable like norman j <UNK> some <UNK> films are just bad like kent <UNK> eyes but <UNK> films that try and do the post <UNK> thing of being <UNK> bad should always be approached with extreme caution a lot of people think <UNK> terror <UNK> is a bad taste masterpiece for example but i'm guessing anyone over the age of <UNK> will <UNK> it off as worthless dreck then there's john carpenter's dark star yes it's quaint and certainly a product of its time but as a film it's only two <UNK> above worthless this no budget british black comedy horror outing tries to achieve a satirical tone with its endless references to its fellow <UNK> splatter flicks among them <UNK> horror hospital and pretty much anything by pete walker but due to dismal performances by second string tv actors the leading lady looks like amy a script that appears to have been written on the back of a <UNK> <UNK> by two with no understanding of how film comedy works dean intentionally dire elevator rock soundtrack and production values never rising above mediocre the net result is a film that can only be laughed at rather than with if your idea of <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> chinese called fu king and references to long forgotten tv ads you'll enjoy this one but don't expect too much
<START> this movie was utterly and <UNK> terrible the plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end i wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen br br normally i don't write reviews but i was <UNK> by the number of positive reviews it got while i admit that the acting was okay at some parts the <UNK> <UNK> more than <UNK> the decent acting the only reason i watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made judging by the trailer we were not disappointed in the least its only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line br br brandon i just want to get to know you br br girl you just want to get into my pants br br brandon i want to get into your mind your heart your soul i don't see you wearing any pants in this <UNK> br br overall i would rate this movie as the worst movie i ever saw that took itself seriously
<START> i rated this movie a 3 and that was generous the scenery is <UNK> and <UNK> the acting for the most part is terrible i do think peter o'toole did a good job of acting but he must have been <UNK> when he saw the final cut of the movie john gielgud brief his appearance in the movie still seemed to be playing a role from hamlet the hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story okay malcolm mcdowell had a nice butt and the guy who played <UNK> was handsome the guy who played <UNK> looked more like the traditional depictions of <UNK> and was certainly at odds with robert <UNK> picture of <UNK> the climactic assassination of <UNK> wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open air area when in fact he was <UNK> in the underground passage on the hill which ran along the front of the that still exists today there are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it <UNK> <UNK> if you want history read or if you want pornography and <UNK> watch <UNK> but by all means stay away from this movie
<START> i've read other reviews of this movie and while it certainly isn't the best movie ever made in the sci fi horror genre it isn't that bad if you accept it for what it is low budget b movie fare that shall we say borrows heavily from the likes of <UNK> nasty <UNK> monster that <UNK> its victims gorgeous and confused space girl and the <UNK> <UNK> with captive girls angle this is one seriously cheesy movie and the whole thing was obviously done on a <UNK> budget although the alien isn't too bad i've seen far less convincing men in rubber suits at any rate none of the acting is oscar material and the <UNK> of man doesn't really double for boston very convincingly the plot is fairly predictable too and the premise that an alien craft would travel <UNK> of miles and crash land <UNK> bang in the middle of an all girls college campus thus conveniently providing a rich source of perfect <UNK> victims is utterly laughable however the movie does have its suspenseful moments there's a few <UNK> of nudity and semi nudity and the film does feature one of the few movie appearances by the beautiful and tragic model actress simmons as the space girl who at the age of only 24 was murdered in london by her jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film
<START> tony curtis and skip both are wearing black with white <UNK> <UNK> shoes in the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the tank being blown up must have been too hard on the young stars feet if the real marines had been on the mission they would have been wearing boots in the first scenes they took off their just before starting out on their little trip to find the farmer when they went to the area where they <UNK> the fox holes tony and skip are wearing combat boots then later when <UNK> and curtis run into the and his daughter tony is wearing the <UNK> shoes but hey have been the movie in about a true story but did they really need the love interest
<START> a <UNK> in space sends astronaut neil <UNK> glenn corbett off course and headed to something of a parallel world called <UNK> <UNK> the sun exactly opposite earth as a being from space would pose a threat to this world's order <UNK> is held until a determination can be made as to exactly what to do with him <UNK> however gets suspicious of his surroundings and escapes with the help of a sympathetic nurse and a old scientist who <UNK> the government <UNK> will try to board a spaceship and head back to earth br br stranded in space or the stranger if you prefer is another of those 70s made for tv movies that was to be turned into a regular weekly show in this case it's easy to see why it didn't make it first off there's nothing new about the show's set up it was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by the fugitive or the incredible hulk or planet of the apes you know a stranger constantly on the move going from one town to the next taking whatever odd job he can all the while being pursued by a government agency or newspaper reporter it's a formula that's been done to death the second strike against stranded in space is its lead glenn corbett could this guy come across any less likable i was rooting for him to get caught without sympathy for the main character this kind of show would never work finally this is supposed to be science fiction just because everyone is left handed and someone has hung three fake looking <UNK> on the horizon i'm supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is some distant planet so it's a mere coincidence that they all speak english dress just like people on earth and drive <UNK> <UNK> yeah right br br the lone highlight for me was the inclusion of cameron mitchell in the cast sure it's difficult to watch him in something this dreadful but you know the old saying any cameron is better than no cameron yeah i've never heard it either br br as with a lot of these 70s made for tv movies i watched stranded in space courtesy of mystery science theater 3000 i wouldn't call it a great episode by any stretch of the imagination but there are a few good jokes along the way so in the end while i rate the movie a 2 10 it gets a 3 5 on my mst3k rating scale
<START> i bought my first album in 1974 at 17 and have been hooked ever since this dvd has now taken pride of place in my music collection it is not often that a band can <UNK> 4 in their <UNK> but here we can each member made their own contribution to the band but on the stage together the electricity they generated was bigger than the 4 individuals this masterpiece covers the <UNK> entire career from led 1 to <UNK> and this is captured <UNK> on this dvd as each concert shows how the band became bigger and bigger over the years recently my copy disappeared but i'm happy to say was found in my son's room as the new generation discover just how great these guys were this is a must have for anyone who has an appreciation of rock music long live led <UNK>
<START> a good story about rusty parker rita hayworth who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with danny gene kelly and genius phil <UNK> rusty is in love with danny all three are good friends and every friday night they go to a local bar where they get <UNK> so they can look for a pearl they never eat them the story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing the movie has two questions that rusty must answer is fame all that it is <UNK> up to be and is less really more if you are happy answering those questions makes the movie the movie also does a good job of <UNK> the talents that all three principals had never a dull moment
<START> i can't believe that someone actually paid to have this film made stupid unrealistic and stereotypical right from the take off of the massive <UNK> the pilot pulled the back to increase speed then you have 5 armed persons with semi to fully automatic weapons firing without so much as one bullet the walls of the <UNK> cabin at <UNK> 000 feet then once below in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a fuel line and we see the fuel <UNK> from the side of the plane the acting was just horrid and forced there just didn't seem to be any direction i have seen some pretty horrid b movies in my lifetime but with the names that were in this film i was extremely disappointed
<START> my impression having seen this documentary is that <UNK> <UNK> ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film br br he took five years to make it a <UNK> of love and longing i can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process what to leave in what to take out br br his father the renowned architect louis <UNK> comes across as a man too selfish and self absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three but like many men of his character he attracted women who were <UNK> by the <UNK> and <UNK> by the creativity br br one of his <UNK> said he was accessible but that is never explored other comments by people who knew him well suffer the same fate a pity br br the tension between the three half siblings in the room of a home louis designed is also <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> over the conversation the only tracks that his father left were in the buildings he left behind some great some not so great br br i was captivated by the music ship and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by the baby mothers who got caught forever by his <UNK> never more <UNK> than what he said to the director's mother upon being told of her <UNK> not again br br 8 out of 10 beautifully filmed genuine br br it appears in this case at least the son is not the father of the man
<START> this is a brilliant series along the same lines of simpsons following a family as they go through life and problems etc slightly less realistic than simpsons talking baby and dog anyone family guy goes where simpsons or <UNK> <UNK> not reaching past into the <UNK> jokes and more <UNK> gags and believe me it works almost all the gags hit the mark and they'll have you in <UNK> especially the random frequent flashbacks when my brother first showed me this i wasn't hooked but after a few episodes i was hooked you will be 2 10 10 for a truly brilliant show <UNK> to seth for bringing this show to life
<START> i saw this at the festival friday amid an <UNK> crowd of people not helped by a poor decision by the of the event who chose a totally inappropriate short film to <UNK> the movie and it really threw the audience when modern love came up after a light whimsical short name i forget br br people it was really silly to mix this short with modern love which is a serious drama movie a film film br br so the audience gets the <UNK> which is a comedy and then modern love <UNK> modern love despite my <UNK> strange ending a little too <UNK> needed a short film that was <UNK> with it's oddball <UNK> so my advice to the <UNK> for next year is to take more care planning the show br br the folks watching modern love really just didn't know what had hit them they were led up the path and this is not their fault br br modern love has some superb performances which play well against the <UNK> <UNK> of the film a film that its maker seems to have out <UNK> rather than executed in the normal way a film is scripted and shot br br too bad the audience was wrong session placement wrong short film wrong approach by the well <UNK> <UNK> who despite good efforts need to see a lot more films and travel to some other festivals
<START> i did something a little daring tonight when i watched this movie i attempted to <UNK> myself from silent movie scores sure when this film originally was distributed a piano score was probably played with it <UNK> the director would choose the score himself charlie chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films but most of the music you hear on vhs tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released and then again there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score i do not know the history of <UNK> score so i decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within film br br soon after i turned the music off or should i say by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen i became utterly attached to the film visually it is easily one of the most stunning of all films <UNK> was a master of composition the editing possibly the cinematic technique <UNK> is most famous for montage is extraordinary the mood of this film is anger and it <UNK> my passions violently br br it takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film especially a drama but films like <UNK> <UNK> prove that this effort is entirely worth it come on you owe it to yourself to watch this film your education is <UNK> without it
<START> this is a delightful film elizabeth taylor does a wonderful job as does mickey rooney the film just makes you feel happy it's inspirational and even though some parts are a bit overly sentimental that is easily forgiven i could watch this movie again and again the race at the end is exciting every time i see it highly recommend this film
<START> i would give this movie a good strong 7 while it isn't the greatest movie or even one the best movies of it's kind the killing fields is better it does at least attempt to tell a necessary story br br i think the method of introducing laura into <UNK> was a bit contrived first of all <UNK> isn't exactly the <UNK> country to visit especially in the late 80's secondly if you did make it <UNK> your <UNK> would not get lost a sane person would make darn sure they knew where their <UNK> was at all times with that in mind i'm sure the screenwriter knew that was weak but needed something patricia <UNK> performance was understated and i just didn't buy that she was a doctor however at least she didn't <UNK> the role which often happens in movies like this u <UNK> was good but also understated the end is hard to follow since most of the dialogue is in <UNK> with people <UNK> for laura it would have been difficult for laura and is difficult for the viewer as well another plus is the strong se asian scenery in the film which was enjoyable to see
<START> james franco is totally cool in this movie not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way at the <UNK> screening some folks were on his back for being <UNK> and <UNK> and doing the whole james dean thing but i don't think this true blind spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent in this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely it's a unique performance bittersweet and really moving the lines from his <UNK> cut you like a knife you sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words the tone is everything he carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim bits of <UNK> humor i like the other two actors a great deal too the blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his twisted tough guy <UNK> some of the thugs seemed a little <UNK> but this is a mini point really the film is totally solid and franco is way cool all around
<START> the plot line is an expose of the under belly of american politics while the theme seems common what makes the movie is the unconventional way the story is told br br the characters are played with conviction you feel the innocence of the lead and his innocence lost the politician is the prince of double talk a real snake br br the camera work is impressive it <UNK> the nuances of the acting and dialogue <UNK> for the music br br the story uses a <UNK> style with where the message is filled with double <UNK> a very <UNK> <UNK> by the writer director the tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes br br the movie was like a good mystery book something was <UNK> you knew it was bad you didn't know exactly what it could be you had your <UNK> and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadn't noticed you were holding in <UNK> shaking your head br br a story well written and well told 3 cheers to a young writer director
<START> the most hardcore bad film buff will be surprised by the overall <UNK> of this grade z film mary <UNK> a clever actress best known for her roles as mary bland in eating <UNK> and miss <UNK> in rock <UNK> roll high school is by far the best thing about this tripe this film is almost too bad even for mst3k honestly
<START> it is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this however this is a dreadful film gene hackman wastes time and one suspects many dollars on re playing his most famous and <UNK> <UNK> role as gene hackman otherwise television actors are given the chance to become film stars and successfully resist the temptation patrick <UNK> has a minor part and went on to greater things for which he must be <UNK> thankful br br i watched this film as a result of someone else's review and i felt that another point of view was <UNK> you may not agree with my review but now at least you have been warned
<START> when i saw this movie at age 6 it was in the <UNK> section at video because it was animation we watched it and it was a whole different ball game a very violent story and graphic deaths are very entertaining and compelling but not for children avoid for family viewing my mom nearly had a heart attack and ripped the video apart
<START> the film itself is only a <UNK> of scenes which have no inherent meaning to someone living outside of russia i won't deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time filmed <UNK> but the problem with the film is that it has no interest to the intellectual or common man we are merely watching an arranged form of pictures ranging from a one arm man beating a horse to a <UNK> soldier in the war everything in between is awkward <UNK> and quite unnecessary it would have been possible to <UNK> a forum which kept the viewer interested but this would not be it although the method of the director is quite brilliant br br in all one should view this if they are an art student on <UNK> drugs or a student of pre cinema
<START> this film is remarkable in how <UNK> it is this is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull <UNK> life of a housewife and man of the house it could be any couple any family in any town but that's what makes the story so moving it touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love or of ourselves i laughed i cried i couldn't stop thinking about it and what more could you ask for from a film really especially a documentary this is an excellent film and one that i highly recommended to anyone who enjoys documentaries stories about families like yours stories about love life <UNK> loss expectations soul searching yearning wandering through life and finding your way or not
<START> all monster <UNK> in the final film in <UNK> renowned cycle of classic horror stories count dracula an intense <UNK> john carradine calling himself baron comes to dr <UNK> stevens asking to be <UNK> of his <UNK> naturally this is just a <UNK> then <UNK> larry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a k a the wolf man shows up and of course he really wants to be <UNK> br br as others have noted the monsters don't get equal screen time the frankenstein monster glenn strange gets thrown in at the end just for the purpose of including all of the universal monsters stock footage and library music are re used here as well the film spends maybe a little too much time with the dracula part of the story although carradine gives an impressive non hammy performance in the role of the count the film is mainly a showcase for stevens who goes through a tragic character arc of his own and does an excellent job the women are gorgeous and i have to say that i loved jane adams as the <UNK> nurse who happens to be <UNK> br br of course it wouldn't be complete without the inclusion of angry villagers br br competently <UNK> made <UNK> is just for my tastes not really scary at all but entertaining regardless it's a respectable series entry overall br br 7 10
<START> a gritty australian film with all the elements for success two hands represents the ability of australian film makers and actors to produce top quality popular material the film has a fresh angle and uniquely <UNK> drama suspense and comedy br br i found this film thoroughly enjoyable on so many different levels but can also appreciate that it might not be everyone's of the film carries a distinct aussie humour as it portrays the seedy underworld of sydney and explores the lives of a young man ledger and young woman <UNK> swept up in the local crime scene br br two hands deals with the theme of good and evil both on an <UNK> and personal level and looks at the issue of consequences for actions br br the camera work is <UNK> and the dialogue humorous with bryan brown who plays and heath ledger as jimmy battling it out on screen in the most bizarre situations this aussie film is certainly not short of acting talent br br this subtle action comedy has become somewhat of a cult favourite and one of mine also
<START> back in the day is an interesting but flawed effort <UNK> rule stars as <UNK> cooper a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father he meets his old friend j bone <UNK> <UNK> who tries to force <UNK> into a life of crime <UNK> also falls in love with ali who is the <UNK> daughter now he has to choose love or crime br br <UNK> rule does a competent job as <UNK> at least he's trying to act <UNK> <UNK> is perfect as j bone he brings a lot of energy and menace into the role joe <UNK> as the preacher is his usual excellent self but he doesn't do much the same problem for <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> dad he needed more screen time i don't want to say this but pam <UNK> is pretty awful as mrs cooper she overacts every scene and brings the movie down <UNK> <UNK> and frank <UNK> are in it but don't do anything substantial for the plot br br in the end you should see it for the skilled performances of <UNK> <UNK> and joe <UNK> and the <UNK> of the writing and directing
<START> perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself what i want to point out here is that distant is not only an art house film but one of the best art house films from all the art house films i have seen distant is the one that really stands out as a <UNK> piece of gold it is even fair to say that this film's cinematography and depiction of human emotion <UNK> <UNK> nostalgia one <UNK> got it right that sex a jaded common feature among foreign films is surprisingly lacking in distant and in a good way what is most remarkable about distant is that it captures the details of life we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual <UNK> of our <UNK> world fortunately distant doesn't have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings
<START> i have to agree with what many of the other reviewers <UNK> a subject which could have been thought provoking and shed light on a <UNK> double standard failed miserably br br rape being a crime of violence and forced abusive control the scenes here were for the most part pathetic it would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the deed and the <UNK> laugh with the cops when he <UNK> his police complaint seemed as genuine as that of the cops no <UNK> no to merely join in i don't know if this was bad acting and or bad directing but someone missed the point entirely as for his half a ed supposed search for his <UNK> pathetic they should have <UNK> most of the sex scenes another monumental failure in themselves and had him meet colin <UNK> when he first went to the police the story could have then been drawn forth with good dialog and the occasional flashback and saved by the superior acting and presence colin <UNK> the only reason i watched this movie brings to any project he does br br the only <UNK> revelation of this movie is it was crap
<START> ok so i admit that it often seems like most of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> have exactly the same plot <UNK> tries to get <UNK> but repeatedly fails and always gets <UNK> in the process often with the help of a <UNK> i guess that it's sort of like <UNK> e <UNK> chasing road runner in other words <UNK> should never go after birds all a r r <UNK> has the same plot and sets it on a train in a way the best part of these cartoons is seeing what sorts of schemes <UNK> comes up with to try and go after <UNK> we know that he's going to fail miserably but it's also funny to watch <UNK> turn into a bad ass if you've seen his really early cartoons you'll see that he was not cute at all but in fact had a cruel streak this one mainly works as a way to pass time br br by the way i thought that i saw i mean i taut i <UNK> pass a piece of <UNK> with the name <UNK> <UNK> on it
<START> my curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film which now has been released on dvd for the first time in the uk has been more than rewarded peter has <UNK> himself in his <UNK> and technical skills this pseudo documentary is certainly ahead of its time and still <UNK> relevant and up to date br br the film is inspired by the <UNK> of the late sixties in the us when the government has <UNK> its use of violence and <UNK> while the anti war movement <UNK> increasingly violent and radical in order to deal with both this the <UNK> of <UNK> and to provide special training to riot police <UNK> the government has introduced the so called punishment parks convicted <UNK> mostly <UNK> are given the to either be locked up in prison for years and years or spend three days in one of these parks where they either gain their freedom their death or an even longer prison sentence the situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations however it reminded me of a sort of realistic version of battle <UNK> 2000 br br the film's structure is extremely effective and recalls parallels with cannibal holocaust which is made almost 10 years later both movies are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged in thinking and feeling he is actually watching a real documentary and therefore shocked even though aware of the fact that this is a film both confront us with the <UNK> violent nature of mankind but where cannibal holocaust is devoid of any deeper meaning above all it is an exploitation movie in every sense of the word and does not raise any critical questions about the state of the world punishment park does just that br br i have been profoundly impressed with punishment park and find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and <UNK> for so long maybe that says enough about the truth of its content about the way power <UNK> in this world function i do not agree with the critique that <UNK> and stereotypes because the movie depicts <UNK> and the <UNK> of the power <UNK> who are in reality as <UNK> as they are here if they weren't there would not be any conflict and therefore no change in our societies in reality <UNK> between these two groups often take stereotypical forms whether you place them between <UNK> and establishment in latin america russia or new york city if these groups would not be <UNK> to these extremes the <UNK> would be part of the silent that <UNK> complain but at the same time <UNK> in the <UNK> of the world br br as peter tells us in the introduction on the dvd the actors in punishment park are for the most part amateurs most kids were real <UNK> from la most policemen had been part of the national forces and even some of the members of the are part of the social and political establishment of the time not introducing both groups previous to the shooting of the scenes taking place in the improvised court room adds to spontaneous and improvised feel parallels are drawn with issues of the time such as the <UNK> of black <UNK> members one of the black prisoners is said to resemble the convicted charismatic bobby and the trial of the chicago seven br br i admire <UNK> obvious and sincere engagement with injustice and his concern with human rights and the increasingly <UNK> <UNK> taken by <UNK> nowadays in the name of the war in terror to silence those that do not agree and refuse to be <UNK> punishment park remains to be an extremely important movie that should be shown in schools and seen by everybody who shares these concerns maybe its <UNK> can finally be made up for
<START> there is something about doug appearance in a movie that is a of <UNK> his <UNK> are like a special cinema <UNK> that comes somewhere before <UNK> br br cushing on the other hand seemed to both a <UNK> agent and poor judgement of his own he did excellent work in the hammer movies as dr van <UNK> seen him do a very passable sherlock holmes in <UNK> of the and his <UNK> <UNK> was probably grand <UNK> in the first <UNK> <UNK> the only man but the emperor who could tell darth <UNK> to <UNK> and get away with it but <UNK> he's done some <UNK> there was that <UNK> movie for one and here's another br br there's a machine that's been <UNK> from tracy island it's a <UNK> with a screw at the front and <UNK> devices at the sides i'm surprised jerry anderson didn't sue for <UNK> maybe he was bought off yet if the movie is any guide they can't have paid him much br br it's 1976 and we're still playing about in <UNK> <UNK> suits br br that's about it really some movies have an entertainment value in the <UNK> bad it's <UNK> category this one doesn't even manage that it wouldn't even entertain kids stuff from the 1930's has got more going for it
<START> pity the <UNK> people always accused them of being <UNK> which they were or being nothing more than a american knock off of the beatles again which they were but to the kids of the time they were real they were important they were legitimate discussions about who were better the <UNK> or the beatles were common on school <UNK> but the critics well they never quite bought into it despite recording some very catchy classic pop tunes the did not receive much respect for their albums sadly a similar fate was met by their one movie vehicle despite the fact that it stands as the best band film ever <UNK> fans may argue that hard days night was better and i am sure that many of the kids think 8 mile was superior but none of these films were as daring and inventive as head and that is probably why it failed br br if head had told a direct a to b type story perhaps it would have <UNK> to the bands young fans but by pushing the <UNK> and using the movie opportunity to mock their own image they really <UNK> the film with their fans could you imagine <UNK> turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is that he is the best selling guy in a genre in which only 5 and i am being generous of the acts are white if you can picture that than you have an idea how daring it was for the to sing hey hey we are the <UNK> you know we like to please a <UNK> image with no philosophy when you have a film in which frank <UNK> tells <UNK> that he should focus less on the dancing and more on the music its clear that there is a lot more going on then you expected br br the story what there is concerns the boys trying to flee their manager who at one point forces them to play in a commercial but every time they run away they end up inside a box i don't think you need to be fellini to figure out the symbolism of that bit some neat little comedy bits follow with <UNK> as a boxer who has to give up playing the <UNK> to take a dive in the big match and peter <UNK> to throw away a ice cream <UNK> he does not want because there are starving children so its wrong to waste food but the real selling point to this film is the music and its some of the best the band ever recorded even if you are put off by the story you can sit back and enjoy some terrific music br br any film that begins and ends with mickey attempting suicide by jumping off a bridge at the end the band follows him is never going to be a mainstream classic but if you are a fan of either the band or experimental cinema of the era than you will enjoy this film
<START> i wasn't expecting to much of this movie when i went into the theater but i had been waiting for it for many years to sum it up it was pretty damn good <UNK> michael murray was pretty good i thought he was going to be another chris flynn from wrong turn but i was wrong elisha <UNK> was also good but the best performance has to go to brian van holt he played the bad guy too well i mean he was sick sadistic and very cruel the back story between the brothers was good plus i liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film it gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die jon <UNK> was pretty good as the goofy best bud of <UNK> i liked how <UNK> kind of cried when he found him dead it was better then just him being like whatever my buddy is dead who cares it showed how he really cared so overall this was a darn god slasher with some great effects bravo
<START> i am a huge robert taylor fan and i have been trying to find all of his films this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script victor mclaglen was even bad and brian <UNK> was almost <UNK> considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the u s would order a navy lt to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers and report only to the president that it made it hard to appreciate anything else about the film the death row scenes were entirely <UNK> the only thing worse than <UNK> acting was <UNK> singing she got better later in ball of fire thank heavens
<START> ah the classic genre of 80s sex comedies this is set on two <UNK> one a nude beach featuring <UNK> fully <UNK> women the plot something about a bunch of attempting to get laid the usual fans of gratuitous t a and p should hunt this one down
<START> this film must have done well in the box office in order to give <UNK> the budget it deserves this film had no budget needed a script rewrite and a better ending there is flashes of brilliance in this movie the boat ride scene burt driving the mean machine and his chat with his parents you can tell burt is a <UNK> and not a actor this movie shows what <UNK> would be like <UNK> best film too bad this film did not have the same funding and was done on the rush 4 10
<START> i knew this was headed for disaster after looking at the clock within 7 minutes of air time the story line two people get married they move into the wife's parents home and husband doesn't get along with father in law and if you haven't seen this plot before you probably have not watched tv for the last 15 years or so
<START> i just want to comment to the woman above that the movie does credit <UNK> in the begging in the beginning credits they show it thank you i think this is an amazing movie they picked just the right music for the mood of the movie the animation is wonderful and they picked the voices for the characters very well it teaches children to never give up and to always have hope princess doesn't give up and it shows children that they can do the same the movie also has humor in in for all ages parents and children to laugh at the colors in this movie are great and kids can really feel good while they are watching it i watched this movie for the first time now i am a huge fan and i'm sure your child will be too <UNK> sells tons of <UNK> and the magic of <UNK> stuff so your child can continue to enjoy the movie even when they aren't watching it thank you
<START> haines is excellent as the <UNK> <UNK> who thinks west point will really amount to something now that he has arrived haines displays his easy goofy comic persona as he takes on west point and joan crawford the local beauty great fun for the first half and amazingly touching after <UNK> character goes too far and nearly gets <UNK> by fellow <UNK> the new <UNK> filled haines get s minute <UNK> to play in the bill football game against navy and despite a broken arm wins the game great rousing entertainment by mgm in this haines formula film shows billy at his best william <UNK> also scores as the skinny <UNK> the handsome but <UNK> character would be played by clark gable cary grant gary cooper and others in later decades another take on the beautiful but <UNK> <UNK> played by carole lombard and marion davies west point is a winner
<START> i have to admit that i had low expectations for this movie but i was surprised to find it entertaining interesting and funny it's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film there were moments that made my <UNK> stand up even better though were the highly amusing occasionally hysterical comedic moments in the film you'll know which ones i'm talking about there also are a few great special effects and the humor and the special effects aren't necessarily separate br br the acting on the whole is very good way better than a typical low budget horror film the lead jackie in particular and many of the smaller supporting roles like the lawyer the couple living next door the pizza man are well acted if they hadn't been the film wouldn't have kept my interest and i would have lost my belief in the story this is a good interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental
<START> ah man this movie was funny as hell yet strange i like how they kept the <UNK> language in this movie it just felt ironic because of how idiotic the movie really was this movie has got to be one of <UNK> best movies highly recommended for some senseless fun
<START> this movie is really bad the hero can't play you see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart and believe me he walks a lot for 45 min nothing happens he only walks to places and gets out like if the story was so short that they had to <UNK> it by adding useless and boring looks like a scenes br br dialogues are very poor i counted around a lots of <UNK> and few hang on on the 1st part br br blood is orange like the you put on kid's and scenes are not following themselves a bloody neck on a scene a clean neck on the following br br the story could have been improved yeah i mean what the hell is the story br br martial arts where is that martial arts watch how <UNK> and slow are the moves if giving a kick and receiving a punch is called martial arts then i am bruce lee br br the only good point i have found is on fight scenes they don't play with zoom and fast switching scenes that gives you headache in most of action movies br br there are plenty of low budget movies that are great that one was just to make money nothing else
<START> jon <UNK> wife simply one of the worst titles for a film ever or the red right hand another absolutely awful sounding title that means nothing has no relevance to the film under which i saw it is set in <UNK> the year i was born which was quite possibly the best thing to happen during those <UNK> days where five old college friends meet up for a school reunion gay boy roger john is that <UNK> for real just say it out loud martha <UNK> kim rebecca <UNK> jenna stern her boyfriend jake <UNK> john <UNK> alan michael kevin walker his wife sandy <UNK> plus john good marc why is the spelling of <UNK> different in the title his wife sara <UNK> morgan from the word go there is an uneasy tension in the air when someone mentions their <UNK> friend jason lots of unpleasant memories come <UNK> back then comes the phone calls the mysterious nose <UNK> hallucinations guilt as the true horror of the events all those years ago finally comes to light br br produced executive produced directed by kurt who also wrote the thing kurt st thomas who gets the art direction credit too if that wasn't enough they both act in the film as well personally i thought jon <UNK> wife was awful i mean she can't cook or anything ha ha ha only joking seriously though i didn't think much of the film overall for a start it's pretty slow going the entire first 30 minutes is solid <UNK> material of the reunion <UNK> of lots of catching up with each other dull character building exposition the film never explains itself what's with those weird nose <UNK> for god's sake the mysterious phone calls the almost <UNK> death of one of the group that might or might not be natural what the hell was sara all about she comes across as some <UNK> sex crazed dirty talking shameless bitter <UNK> know it all whore who apparently sleeps with just about every man she meets some of the dialogue she <UNK> wouldn't be out of place in a porno it just seems totally at odds with the rest of the film which plays out more like a drama than the horror thriller it was supposedly meant to be then there's the ending if there's a worse way to end a film then to just leave literally everything hanging in the air with no closure whatsoever i have yet to see it the whole thing was very predictable as well i mean is anyone watching this not going to know that when they all mention their friend went <UNK> there wouldn't be more to it br br directors thomas make an <UNK> film on top of the predictability annoying climax there is a <UNK> narration by alan which i simply don't understand as he has no more or less significance than anyone else at what point in time is he <UNK> from the reasons behind this narration is never made clear or <UNK> upon there's no tension because the whole things so by the numbers br br technically the film is ok but nothing special some of the locations clothes didn't look particularly authentic to me this never convinced me it was taking place during the late 70's the acting was alright what about actor john last name i suppose if his wife was standing next to him we could describe them as a couple of right br br i really didn't think much of jon <UNK> wife a blow up doll would have been better ha ha ha i'm not sure who it would appeal to forget about any gore horror violence scares atmosphere or excitement in fact forget about everything that would have made this film watchable because it ain't here not recommended
<START> actually i'm still in doubt if there's anything about this movie i like as for the story unrealistic and very exaggerated the acting was too bad in my opinion not very likely that will get a <UNK> <UNK> status some folks will expect it anyway first let him work on his english <UNK> if you watch the <UNK> to paris of these actors dvd extra you will most likely want to up advice to beau stop your acting career you'll never get there to the 2 main <UNK> grow up please being generous i'd give it 4 out of 10 br br
<START> i watched the first few episodes a short while back and felt i couldn't take it anymore the horrible looking fight scenes are the worst i've ever scene in my life about one third of each episode is dedicated to flash gordon and his mighty fight moves i know fight choreography from that era isn't exactly up to par with today's standards but this is ridiculous they don't even try to make it look realistic flash gordon who hardly resembles a fighter uses his drunken slow moves and bare fist to knock out four or five guys with knives guns and other weapons give me a break there's also a scene where he does some similar act while in the water basically every episode has scenes similar to that as for the rest of the episode there's not much else i remember i basically viewed it out of curiosity on what science fiction looked like 70 years ago
<START> the <UNK> approach that lewis takes with king of the underworld <UNK> a deeper plot while still maintaining an efficient run time one of the <UNK> examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple the audience is instantly transported from a <UNK> medical office to a <UNK> <UNK> at the city's most <UNK> <UNK> this development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into the story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate by abruptly cutting from this scenario to the morally <UNK> <UNK> the personal <UNK> the viewer is called upon to experience this sudden turn of events the <UNK> kay francis and john are <UNK> employed by <UNK> bogart without <UNK> this stylized notion of organized crime being too influential and powerful to overcome has become a standard <UNK> in every gangster picture the one aspect of this film that raised some questions for me ironically dealt with the pacing of the story and that rate at which it was told i think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined this <UNK> happens to be a result of personal taste in that i think that the movie going experience can be enhanced through <UNK> character development however for the purposes of this film i must admit that the rapid action contributes more dynamic <UNK> to the impact of the film br br 1 2 of
<START> as a teenager i watched this movie every time it was on tv and it was on a lot because of its witty appealing to teenager humor it may not be what critics consider 4 star viewing but i love it for what it is a fun comedy meant to please the audience the teen actors are of my generation probably why i love the movie so much and was like a fantasy cast of everyone's favorite tv shows of the early 90's full house family matters fresh prince all of the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90's though it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many teen movie writers think vital to success among the youth <UNK> or perhaps because of its absence i highly recommend it to pre teens and teenagers everywhere
<START> i am an indian <UNK> in the united states why india continues like a dumb animal to <UNK> everything american is beyond me the main problems with the movie aren't so much the inane plot and dumb comedy it is that this movie has a lot of sex touching women dressing like in the streets and a lot of <UNK> that doesn't belong anywhere on t v br br to the producers and directors of this movie i have this message you continue to <UNK> our <UNK> strong family values by making this sort of junk you continue to let young women think it's okay to have a feminist attitude and have no morals you continue to make dance songs that belong in the lowest of adult <UNK> and bars i am ashamed to be an indian after seeing movies like this br br in 2003 the united states government suggested that the best way to destroy iran is to there there is no need to do that for india we will destroy ourselves with rubbish like this
<START> this movie is great 80's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an <UNK> so they kill everyone they see the reason they kill makes practically no sense but it just adds to the charm of this movie and <UNK> these kids are crazy especially curtis if you've seen the movie you know who i am talking about that kid's although the movie doesn't have much gore it is entertaining and for some reason you kind of care about the characters it also has some nice nudity has some decent acting as well really a decent 80's slasher movie it's worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it you'll have nightmares about those darn kids though i guarantee you
<START> there are films that are not released in theaters but on video this one should be allowed to age and <UNK> the way old <UNK> film stock does no story inept violence over acted badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only bad part in the film and i did like and enjoyed some of <UNK> other movies
<START> without a doubt this is the big <UNK> of all music videos unlike most music videos that are either dance videos badly <UNK> and or badly interrupted lyrics this was done right jackson was co writer and by evidence of <UNK> heavily choreographed and directed this masterpiece in fact you could say thriller is <UNK> then most horror movies with that last second <UNK> eye to me this music video is what you judge all other music videos on you can easily see the ominous influence m j had on early break dancing with the zombie march number because of the dancing comedy storyline and yes horror i give it a 5 of 5
<START> better than i expected from a film selling itself on the premise of <UNK> and inter racial bondage the music is great and cinematography focuses greatly on turning <UNK> into a trailer trash betty <UNK> and it works samuel l <UNK> to shout a lot which he's good at as well as play lots of blues guitar which he looks cool doing even justin timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend i get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s but instead managed to just <UNK> <UNK> out it's own odd little <UNK> pulp <UNK> while still being an effective drama
<START> after some quite ok dutch action flicks like <UNK> and van god los <UNK> wants to make a movie about the life of a dutch mobster well mobster is a big word for he isn't a real international big guy like george <UNK> blow or <UNK> he is just an <UNK> <UNK> who made some money by selling soft drugs things are often blown up in the <UNK> and this movie is just an other example but even then the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told now there are major jumps in time one day is just an ordinary drug boy the next shot he seems to be a big player in the drug scene nobody knows <UNK> that possible except for those who read the book the acting is really bad the non dutch movie <UNK> get to see one of the worst actresses in the <UNK> <UNK> when you think she finally gets naked then you are watching a stand in model so bad acting bad montage crap story de br br please don't watch it even if other people say it's good because it isn't i've warned you
<START> i saw this movie on tv back in the 60s and it still stands up well even after brilliant performances as a <UNK> by r lee <UNK> lou <UNK> and even frank <UNK> in a comic vein on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i wasn't in the service but my brother had a recording of a <UNK> <UNK> in the air force and it was scary others in the family who were marines told me that <UNK> and even <UNK> were pretty spot on in their roles the only thing missing in the d i is the language in 1958 they couldn't yet use profanity on film yet jack <UNK> came across pretty damned tough without it i think it's his best role ever in <UNK> he was quite stiff i'll admit though not as bad as george raft but he used it only to effect in the d i you never forget the funeral for the dead flea the romantic part was just to stretch the movie but didn't really <UNK> with the basic plot don was pretty good to but he never <UNK> this film in his career as far as <UNK> jack <UNK> was tv's john wayne he carried it a bit too far in some <UNK> episodes but not in the d i after 40 some years i hoped the film could stand up to the likes full metal jacket and others and it did
<START> i was delighted to see this gem of a film available on dvd despite being a <UNK> <UNK> and shot on <UNK> it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a <UNK> along with their <UNK> and family <UNK> even the most hapless of candidates <UNK> with his <UNK> wife it was possible to see how jack was able to craft an often funny and sometimes tragic <UNK> of london life into an entertaining 90 minutes br br originally premiered as a vehicle for mick ford pun intended the quality of the acting from an ensemble cast including michael <UNK> <UNK> jonathan <UNK> <UNK> joseph and maureen <UNK> mrs meant mick may have had top billing but he had to work hard in the face of such competing talents br br even 15 years after its 1991 release it is still as fresh as ever
<START> after wasting 2 hours of my life watching this movie on late night television i went back and <UNK> some of the imdb material to remind myself of why i watched it in the first place in <UNK> the only thing that i can think of is that the genre generally appeals to me but this movie was a total waste of effort it fails on every level and to see that it's described on imdb as a comedy really leaves me at a loss i don't recall more than a couple of chuckles there are more laughs in any episode of law and order than in the last man seriously br br too much of the characters' interaction just didn't seem to me to have any foundation and was therefore very unlikely unbelievable br br if it hadn't been for the almost gratuitous bikini shots well what can i say avoid this movie like the plague or tape it and just fast forward to the bikini shots do not spend even 1 to rent it though
<START> easily one of the best indian films ever granted that's not saying much i made this conclusion after a <UNK> 15 minutes of watching but i can truly say that fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films i've seen br br beautiful because of its imagery the best example i can give is the <UNK> between the 2 female leads <UNK> and <UNK> and the characters of the same name in <UNK> mythology <UNK> for example is the wife of the <UNK> lord ram as legend goes ram <UNK> his wife by making her walk through a fire to prove her <UNK> ' <UNK> in response cries and leaves him <UNK> with her mother the earth this story has all sort of crazy <UNK> to the stories of the 2 indian women <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the word <UNK> all of a sudden has many meanings marriage tradition religion <UNK> and probably a few others i didn't catch br br brilliant because of its social overtones many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see fire e g my mom who actually loved it why because although fire is an attack on tradition it is also an attack on tradition in other words that is its strength not its weakness traditional conservative social <UNK> whether indian or canadian or american or whatever are useless if they <UNK> you gender roles and self denial can both do this br br these are the things i took with me after seeing fire hats off to <UNK>
<START> in <UNK> in <UNK> a boy <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> accused of <UNK> by his crooked master and runs away he falls into a <UNK> local river and is transported into an underwater realm where he makes many friends and <UNK> the mythical water babies from an evil shark br br based on a book by charles kingsley this is a lovely children's film half live action and half animation which is both a grim and <UNK> depiction of victorian times and a <UNK> enjoyable <UNK> adventure it really is two films in one which somehow <UNK> each other and combine into a much <UNK> whole the animation by tony <UNK> jack and is wonderful as is the photography by ted and the music by phil <UNK> and bill martin has a great rough diamond quality as the literal fish out of water i love the moment when he's on top of the mansion sees all the <UNK> and shouts <UNK> at the top of his voice mason and <UNK> are the <UNK> <UNK> bullies you could hope to see in a costume drama if you want to see real victorian values don't watch sense and sensibility watch this and <UNK> pertwee who does <UNK> voices and <UNK> are all excellent this is how a good children's movie should be good old fun but also just a little bit thoughtful sad and frightening high
<START> this is easily the best of the summer camp movies in fact few of the others are even fair let alone anywhere near as entertaining as this one is br br the film is just simply out to have some good clean fun many people who went to summer camp as kids will see that it is presented here <UNK> to the way it usually was but with slapstick comedy mixed in bill murray as the chief <UNK> of the camp leads a fine ensemble cast and is usually at the center of the <UNK> nonsense has great one liners throughout usually <UNK> his jokes as pseudo <UNK> over the <UNK> public address system br br several great supporting actors played the <UNK> and <UNK> to build a <UNK> of fun and interesting subplots all the while <UNK> amongst the many incidents of camp hi <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> and <UNK> keith knight were two characters particularly well done the adventures and <UNK> of these two are hilarious each has classic lines and they are characters you like and root for look for <UNK> in the scene of disco dance <UNK> br br the girls in the story are realistic characters too they're not dumb naive <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or any of the other <UNK> <UNK> teen character stereotypes <UNK> <UNK> kate lynch cindy and others make these characters believable br br the requisite pranks abound usually at the expense of camp director <UNK> harvey the nature of these pranks start at outrageous and progress from there however with all the silliness going on and the others have their serious sides for example befriends a shy lonely kid <UNK> chris <UNK> and takes him under his wing br br the story <UNK> with a sports competition against a rival camp it's a great root for the <UNK> finale when the <UNK> are down <UNK> it just doesn't matter <UNK> is inspired and one of the best moments in the movie and get ready to root <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> ok with this film there are a number of ingredients at work br br first put in loads of <UNK> <UNK> good <UNK> boys who have secret desire to take law into own hands second put in evil <UNK> cops controlled by a texas <UNK> outlaw third put in karate fighting <UNK> played by chuck norris fourth put in a <UNK> teenager as <UNK> nephew captured by evil <UNK> cops fifth show chuck norris fighting in slow motion br br now mix all together and what have you got br br you guessed it one very mediocre movie
<START> just saw it at as closing film of austin film festival going in a had seen a few snippets of their act at <UNK> and thought the trailer was amusing but i wasn't expecting such an epic theme music and the use of <UNK> cards is genius in the title sequence watch out for cameos from ben stiller and tim robbins and the dark lord himself who has a fetish for so much over the top fun and the songs are so catchy the car chase was by far my favorite scene i know this will earn cult status right away and win over some new <UNK> d fans just like me i hope this does well in the theaters follow me we are the shadows
<START> <UNK> is remembered not so much for the fact that its three stars all had the first name robert but as being one of the first hollywood films to deal with anti <UNK> br br the story opens with the murder in <UNK> of a man whom we later learn is a jewish man named joseph sam <UNK> <UNK> smoking police captain <UNK> robert young is assigned to the case an ex soldier <UNK> robert ryan comes upon the murder scene and we learn through flashback that he had met in a bar along with other soldiers who were in the process of being <UNK> out of the service following wwii br br according to <UNK> he and pal <UNK> <UNK> steve <UNK> had followed and <UNK> arthur mitchell george cooper to apartment for drinks <UNK> tells <UNK> that mitchell left the apartment first and that he and <UNK> followed soon after with still alive and well br br unable to locate mitchell <UNK> suspects him of the murder he <UNK> sgt peter robert mitchum to help him locate mitchell mitchell meanwhile has been wondering the streets in a <UNK> state he meets prostitute <UNK> gloria <UNK> in a bar and strikes up a friendship she gives him a key to her apartment and he goes there to rest unexpectedly a man paul kelly turns up looking for <UNK> mitchell still in a <UNK> leaves and goes back to meet and his pals manages to keep him from the police and hides him in an all night movie house br br from <UNK> perspective we learn that <UNK> hates jews and is probably the killer <UNK> begins to focus his investigation on <UNK> trying to prove his guilt he to have one of the soldiers a kid named <UNK> william <UNK> set a trap for br br <UNK> is considered to be one of the best of the film <UNK> genre in fact it garnered several academy award nominations including ryan and <UNK> for best supporting actors it was made on a modest budget in about three weeks br br it has all of the elements of classic film <UNK> the shadows low key lighting and the story playing out mostly at night the requisite femme fatale of the piece is <UNK> <UNK> who plays a minor role but is nonetheless your classic femme fatale the <UNK> character played by paul kelly in an excellent bit has been <UNK> up and spit out by <UNK> and was she about to do the same to mitchell br br robert ryan steals the picture as the brutal <UNK> although it would type cast him in similar roles for years to come robert young makes a good low key detective but robert mitchum has little to do other than <UNK> the mitchell character others in the cast are <UNK> white as <UNK> wife lex barker who would go on the following year to play tarzan as one of <UNK> soldier pals and richard powers who was previously known as tom <UNK> as <UNK> assistant br br director edward would shortly run <UNK> of the house un american <UNK> as having communist and spend a couple of years in jail
<START> oh the horror the <UNK> horror of this film if you can even call it a film this looks like some first year art school project <UNK> <UNK> together br br the talents here will subject you to a painful mix of under and overacting and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious br br the film in no way reflects <UNK> culture or social conventions nobody even talks that way over here i live in <UNK> btw br br spinning seems <UNK> made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival and unfortunately that <UNK> seems to have worked some reviewers would no doubt describe it as exotic but a more accurate word would be atrocious br br
<START> hey all you <UNK> <UNK> you stone <UNK> you mean <UNK> watch out cause slaughter is back in town if you are looking for a bad ass funky film to watch some night this is just right is back and trying to take it easy <UNK> relax after his adventures down in mexico but if you are a narrow minded gangster like you are bound to seek revenge why i don't know was in the first one his brother or what any who the movie starts off with the old assassination from a plane routine we all know that that is the most effective way for taking out one guy in a <UNK> full of people needless to say slaughter survives the ordeal but eric sorry george i mean isn't that lucky <UNK> also <UNK> best friend <UNK> is killed this is the start of a grand adventure filled with the <UNK> music james brown himself has to offer that's right 'the godfather of <UNK> has put his trademark up on this bad boy in addition to jim brown in the lead part this movie is filled with some of the biggest names the <UNK> scene has to offer how about <UNK> <UNK> dick anthony williams gloria <UNK> and <UNK> peters in other parts we see none other than <UNK> m brown and last but definitely least the fantastic don <UNK> as the evil henchman
<START> although the movie was only so so the closed <UNK> was by far the best i have ever seen most of the time the spelling is terrible and the <UNK> out of sync i use the closed <UNK> even though i can hear well but find a lot of actors <UNK> also many times the sound track <UNK> the dialogue thanks
<START> the final <UNK> wants to say something about racism and inner city violence unfortunately the message is by the nonsensical script the amateurish production and the heavy handed <UNK> how heavy handed you ask to give you just one example a black doctor comes out of his hiding place <UNK> with his hands up in the air ready to surrender to the police one of the all white cops says don't shoot him he's a doctor to which another cop replies so what he's still a n r and proceeds to shoot him in cold blood the cops are portrayed as ignorant racist killers even though at the end there are just as many dead people among them as there are among the black people who staged the riot and this whole event was meant somehow to the white folks to the <UNK> treatment of the black folks when in fact something like this can only breed more hate and violence on both sides pamela jones as <UNK> girlfriend briefly lights up the screen with her smile and body particularly in a tender sex scene and <UNK> the rating of this movie from 1 to 2 out of 10
<START> why do they keep making trash like this because it makes money that's why <UNK> is not so much a film but a string of action set pieces strung together it's well filmed but predictable and it's all been done before only better this is basically a nineties version of
<START> this movie is such a good movie shah <UNK> khan does a great job as the crazy mad villain who is totally obsessed with br br the girl the story is fantastic the acting by all br br characters like the girl and shah <UNK> and sunny are all fabulous and i really love the first song especially how it comes back at the end oh and its so emotional if your a true shah <UNK> khan fan you have gotta watch this movie because its the best shah <UNK> khan movie ever he plays an excellent role and i wish he done more crazy man roles but u have to watch this what so ever this is a really good movie this is a really good movie you have to watch it it is truly amazing you have to watch it it is fabulous i can go on and on about this movie because it is a fun funny scary cool and totally fantastic movie in the world
<START> there is one <UNK> that describes everything about this film acting plot effects continuity etc and that word is poor the government wants to <UNK> the effects of space travel on certain <UNK> but the capsule crashes and a mutant something or other looks like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face <UNK> havoc around the accident scene which includes a favorite place for the window <UNK> <UNK> set therefore some young people as well as a law <UNK> officer are among the <UNK> victims you gotta be extremely about how you spend your time or rich if you spend any money to view this epic
<START> i found it hard to care about these characters who were either annoying or insipid all living their <UNK> hilariously urban lives br br the dialogue was at times and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow was it me or were entire scenes deleted br br it felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film the stereotypes and jokes about men's groups would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s as it is this is where much of the humour of the film comes from and boy does it get old fast br br apart from the attractive irish man this film was a dud and not even in a so bad it's good way the last 20 minutes were particularly painful perhaps if you've never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before then this film might have something meaningful to say otherwise <UNK> you'd still be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing
<START> one of the greatest lessons i ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way br br i was working in roger <UNK> <UNK> like so many other before and since i was and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself <UNK> <UNK> one afternoon julie corman roger <UNK> wife and a producer in her own right asked me to load up a tape i'm not sure why she wanted to watch it i got the impression it was a student film or a show reel something like that some sort of calling card whatever the reasons she had to see it the only free video machine in the <UNK> at the time happened to be in the room i was working in and i was the nearest person to the machine i started the tape br br fade in on screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera behind him screen left was a door that opened into the room against the far wall was a coat rack a second character entered through the door and started talking the first character the guy at the desk turned round to <UNK> this is all one take static camera there are no cuts pans or <UNK> shots just one locked off camera the second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line julie corman said i've seen enough and left the room br br what she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines nope sorry next that's how long you've got ten seconds <UNK> it up in the opening shot and you are dead br br i was reminded of that moment while i watched the opening of this piece of crap after an <UNK> long <UNK> of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into <UNK> a man carrying a gun laughs a jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the <UNK> god this is boring cut to the interior of the airport two men meet <UNK> something is happening they shake hands cut to a different angle of the two men br br and the director crosses the line br br the first two shots of the movie that have any kind of <UNK> relationship with each other and the guy has <UNK> up <UNK> crossing the <UNK> is one of those basic rules of movie <UNK> that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience audiences don't like to be confused <UNK> <UNK> puzzled and intrigued yes audiences love all of those confused no you loose them they walk out <UNK> crossing the <UNK> is one of those things they pound into you at film school or should it's basic stuff it's not an <UNK> rule there are no <UNK> rules directors break it all the time but not on the first real cut of the movie br br i thought i've seen enough and switched off
<START> will some company please make a good dvd of this film aside from being a wonderful film about relationships and friendships four friends is the only film i've ever seen and i have literally spent years of my life watching films that captures the essence of the 60s experience and i was there the <UNK> the hope the freedom the confusion the <UNK> and ultimately its upbeat but bittersweet denouement and all of this is accomplished without being a story about any of the numerous <UNK> of that era although many are just touched upon as part of the <UNK> but the story is primarily about the characters and their friendship over about 10 15 years and that those survived and <UNK> despite the <UNK> of that <UNK> decade absolutely a joy and must see film even if one's not an old hippie
<START> after i saw la <UNK> several years ago i said to myself that i would never see it again so powerful and disturbing it was time went on but i could not get the movie and its main character erika out of my mind the story of a respected piano teacher in vienna <UNK> cool and <UNK> on the surface an expert in classical music with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear self loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her <UNK> more than one viewing i read the book the piano teacher by <UNK> <UNK> the controversial <UNK> prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it i saw the film again second time all pieces of puzzle came to the right places not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such <UNK> as le <UNK> three actors gave outstanding performances <UNK> <UNK> piano music <UNK> in the morbid humanity is another bright star of the movie br br i only have one problem with <UNK> vision there is a scene in the film where <UNK> made some changes to <UNK> character comparing to the novel in the book the <UNK> she went to reveal herself to walter the young student in the <UNK> who became attracted to her was in a letter as soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was <UNK> by that she had stopped <UNK> with him erika of the book would never chase walter to throw herself to him she kept everything inside she did not like to act she was not a <UNK> she loved to watch the big scene during the hockey game was not necessary it tried to make erika sympathetic and of course <UNK> was heartbreaking but it took the mystery that surrounded her <UNK> did not write that scene it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film
<START> this piece of crap is actually the bomb as in bottom of the barrel i can't figure out which is worst <UNK> dull portrayal of <UNK> not a great <UNK> in an action protagonist or christopher hysterical overacting this film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever the action sequences are tame the plot is paper thin and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a cliché from the fifties you can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits and expect the audience to scream in terror br br visually the film does nothing for me it actually looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn flick and a miami vice rip off with a little <UNK> of hell <UNK> no wait that should have been hell yawn
<START> i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about <UNK> england br br the writing directing and editing of this tv movie for the most part was truly awful i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period <UNK> then a movie br br first there were too many <UNK> between important parts and leaving out important events which happened at the time one is <UNK> fall out with rome over his desire to divorce <UNK> of <UNK> which led to <UNK> breaking away from rome and establishing her own church they barely stuck to the book at all i'm all for creative freedom but to a limit especially when your dealing with a well written book as your <UNK> point in the book mary birth to young catherine first and then she has young henry is born both their father is <UNK> the eight in the movie they show harry's first then catherine and suggest that catherine father is william carey br br there are too many bad <UNK> in the movie to write them all br br i will however say that may and <UNK> <UNK> portrayal as the <UNK> sisters was probably the best part of the movie br br if you haven't read the book and know nothing about the 8 court i will recommend to stay away from this movie and for those who read the book the movie will annoy you for it's lack of details and important <UNK>
<START> i love this movie sure i love it because of madonna but who cares it's damn funny <UNK> rocks when i first saw this film in the theatres back in 1987 i thought it was all out hilarious madonna is so funny and i love her dubbed accent and wacky funky look the all time funniest part is when madonna <UNK> screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi and also when <UNK> dunne <UNK> and falls at the apartment interview scene <UNK> rocks <UNK> character <UNK> steals shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time didn't rob <UNK> when you rob a store you stick up the <UNK> we <UNK> a few tapes there's a bit of a difference i love that it's classic <UNK> rocks i don't know why this movie got <UNK> the way it did i see nothing wrong with it course maybe if you're a huge madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome anyone out there who wants to see some funny classic entertainment then watch who's that girl and another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist <UNK> will always rock ya completely to the end so does madonna in this film and just entirely her acting is superb
<START> everything is <UNK> is like viewing a fine piece of museum quality artwork it absolutely the emotions through a very broad spectrum jonathan <UNK> <UNK> is played with <UNK> by <UNK> wood he is in search of his <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> his travels bring him in contact with alex played very well and with extreme humor by eugene his grandfather is the most emotional tie to this film and he is <UNK> portrayed by boris if one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema then one has only to turn to a real dog who is called sammy davis jr jr by alex and his grandfather they also call him the seeing eye bitch the cinematography is spectacular the colors are a very important part of the <UNK> of the film it is a film worth the time and emotional investment
<START> this movie is extremely funny and enjoyable with suitable funny and experienced casts i find this movie enjoyable not only by the elements of humor but also the music in various scenes kevin kline a good comedian has done a good job at being funny in many parts of the film along with tom <UNK> who is amazingly different from many of his other films the humor within this film are goofy which makes various <UNK> within many scenes especially the beginning bits joan cusack is also remarkably funny and exaggerated and the same goes for all the other casts this film has many elements of goofy humor and is enjoyable if you want to laugh
<START> at the opposite end of the spectrum from <UNK> of the lost <UNK> is david utterly inferior adventure regarding the salvage of a world war ii era plane with a valuable <UNK> <UNK> include beautiful new zealand settings brian <UNK> energetic music score and some dandy helicopter flying and jet boat chases the bad however far <UNK> the good donald <UNK> <UNK> as perhaps never before half of his dialog is almost <UNK> george <UNK> attempts an australian i think accent then gives it up halfway through <UNK> ann warren is at her most irritating ken is well ken the dialog is painful to hear and direction is largely inept the script is not only obvious but terrible jokes fall flat scenes carry no punch and continuity is virtually non existent according to the end credits two men were killed <UNK> jet <UNK> during the making of the film what a waste
<START> a lot of good things could have been done with this movie using essentially the same sets plot devices and storyline for example why not plant a seed of <UNK> before the murder of her lover why not develop <UNK> and the <UNK> relationship slowly and convincingly maybe contrast <UNK> by including some other post event <UNK> relationship etc in her life that she now rejects why not have her <UNK> an innocent <UNK> to <UNK> the in actions br br instead exploits the revenge fantasy to its maximum level giving <UNK> lip service to the don't do this at home messages thrown in only to allow the film to qualify as legitimate br br i'm not a jodie foster fan after displaying some range in films like silence of the <UNK> <UNK> and one where she plays the ordinary mother of a child <UNK> foster has slipped into a succession of roles where she plays the same hard bitten heroine single <UNK> <UNK> evil such is fine once or twice but i'm getting too used to her fight versus flight close up could have used a younger actress or one that more convincingly <UNK> being a woman in her forties instead of 40 something foster playing a younger woman br br is a movie with substantial actors <UNK> and resources that manages to <UNK> to junk
<START> this is an awful movie from just about every point of view since much has been already pointed out in previous reviews let me just focus on <UNK> and <UNK> force guys in this movie br br 1 the uniforms that <UNK> wear are not serbian and <UNK> are wrong too br br 2 the actors who play <UNK> are not speaking serbian not even a language close to serbian unlike in behind enemy lines where the czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least a bit of credibility to the movie br br 3 the gray <UNK> serbian general looks and acts like a moron firing his gun whenever us soldiers call his name br br us soldier give up br br gray <UNK> moronic general fires his br br us soldier come out br br fires his br br us soldier you're surrounded br br fires his br br prop guy excuse me mr gray <UNK> moronic general see we're out of <UNK> and i sent the boy to buy some more but he's not back yet br br click br br 4 since when does the army issue to the <UNK> force i guess they couldn't find enough working in <UNK> but there were plenty of old and practice <UNK> maybe they should have went for some they are cheaper and wouldn't have hurt the credibility of the movie anyway br br 5 in the scene where a officer is hanging on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist he is holding his finger on the trigger all the time no sane person with any weapons training or just plain common sense would ever do that i guess the actor figured that his <UNK> level <UNK> the longer he holds the gun that way br br this movie is such an insult to common sense
<START> what a crazy film it lasts 12 hours and you don't understand who these people are and what are they doing the main plot is about a bunch of clueless actors trying to bring on scene <UNK> but there are lots of sub plots like the disappearing of thomas and a crazy guy looking for <UNK> what's the meaning of all this
<START> lou <UNK> sans <UNK> plays a small town self employed rubbish collector and the <UNK> of a time controlling machine who is secretly <UNK> the niece of the town big shot after a <UNK> <UNK> girl dorothy runs into a misty cave why it's misty we never learn and emerges as a 30 foot giant is certainly a good sport and she doesn't bother trying not to look ridiculous it would've been impossible anyway yet the screenwriter is really cruel to this character turning her not only into a giant but a <UNK> <UNK> as well bosses <UNK> around while creating havoc with the army troops who get called in but nothing funny is done with the transformation <UNK> by attack of the 50 <UNK> woman the previous year the film does feature lou <UNK> in his final bow but provides little else the special effects are <UNK> while the script needed funnier lines and the direction pacing 1 2 from
<START> what can i say not as bad as many here have made it out to be the only reason i even watched this film that i had previously never heard of before was strictly for ian <UNK> br br i was not disappointed in the least ian <UNK> was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role he's always great to watch and for my money an extremely underused actor br br as for the rest of the film every other actor in the movie delivered strong solid performances these people certainly weren't being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation as this was a fairly low budget film but this did not mean that any of them <UNK> their appearances in everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them br br i was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul's performance though i must admit i have only ever seen him in the <UNK> television series before this movie br br the plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film anybody who expected a clear cut by the numbers connect the <UNK> conclusion or answer at the end of the movie clearly wasn't watching the film closely enough this film is not going to tell you what the meaning of life is the idea is that after seeing the film you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee i certainly did br br no car chases no explosions no bar room <UNK> sounds pretty dull huh but the reality is that i was completely absorbed by the film and it's just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved br br warning if you're the kind of person who <UNK> movies that <UNK> an enormous question as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly br br you might not enjoy this film
<START> the golden door is for this viewer the finest film of the year to date it is a masterpiece of concept writing directing acting and cinematography more importantly this <UNK> beautiful film is a much needed <UNK> mirror for us to view the history of <UNK> of into america at a time when the very mention of the word is a political <UNK> writer director <UNK> has given us not only a deeply moving story he has also provided a <UNK> for viewers to re visit the history of each of our origins with the exception of the native americans we all entered america as at some point in our <UNK> and it is <UNK> to view this film with that fact in mind br br the film opens in turn of the century <UNK> as poverty stricken widower <UNK> <UNK> vincenzo <UNK> and his brother <UNK> <UNK> climb a rocky hill to present their <UNK> to the cross to ask for a sign as to whether they should continue to struggle for existence on the island or go to america the land of dreams deaf mute son <UNK> runs to the top of the hill with <UNK> he has found with images of america money growing on trees <UNK> and <UNK> larger than people etc and <UNK> accepts this as the sign that he should move his family to america after convincing his reluctant mother <UNK> and his sisters rita de <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to make the trip he sells his only <UNK> two <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and the man with the boat <UNK> their trip giving the family shoes appropriate clothing and <UNK> to board an ocean liner as third class passengers as the <UNK> family <UNK> to board they are asked for a photograph and as they pose behind a painted set an <UNK> lucy charlotte <UNK> walks into the photo as though she were part of this <UNK> family lucy cannot board the boat for america without male <UNK> br br the voyage begins and in her gentle way <UNK> with the <UNK> family finally her safe passage by <UNK> to <UNK> to marry her <UNK> <UNK> not for <UNK> when they arrive in america through a violent storm and living conditions that are appalling poor the <UNK> of third class passengers survive bond and eventually arrive at <UNK> island believing their dream of america has been <UNK> but everyone must pass harsh physical <UNK> de <UNK> and even intelligence testing to determine if they can enter america the officials let them know that america does not want <UNK> inferior people entering the new world each woman must be selected by a man to marry on <UNK> island before they are allowed admission the manner in which the <UNK> family remains united until a somewhat surprising ending is the closing of the tale br br few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment immigrants face or at least faced at the turn of the century on <UNK> island and if we do we have elected to <UNK> that information the golden door presents the case for struggles in a manner that not only touches our hearts but also challenges our acceptance of current <UNK> <UNK> but all political issues aside the golden door is first and foremost a film of enormous beauty exquisite photography deeply felt performances by a huge cast and a very <UNK> written and directed story the is a film that deserves wide distribution a movie that is a must see for everyone highly recommended grady <UNK>
<START> jeff <UNK> never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martial artists turned actors lower than don the dragon wilson for example and with vehicles like the expert you can see why there are three major problems with this movie 1 the plot or should i say plots are all over the place there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve little purpose 2 there are only 4 fight scenes in total some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some taking place in the dark 3 the music score is <UNK> and overbearing strange as it may seem this is really the most annoying thing about this film the score <UNK> tries to convince you that you're watching some sort of grand epic instead of the low budget limited action film you are indeed watching with all that said at least there's james <UNK> around to lend a touch of credibility 1 2 out of 4
<START> this is an excellent <UNK> <UNK> from the war years br br john mills leads a fine cast of regular british b movie <UNK> in a solo submarine attack upon a <UNK> enemy <UNK> br br filmed in black and white it's well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time if anything it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda br br the mission side of the movie takes place in genuine <UNK> things are <UNK> and claustrophobic the actors look suitably <UNK> and <UNK> without being too offensive to the heroic <UNK> other <UNK> have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the <UNK> <UNK> and forgetting to read <UNK> as well as the engine room activities br br this probably is the first movie in which <UNK> and a dead german is blown from the <UNK> tube to fool an enemy <UNK> and it's the only time i have seen part of the <UNK> exposed in a <UNK> of sinking a high risk <UNK> if ever there was one br br i'm a little <UNK> as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wire rope net <UNK> speed was barely twice that of human walking speed and the net would have had a great deal of also the engineer was at the same work station and operating the same <UNK> both on the surface and <UNK> this too seems implausible as either <UNK> or electric <UNK> were used and they were in different sections of the ship or so i'm told br br there was a wee bit too much shore side drama for my tastes but then this was a propaganda effort and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could <UNK> affect service <UNK> and <UNK> the war effort br br these <UNK> aside it's a pretty entertaining little adventure nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy prime time but then it's no longer politically correct to mention the war in the presence of our european friends too many of them have guilty or our own left wing <UNK> non of whom have ever fought for the <UNK> they now take for granted br br as a submarine movie it is <UNK> <UNK> better than 'the enemy i think though less <UNK> not so authentic as by any means but not so gross either
<START> a <UNK> police detective suspects a french duke of being the infamous thief <UNK> br br john lionel barrymore <UNK> together for the first time in a motion picture in this intriguing crime drama alike and yet so different they are the perfect <UNK> to each other john plays his role with suave sophistication when not in disguise and lionel is <UNK> common in his portrayal each obviously having a wonderful time trying to out act the other helped by a generous script the outcome is pretty much a draw with the viewer the clear winner br br although <UNK> by the two male stars karen <UNK> is intriguing as the mystery woman john finds naked in his bed <UNK> marshall gives a colorful performance as a silly <UNK> with much to lose to the master criminal henry <UNK> george davis are very enjoyable as two seriously inept security guards john <UNK> provides a <UNK> presence in his small role as the police <UNK> br br movie <UNK> will recognize an uncredited <UNK> <UNK> as a guide in the <UNK> during the climactic scene dealing with an attempted heist of the <UNK> lisa
<START> doesn't mean this movie is good i was really frustrated by it on many levels it's kind of the tip of the hat to <UNK> hey i've read that guy in college let's see what matt dillon does with him and i like matt dillon i thought he came close to looking a little like hank but mostly just the <UNK> i have to care about a character though and there just wasn't much here to care about i think time might be cruel to <UNK> and that bothers me a lot because the writing was solid in a sort of post counter culture time hard to sit through scenes that went nowhere and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit i ask for very little got less
<START> i saw this movie on a <UNK> i was standing on <UNK> street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this movie i gave it a chance not expecting much the <UNK> movie posters i've seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all br br the movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal i'll leave it there the movie is a heavy comedy and <UNK> of fun if your are old enough to remember when heavy metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this film jack black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician br br <UNK> d is definitely worth a look
<START> should we take the opening shot as a strange frame i guess we have to anyway two women are behind a closing <UNK> they walk upstairs to the talent agency and we go with them and then they are never to be seen again okay how come not inside the place at the piano or even outside with the sound of the piano then track inside and over a la hitchcock so i guess <UNK> is already telling us in a not very <UNK> manner that we are following a segment of <UNK> society especially how he then uses a citizen kane like song cut up into about five pieces to show the lady singing traveling from the talent agency all the way to her first <UNK> and applause of her vaudeville debut br br after that we are relentless <UNK> of more or less small disgusting details of a defeated country getting off its war torn <UNK> knees and nobody ever handled small disgust better than <UNK> in fact too bad he never tried <UNK> <UNK> almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us ever so slightly <UNK> okay okay i'm grossly <UNK> that let's just settle for a general feel of a lot of the film look carefully in fact and you will even see one of the cops picking his nose and in how many films has anyone ever done that then there is a very loud nose blowing bit in front of the photographer lesbian by the main cop and notice that she does not literally blink an eye or raise an <UNK> br br the point of all this is an almost <UNK> <UNK> in seemingly until you can smell practically every scene as well as see and feel it br br as for the other aspects of the movie others here have covered them in a lot more detail than i but forget about the mystery here this is the ultimate <UNK> <UNK> is about as interested in the real killer as those two women coming in out of the rain in the first few seconds of the film and are never seen again from beginning to end all he wanted to do was follow a bunch of people around not even particularly interesting ones at that and say here look at this woman's <UNK> that man's <UNK> of his pants in all their <UNK> years and years before tina turner was singing we don't need another hero br br even the forced <UNK> of the ending is <UNK> done in a <UNK> part of paris and rather <UNK> bare <UNK> apartment with only the couples love for each other to see them through as if to say there must be two or three million like you throughout the city working your fingers off by the day for a little love at night br br from this it was just a short step to <UNK> of fear and the ultimate in despair br br they don't even know how to make films like this anymore in the u s for that matter they didn't even know how to very much in france then much less now the relentless detail of gesture makes even the of italy look like bad <UNK> which i guess makes <UNK> a kind of <UNK> on speed br br very enjoyable nonsense this movie the only flaw seems to me and as was pointed out by another viewer the lead woman is somehow not quite right everybody else in the film is just about perfectly cast
<START> my children <UNK> 7 and <UNK> 10 enjoyed the movie so much they were <UNK> in their seats it was good old fashioned rated g family fun this movie was made for kids someone really understands them br br it was fun to see julia roberts <UNK> willis <UNK> brooks and the other stars make their cameo appearances br br as someone who lives in the city the fictional big texas was <UNK> after i can say that they did an honest and accurate portrayal the kids looked like kids not like <UNK> br br i hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to hollywood that we need more movies like this go see it then spread the word
<START> i sat through this on tv hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time but dear <UNK> whoever thought this script was worth producing the basic idea is excellent but the execution is <UNK> bad with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly <UNK> face looks like a bad b movie from the 40's
<START> lovely <UNK> <UNK> as the widow are kidnapped and held for <UNK> by the <UNK> played by one dashing sean connery the incident comes during <UNK> as theodore <UNK> runs for election to the <UNK> in his own right needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the united states brian keith as <UNK> issues a stunning <UNK> to the <UNK> of <UNK> alive or dead br br but in this adaptation of that incident the famous <UNK> is the only true thing about this story the in question was in reality one <UNK> who was a greek immigrant and <UNK> playboy in fact gave up his american <UNK> years ago and was back as a greek national never mind that though his <UNK> was <UNK> enough at the time br br the damsel in distress makes better screen material though so it's a widow woman and her two kids that are in <UNK> way here of course as presented here the incident is also used by some of our european powers to get their <UNK> into <UNK> the <UNK> get far beyond one demand for <UNK> br br the wind and the lion is hardly history but it is an enjoyable film and sean connery is always fun to watch brian keith also fits my conception of theodore <UNK> and the scenes in the <UNK> white house do ring true to all the stories told john huston plays the ever patient secretary of state john <UNK> who <UNK> had inherited from his predecessor william <UNK> br br but kids don't use this film to skip reading a history assignment on the theodore <UNK> era
<START> a gritty look at new york city and <UNK> workers this is a classic film realistic brutal at times always believable it was originally shown live on tv also starring sidney <UNK> john cassavetes was a fantastic director and actor
<START> this probably ranks in my top 5 list of the funniest movies i've ever seen i was not a big fan of robin hood or robin hood prince of thieves but this movie was a lot different it made fun of robin hood and was hilarious i was extremely pleased with how well it was put together and how well acted it was besides home alone mrs <UNK> and <UNK> this was the funniest move i've ever seen i especially love the song we're men in <UNK> if you have a good sense of humor you'll love this movie
<START> it s funny how instinct warns you of something for example as soon as the company credits read <UNK> image i knew <UNK> i d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but <UNK> t remember where nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was maybe i m psychic br br mild spoilers br br the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time i don t know about you but i m <UNK> slightly fed up with <UNK> violence <UNK> nowadays along with bad language especially if it s <UNK> by actors as bad as the ones in this movie anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to <UNK> revenge on the man who shot his wife oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night yeah he s a serious <UNK> <UNK> in fact he s so bad and i don t mean the acting i ll get to that in a moment that he s impossible to take seriously and this is before he s executed only to return as <UNK> john elvis a french chef etc i wonder if keith david got paid for this because he looks he s having so much fun on screen that s the only reason he s playing the role what a pity this reviewer <UNK> t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury hey maybe the producers could send me keith s <UNK> <UNK> only knows i deserve it br br i disliked this movie a lot as if you t guessed and my main <UNK> <UNK> t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence if like me you <UNK> had a wine bottle <UNK> over your head or been kicked in the <UNK> very hard several times you ll know violence is an obscene painful thing but judge and jury will have you believe that if you re thrown through a window crash through some and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be <UNK> but you ll be able to <UNK> a couple of <UNK> devil dogs it could of course be <UNK> that any film starring sly arnie or bruce also suffers from this same <UNK> showing of violence but with judge and jury it <UNK> my chain
<START> as i sat in the theater almost crying to myself in <UNK> over the atrocity ron howard and tom hanks call the da <UNK> code i could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is angels and demons br br hanks and company are back for the sequel prequel angels and demons and they have learned their lesson br br acting wise everyone is much better is very good as and better than the girl who played sophie tom hanks is very good as always he is better in this though because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller i think ewan <UNK> does the best job of any of the actors he might even deserve a nomination come march but <UNK> he had me convinced right until the very end he's dynamic and faithful but rational and realizes that the church needs to put their past behind them the minor actors also do very good jobs br br technically and visually the movie is much improved the cinematography is much much better and the visual effects are superb the final explosion sequence at the end is excellent howard does a masterful job taking you through a tour of rome br br pacing wise ron howard does an amazing job this time around at keeping the story moving and not boring us with a history lesson deemed at <UNK> christianity the movie also makes you feel like more is at stake in our feeble minds discovering whether or not jesus had children is not as high up on the list compared to a <UNK> explosion killing thousands including the roman catholic church part of the reason i think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score i cannot say enough about the score it was epic at times like something from lord of the rings but then sometimes it felt like a bourne movie which is a nice mix br br my only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far fetched the chances of the being someone of ewan age are highly improbable and the chances of a <UNK> with an adopted son getting elected <UNK> are even more ridiculous not to mention the whole <UNK> thing which has yet to be created and dan brown wrote the book in 2003 br br overall angels and demons is much <UNK> faster paced more exciting and more important movie than the da <UNK> code this is must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one
<START> i as many imdb <UNK> seem to have stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the canadian showcase network i was as many of you also sucked in and watched the entire film i was hooked at first by the <UNK> dialogue and <UNK> sense of humour that the film is rich with i was <UNK> along <UNK> on a sort of kevin smith meets killer films wave until half way through when the movie really <UNK> down and explored it's themes in more detail with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge far from being taken out of the experience i was brought further in this is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal so i do understand some of the more negative reactions to it but i bought in and enjoyed it immensely the flash back type movement in the <UNK> was effective the characters were well realized and the issues raised were human accessible to my experience anyway and interesting i was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet funny and entertaining while not <UNK> away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language dynamics and situations this movie is a great <UNK> to a lot of the schlock that has <UNK> the witty clever romantic genre a kind of male <UNK> jones for the <UNK> <UNK> take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and jump into world or you could go rent you've got mail 'cause if that appeals to you you won't like this anyway those of us who did like it will be alright without you on our side
<START> i loved this program and for years searched for it on video i've <UNK> a great many folks in my attempts to get a copy to no <UNK> br br i do however have the second half of the program i would be willing to share my half with anyone who can give me a copy of the first half of this show i'd offer to provide copies of what i have to anyone but it's just only part of the program so it's just not an adequate representation of the show br br there are a few folks selling this on ebay for some incredible cost and that's <UNK> not fair not to mention blatant <UNK> <UNK> br br please send any <UNK> to <UNK> com
<START> i got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for <UNK> with clips from it so i watched the movie and it is indeed <UNK> beautiful a masterpiece of animation br br unfortunately the story doesn't keep up it starts out well with interesting <UNK> about people <UNK> for the possession of the rose bride but suddenly <UNK> fill up with water and <UNK> their walls people <UNK> away and finally for no reason whatsoever is into a car and a chase ensues br br i like much anime for it's ability to make alternative <UNK> but this universe is just stupid if you are gonna watch this movie turn of the sound it's better that way
<START> follow up to <UNK> my name is barbra and shot in brilliant color color me barbra has la streisand <UNK> nostalgia <UNK> comedy feminine romantic angst and <UNK> seriousness for a crazy <UNK> hour of show <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she's a cut up and a femme fatale a <UNK> and an <UNK> with her egyptian eye make up and ever changing <UNK> she's also a <UNK> her voice is rich and moving even if a few of her songs are not one kiss <UNK> the circus sequence isn't as intriguing as the museum trip with the <UNK> of barbra becoming the images in the paintings an idea which works better than you may think the circus <UNK> built around songs featuring the word face is <UNK> cute without ever really becoming enchanting still this is a lively <UNK> special not quite as emotionally <UNK> as my name is barbra but certainly a sterling <UNK> effort
<START> much as i really like catherine zeta jones i wondered once again why remake a good movie this version lacked the tension and passion of mostly martha it was a clear rip off was more convincing as a hurting child who <UNK> with love i couldn't believe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> owned this role unfortunately zeta jones should have found another one that she could own she has other roles she does own sergio <UNK> was good as a vulnerable but <UNK> italian aaron seemed <UNK> in comparison this version was pleasant but bland br br the love between mario and martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying the <UNK> added an interesting bit of color that didn't seem important i liked it when at the end he said he'd be back but the movie was over before he returned i have mostly martha at home every now and then i <UNK> it
<START> i think the best way for me to review this title is to split it into its pros and cons br br pros they turn into wolves rather than plastic <UNK> monsters the chase of the wolves through the forest cash machine by hard fi being played br br cons some parts of the script makes you cringe for example the terrible part where the woman escapes the of the fortunate five boys and there's about half an hour of dear cousin and a round robin of yes see we know <UNK> law the diving transformation is ridiculous the obvious and ridiculous ending <UNK> being told thousands of times to leave and then goes if you cared about me you would have left me the obvious characters the unnecessary the completely unnecessary <UNK> of the arm by <UNK> <UNK> speeches by gabriel br br you see what i mean br br i adore werewolf films and i tried watching this a few times to see if i'd like it better but it just made it worse i think i'll just read the book and see how i get on br br don't bother with this unless you have a 12 year old brother or sister into spooky things anyone over that age may suffer and want their hour and a half back

<START> <UNK> is the second movie of the series of six productions named i have already <UNK> commented the first one <UNK> this second tv movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the italian state owned network has the same <UNK> in addition contains a considerable number of historical errors some examples <UNK> is a child and calls him <UNK> <UNK> at that time is name was <UNK> he was named <UNK> after his <UNK> <UNK> did not meet when he was young as in the movie but after his marriage with <UNK> and his nomination to emperor when becoming emperor his sons where not adults is one month old and <UNK> one year old and many many more if you are fond of ancient roman history you can find yourselves other examples series will continue with four more movies <UNK> marcus <UNK> and the fall of the roman empire finally
<START> basically the first two <UNK> movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way this movie is way more of a b movie that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons br br this is the first sequel that doesn't really follows the plot of the first two movies basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time well as good as none since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late and the budget for this one obviously went down again to save even more costs the movie got shot back to back with part 4 which i <UNK> will be just as bad since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this one br br it's just a typical b genre movie that doesn't really have any originality in it or brings entertainment it makes <UNK> 3 a real redundant sequel you can easily do without granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just ain't exactly a good one either the movie just falls flat as a science fiction horror comedy br br also kind of strange to notice how the <UNK> has suddenly changed in this one they are about double their usual size this time without giving an explanation for that and they are even more <UNK> like in this movie than was the case in the previous one br br the movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of <UNK> <UNK> he was about 17 in this movie and of course looking baby faced like he still does now i like watching this well known actors in their early roles it's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years of course <UNK> got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these days br br really a too silly and lame movie br br 4 10
<START> 2002 a turkish film shown in the u s as distant br br was directed produced written and filmed by <UNK> br br br br this movie is a gritty and somber version of the clash between a city mouse played by and a country mouse played by br br both men are superb actors and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skill <UNK> died in an <UNK> accident shortly after the movie was completed br br in most country cousin city cousin tales the contrast between rural and urban life styles is portrayed in a humorous fashion in this film there's little humor or even warmth both men br br have lost touch with human society 's work as a br br commercial photographer for a <UNK> company gives him no satisfaction he has divorced a woman he clearly br br still loves and has no satisfying human relationships br br has lost his job because of a factory closing in his small town and doesn't have the skills or the energy to find work in the city his human interactions are primarily confined to silent observations of the other people who cross his path he's clearly a warm and caring person but can't express these qualities in an urban environment br br the cousins don't relate well to the world and they don't relate well to each other neither makes an effort to act in a way that would provide an opportunity for bonding or <UNK> br br in a sense this film portrays an opportunity wasted br br <UNK> each cousin could have provided at least part of what was lacking in the other's life instead they steer parallel unhappy <UNK> the two men are distant throughout which is a situation suggested by the film's title br br one of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which builds detail upon detail these details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we might have learned by simple exposition br br was shown as part of the rochester labor film series it's not a labor film in the traditional sense of that genre it is a labor film because it demonstrates the <UNK> effects of unsatisfying work and <UNK> br br this is a quiet absorbing dark film although it doesn't make for happy viewing i walked out of the br br theater realizing that i had seen a truly creative and br br important movie this film is worth finding and seeing
<START> what can i say this movie has it all romance break ups rich kids <UNK> and <UNK> this is my all time favorite movie that i can <UNK> line for line i remember when it first came out i was 14 and couldn't get in so finally got to see it on cable i was hooked wanted to move to california and be a valley girl hey i even remember the song by moon <UNK> do you tried in vain for years to get the never produced soundtrack now you can find it on <UNK> records
<START> i watched this cooking show for a few times before i wanted to pull my hair out just one question who can't cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand already <UNK> sometimes pre chopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few <UNK> also almost every cooking show on tv is 30 minutes and most of these <UNK> do all of their <UNK> work except for sandra lee during their show oh and yep they do full <UNK> too br br love the comment by the guy who hated the comment add de to my list of stupid tag words br br then you have the obvious a loud <UNK> woman who is truly her own best audience she laughs at her own lame comments <UNK> too many times for the camera because she wants to convince us that she's as good as the thinks br br no she ain't the <UNK> thing she's a 40 something year old woman who isn't de
<START> ok it was a <UNK> move to rent this flick but i thought i had nothing to lose well i was wrong this is next to the worst <UNK> i have ever seen crappy actors crappy technical <UNK> crappy story and so on the soundtrack though isn't to bad that is why i give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1 and of course the cats are a positive surprise by far the superior actors in this movie do not rent or buy it stay away from it and hope that this horrible horrible film will <UNK> to some obscure existence and not become a cult classic it most definitely do not deserve any recognition
<START> <UNK> is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully <UNK> study of a small danish community towards the end of the last century two beautiful and <UNK> talented sisters give up their own <UNK> of happiness and marriage in order to look after their <UNK> father one day a french woman <UNK> comes to work for them after some years she wins the <UNK> and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in her solution is to prepare an exquisite and <UNK> feast which changes the lives of all those invited this is a film about human and cultural interaction reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from danish to french and especially between the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> northern europe and the <UNK> of the catholic south it is also about human needs and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and <UNK> through the <UNK> of the senses a profoundly uplifting film
<START> right the hospital scene with holly and shannon was done brilliantly it starts off with <UNK> on a <UNK> looking very badly injured the <UNK> race her into a <UNK> room they move her from the <UNK> onto a bed and holds her hand from that point on it is obvious that <UNK> is having a lot of trouble breathing and her <UNK> are failing as she turns to beg of to not leave her side she gaps don't go i love you and then her pulse drops and she goes into <UNK> arrest the <UNK> shows a clear flat line the <UNK> go into full out trauma mode bring in a steps back from the bed in horror as the doctors desperately try to shock her dying sisters heart but there is no response and she is <UNK> <UNK> dead well great scene well done girls
<START> i totally loved this movie tried to buy it and can't find it a must see a movie you can watch again and again funny but also a tear <UNK> in one really good album for the movie it's a really good 80's movie i wish i could find a copy to buy this movie cause i would the actors in it acted really good there's a lot of people out there that probably could relate to this movie that's what makes this movie so good so go out and try to rent this one you won't regret it it's an older movie but it's worth watching i would not be surprised if they made a remake of this movie soon but i'm sure it would not be the same anyone who hasn't seen it go rent it
<START> this show started out okay but then it turned into a nightmare the worst part about it was the contestants most of them were <UNK> they did stupid things for a living and they also did strange <UNK> in the second season one guy said he that he talked to his pants that is sick and repulsive also no one cared about winning money all they ever wanted to do was make <UNK> like it was survivor or something the men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together the women were the same also i just couldn't take it anymore i had to stop watching it it was truly one of the worst shows ever
<START> so i got this from the rental store where i work before it was released release is 8 21 just watched it today and now i'm speechless they could have had a decent movie here but they screwed it up in some painfully obvious ways br br first of all the parts with john were funny and are the only reason i gave it above a 3 but they are broken up by bad acting and terrible serious <UNK> on life between the main character andrew and his girlfriend the annoying <UNK> <UNK> it would have been much much better as a straight comedy ala lock stock and two smoking <UNK> br br i wanted to like it because i think is funny and want to see him do well the story wasn't bad either just not very original but the directing and a lot of the acting was terrible i swear they had trouble keeping peoples faces in the shot and just went with it anyway br br their <UNK> is <UNK> when the gun expert <UNK> another character and says that a dirty harry gun is not a <UNK> <UNK> but a 45 it was as everyone knows a <UNK> <UNK> br br so see this if you 1 really like john 2 like to watch low budget and poorly directed movies or 3 have too much time on your hands this is me
<START> before <UNK> into whether this film is worth your time or not i should inform you i've never seen another adaptation of carmen so if you're looking for a review on how it ranks amongst others this might not be of much use to you br br the only time i've come across carmen was on the car <UNK> when driving through spain on a family holiday when i was a teenager i didn't pay much attention to it because i didn't like opera at the time and i didn't know any better the story has been around for 150 years or so do i feel i've missed out after seeing this movie yes mainly due to the plot but also because if all the actresses who played carmen looked like paz vega i would have all the adaptations happily sitting in my dvd collection br br directed by <UNK> who also co <UNK> the story with <UNK> the story is told through the eyes of the original author <UNK> <UNK> a french writer making his way through 19th century spain he comes across <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> soldier and one of many men who fall in love with carmen paz vega a <UNK> sexy gypsy woman who has the mouth of the devil the temper of a and who <UNK> leads men to their doom the moment she meets <UNK> she is attracted by his stand behaviour but she <UNK> him <UNK> him in and lets him go many a time until one day <UNK> is wanted for murder carmen <UNK> him to join her band of gypsy <UNK> they seem to be <UNK> she's fallen in love with him but she meets the charming the <UNK> can <UNK> hold his jealousy in check or does it destroy him br br it's a beautiful seductive story something that resembles almost a <UNK> or <UNK> plot with the portrayals of immense passion and emotion that can make or break us and <UNK> us to do things out of character it's poetic fiery and above all <UNK> i was left hanging on i didn't know which way it was going to turn i always hoped that <UNK> might change dirty little ways i won't tell you if he succeeded or not br br the above synopsis is what i took away from the film but i was not impressed by the film itself it was only after i watched it that i <UNK> a little deeper into the story and i realised how much of a missed opportunity had made of retelling classic it was a shallow <UNK> period drama <UNK> that saw paz vega spend a lot of the time partially or completely naked not that i'm complaining about this in particular br br first of all the acting was poor i was not impressed by as <UNK> i'm still unsure whether he was a weak actor or <UNK> was supposed to be a weak character i've not read the book he's supposed to be a man who with burning desire for carmen but he spends much of the time looking confused jealous and a bit dim paz vega was slightly better as carmen i was convinced by her hardened wicked character although i have seen more convincing performances by her in other films such as <UNK> and <UNK> y el <UNK> she seems too pretty to play a gypsy woman not that i've come across many <UNK> gypsy women so in a way the role didn't really fit her the other actors in the film weren't great either they seemed to do everything half <UNK> the story is passionate <UNK>  they looked half <UNK> as if they couldn't wait to get out the tight 19th century costumes they were wearing br br however the costumes i was impressed with one of the redeeming factors of the film i like spanish culture i liked the <UNK> uniforms the top hats and the women's flamenco dresses they <UNK> the time well that's all i can really say about that sorry back to the criticism br br the script as stated above was co <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> and done so badly so much that it would leave <UNK> turning in his grave it was boring it didn't make best use of intense passion for carmen or maybe that was just the acting there were cheesy lines <UNK> upon one and other satan and devil <UNK> everywhere amongst the millions of swear words i know the spanish are partial for the odd swear word but the film was <UNK> with in literally every line maybe it was realistic in 19th century poverty stricken <UNK> but the story itself didn't need it br br the editing and camera work was dull and ordinary there was only one bit i actually liked and that was when the camera follows a fly close up in mid air which lands on face that was good but the rest boring br br to conclude it is sad to see such a great story go to waste with unconvincing acting and directing if you're a literature teacher by all means let your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of the story however only the male half of the class will be paying any interest to the film thanks to paz vega otherwise stick to the opera version even though i hate musicals i give this film 4 just for the fact i love the storyline and paz vega
<START> hilarious i would have <UNK> ed wood wrote this terrible i loved every frame bad movie <UNK> this is your <UNK> i will watch it again words cannot explain how entertaining this movie is career must have <UNK> low but i really think he's heading in the leslie <UNK> direction he was perfect for this terrible just terrible you'll love it get some friends lots of beer and you'll have the time of your life it's an <UNK> party waiting to happen enjoy it is worth the rental you like the <UNK> type cop and the comic relief <UNK> the bad guy will have you on the floor laughing he's also in another <UNK> movie <UNK> vs <UNK> and he's just as good there i don't know what the budget was but they'll get it back because this film is destined to be the best <UNK> comedy of the year
<START> <UNK> is a great film that is overlooked it's a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job it's an over used story but this one is different from the others they round up the usual suspects for the job this film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on the actual heist scene is one of the best i have ever seen instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence around thirty minutes of silence this fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days of course things get out of hand and people die and it ends in a great ending that builds up in suspense br br so if you're looking for a great film noir that not a lot of people talk about this is a great pick up
<START> ok first off there may be a spoiler here since i don't know what <UNK> giving out too much information my subject line says it all but surely people will want to know why it's so stupid br br first off this film follows a bunch of <UNK> as they go to a sports game in chicago but wind up taking the wrong exit and <UNK> up in the ghetto scary huh well first of all <UNK> is driving everyone in the world's most overblown <UNK> tricked out with satellite <UNK> and crap like that on it so these guys are going to a sports game i forget which though likely the <UNK> or the white sox since they're near the oh so scary ghetto yet they can't even make it down the <UNK> without having an <UNK> viewing command center that would put <UNK> to shame yet they're smart enough to earn that would pay for the stuff but are such sports fans that they don't even know which exit to get off at on their way to the game they so love br br i gave up on the movie within a half hour after that but the reasons were <UNK> they wind up in the ghetto yet their main danger to their existence is denis <UNK> a white guy i'm no racist but come on in anything resembling reality and this film was trying to be an urban nightmare denis <UNK> would not be trying to kill <UNK> <UNK> he'd be <UNK> a ride to get the f out of dodge himself br br this is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created although i'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world's cinema if mst3k were still on they surely would have devoted an episode to this one
<START> excuse me if i'm wrong but <UNK> un could be one of the most films in mexican movie history for a lot of reasons we can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect mexican middle class family breakfast a cup of <UNK> <UNK> with a little drop of scenarios a pound of <UNK> symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity more than todd happiness and the dogma movement films there s a lot of <UNK> black humor repressed dreams <UNK> dream of fly <UNK> lack of control the relation between <UNK> and no sense parallel stories a <UNK> violence <UNK> and br br a little sign of hope <UNK> in the husband's home return and un <UNK> used for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bruno <UNK> is a charming character i think in a way the king without a crown who don't expects for anything but broken <UNK> maria <UNK> the lovable wife put out a lot of faces but the only thing that she worried is that her sons had breakfast s a loser in many ways and sensual in few moments but you will fall in love of her the <UNK> drag too much woods <UNK> the lack of technical merits intentional of course out of focus shots close ups in <UNK> scenes <UNK> pans and sudden edition cuts is something difficult to <UNK> it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it it tastes bitter like a rotten orange juice and sour like <UNK> milk but you want to enjoy it so i recommend to get some before the show because you won't get hungry after all
<START> every once in a while you stumble across a movie that takes you by surprise and this is one of them on the surprise scale this would rate as sharing a hot <UNK> with jessica alba whilst a band <UNK> of elvis <UNK> <UNK> john lennon phil and keith moon play you music for the night the reason why this film will surprise you is that for the <UNK> budget they had <UNK> 000 and that this was done by a bunch of mates who just wanted to try it out they have produced something very slick and looks easily 100 times more than its budget br br the plot is simple a crew of <UNK> carrying a dangerous prisoner through space come under attack and are forced to crash land on a nearby desolate planet after some <UNK> not only does the planet not exist according to star <UNK> but they are not alone as it seems and something very <UNK> begins to pick them of one by one it sounds like very standard sci fi fare mixing elements of aliens predator and pitch black but it takes all these and makes them into something that feels fresh and original br br the location shooting in this is fantastic <UNK> beach in to the maximum and you genuinely feel that you are one an alien world the seemingly never ending sand <UNK> and clever lighting effects give it a very bleak feel you truly think the crew are stranded on an alien world also the action sequences are superb the opening assault on the <UNK> a great showcase of what special effects can be achieved on a budget and the <UNK> as well as the stunning finale all showcase the <UNK> of the film br br as for the team of <UNK> the cast excels themselves for a low budget independent movie the casting here was done via local media <UNK> and they seem to have picked some possible stars for the future local body <UNK> mike mitchell whilst not a natural actor <UNK> into his role as the arnie <UNK> leader of the <UNK> from the rest of the cast there are two stand out performances patrick wright as second in command and scott <UNK> as the rough and ready engineer vince both have some the best lines in the movie and scott <UNK> a good bit of humour into the movie with his performance patrick gives a well rounded performance as the cool as ice second in command br br director mark can be very proud of what he has achieved and shows that scottish cinema need not all be and or and scottish films can be fresh inventive and most of all a lot of god damn fun this film is scottish with a north east <UNK> to the core and praise to the actors and directors for keeping the accents intact which adds to the charm of the piece although the budget limitations show from time to time the only fault i could find that is to be expected this film its cast and crew deserve all the success they get and then some more i for one wish mark and his crew every success and theirs is a career to keep a very close eye on br br rating 9 10 the first scottish sci fi is bold fresh and inventive a real triumph br br movie reviews news and opinion like no other plus the kick ass <UNK> weekly <UNK> casts br br www co uk br br contact co uk
<START> a sign of what to expect in this film came when i spotted that this was the first and probably the last film to have in its credits a vomit <UNK> br br in what is a couple of hours of silly gags hilarious violence and excellent slapstick humour br br this film was just what you'd expect from the bottom boys and it is great to see them back in their best form after <UNK> life threatening accident br br <UNK> and eddie are too similar to their bottom characters if we can have any criticism at all and does a surprisingly good job in directing the film also br br this film has already <UNK> the predictable comparisons to <UNK> towers that just aren't there and the guest house <UNK> itself is hardly br br watch out for some excellently crafted dialogue amongst all the violence and mayhem br br if you don't like bottom you'll probably hate this but i loved it
<START> i didn't realize just how much of this episode was taken from the enemy below until i finally saw the movie it has since become my <UNK> war flick there were a couple of elements lifted from run silent run deep as well nothing wrong with stealing ideas as long as you do something cool with them and boy did <UNK> and company do something cool with this one br br the story begins when the <UNK> <UNK> a 100 year old <UNK> and by crossing the neutral zone and destroying a series of <UNK> <UNK> along the zone ostensibly to test their superior <UNK> and <UNK> screen and subsequent shift in the balance of power between the <UNK> and the <UNK> in their view as a <UNK> to an all out invasion kirk has to decide whether it's worth <UNK> war to try and stop the ship or if in fact the greater risk lies in letting the <UNK> go after they destroyed 4 military <UNK> kirk wisely chooses the latter br br this is our first look at an enemy of the <UNK> the <UNK> a <UNK> yet in their own way honorable race who are distant relatives to the <UNK> however unlike their peaceful cousins the <UNK> did not <UNK> their emotions and violent and ways even as they advanced <UNK> br br none of this matters to mr stiles the <UNK> <UNK> and this <UNK> chief antagonist on board the enterprise the commander has his own problems with a <UNK> ho junior officer all that matters to him is he hates <UNK> and spock looks like one until the end when spock saves his life naturally this <UNK> <UNK> with captain kirk and the commander neither of whom has any personal ill will towards the other at all both men are simply doing their duty in fact there's a mutual respect this is the first trek episode to deal directly with prejudice and it does so <UNK> as opposed to season <UNK> not so subtle let that be your last battlefield br br like the enemy below we have a classic chess match between two ship <UNK> who are actually very much alike you see right away that both of these <UNK> are good very good if you were going into battle you'd want either of these man as your leader both are honorable and decent men who are duty bound yet even though the commander is bound by duty to his home world he still finds himself wishing for destruction before he can make it home rather than start another <UNK> war yet he still does everything he can to make it home just as kirk does everything he can to stop him br br this is in my opinion one of <UNK> 5 best it has everything plenty of action suspense great dialogue fine acting i still maintain the commander was mark best trek role and it manages to make its social commentary without being overly preachy a pity <UNK> forgot about the last part when he did <UNK> br br watch this episode then watch the enemy below
<START> is not a bad movie but the acting and the screenplay can be better i like this movie because i have a life that is in good part like the one in the movie is hard for a lost generation to get a life in romania and 90 percent of us choose something else and that something else includes dealing with people with bad <UNK> if you understand me but that comes with the territory this movie represent me and i like it i have a rage in me that i <UNK> talk with people i live in a messed up society and i can't fit in and i don't want to and that's the story of movie also if you r like me you can understand the true movie if not you will find it easy and cheap
<START> this movie is certainly well constructed beginning and ending in the dark with focus on <UNK> smith <UNK> julie andrews initially the singing <UNK> later the notorious spy br br it's beautiful i saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently while it was <UNK> by critics in the 70's as overblown <UNK> and lacking in structure among others time has <UNK> them wrong blake <UNK> certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality br br the film <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> photography julie andrews in motion and <UNK> one must just buy into the premise that julie andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong <UNK> the tepid chemistry between julie andrews and rock hudson one must believe that these are lovers who in all innocence fall for each other and in the end love is far more important than winning wars and so is maintaining innocence br br there is a lot of understated acting and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comedies br br there are wonderful comedic elements <UNK> the french <UNK> in victor victoria interesting <UNK> <UNK> reminding me of the seed seen about 18 years ago and a general sense of good will br br suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away julie <UNK> <UNK> out of war songs and the haunting away the <UNK> are reason enough to turn the tv on just for the soundtrack and the <UNK> number like the number in star works br br this film has like a good <UNK> aged well paramount should bring it to dvd as soon as possible the same applies to <UNK> the laser <UNK> of star to dvd these are both interesting pieces of julie <UNK> <UNK> and then underrated works
<START> my wife and i saw every episode in this series and loved it however the series was cut short without a final episode by the producers of the show it ended with a typical end the season cliff <UNK> leaving it's fans feeling cheated a waste of great writing and acting
<START> this is the sequel to <UNK> br br <UNK> ok a lot of stock footage but pretty good i'm surprised that they actually had a giant robot <UNK> that actually didn't look that bad i was actually quite surprised by that br br the movie overall was just ok fun it never explained how the <UNK> got so big and isn't linked it anyway to the first but it was still fun br br the ending me and my friend laughed at basically after blowing the <UNK> up once the two main characters launch a bomb and five explosions most stock footage appear on screen we <UNK> that they went to the dollar store and bought a <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> toy believe me it has to be seen to believe overall just stupid fun worth giving a chance buying if it's cheap
<START> get smart should be titled get stupid there is not one funny line or gag in the entire film this film is so bad it makes the austin powers films look shakespearean a few more films like this and steve carell can kiss his career goodbye as for anne <UNK> what is she doing in this film she's a good actress but is just plain terrible br br the writing is <UNK> lame there is not one funny clever or witty line there is not one good sight gag br br the directing is terrible comedy relies on timing someone should tell the director that every line that is supposed to be funny and isn't is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing i've ever seen br br 0 stars
<START> reports of this film's brilliance appear to have been greatly exaggerated and unless the other reviewers were watching a different movie i fail to see how anyone can find this film anything other than dull <UNK> overlong and at times <UNK> irritating i'm not some <UNK> horror fanatic i love j horrors and euro horrors over american horrors any day but i feel the need to warn any potential viewers about this film before they <UNK> two hours of their life in it br br it could have been so great a reporter is investigating a series of bizarre deaths and <UNK> which seem ostensibly but a series of unnerving <UNK> appears to connect them dead <UNK> <UNK> noises the presence of strangely tied <UNK> our reporter goes from person to person <UNK> them filming them and then passing on three important characters are among this <UNK> of people a young shy psychic girl an immensely irritating insane psychic man and a crazy old woman and her boy whose importance is not revealed until later on br br the problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting which makes its two hour running time unforgivable it's also not even remotely scary or creepy supposedly scary scenes like shots of <UNK> faces are done incredibly poorly shown twice or worse we are told when they are about to happen other techniques such as telling us that a family just interviewed died five days later simply don't make me care let alone mildly <UNK> br br the film does pick up a bit towards the end as our reporter cameraman psychic and cursed woman go to a village in order to the curse which is <UNK> all these deaths however by that time i was in a state of <UNK> boredom and couldn't care less so all the fairly creepy camera work and shocks were wasted on me the final tape is quite good but once again i'd given up caring and just wanted this film to end br br boring and dull not scary and not creepy i would advise you keep away from it has promising moments but this is a film that was poorly made and not worth your time
<START> i simply cannot believe the folks that made and performed in this movie really took it seriously the skits on snl look more real everything was laughably fake the goofy <UNK> the ridiculous fist fights the dialogue the sappy background music and even <UNK> blind eye had it been billed as a comedy it still would have made more sense but still would be bad i can see this as entertainment only if you get a room full of stoned college kids watching it like it were rocky horror picture show imagine some of the stuff you saw on blazing <UNK> like knocking the horse down or the old lady stomach <UNK> now imagine the producer wants you to take those scenes seriously and you get the of this disaster
<START> oh <UNK> i want to time travel back to <UNK> studios and <UNK> someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical it is one <UNK> above flat <UNK> for 60 of its <UNK> minutes and then actually shows for the one thin minute spread in second across the hour that there is real life talent being badly photographed i just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow <UNK> to be the main thing on view the weird storyline shows <UNK> vaudeville <UNK> grace hayes her <UNK> way into a college where her rat bag son is rich college clown she's gonna fix his playboy ways no matter what her real life son weird looking peter <UNK> plays her screen son his real life wife plays her secretary talk about <UNK> i suspect this talent package was almost the <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> this back lot musical produced by resident <UNK> <UNK> sam <UNK> as with other <UNK> musicals it just looks more like a reason to film recent new furniture <UNK> and light in order to show off to other studios that <UNK> pictures are in their b grade ways have a ghastly look at swing parade of 1946 for genuine evidence of this they just constructed this gigantic nightclub set then found an excuse to film actors and musicians running all over it story none anyway <UNK> boom <UNK> is more <UNK> than boom where was <UNK> storm and <UNK> when <UNK> really needed them probably standing at the boom gate of <UNK> pictures wondering if it looked safe to enter there junior <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> springs to life to tap his teen legs around two <UNK> dance numbers especially in the <UNK> <UNK> finale set in the new and expanded <UNK> <UNK> club set the usual <UNK> <UNK> are loosely hanging on the back wall and the stage set of <UNK> matched <UNK> even has one dark main <UNK> that is <UNK> back and forth as each amateur sequence <UNK> past the previous one the chorus girls and their very plain looking partners in this finale just look like <UNK> office staff borrowed from <UNK> and <UNK> for the morning of filming they have absolutely no dance talent and are so ordinary on screen all the girls look like they are all called <UNK> there is even a costume <UNK> where they wear <UNK> hot pants on one leg only it is all so awful and crummy and actually annoying when one more <UNK> up by all concerned would result in <UNK> being actually fun the one strangely interesting thing is the dialog delivery between grace and her son daughter in law it is so casually delivered that it actually works in spite of the script and logic she has a very life like presence which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly compelling the <UNK> kid is the real star he can actually do something in spite of looking like a <UNK> <UNK> tap dancing teen you read that right
<START> i believe to be the best piece of work that has come out of the steven seagal factory in a long time this movie was the first one i have seen since that fine film preview my point he is done every movie is the same maybe he will be good in <UNK> because he won't be the star we can only hope br br p s thanks for speaking to <UNK> when i went to college it was an amazing speech you really influenced some people out there br br so i have to write ten lines about this movie <UNK> i like the <UNK> guy who killed a bunch of fools whenever anyone <UNK> look out because there could be a killer with a <UNK> <UNK> and another loud one who wants to kill you br br is that ten
<START> a great story although one we are certainly familiar with meryl streep proves that she is truly the best actress in film today very entertaining and just what i expected don't go see this film unless you are prepared to be used and manipulated emotionally but if you have that expectation then you will enjoy the ride
<START> but quite dated today otto preminger made this movie without the <UNK> of <UNK> that was needed then it was enormously courageous and <UNK> as he could have lost his investment and future br br the film is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately <UNK> br br frank sinatra and i've never been a fan playing frankie machine is astonishing in his performance one forgets it is frank up there the level of realism he brings to the role of a <UNK> drug addict has to be seen to be believed br br kim novak <UNK> gorgeous and talented does not disappoint in the role of the devoted <UNK> always there for frankie br br supporting roles particularly a young handsome and talented <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> br br <UNK> parker playing <UNK> wife is hopelessly inept she <UNK> from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top a forgettable performance br br the <UNK> cheap settings are appalling as if a firm <UNK> of wind would blow the whole tacky painted <UNK> over the horizon almost laughable at times in their <UNK> <UNK> br br the music was irritating <UNK> so at times as if each nuance of the script example when <UNK> is getting frankie his fix out of a <UNK> had to be <UNK> at a high level br br 7 out of 10 sinatra truly deserved his oscar nomination worth seeing
<START> it is truly <UNK> to see a once great director such as <UNK> delivering such a second rate giallo such as this this movie was so terrible it effectively put an end to his movie career the box lies this is no erotic thriller hell during the film's <UNK> minute running time charlotte lewis barely shows us one <UNK> i thought it would pick up once william <UNK> showed up in one of his last roles but his character is killed off rather abruptly and <UNK> this movie fails in pretty much every way <UNK> <UNK> music is little more than noise and the plot made very little sense at all for some reason lewis is <UNK> by ghosts which attack using phones by the end the characters all seem to have forgotten the previous 90 minutes of hell they went through and casually laugh as they sick the evil spirits on someone else <UNK> ex boyfriend what this movie did little for me besides anger me and bore me half to death for genuine 80's <UNK> fun watch the <UNK> or the atlantis <UNK> let this one <UNK> on the video store shelf <UNK> could make a better giallo than this
<START> some said that this was a nose candy <UNK> flick but short of the original dr <UNK> <UNK> no drug has yet been developed that can provide this effect if <UNK> was the <UNK> mold stage that white <UNK> <UNK> is the stephen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or at least the <UNK> idiot <UNK> branch this reality show is really about the sacred <UNK> of medicine seen as was the emperor without clothes few of us want to question the health field both because most of us would not have lived to our current age had we been born before modern medicine and because our <UNK> hopes that we will continue to live on if we have faith in the helping <UNK> so the geniuses who produced this movie made jokes out of those <UNK> giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern institution of medicine the timing was right and many were able to see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of oz a decade before when george c scott <UNK> through the movie the hospital my wife and i were sitting in the packed premiere in <UNK> city just as in <UNK> <UNK> remake we were almost unable to keep from falling out of our seat and laughed and <UNK> <UNK> for the duration the hundreds of other audience members were deadly silent they were shocked that doctors <UNK> the hospital institution were being <UNK> it was as if the <UNK> billy graham and gandhi were were sitting in the animal house beer <UNK> <UNK> shirts and all competing to see who could tell the funniest god knock knock jokes between had the hospital been a slapstick comedy rather than a satire they might have been able to see what was being shown to them unfortunately they were like <UNK> at a screening of michael moore's 9 11 perhaps smaller golden would have been given to the corrupt medical corporation leaders health insurance companies would have had a <UNK> time denying medical care and health <UNK> would have been earlier if george c scott had tap <UNK> in a <UNK> while delivering his terrible truths but forget everything i just said watch the movie be <UNK> made as happy and <UNK> and full of laughter as the best ever saturday night live skit and let the <UNK> <UNK> in the documentary of the underlying reality just don't blame me when got to got to got to got to becomes one of your <UNK> or when <UNK> got nothing to hide <UNK> that portion of your brain now <UNK> by its a small world after all or when you start calling your local hospital our lady of pain and suffering instead of our lady of eternal construction even were changing their favorite terrible boss <UNK> winner from <UNK> on him and leave him for dead to body in a pit you in it the smell of death it's gone chicken <UNK> mary mary
<START> no surprise except in how quickly abc <UNK> to the dismal ratings according to published reports variety the show garnered the worst ratings in the history of the abc television network br br and i quote <UNK> music talent competition the one opened <UNK> night to <UNK> me now ratings br br the article went on to say that the show received a shockingly low 1 1 rating 3 share in adult 18 <UNK> and 3 <UNK> million viewers overall br br that makes it the weakest premiere for any reality show on any network and also below all series <UNK> in abc history br br from the first moment i saw the commercials for this i knew it would fail we don't need another american idol clone but abc should have given this show a fair chance to succeed
<START> to those of you who've made comments on this film earlier and hoped to see it again i hope you did it was broadcast today <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on lifetime movie network i <UNK> to dish br br karen arthur directed william <UNK> and barbara <UNK> in this <UNK> gothic like tale expertly the lighting editing and dialog contributed greatly to the film and <UNK> and peterson were perfectly cast for the roles both playing sensitive bold and <UNK> characters the screen play was excellent as well the supporting cast br br not having known ahead of time i guessed correctly the story was based on truth and now that i know it i must make the <UNK> as santa <UNK> is a hop skip and a jump from <UNK> br br as an engineer i was fascinated with the theme of the unique construction of the <UNK> and the man who designed and built it who was he an angel but the storyline and it's several plots of how it came to be is what most <UNK> you you certainly get a strong sense that god in his heaven was in every detail of this entire drama in history for you who have seen the film you know what i'm talking about for those of you who haven't i won't spoil a minute of it br br bon holiday br br bob <UNK> jr missile systems <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i usually much prefer french movies over american ones with explosions and car chases but this movie was very disappointing there is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens this french couple has been living in <UNK> for years and they return to paris for a friend's wedding they <UNK> to another friend they are having dinner with that they are going to split then nothing much happens they don't seem to know whether they want to separate or not i don't necessarily think that their make for a bad movie it is very human to hesitate before making such a decision for good but this could be treated in an interesting manner giving some flesh to their desires and their relationship but that does not happen one gets out of the theater unsure of why these two got together or want to split the only piece i enjoyed was the conversation with the drunk that was true to life
<START> frankly i'm amazed to see that this movie is getting relatively good reviews i'll be completely honest and say that the only reason i even got through it is because of ryan <UNK> and not for reasons particularly connected with his abilities as an actor though i think over the last years he has proved himself to be a better actor than his first major roles in the late 1990's <UNK> br br as far as action suspense movies go this movie fails in nearly every respect the acting is ok i guess but the script is absolutely horrible and makes very little sense a fact which the filmmakers try to cover up by adding absurd references to chaos theory as if it would convince anyone that the film is actually <UNK> but then again judging from other reviews some were don't be fooled the script is a boring derivative mess and no other element of the movie makes up for it wesley snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a film and <UNK> is a thoroughly dull actor br br not recommended
<START> following is a little known 1998 british film which was made with a budget of and has a running time of 70 minutes when watching it you'd never expect its director to go on to make it in hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the 21st century  well everybody has to start somewhere i suppose br br the director of following as you probably already know is <UNK> christopher nolan who directly after following would go on to direct the <UNK> acclaimed independent film <UNK> a few years later he would be hired by warner bros to direct the new batman series which further brought him acclaim and so on and so forth my point is everybody has to start somewhere  even if it's not in the most astounding debut  and christopher nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with following br br when watching it i couldn't help but draw <UNK> to another directorial debut avant garde auteur david lynch's <UNK> following is not a <UNK> psychological horror film in that sense but the similarities are noticeable most notable it's shot in grainy black and white and has an atmosphere about it that makes it unique it's hard to describe in words but it loosely resembles the <UNK> atmosphere you'd find in the film <UNK> of old hence it can be said that following is a contemporary film noir or a neo noir overall it's an <UNK> of that and a psychological thriller and the story is most appropriate to these two genres br br the main character is <UNK> and the movie's title <UNK> from an early obsessive <UNK> <UNK> he possessed  randomly picking out people on the street and following them sometimes even for hours on end during one of these <UNK> the main character becomes noticed by one of the people he is following and is confronted turns out that the is a man who is willing to <UNK> our narrator and he introduces himself his name is <UNK> and he's a petty <UNK> who invites the narrator to follow him on his <UNK> br br from there the main character becomes swept up in world and he becomes <UNK> in crime passion and violence as he gets more and more intimate with <UNK> following is not so much a character study but instead a film which follows the <UNK> relationship between these two main characters and the devastating <UNK> it has on our narrator nolan succeeds in making the film resemble a film noir and <UNK> the respective atmosphere well br br as a thriller following is taut and atmospheric however as a film in general it's somewhat of a disappointment if not that then one could definitely call it <UNK> the entire film is shot in a non <UNK> and non linear fashion and it makes the story and film experience unique to some extent  this style has been done so many times now it's almost <UNK> technique  and the story itself is unique to some extent br br however following is ultimately <UNK> for the entire film and is <UNK> <UNK> the story calls for more  more action more suspense and more thrills  but it becomes too <UNK> in its own storyline and instead focuses on creating an intricate story following does succeed in doing that but without any other elements it's a film noir that doesn't quite work out it's got a sense of <UNK> which isn't enormous but still noticeable nonetheless furthermore the film's shocking revelation at the end  almost a mandatory convention in film <UNK>  is one that makes us feel cheated it's unpredictable and comes out of nowhere but in relation to the story it's disappointing as it essentially makes the <UNK> scenes and the entire film seem like an enormous waste of time br br but the <UNK> far <UNK> the <UNK> and in the end following turns out to be a flawed but satisfying film yes everybody has to start somewhere christopher nolan does it with following and he does it in a fine manner a quiet meek but fine manner it's not the most astounding movie and it isn't quite worthy of the <UNK> the director would go on to receive in the following decade but it's still a good film nonetheless when <UNK> out following you find a well made taut and atmospheric thriller one which lacks noticeable nuance or innovative style but still manages to grip audiences nonetheless
<START> this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen i tried to like this movie but they managed to mess up practically every individual aspect that <UNK> to this film cheap dialogue no character development no tension not enough story to pull you in no action apart from some really cheap scenes it seems they tried some things on the set and said to each other hey this looks rather cool why not put this in there after which the director probably said yeah yeah this is genius and got back to <UNK> coke or something when it comes to acting i think the only person that tried to make the movie worked is but in the end it is all for nothing cause this movie sucks 2 10
<START> this <UNK> sweet and <UNK> paced 5 <UNK> is definitely not among harold <UNK> better films gags are sparse and mostly uninspired <UNK> melodrama is <UNK> the setup takes forever as lloyd the unconventional but <UNK> kindly country doctor makes his rounds bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children the elderly and <UNK> it's like a <UNK> version of <UNK> adams ugh 4 10
<START> psycho criminal pure by carl who is active in hollywood like mrs <UNK> george and are stealing the last peace of they are too able how can i get calm into a lift next time
<START> oddly enough the independent film channel showed this film a week after it showed karate bear fighter even though the bear film was the second in the trilogy and this film was the first what were they thinking while all three of these films are supposedly based on the life of this great karate master you can't help but think that they must have <UNK> the story quite a bit especially in this first film sure the guy evidently did fight and kill a bull and later a bear in fact he fought and killed many <UNK> during his career but in this film set in the early 50s at the end of the film the hero actually fights about 60 guys and kills many of them brutally i just can't imagine that this really occurred so i did some checking and found that while many of the details are correct some of this film is pure <UNK> yes he did kill a man in self defense and yes he did follow the widow and her son and spent a year working for them trying to get them to forgive him but the end of the film is great to watch but <UNK> seeing one of his opponents get a staff thrust through his head and all the other gory details couldn't have happened or else the japanese government would have locked <UNK> up to protect society the film is entertaining and the fighting is excellent there are no complaints about the action or acting the only minor complaint is the camera work which is a tad sloppy during some of the fight scenes despite this minor complaint this is a most enjoyable film in many ways the wandering karate master theme is pretty reminiscent of the zatoichi films which are also lots of fun to watch but many of the exploits are truly impossible br br <UNK> there is an dubbed version of this film entitled champion of death and i just saw it as well it's not a bad dubbing and it was letter <UNK> a big plus but still i prefer the subtitled version
<START> without a doubt the best burt reynolds film ever even better than <UNK> and the <UNK> this was probably the first real bloody cop thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect blend of humor action mystery and style that is missing in today's films br br this one has it all a psychotic henry <UNK> <UNK> up on <UNK> 1 000 a night call girls ninja <UNK> and burt reynolds getting his fingers <UNK> off one by one with a <UNK> knife the film is based on the novel by william <UNK> who also wrote primal fear another one of my all time favorites this movie is worth watching just to see henry <UNK> get shot six times crash through a window and fall thirty stories from the top of an <UNK> high rise this is probably the coolest stunt in hollywood history performed by legendary <UNK> <UNK> robinson br br robinson also played in the <UNK> leonard movie stick also starring burt reynolds stick features another great <UNK> robinson stunt robinson falls from a miami apartment building and all six shots from a <UNK> <UNK> on his way down very cool stuff br br <UNK> machine is my favorite police drama i never understood why this film <UNK> the way it did if burt did more films like this he would've built a better reputation for himself he proves to be a talented director with <UNK> as well as a gifted actor burt is supported by brian <UNK> charles <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> richard <UNK> rachel ward and everyone's favorite bad guy henry <UNK> please remake this classic film get affleck and samuel l and some other hot actors and you've got a great movie just waiting to be filmed br br i give it a 9 out of 10
<START> this movie was made by <UNK> studios known for its gamera movies it is about a samurai lord who was murdered by one of his own men he claims his throne forcing his <UNK> two children to flee into the woods where they hide near a huge stone statue for 10 years in those time that passed the new samurai lord has proved to be very brutal and ruthless towards the village people and the valley therefore it seems that the good people's only hope is the stone statue which is where a demon god sleeps they want the god to help them br br this samurai movie brings to us traditional japanese aspects including sword fights geisha and <UNK> it is a superb and powerful story of survival and hope with the protagonists attempting to triumph over pure evil it is full of excitement particularly the parts where the children struggles to remain in hiding as the evil <UNK> is out to get them in addition it has beautiful cinematography with <UNK> landscapes of the village and countryside instantly reminds you of the ancient times in japan br br as with most samurai movies like the seven <UNK> and the last this movie is no less than pure sometimes graphic action there are several disturbing scenes in the film therefore it is not the casual sci fi film yet it is strong and powerful and delivers a message that a good natured human can overcome any <UNK> as depicted in this film even the young innocent girl can calm the wrath of the demon god the scenes of the demon god known as <UNK> <UNK> on its enemies and anything that stands in his way will instantly remind you of a godzilla or gamera film overall a powerful and serious yet hopeful film br br so be careful with your samurai sword you wouldn't want to <UNK> <UNK> br br grade a
<START> what a pleasure this is really a parody only french people can do that kind of thing without being coarse and as a result you spend a really good time watching jean playing the dumb most of the movie stands on his shoulders and he has them wide enough to make this movie a good one he has the perfect way of <UNK> the james bond kind of guy that he is no match for mike meyers in austin powers for example the dialogs are also good enough to keep up the attention of the <UNK> with a lot of stupid jokes that's really perfect both of the women having the main parts in the movie bear the comparison with the main character and that was a challenge there is no really plot in this movie but that's not what is expected in this kind of movie you just wish to laugh one hour 40 minutes and that's precisely what the movie manage to do it deserves the success it has in france
<START> exciting action packed and interesting film telling the tale of a group of men <UNK> at a naval base in italy and their adventures aboard a navy submarine during wwi tommy and brick played by robert <UNK> and robert young are two pals and make for a couple of very handsome officers i must say a new captain arrives on board already known by a few as dead pan <UNK> walter huston and he's a real <UNK> for following the rule book and a code of honor soon tommy and brick are chasing after an attractive blonde at an <UNK> dance tommy insults the captain and of course the blonde is actually the <UNK> daughter but tommy wins out anyway as he and the daughter sneak away from the dance to a street carnival outside and soon bond during an air raid unfortunately for him she reveals she is married later tommy gets himself into some real trouble when he <UNK> orders in an effort save his buddy br br this film is quite entertaining with an absorbing plot line that held my interest and top notch performances by all a climactic death scene featuring sterling <UNK> is haunting indeed the most memorable scene in this film i thought eugene palette and jimmy <UNK> add some humor here playing a couple of <UNK> character is actually studying to be a dentist via mail order and continually has run ins with a british man who makes fun of his nose okay if you're looking for a movie showing a man boxing a <UNK> this would be the one
<START> this was a movie that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been chosen or made up to look a little more like the real persons not very difficult <UNK> did not go to <UNK> to see her dead son she also did not die in the street they carried her on to the boat and then back to the hotel which was much more dramatic i am not sure about the wedding night but i find it exaggerated that a lady in waiting would <UNK> the <UNK> and leave her completely naked and that in the or that the emperor would <UNK> very proudly yes i finally laid her to the assembled court as far as i know this was done right away on the first night and nobody rewarded her as if she were a <UNK> the saving grace of the movie is really <UNK> excellent actress and true to character
<START> it's not citizen kane but it does deliver <UNK> and lots of it br br badly acted and directed poorly scripted who cares i didn't watch it for the dialog
<START> joseph <UNK> novel heart of darkness is a dark profound and lasting novel that portrays the <UNK> and irony taking place in africa if you are looking for a great book to read over the weekend this is not the book for you conrad holds nothing back when describing 19th century <UNK> but the novel is meaningless without giving it the reflection and consideration it deserves if i read this novel looking for a great adventure story i would say that i wasted my time but looking at in the perspective of explaining the <UNK> of 19th century civilization i would say this is one of the most significant novels i have ever read because of the fact that i read this novel in my english class and we <UNK> every page i think i appreciated the book more than someone would who was just reading it for entertainment i am not going to lie this book was difficult and it challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning the movie on the other hand i found tiresome and boring the movie heart of darkness comes no where near giving the book justice the movie left out many key parts that i consider important to get the true message of the story if you are having difficulty understanding and <UNK> the novel then the movie might be a good <UNK> but i would not recommend seeing the movie as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective
<START> this is a great film in many different ways perhaps the most important is that it introduces western audiences to the remarkable tragic story of san and her fight for freedom and democracy wonderful acting gorgeous cinematography breathtaking action and suspense beyond has everything i've seen this movie several times over the last ten years and each time it means more to me not everyone will like it hence the relatively low rating on imdb but that's because it is not conventional hollywood rather it challenges the viewer on several levels i've never watched it without <UNK> at the end and promising to live a more meaningful life
<START> as i've said in the title of this review it pains me to say this but <UNK> reaches the <UNK> of what hollywood romantic comedies can ever hope to <UNK> to i've been a critic of both the genre and it's <UNK> for as long as i can remember myself but on an almost tragic note <UNK> has caused me to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile <UNK> across my face br br this movie may be misogynistic and <UNK> at times but it nonetheless possesses a certain humor about it whose subtlety may only be described as british this is a wonderful attempt by hollywood to make or remake as the case may be a film which appeals to all of our wishes for a romantic comedy which can make us both think and laugh simultaneously i <UNK> and most give this movie a 9 out of 10 something you shall hardly see me do for a romantic comedy in the near future or so at least i hope
<START> i watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot i was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite <UNK> did not show any stars br br i will not give any spoilers to the plot line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value until the very last minute i did not know how it would turn out frequently you can pick up the formula and predict a story direction i could not do that with this film br br i would recommend this as one of the <UNK> films of this genre
<START> this film offers one of the greatest experiences available to movie goers it is by no means a pleasant film but offers realities and emotions the human mind may never have meant to touch upon it opens <UNK> in how an individual thinks and afterwards will change the person forever br br the first time i saw this film was in class and immediately after seeing it i had to skip my next class and walk around campus in order to <UNK> my body and mind i felt <UNK> and somehow unreal as if i didn't exist it was only a few months later that i was telling one of my friends about shame and she asked oh is that when you were messed up after seeing it and ran into me talking all strange about it i didn't even remember running into or talking to anyone at all while outside that day i was <UNK> br br in plot terms it is the simple tale of a couple torn apart by war there suffering is greater than that of the dead and by the end there are no words to complete the image that bergman creates its like a horrible dream which causes you to wake <UNK> your own reality forever this film must be seen
<START> <UNK> self awakening is the theme of 2001 a space odyssey a process that unfolds along a space time <UNK> we see our <UNK> past and we <UNK> a <UNK> future the powers of <UNK> thus become the doors of perception in our ongoing collective journey br br from this <UNK> perspective a conventional <UNK> plot seems superfluous our <UNK> conflicts and self important dialogue are consumed in <UNK> change and are irrelevant in a <UNK> that is vast beyond <UNK> it's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species not surprising then that some of us <UNK> and <UNK> about the film's <UNK> and minimal story for <UNK> viewers the <UNK> is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe br br in this film which is mostly visual <UNK> symbols guide our <UNK> circles and <UNK> represent nature right angles represent conscious intelligence some people think the <UNK> black <UNK> is a von <UNK> <UNK> maybe without doubt the <UNK> is a visual metaphor for an <UNK> intelligence whose physical form is never shown mystery is more profound than explanation br br 2001 is unique among films in content and scope the cinematography is out of this world the special and visual effects are breathtaking and the classical music is sublime i rarely use the word masterpiece to describe a movie but stanley kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey is art in the highest sense like <UNK> da <UNK> lisa or vincent van <UNK> the <UNK> night
<START> <UNK> and the star <UNK> is not for people who were born before 1980 or after 1989 most of those people would not appreciate the great things that are 80's cartoons the fact that <UNK> was made into a movie is a guilty pleasure for many of us who remember watching the tv show as a child granted much of the dialogue is quite amusing and silly and the plot is to pointless but it's a very cool movie none the less
<START> luckily for bill murray this is such a light weight project since he pretty much has to carry it <UNK> is the story of low rent camp and how its <UNK> deal with the <UNK> as well as one another then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp <UNK> which <UNK> in a two day <UNK> competition above it all is bill murray <UNK> around and making a pretty memorable film debut br br the film is <UNK> with medium sized laughs chuckles and more than a few <UNK> along the way the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director three of them involve the <UNK> moving his bed outside in various locations while he's sleeping <UNK> or <UNK> as everyone calls him wakes up along the side of a road strung up in some trees several feet above the ground and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake there are also some funny moments involving the <UNK> hitting on one another but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of <UNK> br br the film takes a serious note involving a shy <UNK> named <UNK> who is played by chris <UNK> of course it's up to murray to teach the kid how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the <UNK> the sentimentality of situation seems tacked on to a great degree notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him you must be the short depressed kid we ordered makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just ad <UNK> while the cameras were rolling in other words murray might as well have said to <UNK> you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn't fit in but before it's all over <UNK> performance makes this plot device more than bearable he really seems to have some good chemistry with <UNK> br br the film <UNK> with the games between the two rival camps very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable but it just doesn't matter this is a pretty good film on many levels don't let the absurd 5 6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off murray will keep you laughing throughout just be warned avoid the sequels especially the one with corey <UNK> 8 of 10 stars br br the <UNK>
<START> how pointless hideous characters and boring film saved by brief sex scenes mad witch gorgeous desert island and brooks body the plot is <UNK> the characters are shallow and unlikeable having said that i did manage to watch it all mainly because i was totally <UNK> by the <UNK> and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end the film was well shot well directed but perhaps the casting let it down in some ways disappointing really summed the review up in the first line but this website <UNK> that you need to write 10 lines minimum it would be better to spend the time watching another film
<START> not only the title the film itself is a long one too or so it seems that's because of the outdated style of acting and the pathetic way its hackneyed themes are bad <UNK> of the sisters and a <UNK> brother who <UNK> not speak the name of his sexual <UNK> italy 2003 you don't believe it and you don't have to

<START> buddy <UNK> roy <UNK> solid in a chance leading role heads a secret undercover police squad called the seven ups whose tactics don't necessarily follow the exact ways of the law they get the job done in their own way without anything being <UNK> to the press and this gives them a freedom to expand their means of getting to the criminals most working detectives and policeman just can not <UNK> buddy has a pal from childhood named <UNK> tony lo <UNK> who <UNK> information with him regarding mob types and <UNK> working the streets in nyc what buddy doesn't know is that <UNK> is <UNK> a scheme using names from <UNK> check list he has this book open taking down notes provided by <UNK> but doesn't know that his friend has copied those very names written within his mind to set up mob families in a series of mob <UNK> <UNK> cash thanks to two cop <UNK> moon the always villainous richard lynch and bo bill <UNK> working with him when this scheme goes awry with one of the seven ups being killed <UNK> becomes <UNK> because he knows how buddy can be when he's <UNK> after someone especially when one of his own is murdered br br extremely underrated cop flick has thrilling car chase through new york city as buddy follows the kidnapping cop <UNK> trying to get them after killing his partner the film isn't overly complex after the plot is set up and we realize who is the ring leader in the scheming of <UNK> <UNK> has never been given the credit he deserves as a fine lead actor he has emotional range and we see how losing his cop and friend takes it's <UNK> on him the film is <UNK> paced with good action sequences and sets up an interesting plot of betrayal between friends as greed comes before that childhood friendship and how what seems like a smooth crime spree against evil mob families can get cops killed
<START> i only voted it 2 10 mainly because hitchcock agreed to direct it he certainly had an off day with predictable plot lines stupid childish characters who are desperately trying to be funny there were <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sex scenes at a time when the hollywood production code was in full force lazy male characters in the film who like soap characters never do a stroke of work for which they are paid it always <UNK> me when food is usually never eaten by actors one exception was in the eating scene in tom jones 1963 although <UNK> amounts of drink are consumed actors have to leave their mouths free for the next line carole lombard certainly <UNK> hitchcock's cool blond <UNK> image of a heroine but what ever possessed him to direct this worthless unfunny script he should have stuck to his thrillers it certainly has not worn well over the last <UNK> years i couldn't wait for it to end as it gradually irritated me no end
<START> i loved this movie yes it is rather cheap and i'm sure plenty of reviews will be <UNK> about that but my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved i was reminded of the early work of sam <UNK> yes it is rough but has good energy and plenty of fun the acting <UNK> from the very good in scott <UNK> and shawn paul to the not so good in some of the lesser parts is it a cult movie well it grew on me first time i liked it but by the 3rd viewing i was loving it the movie is probably a 7 out of 10 but i'm giving it 8 for sheer cheek anyone who can pull this off for 8 grand is worth watching almost makes me want to visit scotland
<START> of all the adaptations of books by <UNK> <UNK> i feel that this qualifies as the worst but <UNK> blame <UNK> it would appear that all that this film shares with the novel is the same title we have no suspense no sense of foreboding of mystery no chance to really empathize with the main characters we spend the entire duration or at least i did waiting for charlotte <UNK> to shed her clothing for charlotte this appears to take a remarkably long time still a glimpse of charlotte tits really <UNK> save this disastrous film <UNK> has once again been kicked into the <UNK> to endure the <UNK> of those bitter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who would appear to blame him for all the <UNK> that <UNK> attempted filming of his books poor old <UNK> must have <UNK> into a corner and <UNK> when this one came out at least bear island which also uses the <UNK> name but apparently none of his novel was a little exciting the excitement here is in waiting for the final credits
<START> as everyone knows nobody can play scarlett o'hara like <UNK> leigh and nobody can play <UNK> butler like clark gable all others pale in comparison and timothy dalton and <UNK> <UNK> are no exceptions one thing that i really couldn't get past was that <UNK> has brown eyes the green eyes were the most <UNK> feature of <UNK> good looks and in this sequel she has been stripped of those br br the movie as well as the book had several <UNK> in it the new characters weren't all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever it could be that i'm only 11 but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say 10 minutes when <UNK> told her she had grown up if <UNK> hadn't told her that i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude she really loved cat her baby she likes this child best because she had it with <UNK> her only loved husband still if you've read gone with the wind you would see that children make no difference in <UNK> world br br quite frankly it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without <UNK> all anybody cares about is whether or not <UNK> and scarlett get back together and scarlett took way too long to get to that it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind but then again what isn't if you have read the novel you will like that better than the movie br br i would watch it just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind regardless of whether or not it's worthwhile it may not satisfy you entirely but it will get you some of the way there
<START> while it's one of two movies on tales of voodoo volume 1 there's no voodoo or anything supernatural in it the box <UNK> it hell hole but the screen title is escape from hell hole the title is <UNK> similar to hell hole 1978 aka escape from women's hell hole a group of women <UNK> in a river and seemingly the worst thing they have to worry about is a <UNK> tom who they easily <UNK> no nudity in this or any other scene however br br a woman named drives up in a car and seems to be known and liked by all the women she invites to come and live in the city with her and her uncle m g once they get there it becomes clear that m g wants to take virginity m g runs some sort of house of prostitution and he's either in charge of a corrupt branch of the military or runs a <UNK> outfit or prefers for his guards to all wear military style uniforms br br the women who refuse him or otherwise make trouble get put into a prison gets sent there the women get tortured and sometimes possibly raped by the guards br br various <UNK> attempts at escape or rescue are made but inevitably fail despite the obvious <UNK> the women have they <UNK> the guards vastly and relatively few of the guards have automatic weapons most have semi automatic <UNK> or <UNK> br br <UNK> genre <UNK> may like it and the fact that it was made in the <UNK> gives it some novelty but otherwise eh
<START> some have commented on the subtitles not being a problem in this film i beg to <UNK> the in the facial expressions and subtle interactions between the characters is such that you can not afford to take your eyes away for even a <UNK> of a second i tried to watch on the dvd in english to overcome this problem don't make this mistake the result is a travesty the only way to get the full benefit is to watch it two or three times in quick succession so you know it and then ignore the subtitles an acting master class not in the dialogue but body language br br it is the little things the <UNK> shop keeper <UNK> out his chest and goes in to get his cap before delivering a letter from france the <UNK> <UNK> expression as his delight in a bunch of perfect <UNK> <UNK> a biblical reference with a <UNK> worthy of <UNK> <UNK> br br the cinematography is awesome and the bleak <UNK> village with its washed out colour just <UNK> the <UNK> of the feast when it comes i have a friend who claims to be <UNK> from the and who's family <UNK> is <UNK> it is worth doing it is worth doing to <UNK> br br i laugh out loud and cry each time i watch this film
<START> once in a while i like a good horror movie so i thought this would be a splatter and gore movie but it was a boring boring movie maybe because i have seen a cut version because there where only two things that where a little splatter one time where some ones cuts someone arm of and where some one shots an arm of but that where the only things for example had more cool then evil ed its more a boring ed than a evil ed and some actors where lousy to o

<START> 1931 also presented an american tragedy the original tale of who will he take up with poor girl or rich girl this was a truly entertaining film <UNK> stanwyck was a pretty as she could be <UNK> sally <UNK> monroe <UNK> played husband i had never heard of him but i thought he bore a good physical resemblance to bing crosby of the big broadcast even a <UNK> <UNK> and ears <UNK> cortez the rich playboy with a heart of gold a true movie <UNK> going back the dilemma is resolved at the end to the <UNK> of the title and i believe <UNK> had the hit recording although the off screen voice did very well i also enjoyed the dance hall scenes i'm sure they were authentic the band a leading one of the time was superb good job lionel barrymore
<START> i had to watch this movie for a film class i suffered the whole time through i am not asian but was still greatly offended by this film the film's basis is overall <UNK> rex harrison isn't even asian are depicted in narrow minded manner the <UNK> of the film in thailand illustrates the degree <UNK> and <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> in addition there has been critical attention given to biography of anna many critics argue that anna added many <UNK> events to her story to project herself in a good manner some critics of the film and biography have even stated that anna made up the whole story an awful film but good for discussion of <UNK> as form of <UNK> narrative fiction rather than a work of non fiction
<START> the story is quite slow at the beginning except few interesting humour that come along the way but some of the plot still empty br br the science on how the kid entered the 21st century is still a mystery except at the end of the movie we have been shown of how br br other than that everything looks ok
<START> i thought i might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years on the contrary i was more impressed now than in my <UNK> youth with its honesty and brave humour in 1969 the transition among african american groups from a <UNK> policy of and <UNK> to one of confrontation and self determination was still quite new and more than a little controversial it took courage and <UNK> to portray both the establishment and the anti establishment as the caricatures they often closely in real life special mention should be made of arnold <UNK> performance he successfully avoided having his character <UNK> into either <UNK> or <UNK> i'd rather watch this than to sir with love any old day
<START> if there are people that don't like this movie i don't think they are human this film <UNK> all emotions and shows many sides of <UNK> <UNK> character made in 1997 this is one of the best movies i have seen and really the film that <UNK> light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers this movie although sometimes you want to <UNK> the son for <UNK> her so much is incredibly moving i cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me the plot doesn't have much to it but the acting provided by <UNK> light is incredible she looks beautiful the whole time and by the end you don't want the fate <UNK> by the <UNK> to happen to her overall a movie worth my highest praise thank you for making it and <UNK> my view on the death penalty i eagerly <UNK> this movie to come out on dvd or some other form of media since lifetime is starting to issue some movies to customers although i don't have high hopes for this one because this took place almost 9 years ago which is still hard to believe since this movie is still <UNK> into my head after all this time
<START> the make or break of a love story for me is whether or not i like the characters and also if they click with each other matt is pretty unlikeable <UNK> <UNK> seemingly lazy and a <UNK> he's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take i guess i liked the details of his <UNK> he was believable he by <UNK> that nail amy he acts so cool around amy that he strikes out twice when they do talk he can't show her who he really is she and then him at just the right moments she seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didn't seem to fit for me i found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty girl next door pretty i call it so i was going to like this movie unless it really screwed up br br funny things happen with the coach but <UNK> relationship with the other coach was inspiring the football scenes at the end were <UNK> matt doesn't carry the ball but seems to be a <UNK> back folks he isn't the right size he's fifty pounds too light for that position but i thought his acting was skilled i measure that by the way i wanted to <UNK> his neck a couple of times during his scenes with meredith monroe the film was all right meredith m was better than all right
<START> others have <UNK> here about james stewart's age when playing he was <UNK> was twenty five but stewart does not look his age and the film for him was a dream come true an actual pilot and a retired air force <UNK> general at the end of his life stewart had the feel for the character and understanding of his passion which other actors could not bring to the role added to the cast was co star murray hamilton who was also to be featured in the f b i story with stewart and such other well known character actors as richard <UNK> of the later dick van <UNK> show and robert of the thing from another world the 1951 sci fi classic br br billy wilder captures the flavor of the autobiography and the telling of what was to become a major event in the history of <UNK> this story and film are a testament to the soul of determination and <UNK> to realize a dream a box office failure at the time of it's release it has since become one of the great classics of american film and another in a long line of outstanding performances by an actor that has been called america's <UNK> no student of film history should miss seeing this one there have been over 500 000 films since the beginning of motion pictures and this one belongs among the top 500
<START> this could have been the best game ever but the game makers just screwed up after 3 <UNK> and the ending this is a combination of prince of <UNK> hit man <UNK> and age of <UNK> ii br br yes these four games mentioned above are considered to be one of the greatest games ever made br br you combine the four and you get this game it has all the good aspects of the four games like <UNK> skills stealth <UNK> open world and the history for the first 3 <UNK> you feel this game is greatest but after the third things seem to get so repetitive that you only hope for the game to end br br i have played this on a pc and the pc version is horrible with <UNK> and the stupid side missions are senseless br br my advice to all this is a good game but get it either for the or <UNK> don't get it for the pc br br lastly this game came from the creators of prince of <UNK> surely the producer is hot but the game is not hot and it is not better than the four games mentioned above
<START> it's like someone took a fantasy type video game and put it in a <UNK> and the resulting scene <UNK> is what we have to sit through br br now let me go on record by saying how much i love chinese fantasy films from the fun and silly to those focusing on martial arts to the more dramatic and romantic a genre i very much enjoy films like a chinese odyssey <UNK> box and a chinese odyssey cinderella both of which were written and or directed by jeffrey <UNK> the bride with white hair <UNK> sword green snake a chinese ghost story ii zu warriors from the magic mountain <UNK> tiger hidden dragon and others which is why i was looking forward to a chinese tall story one of the film's characters is the monkey king aka sun an extremely well known character in chinese mythology first told in the stories of the journey to the west the epic adventure written about 500 years ago the story of the monkey king and his <UNK> is also the focus of the chinese odyssey films amongst many others other familiar characters that appear in the film are <UNK> the pig character and <UNK> br br so how does it all go wrong well let's take an example familiar to western audiences how about the robin hood mythology a well known story from <UNK> <UNK> days let's say that our robin hood film starred wesley snipes as robin hood and <UNK> joel <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> maid <UNK> is none other than <UNK> <UNK> let's give sir robin an <UNK> as well because you never know when you might have to waste the sheriff of <UNK> they might need rocket packs also and while we're at it give them a <UNK> nuclear weapon because that sure could come in handy if you think this sounds like a really neat retelling of the robin hood tale then a chinese tall story is the movie for you as i <UNK> above this movie is a <UNK> mess in the first 30 minutes we are introduced not only to sun <UNK> and <UNK> but also to the monk who is actually the main protagonist kidnapped children a millennium bug demon which shoots laser <UNK> an underground tree god a lizard <UNK> tribe an <UNK> girl in an <UNK> egg the lord <UNK> <UNK> a sea dragon king a ever <UNK> magic golden staff a <UNK> girl <UNK> in space and the four heavenly knights all this wouldn't be too bad the tales and <UNK> passed down over the years certainly do have all sorts of <UNK> elements but i guarantee you the chinese mythology does not include much of the stuff we get subjected to in the last half of the film helpful advice to the filmmakers just because your computer effects guys can come up with cool looking <UNK> and depictions of <UNK> war does not mean they should br br you know your chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks and i am not making this a direct quote from the commentary i asked the composer whether or not we can have a more rock and roll type music when she transforms into some kind of <UNK> like thing is there a story hidden in here somewhere yes yes there is most of the adventure follows played by nicholas gen x cops time and tide my <UNK> the barbarian and the lizard <UNK> girl played by <UNK> <UNK> and a computer <UNK> is the best thing going in this film you may know her as half of the <UNK> pop group twins and from other films such as the twins effect a fun flick and just one look a surprisingly good drama romance comedy poor <UNK> being a lizard <UNK> and all is hardly recognizable with her <UNK> <UNK> out teeth nose and <UNK> back that is until the computers get a hold of and <UNK> her which somehow makes it worse <UNK> is passable but all of the supporting actors were abysmal a couple of recognizable faces in bit parts are wasted br br at one point i was <UNK> with myself if a chinese tall story was a spoof i was almost able to convince myself that it was when the <UNK> egg girl played by a very pretty fan bing bing got out and lit up a <UNK> while talking with who was practicing martial arts dressed in a spider man costume but it is not a spoof of course there is the typical hong kong silliness but the movie takes itself seriously enough with enough scenes of romance and pathos scored with a of <UNK> and <UNK> and rousing action and adventure br br you might think that you could watch this on a netflix rental and it wouldn't cost you anything oh but it'll cost you all right br br is there anything good to say sure the colors are vibrant they are the best thing about this movie and the filmmakers certainly were trying very hard too bad all that effort went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game
<START> i first saw this film on cable in the 80's and it <UNK> me to the core it showed up again on tv about six months ago br br filmed on location the black and white cinematography <UNK> portrays 1950's new york as the gritty urban jungle at a time when there was far more industry and <UNK> activity in the city particularly in manhattan br br john cassavetes always brought a special intensity to his acting and is magnificent in the role of the army <UNK> his brief 1959 tv series johnny <UNK> is also a joy to watch br br sidney <UNK> and later in the film ruby dee bring <UNK> and <UNK> to their roles but it is jack <UNK> superb acting as the vicious brutal shift boss that grabbed my attention to get an idea of <UNK> <UNK> watch this film then check out a <UNK> episode of the tv series naked city entitled <UNK> of the rose street gang available on video if you are a fan of film noir this is a must see enjoy
<START> no budget direct to video tale of aliens in arizona involving the military and escaped <UNK> br br not bad as such rather it suffers from the cast and crew sort of going through the <UNK> instead of trying to sell it its as if they knew they were in a grade z movie and want you to know they know then again maybe they just couldn't get it together br br a misfire of a grade z movie that could have been something if some one cared and had skill why must low budget filmmakers insist on not actually trying to make a something good instead of just making a product br br 2 out of 10 because nothing comes together
<START> i work at a movie theater and every <UNK> night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next day today it was the guardian i saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it and in no way really did i <UNK> seeing this movie well turns out this movie was a lot more than i would have thought it was a great story first of all <UNK> <UNK> and kevin <UNK> did amazing acting work in this film being a big fan of that 70's show i always found it hard thinking of <UNK> as anyone but <UNK> despite the great acting he did in the <UNK> effect but after seeing this movie i think i might be able to finally look at him as a serious actor br br it was also a great tribute to the <UNK> heroes of the u s coast guard
<START> this is one of the better marion davies <UNK> and one of the few to allow her to exhibit her skill as a physical comedian which was so endearing in her silent films ok so she does a clunky tap number but even ruby <UNK> dancing from the era does not hold up for younger generations the problem here is the script the story falls into unbelievable melodrama in the last reel it's quite <UNK> and is obviously adapted from a play but not well enough still there is some snappy dialogue and slapstick throughout worth a look
<START> yes this movie was just hilarious and the acting was top notch from the whole cast except shelley winters german accent wasn't that great but then that doesn't matter as she is hardly in the film so if you're a fan of hers beware the two main stars of this film are laurence harvey and julie harris now before this film i'd only see miss harris in east of <UNK> with james dean and i own an audio tape of the glass <UNK> that she did on stage with monty <UNK> and jessica <UNK> so i wasn't sure how she'd be in this role and boy did she impress me how hammy was she i love ham mr harvey he <UNK> my fancy i am now a full time laurence harvey fan that hair <UNK> <UNK> it's almost like burt that crazy messy look it doesn't get better than that he is young and so innocent in this film see it now it's definitely in my top ten i am so glad i found a copy that is all mine unfortunately this movie is out of print and very hard to find on video br br btw watch out for the hospital hotel room scene it's one of the best parts or when mr harvey has convinced himself he's ill and he's trying to get his <UNK> to kick you know how doctors do with that little rubber hammer well he does it himself and his leg kicks and it kicks the table <UNK> check out the look on his face so innocent i can't describe it but to all those people who say he couldn't act very well and other <UNK> comments see this film and you will see what a great actor he really was you'll be <UNK> over if you aren't then i'm afraid there is nothing i can do for you you're hopeless
<START> national <UNK> 1944 the movie that put taylor on the map <UNK> the then number one box office <UNK> mickey rooney taylor plays a girl in love with her horse and when <UNK> mickey rooney is unable to ride in the grand national race <UNK> liz cuts her hair pretends to be a boy and races the horse to well i won't spoil the end for you it's quality melodrama that mgm was famous for putting out and it's another early color picture to boot
<START> this movie was not that good at all here is the first clue and that it is not gonna be a strong movie harrison ford's name not only appears first but it is also bigger than the title the music was nominated for an oscar what the heck was that that music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie the acting was sub par at best except the <UNK> boy he did a decent job for being so young then you have the story which was weak and a little over the place and it won for adapted the music was horrid i know i already said something but it was really bad the premises was real good and it should be remade well that's all i really have on that br br your average movie guy br br
<START> the film tells upon the title role gerard depardieu confronting against <UNK> during the french revolution the film is based on real deeds they are the following <UNK> as lawyer <UNK> in the <UNK> of the king louis <UNK> and the <UNK> of the republic being minister of justice in the convention and <UNK> of club he <UNK> creation <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> of public salvation which he <UNK> but was <UNK> by <UNK> starting a period of revolutionary <UNK> known <UNK> besides in the film appear other historic <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> now a famed filmmaker louis david saint just br br the picture especially <UNK> the happenings surrounding the facing off of the principal figures one time partner revolution and <UNK> execution although gives results a contemporary <UNK> about the modern <UNK> thus is and <UNK> is who was the prime minister <UNK> the martial law in <UNK> and with similar name than actor played <UNK> gerard depardieu is excellent in the title character and <UNK> portrayed also in <UNK> roles are awesome actors as the recently deceased jacques dinner game <UNK> in paradise and angela <UNK> the tin drum the motion picture is well directed by considered the best polish director the flick will like to historical cinema buffs
<START> many <UNK> rod <UNK> of overacting and anyone who has seen the <UNK> horror and the section would struggle to say otherwise that said he's brilliant in this br br it's never on tv you can't buy it on dvd <UNK> in 1988 when channel 4 still had a <UNK> for <UNK> they showed this amongst a small <UNK> of 60s films <UNK> etc and i remember an essentially theatrical experience <UNK> well to film the great thing about theatre is it's <UNK> how do you make it available and interesting on screen <UNK> just about pulls it off because this sort of film is never even on cable or sky tv anywhere it's hard to get a debate going but for anyone out there who has seen it or can remember my memories are of a <UNK> almost <UNK> performance by sally <UNK> all taken care <UNK> which <UNK> the almost <UNK> general performances of her and her sibling in many early 70s offerings she says <UNK> conception there are several of these key lines you remember years decades on that's the power of a film like this br br ps i just saw it again and its just as good one day tv too will be <UNK>
<START> above all you must not take this movie seriously it takes itself seriously unfortunately but that can't be helped this anime ninja <UNK> has to be the <UNK> achievement in spoiling what could have been an endearing if unoriginal story with bad plot twists ridiculous time killing <UNK> and one outrageous guest appearance which will either make you laugh or <UNK> or both like me br br while i'm typically a fan of ninja samurai anime ninja <UNK> and to name a few this one has to be the exception for the record from a technical point of view of its time this movie was very well animated and constructed it is just the plot that <UNK> the authors of this movie clearly decided for what rational reason i don't know that they could somehow make up for the lack of a script if the character halfway around the world in search of a treasure that he learns his father fought and died for in the process he saves a black slave named sam meets a french girl who is living in an <UNK> village makes friends with a ninja clan whose members then try to kill him meets more family members then he knew he had in the <UNK> places and circumstances and whom all subsequently die at some point in the movie br br even so far these ludicrous plot twists could be <UNK> but then come the two guest appearances 1 after having a cliche showdown with two <UNK> meets a man who introduces himself as mark <UNK> at this point you're probably saying what the this meeting serves one purpose it entirely <UNK> a movie which tries to add to itself an educated historical background i found it disappointing that the authors went to all this trouble to research the <UNK> us and didn't manage to realize that mark <UNK> real name was samuel <UNK> 2 when finally finds the treasure it turns out that it used to belong to captain <UNK> i can hear the <UNK> of disgust now br br finally there are the running scenes these scenes show various characters running with the landscape moving behind them for several minutes and there are a lot of them it is these scenes which make this movie <UNK> 12 min to seem to last a week and a half br br if you and your friends are looking for a bad subtitled movie that just asks to be made fun of this is it feel free to poke fun at every possible aspect of it and have fun just don't take it seriously 3 10
<START> my son adam 5 years old is a big scooby doo fan he like this film a lot he particularly liked when the <UNK> <UNK> monster tried to attack shaggy and scooby the vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters br br having seen the vampire rock film first this not surprisingly was very similar as they repeat a well worn basic plot in a different setting br br few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the tv cartoon series and even fewer will watch it without children you either like this or love it i loved scooby doo for half an hour as a kid i am happy my son loves it i can just about put up with it now
<START> this was a highly hyped movie prior to its release but turned out to be a dud i never talked to one person who ever liked this movie i agree i didn't like it either perhaps one big reason it wasn't a box office success was that it had nothing but unappealing characters in the story br br for awhile there i don't know if this is still true i hadn't any movie in which laura <UNK> or dylan walsh played anything but annoying characters br br that and a stupid story make this film a big disappointment especially considering that big <UNK> did the filmmakers with dialog this dumb really think this was going to be a hit
<START> <UNK> ii is nothing compared to the original <UNK> but there are legitimate reasons for it 1 rodney <UNK> was supposed to be the ace of this film but he didn't like the script wanted to change it his request was denied so he didn't do the film 2 it was low budget bill murray had grown to superstar status ted knight passed away in 1986 and chevy chase the so called ace of the first movie although it was rodney all the way be on more than 5 minutes because it would cost too much to pay him but you had dan <UNK> robert stack randy quaid and jackie mason all <UNK> <UNK> who none had their best performances
<START> first there was tsui <UNK> zu warriors 2001 which is visually ground breaking but much lacking in the acting and writing <UNK> now this movie which is visually almost as good as zu though no longer ground breaking but is even worse in the acting and writing <UNK> it's really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing talents in the hk movie industry i guess you need to understand <UNK> to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogs in the movie really are it's like some <UNK> kids talking in the street it's that bad to make it worse the actors and actresses themselves look like <UNK> kids and can't act even if their life depend on it i understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in hk but has hk <UNK> really become so brain dead that they can't appreciate anything but such juvenile and vulgar acting writing if that's the case it makes me ashamed to be from hk br br i wish hk movie makers will learn some lessons from directors like zhang <UNK> <UNK> or ang lee and finally make a movie that's both visually stunning as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing <UNK> and stop using young singers <UNK> <UNK> as actors because they can't act however many fans they may have in hk
<START> hey look you don't watch this movie to change your life but if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for richard gere this movie is right up your street diane lane and richard gere have on screen chemistry going way back in is not a oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric beautifully shot love story between middle aged good looking people they don't make your stomach turn and even when gere is <UNK> <UNK> he does not look too then this is the movie for you i loved the theme of the story and it was quite relevant in many ways of course the whole thing was presented in a superficial way <UNK> over and not really dealt with i mean i would have liked to know more about the father son relationship between gere and james franco but the story was really about the idea that a great love can change you for the better whether it is a lover a child a friend etc the theme of the film is about love and its mysterious ways i was kind of surprised that james franco took such a small part in this film but he is always good even for a few minutes screen time i really liked this film because it was moving and sweet
<START> spoilers this film depicts the brutal bloodbath caused by the retirement of johnny carson to determine who would succeed him the <UNK> of david <UNK> and jay leno are performed in a satisfactory way by john michael <UNK> and daniel <UNK> though the performances weren't great <UNK> <UNK> is the best performing of the <UNK> he plays john of nbc and warren <UNK> played by bob is a close second i was shocked at the way in which <UNK> eagerly discussed <UNK> johnny carson this was johnny carson this scene <UNK> the cut throat what have you done for me lately world of television kathy bates delivered the best performance of the film as <UNK> agent helen another <UNK> <UNK> that leno was portrayed as a <UNK> in the film i <UNK> disagree the relationship with <UNK> on something akin to domestic violence she orders him around and when he rebels against her at the end she tries to play the sympathy card mentioning her dead husband and son however when jay <UNK> their relationship she turns violent again screaming don't you leave me you two faced bastard before <UNK> a picture on the floor overall the movie is hilarious and i wish that it were shown more often
<START> this was a modest attempt at a film though it appeared more like a tv pilot extended br br some may find this unfair but it looks like someone saw the brothers and save the last dance and thought hey i could do that too well not quite br br while i personally found the movie predictable somewhat poorly acted and contrived watch for the <UNK> carl payne shows that he can carry off a lead role and should be back on television the leading lady can't remember her name sorry was plausible too but you keep thinking of julia stiles she was the one in save the last dance right because this one was really stuck in white girl mode
<START> a nice and pleasant movie full of <UNK> <UNK> is a very beautiful greek island that keeps many of the <UNK> characteristics i think that greek <UNK> add something special and magical to a movie one thing i didn't like at all though is that the main characters like and father weren't greek actors but <UNK> i mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear even their <UNK> when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot irene <UNK> was really great in her role a typical example of a mother living in a island during the 40's who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone john hurt father also acted great he reminded me a greek in many of his reactions
<START> <UNK> starts out as expected stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them i thought for a while it might be a cannibal film it starts off like so many others showing nothing but shots off <UNK> amazon rain forest for all i know it could be florida at this point you figure some animal <UNK> or natives will pop up instead you get the acting talents of william smith who starred in l a vice and angels die hard he plays an acclaimed hunter who i would describe him as jack palance light he is bigger in stature but not quite the jack palance goodness as for natives you don't really get that many where's the <UNK> should i even ask that question now <UNK> humans i guess he doesn't really pursue anyone till the end of the movie though just stares at them does race one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a over dramatic <UNK> and the <UNK> kind of way the motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason other than an action sequence i can't tell you how many times i've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle never actually do they live do they die will you care anybody wanna race on <UNK> caution this film contains extreme dry look my advice is to rent a jack palance classic like <UNK>
<START> it seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing sex don't get me wrong i'm no <UNK> but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all i'm interested in is highly offensive take the a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and or a script that wasn't written by a six year old this is essentially the craft with supposedly hot guys and yeah that's it it bored me to tears even my friend who usually <UNK> us crap films hated it it is really stunningly bad to the extent where it can actually be funny i would have laughed if it wasn't for the fact that several other females in cinema <UNK> seemed to be enjoying it they were accompanied by several <UNK> looking guys who positively <UNK> up and died when the really cliché boy on boy kiss happened towards the end watching them <UNK> really was the highlight of the film i don't think mainstream hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers or indeed for anyone so i think i'll give up unless you're a teen who likes the <UNK> dolls thinks paris hilton is hot and watches mtv it's like some sort of <UNK> life's hard when you're a fifteen year old who likes art house p s someone should have told the director that not all teenage girls find would be boy band members totally <UNK> lol <UNK>
<START> well there <UNK> much to say about this movie its simply trash very poor acting poor script and lame story well the actress i even know her name who played not the blond one but <UNK> one was acting fine but the blond one who played the friend of main <UNK> her acting level is just like <UNK> play so as most of other actors in the movie also zombies very bad acting as well and the story itself has really no point at all well if you are really bored and really got nothing to do but wanna kill time somehow maybe you may wanna watch this movie but there are still millions of better b movies than this crap its total waste of money and time
<START> ok to start with this movie was not at all like the book i read the book when i was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite when i'm waiting for a different book to come out this is the book i turn to to fill in the time i have 3 copies for god's sake anyways i knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on they could have done a little better than this i mean seriously if i wanted to watch american werewolf in paris or london than i would watch those movies they took a perfectly good story and twisted it around into a copy of a story that has been told over and over again and quite frankly i'm tired of watching it i mean hello the best part of the whole f g sorry story is she ends up with gabriel he doesn't die what was that about and he's old in this movie gabriel is supposed to be only 24 not <UNK> da it <UNK> and <UNK> who the he came up with the idea of <UNK> being aunt no no no no <UNK> and vivian hate each other <UNK> anyways yeah that was my little rant seriously <UNK> ed off hope this helped
<START> i saw this film at the <UNK> international film festival 2002 this seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival however as it turned out all the more interesting br br the story of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after <UNK> from a drug addiction is based on actual facts moreover the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again this time for the film which is partly set up as a stage play not only do they all happen to be good actors <UNK> parents are actors in real life as well the methods used in <UNK> their relationship towards <UNK> are very effective br br <UNK> is the actor of some chinese action films late eighties start nineties later you can see him in great films such as frozen and <UNK> river in between these two career paths <UNK> becomes a drug addict and <UNK> all drive to act or even do anything <UNK> except for making somewhat <UNK> attempts at becoming a guitar <UNK> br br i like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after <UNK> more than on the horror of drugs we really feel the pain and struggle <UNK> is in at the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him br br the film draws the viewer into a <UNK> pattern <UNK> seems to be caught in dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him because there are personal with the characters we feel like we are getting to know <UNK> not only through himself but through others as well br br the film has a heavy feel but scenes of <UNK> <UNK> through <UNK> and <UNK> with his friends <UNK> the tone so does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after this is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern chinese film this is a strong recommendation
<START> sam ninja 3 the <UNK> mixes martial arts with the exorcist like horror the horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable but the film works as a mindless action martial arts flick the fight scenes are well choreographed and exciting and the film is never boring so forget stupid dialogue lame acting and annoying soundtrack grab some beer and check this one out highly recommended
<START> this movie is just great it starts out real slow and boring but as the movie progresses well the fun keeps on coming the power of the movie is perhaps in it's subtle references to a lot and i mean a lot of other movies for me the best part was perhaps the bruce lee <UNK> tiger hidden dragon scene how the two actors switches from french to chinese or whatever asian language it was it was awesome then the jokes with the names they are hilarious but perhaps you won't understand all of them when your an american no offense overall a great movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> ho is a great family movie salman khan is looking handsome and great than ever there's even a scene where he takes off his shirt what a surprise <UNK> <UNK> is great too <UNK> had very few lines to say but i'm glad she has been acknowledged for her role because she definitely has potential br br it's about <UNK> salman khan and he is a wedding singer he is about to marry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but gets stood up <UNK> goes to house and asks her why he was <UNK> and it's because her brother is ill and she needs to marry an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kumar to get the money to get him treated <UNK> moves on and in comes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> falls in br br love with <UNK> but it's a shame she's about to get married to an <UNK> who could this <UNK> be <UNK> falls in love with <UNK> too while <UNK> is there with her <UNK> gives <UNK> an insulting comment one day and she goes off and sets off to for the wedding with <UNK> will <UNK> stop her watch to find out br br the film was very funny the songs were great especially the song o <UNK> o <UNK> it's a shame the film <UNK> in india and i don't know why every film in india is going flop nowadays this film deserved to be a hit the only problem i found with the film is that they had an obsession about they think all are rich the film deserves a 9 10
<START> thinking that it could only get better was the worst <UNK> i ever made br br <UNK> does not describe this movie appropriately enough br br not only is the plot thin but i get more emotional acting from my pet fish br br it was a shame to see pete <UNK> whom i respect as an actor trying to do the best with the little he had to work with br br i think that a cardboard cut out of stephen baldwin would have done a better job and in fact have been more <UNK> br br avoid at all costs this could really be <UNK> to your health
<START> mickey rourke <UNK> diane lane in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it is not like mickey rourke ever really disappeared he has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene he was memorable in domino sin city man on fire once upon a time in mexico and get carter but in his powerful dramatic performance in the wrestler 2008 we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in get carter whenever we get to know him rourke remains a cool but sleazy muscle bound slim ball br br this is an <UNK> leonard story and production leonard wrote such notable movies as <UNK> western thriller 3 10 to <UNK> be cool jackie brown get <UNK> <UNK> pick up and joe <UNK> this means that we get tough guys some good some not so good br br it also means we get tight realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation <UNK> complications into violent conclusions <UNK> is no different tough slim ball killer rourke stalks <UNK> married witness lane think history of violence meets no country for old men it is not as intense bloody or gory as those two but it is almost as good if you like those two including david equally wonderful eastern promises you will like <UNK> also br br director john <UNK> has not done a lot of movies his last few were enjoyable if not successful proof captain <UNK> and shakespeare in love br br diana lane hasn't had a powerful movie role since she and richard gere gave incredible performances in <UNK> lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as nights in must love dogs and under the <UNK> sun here she is right on mark <UNK> her sexy appeal with reserved tension br br this is a small part for rosario dawson yet dawson does a good job with it you see a lot more of lane including an underwear scene to rival <UNK> weaver in aliens and nicole kidman in eyes wide shut br br while you are in the crime drama section also pick up kiss kiss bang bang and gone baby gone and before the devil knows your dead the last has wonderful performances by phillip seymour hoffman ethan hawke marisa tomei and albert finney br br <UNK> <UNK> at the box office more is our luck it is certainly worth a 3 4 dollar rental if you like this genre 6 20 2009
<START> i had never heard of this film when a good friend recommended it i trust this friend's taste so i purchased the dvd my wife and i sat down to watch it with no knowledge of what it was about i thought it was the funniest film i have seen in a long time mainly because i saw the truth in the satire i strongly recommend this film to all my friends br br this is not a film for everyone some people will see the crass humor and aura of stupidity and find <UNK> to be one of the stupidest movies they have seen what these people don't seem to understand is that the crass humor is there not to <UNK> the audience but to show what appeals to the morons in the future br br luke wilson is well cast as an average joe he is mainly there to be a <UNK> for the biting commentary about society that is spread throughout this film many of the funnier bits are in the background so it is easily worth seeing several times what makes the movie even funnier and more scary is that i see elements of it in every day life in people i meet or on the media then i go back and re watch <UNK> and realize how good it is br br the few people who have seen and enjoyed this film are able to be part of an elite club i'll see an <UNK> for some product with some breakthrough new <UNK> and turn to my wife and say it's got <UNK> she knows exactly what i am saying
<START> i really don't have any complaints about this movie except for the disturbing scenes with the body i fell upon it while switching around the tv one night the acting was actually amazing i didn't expect it to be better than it appeared i thought <UNK> who looks the same since 1986 which is a very good thing <UNK> acting was really great and <UNK> played his character perfectly this movie is a hidden gem its a fresh <UNK> of reality to the '80s compared to the other teen movies done by the brat pack even though i do like those alot too all in all i give it thumbs up
<START> the first official release of world wrestling <UNK> film division is a pretty basic horror slasher movie called see no evil starring kane one of their big men <UNK> known for having an <UNK> presence hard hitting moves and one of the most convoluted <UNK> in wrestling and let's not pull any punches here while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time mostly by wwe it goes without saying that after having seen this movie i can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time br br see no evil sees a bunch of juvenile <UNK> sent to a hotel so they can clean up of course a monstrous murderer played by kane also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes without giving away too much of the movie plot this film has all the semblance and structure of an early 1980s slasher flick with most of the clichés intact but without any of the scares that those films <UNK> and that's sort of the main problem with see no evil it tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next it's too generic to be scary br br the movie's gory no doubt but it's only there for the effect the dark atmosphere <UNK> in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially but as you get towards the end it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly the death scenes don't come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable although some of them are pretty inventive br br and the acting in this movie is pretty bad too as the main characters aren't developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get <UNK> some can't even portray fear properly they just scream and cry in a vain effort to <UNK> so when they die it only adds to the comedy because you don't care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of <UNK> to the monster kane br br as for kane he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character only he uses <UNK> and <UNK> instead of <UNK> and <UNK> there's no doubt in my mind that kane can be a great <UNK> in the horror genre he has the look and presence for it he just needs better material specifically a script that isn't written by someone who writes wrestling shows to work with br br now despite what may seem like a harsh review i actually enjoyed the film it's one of those laughably bad movies that you can't help but sit down and enjoy my main <UNK> with the film again is that it's simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesn't have any frightening or shock moments i enjoyed it but i enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie if that happens because it was supposed to be that way the movie would have been rated higher but it didn't it got laughs because it's a b movie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos not exactly things to direct anyway nonetheless i enjoyed it tremendously br br if you don't mind a fun b movie or funny horror film i'd highly recommend see no evil if you are a true <UNK> of the genre i'd wait until the dvd comes out before checking it out everyone else should probably go watch something else
<START> i have yet to watch the first entry in this series however fortunately i was still able to follow the complex and intricate plot with all its unexpected twists and turns and i applaud them for the utter originality of the concepts <UNK> in case there is any confusion let me leave no doubt as to the fact that everything i've just said is <UNK> in pure carefully <UNK> sarcasm the kind that <UNK> and grows <UNK> when exposed to crap like this flick a clear sign that this is unimpressive is that it was directed by a visual effects creator whose only other credit in that field is a henry <UNK> film that wasn't well received the acting is average at best and i defy anyone to not find scottish computer woman come on seriously what is with that last name 's russian accent laughable and or irritating there is an attempt or two at <UNK> in this and they are reasonable the action isn't terrible cinematography and editing are fine the music is cool enough language is <UNK> if even that violence is fairly bloody i recommend this solely to fans of b movies and i will say that you can do worse than this 1 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> makes us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the <UNK> vague almost lost among the <UNK> of its ancient <UNK> but ready to rise again from its <UNK> if <UNK> from the past they who are a little <UNK> with the director's subjects on the other hand may know very well how he's obsessed by a lingering sense of loss as far as <UNK> of reality is concerned les <UNK> therefore show us the parallel stories of an <UNK> <UNK> and of a tempted revolution gone to ruin under the direction of young french students br br the first part of the story is about the dramatic events of may <UNK> in france <UNK> in a series of astonishing plan sequences a sort of cinema <UNK> style that place the student <UNK> in anything but an <UNK> light against a pitch black background br br there's much that can be said about the <UNK> of black and white photography used to describe the battle between students and police where the high <UNK> <UNK> an unrealistic atmosphere to the sequences and darkness <UNK> in upon the excited bodies <UNK> them in mystery the images completely <UNK> of words show the real <UNK> of the myth made of crude violence more and more <UNK> by the <UNK> reality of the movie shootings the individual doesn't count anything at all here he tends to disappear in the mass what really matters in these fight scenes are the significance of the mass suggestion the blind fury of the juvenile assault sinister <UNK> of the power of the mob even if conceived like separate <UNK> apart from any kind of emotion with the cold and distant look of an <UNK> intent to <UNK> his <UNK> collection br br the second part of the story is described in a <UNK> and most intimate way stands out on the horizon the <UNK> portrait of a self centered generation in search of its lost time completely <UNK> about the individual values of men inclined to <UNK> on its own <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> and making a funeral <UNK> in the praise of its recent defeat br br les <UNK> seems to evoke from time to time the shadow of the great robert <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> by particular sensibility without <UNK> away from the main argument trying to expand overall perspectives on the subject of human that though painful may bring us to the truth in my opinion trying to <UNK> deeply into the of the story if a man lets himself go and play things by ear he probably will find that he can bring out the dark side of his self with dire and <UNK> consequences
<START> i thought that i wrote a comment on this movie before but i can't find it on here anyway i am writing it again i accidentally found this movie from my <UNK> library <UNK> it was free to watch so why not br br i am certainly glad that i watched it i love this movie i have seen a few russian movies before most of them have serious topics i am surprised that this was one a good comedy i had a great laugh while watching it and this is a movie that i want to buy this thing is so funny and they are not just silly funny those plots were very original and well thought so they don't seem to be silly at all i am surprised that this movie didn't attract many viewers this is a classic that you can watch it over and over br br those actors were also very authentic their acting are real not <UNK> if you haven't watched it go get a copy soon definitely recommended
<START> what an utter disappointment forget this abysmal film and get hold of the tv series instead what on earth were they doing making the american president relatively sane all the politicians should have been bumbling <UNK> peter cook is good as the british <UNK> it lacks the biting satire of the original going instead for lowest common <UNK> slapstick 1 out of 10 if i'm being generous this is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people
<START> what a disappointment i've enjoyed the jon <UNK> books about malone but there's little resemblance between him and the cinematic malone in the books he's a city detective who is devoted to his wife and doesn't get involved in <UNK> for the film the character has been <UNK> up into an <UNK> <UNK> who uses his <UNK> and isn't <UNK> to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl though quite what she and the film's other sex interest see in him i don't know taylor was <UNK> at the time and his face was getting <UNK> br br but his character's <UNK> is remarkable he flies in from australia apparently goes straight to the house rather <UNK> seeking to arrest him during a black tie reception saves him from assassination getting into a fight in the process goes to a casino with one girl leaves with another and takes her to bed so much for jet <UNK> on the way back to the house showing a good knowledge of london back streets he gets beaten up by the baddies but is still first down to breakfast it's also remarkable that the <UNK> has its <UNK> and <UNK> miraculously <UNK> within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise of a clock <UNK> bomb br br the best thing is joseph the <UNK> disdain for the <UNK> malone and at least the film avoids being a london <UNK> though some scenes take place during the <UNK> week
<START> the title of my summary pretty much covers my review br br this is to me what teenage mutant ninja <UNK> was to someone 5 years older while i missed out on that little pop culture wave i <UNK> the toy line and t v series that was mighty max with both arms br br you wanna know how into this i was i went as mighty max for halloween br br thank god for the internet thanks to last week i was able to watch this great show from my childhood for the first time in over a decade br br i'm watching this right now having just been blown away by <UNK> rob <UNK> of <UNK> and am also loving the celebrity humor in <UNK> wars 4 minutes in and they have already mentioned by name clint eastwood <UNK> arnold dustin hoffman john wayne and ace <UNK> <UNK> yeah br br damn it is only upon writing this that i realize there is no way in hell i can give this series anything less than a perfect score any <UNK> have been lost in the fog of time br br this is my childhood this is <UNK> this is the mighty one
<START> as a fan of author and humorous books of which van is not the best one i was looking forward to see this film i didn't catch it in cinema though and after seeing it on to tv i'm terribly happy i <UNK> buying it on video out of a good book they managed to make one of the worst movies in dutch film history all the good parts have been left out the story is changed not to its benefits all humour has been cut out what's left is a bad acted over dramatic non consistent film that i do not want to watch again ever br br i with this result and am happy that jan did a hell of a better job on <UNK> sorry go see that one
<START> it's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so so film noir there just isn't a lot to say about it it is not memorable enough to add to your collection and i have a considerable amount of <UNK> br br paul <UNK> plays a tough guy in here he's not one i would think of to play this kind of role but he's fine with it he's a fine actor anyway br br everything including the cinematography is okay but not memorable one thing that stood out the abrupt ending that was a surprise it was also a surprise to see this under the heading hollow triumph i've never seen the film called that it's always been called <UNK> br br if you read about a tense film noir etc don't believe it tense is not an accurate <UNK> for this film
<START> why did i buy this movie on dvd well the short answer would be i really don't know as for the longer version it pretty much comes down to the fact that i genuinely like ali and she plays alicia in this br br now does ali give a genuinely good effort in this movie i must say that it is one of the better and she is <UNK> up to be a rather decent actress i am very much looking forward to see her in action when better material will be available br br this being said this movie was terrible and my score is given based on this 1 star for not being the worst movie i've seen 1 star for the performance of ali and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars there are worse movies for that br br <UNK> rule should stick to <UNK> not my favourite <UNK> to say the least but some seem to like him and if he is contained there i would be delighted not to see him <UNK> the acting scene br br <UNK> <UNK> ah man wallace what are you doing here you used to be cool man just because michael caine is a <UNK> brilliant actor who has been in so many terrible flicks as well as good you don't have to copy him <UNK> br br the rest of the semi big names in the cast it's ok there are bills to be paid and we all have to do things we're not proud of time to time br br the movie itself it so <UNK> flawed it's pretty difficult to know where to start it's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together as were the director to say we need to tell this and we need to tell that there is a story unfortunately there is nothing surprising about or within it to say the least the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore predictable what was going to happen all the time br br to sum up in one word
<START> ever since i first played it in 1998 <UNK> has been one of my favourite video games in fact i recently bought an <UNK> purely so that i could own it and play it more often the game is pretty much near perfect the single player mode does a fantastic job of <UNK> yourself in <UNK> shoes with varied mission <UNK> convincing weapons and great level design even though the <UNK> artificial intelligence is pretty basic by today's standards that only adds to appeal the method of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> levels within a strict time limit was also innovative when the title was released and even now i still haven't <UNK> some of them br br the game comes with a wonderful <UNK> mode for up to four players and while this isn't as advanced as the combat <UNK> in the <UNK> sequel perfect dark it is still incredibly satisfying to blast your opponents to <UNK> with a <UNK> of <UNK> fire
<START> okay my question who's the idiot that wrote this movie giving it the same name as dean awesome book its terrible nothing like the book you got the dog and the watcher but there the similarities end might be good if you haven't read the book though but it disappointed me really br br they should make a new one and let <UNK> write it now that would be a good movie i'll say it again this movie disgusted me absolutely disgusted me it was terrible it was absolutely nothing like the book i would never again watch it
<START> the standard <UNK> of all movie serials the definite good guy flash gordon versus bad guy <UNK> the <UNK> though the special effects seem awful by today's standards for 1936 they were top notch but the essence of the story is the battle between flash gordon buster <UNK> versus <UNK> <UNK> of charles <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are terrific in their parts and the supporting characters playing <UNK> <UNK> dr princess aura prince <UNK> and the rest are all very good this serial is far superior to the 1980 movie basically because <UNK> is much much superior to sam j jones as flash gordon br br this serial is the standard <UNK> for all movie serials no question about it
<START> this film is a sleeper because rod <UNK> is the only big name in the credits yet all of the supporting actors fit well with his character it was fitting that in his last film rod <UNK> reminded us once more of his inventive power as an actor he portrayed a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and acceptance of the end of life in a <UNK> individual and convincing performance because his character was close to death the story brings us closer to the most precious things granted to us the <UNK> of life relationships with family members and the empathy of those who care for us his search together with his grand daughter for one of his sons provided enough suspense to keep me waiting expecting a highly charged climax such as the meeting of two long separated elderly lovers who were also on the <UNK> of death in forever young i wondered how the meeting would be staged and how tightly my emotions would be wound by the time he and his <UNK> reached the end of his quest i was delighted to find that the story brought more than i expected the delightfully satisfying climax brought for me a greater appreciation of the value of the precious gifts of life love and family that are enjoyed today by me and by all of us
<START> the people who don't like this movie seem to have some academic <UNK> against it those of us who don't hold the original can totally enjoy it br br my husband who had never seen the original said i don't want to see a <UNK> movie i assured him that the women is just a great movie not a girl movie he had a great time he was very glad to have gone and enjoyed it more than the boy movie we saw the day before burn after reading br br spoiler i even think the new ending is better maybe not quite as fun but it was beautiful at first i couldn't understand why they had made certain changes to the plot br br but when i got the end and debra messing gives birth and brings the first male into the movie i cried that's one thing to love about men  they are our sons
<START> i had read up on the film and thought it would be cute a feel good saturday night movie i wasn't expecting anything great figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised br br the dialogue was pitch perfect most of the actors were exceptionally good and it <UNK> nicely ash christian was perfect his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see he could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead <UNK> away from stereotypes and focused on the <UNK> of the character it was wonderful to see jonathan again i didn't know what he would do after ashley <UNK> is gem a great young character actress that hopefully will get more work br br there are moments in the film that could have used some work but all in all not a bad time at the cinema my friend described it as a gay <UNK> <UNK> dynamite but it's something more than that it's a character study into what it's like to grow up gay in a small town the pain is there but the humor behind that pain that only age can make <UNK> is <UNK> i look forward to seeing more of ash christian ashley <UNK> and jonathan soon
<START> one minute into the <UNK> and it s already ripped off techniques from the blair witch project and predator does this mean we ll be seeing lots of trees we sure will will we be seeing an <UNK> <UNK> blowing things up well this film has the budget of a <UNK> so the answer is a <UNK> no does anyone like these soft porn shows like <UNK> stories good because there s a scene in this that resembles these type of shows unfortunately the only thing you see is <UNK> do you like it when the screen fades to black during a <UNK> great because this happens between every scene in the <UNK> in fact it happens during every scene too did you enjoy millionaire a major fraud fantastic because one of the characters looks like a <UNK> major charles <UNK> the contestant who tried to <UNK> the show out of one million pounds seriously one of the characters looks like major <UNK> i kept expecting him to say it s bear it could be a bear but it might be a bigfoot <UNK> <UNK> yes it s a bigfoot <UNK> it s <UNK> a bigfoot <UNK> yes i m going to shoot it final answer chris br br oh and have i mentioned that all the above are the good bits br br the <UNK> <UNK> t the worst bigfoot movie i <UNK> ever seen that <UNK> firmly goes to night of the demon which i saw over twenty years ago and i think i <UNK> only seen less than a dozen films that are worse in all of that time but that said the <UNK> is still a very poor film in just about every aspect especially editing as some other reviewers have pointed out it feels like whole <UNK> of the film are missing while there s other bits where scenes are spliced together in the wrong order this is a really bad film that deserves far less than its rating of 5 1 i give it 3 out of ten and i m being very kind
<START> madonna has been <UNK> the boat for over 20 years and with that comes a lot of experience obviously and a lot of knowledge she was never the one to think about yesterday <UNK> <UNK> she seemed to know what is going to be popular tomorrow she <UNK> takes all the new <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> them into her own acts her world <UNK> have never been <UNK> when madonna performs she gives <UNK> everything is bigger better theatrical and meaningful she takes <UNK> from east west and makes then unique everything is given a deeper meaning and the <UNK> tour is not different from the very beginning you find yourself sitting on the edge of the chair she starts with bang then she does brave circus poses on a horse high up in the sky she does everything she can to entertain you she remakes her own songs giving them a modern feel she sings on a disco cross she almost comes in the middle of the stage and with her amazing dance crew that know no <UNK> of fear the show is absolutely more than you <UNK> for it's a spectacle an audio visual <UNK> that cannot be put in words lucky are the ones who actually experienced seeing madonna on stage pushing fifty she is still in an incredible form recent <UNK> and sweet tour is even more ground breaking which proves nothing else that madonna was is and ever be the one and the only queen of pop
<START> this film was probably the best scary film i've seen in years chilling might be a more accurate description the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise if it has any flaw it would be the <UNK> of the whole meaning of life concept since <UNK> truly knows that answer you definitely <UNK> into murky waters when you <UNK> that concept into a movie put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable <UNK> <UNK> should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry the rest of the cast were somewhat shaky however since the focus was on sara novak <UNK> <UNK> her performance <UNK> the movie the at times poor acting abilities of her <UNK> were not an issue since it was not their performances that <UNK> this movie thankfully watch this movie you should enjoy it br br t
<START> with all the potential for a good movie in its gorgeous settings cast and cinematography this film's <UNK> script <UNK> pace and wooden performances produced only a major disappointment with decent direction editing and musical score this could have been a good movie perhaps a dark version of blake <UNK> <UNK> instead of a <UNK> version of ron <UNK>
<START> luis <UNK> has always been a filmmaker whose work was obscure to me my first experience with him was the <UNK> charm of the often considered his greatest work with which i became so frustrated and bored that i eventually shut the tape off likewise belle de <UNK> which is almost certainly his best known film and also generally considered one of his many masterpieces didn't interest me very much at all i didn't hate it like i did <UNK> but i didn't like it third i saw <UNK> <UNK> finally i had gotten somewhere fourth los <UNK> also good still neither <UNK> <UNK> nor los <UNK> blew me away great films but not masterpieces br br is my fifth <UNK> and i like it just a tad more than those other two it is about a priest from spain now in mexico who refuses to live in the kind of luxury most priests live in he wants to be more like jesus leading the life possible he's also willing to forgive everyone for anything and to suffer without protest i'm pretty sure <UNK> does not sympathize with the character and sees him as rather self righteous however i only assume that because of my knowledge of the director whose most famous <UNK> is thank god i'm still an <UNK> which he apparently said in an interview over this very film i get this information from john <UNK> book about <UNK> if you're interested the <UNK> who dragged those words from <UNK> mouth must have been himself confused about one who was more <UNK> to believe in religious conviction who also knows nothing about <UNK> might see the priest as a heroic figure this is especially true if that viewer has his her own criticisms of organized religion the priest may be somewhat self righteous but he seems to be basically a good man when he <UNK> a violent prostitute in his room in order to protect her and presumably to save her soul people begin to find out and assume that their relationship is sexual his superiors assume the same and <UNK> him for it later on he suffers even worse <UNK> from <UNK>
<START> dreamy young <UNK> <UNK> as tom wants a date with sexy blonde tara reid as lisa taylor ms reid thinks mr <UNK> is gay <UNK> works for <UNK> father an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as jack taylor <UNK> agrees to for the boss believing it will get him closer to reid mr <UNK> has a pet owl named o j who becomes a toilet <UNK> br br this is a film to get your <UNK> to g rated pre teens ready for <UNK> r rated fare it will help if they haven't seen the plot before and especially like moronic <UNK> humor remember people get paid to act like this br br my <UNK> daughter 2003 david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tara reid <UNK> <UNK>
<START> robin hood men in <UNK> has received no respect whatsoever it was hilarious cary <UNK> was excellent as the prince of thieves and david amy <UNK> patrick stewart richard lewis and mark <UNK> as all did fine jobs i will never understand the <UNK> toward robin hood men in <UNK> but i do know a great comedy when i see one br br robin hood men in <UNK> receives out of
<START> just how exactly do gay <UNK> manage in a culture that generally refuses to even recognize the concept of homosexuality for millions of gay <UNK> and muslims there seems little hope of ever leading a life that is accepted and <UNK> by their otherwise very close <UNK> families this is the main point explored in chicken <UNK> presumably named after the western <UNK> dish involving tender pieces of young chicken flesh jimmy is a typical young asian brought up in britain by traditional parents with the common narrow minded and selfish views on marriage and <UNK> like millions of others he is led into an arranged marriage that seems <UNK> even though he is apparently completely gay and deeply involved with a very attractive young man with whom he lives he knows that the truth should be told but fears for the consequences of that particularly so as his father appears to be <UNK> ill and so he becomes <UNK> in a web of <UNK> that becomes wider and wider as the plot develops br br the film is beautifully sensitive and not at all <UNK> or <UNK> to any group portrayed the acting is generally excellent although it might seem a bit ham in places as the director tends to search for humor rather than letting it <UNK> naturally there are no <UNK> for photography or script but the film is made entire by the wonderful sentiment expressed at the very end a sentiment that all fathers across the world would do well to learn from
<START> as far as asian horror goes i have seen my share of <UNK> along with some of the <UNK> sh t imaginable doesn't really qualify for either of those categories it had a few moments of tension and was interesting to watch yet i couldn't help think that there should have been a tad more to this story the film deals with a <UNK> couple who decide to adopt a kid who appears to have a fascination with trees he develops a bond with the tree in their yard and seems to communicate with it then during a fight with his mother involving their new birth child he <UNK> off after threatening to find his dead mother who is now a tree when he doesn't come back the parents send file a report and wait while the neighbor girl believes he somehow <UNK> the tree the pacing is rather slow and the ending gets a bit weird but i have to recommend this as a slightly enjoyable effort though the story feels a little flat hell i can't really make up my mind on this
<START> midnight stars <UNK> simon who <UNK> in the <UNK> kings and elizabeth bennett alicia <UNK> together with sexy vampire <UNK> <UNK> simon <UNK> pregnant alicia and her husband charles into the <UNK> of midnight <UNK> sinks his <UNK> into the script by writers brian and jason cleveland and you enjoy watching him and <UNK> kill alicia and charles robert <UNK> try to stay alive while gore keeps your lust for blood <UNK> br br spoiler alert in today's jaded landscape it comes as no surprise that a back stabbing preacher gets bitten set looks cool  lots of detail at the hotel and cool special effects at the end i had a lot of fun watching this movie  it doesn't take itself too seriously and looks great
<START> even though i sat and watched the whole thing i must say it was not good it was all over the place with big <UNK> of information missing about how things developed and even inaccurate at some bits too if you know nothing about michael you wont understand a thing you have to rely on your current knowledge of the man in order for some bits to make sense acting was a bit dramatic <UNK> alexander looked nothing like michael which was a put off for me and towards the end he literally looked grey saying that portraying michael as somewhat naive but highly positive gentle and loving individual was okay even though they still made a fool out of him time to time if you want to watch <UNK> life story check out an american dream it is much better but the only thing is it will cover up to bad era i have no doubt that they will eventually make a big budget movie of <UNK> life story <UNK> michael you rock
<START> <UNK> would of been <UNK> if he knew that his masterpiece was being acted out puppets also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing no one really will care who the puppet was people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief by this dumb little movie this should be a crime and i cant believe you would ruin a book like that i thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed it totally ruins what your suppose to be getting from reading it your just making it a big joke
<START> this has to be my guilty pleasure i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone this move has no meat not substance no deep thought provoking scenes just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown then so be it this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think <UNK> la nudity
<START> i saw ray when it first came out why partly because of the advertising hype secondly because i just loved the heck <UNK> ray <UNK> music but not being around when his biggest things in music and his life happened i wanted to learn more about the man's life and in this film i did his addiction to drugs was something i didn't know and the film let us know br br but here's the thing while this was a decent <UNK> film i cannot say it was a great film i've seen malcolm x and was blown away same with what's love got to do with it and bird the performances of each of those films was outstanding i wasn't just drawn into the main characters in those films who did incredible jobs but to those around them as well that helps make a picture to me br br i felt that at some parts of this film was shallow and heavy handed for emotional appeal and yes i'll admit at certain parts of the film i almost fell asleep and the film was too long and the film left out several other important details of ray charles life that would have made the film flow better the film got choppy to me in certain parts and the film seemed to end with a <UNK> not a bang certain parts including the ending played like a tacked on lifetime cable network movie to me i expect more <UNK> cinema br br so where does my <UNK> come in with jamie <UNK> performance overall he did okay not denzel <UNK> malcolm x or angela tina <UNK> spectacular but okay br br sorry folks but to me there were several points in the film where i saw jamie <UNK> interpretation of ray charles and in others thanks to the wonderful camera angles and lighting he looked like ray charles but i paid attention to the acting an actor has to make you believe he is the character he is playing not make a caricature of the character did i believe jamie foxx was ray on the screen sometimes yes sometimes no br br did jamie foxx deserve a golden globe you <UNK> does he deserve an oscar depends on who's he's up against he's got a few major <UNK> there and he might just edge them out but then again maybe not if jamie foxx doesn't win i will not stand up and say he was robbed i wont particularly feel that he had been br br this was a decent film with decent performances and a decent story a great <UNK> film of the late ray charles no somewhere out there i feel there is a great film about ray charles just waiting to be made and an actor that will blow you completely away in doing so
<START> for the sake of propaganda during world war ii sherlock holmes was moved into the then present one of the results is sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starring a top holmes basil <UNK> along with <UNK> bruce lionel <UNK> dennis and <UNK> it is <UNK> assignment to deliver a scientist dr <UNK> william post jr and his weapon design to the british government before the germans can get him once the man reaches england however his troubles are just beginning can holmes <UNK> the message dr left before falling into the hands of the vicious <UNK> save the weapon and possibly the scientist too this is an effective holmes story set in the atmosphere of switzerland and <UNK> england the series worked just fine in the present day it was not without its problems but those problems had nothing to do with the time period whose idea was it to make watson an idiot <UNK> <UNK> characterization aided and <UNK> by the scripts has always been the false note i much prefer the characterization of edward <UNK> in the jeremy brett sherlock holmes series there he's attractive intelligent and a believable companion for holmes in the <UNK> series holmes is often condescending and treats watson like the bumbling fool that he is however in this particular film watson has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts br br i admit to being a complete <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> from richard ii this blessed plot this earth this england i can't imagine how much it meant to the brits watching the film in 1942 sherlock holmes really served his purpose
<START> br br it sucked br br i returned the video after watching half of it not funny br br just a cheap and desperate attempt to cash in on a very very funny original junk forget it don't waste your time etc etc
<START> i don't believe it luc is not only a genius now he has always been one this film is for everyone who likes real good deep films just perfect
<START> i once had a conversation with my parents who told me british cinema goers in the 1940s and 50s would check to see a film's country of origin before going to see it it didn't matter what the plot was or who was in it if it was an american movie people would want to see it and if it was british people wouldn't want to see it this might sound like a ridiculous but after seeing the <UNK> heart i can understand why people in those days preferred american cinema to the home grown variety back in the 1940s br br british <UNK> was devoid of working class members and it shows in this movie everyone speaks in an english <UNK> dee upper class accent that makes the british royal family sound like working class <UNK> and what this does is alienate a large amount of a potential british audience who would no doubt prefer to be watching jimmy cagney in white heat because people would have if not related to then certainly <UNK> with a violent gangster in cinematic terms more than some high class english shrink in 1949 that's entertainment the reason people go to cinemas even the characters names seem bizarre <UNK> how many british people were named <UNK> in 1949 and the protagonists drink <UNK> and they use words like <UNK> you do get the feeling that this wasn't <UNK> for a 1949 mainstream british audience but why should it if the majority of british cinema goers were <UNK> up at cinemas to watch far more entertaining american <UNK> br br watching the heart in 2005 i was <UNK> how dated everything was in fact it's so dated i thought maybe it might be a spoof from the harry show what didn't <UNK> me was the fact that these types of movie came close to sinking the british film industry an industry that didn't pick up until american money invested in crowd <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> and the james bond movies
<START> in a <UNK> key <UNK> can be taken as a mediocre exercise <UNK> gay <UNK> and judy davis a good cast juliette <UNK> new age freaky character has been incredibly taken from reality i know an american young lady who <UNK> like her but <UNK> does not show much beyond its plot br br even though movie making is all about make believe there were certain noticeable screenplay inconsistencies two <UNK> you pay 14 euro to enter the <UNK> where <UNK> and frankie met never at 7 am and you cannot leave a <UNK> without paying the bill they'll charge you on the spot if they don't know you or get off a taxi that quickly you americans always tip even though they don't expect to but the sequences portrayed in the movie were ridiculous don't believe me reader come over and see for yourself br br if you've never been here before you might not care about all this but good movies should be believable <UNK> of your origin nobody knows about <UNK> here and i will make sure that does not change in the future
<START> as the superb prime <UNK> series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all this in itself a considerable achievement ' prime suspect iv the lost <UNK> has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these british dramas but of course the beautiful helen <UNK> easily <UNK> our eyes never leave her while she's on screen br br the search for the lost child of the title leads <UNK> jane <UNK> team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted <UNK> now living with a single mother and her two young daughters the insight we are given into the <UNK> of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini series but it may be too strong for many <UNK> br br the action sequences are brilliantly handled with the hand held camera <UNK> us right into the middle of the excitement and there's gripping tension during the climactic siege br br altogether this is another magnificent police <UNK> drama
<START> it is not always certain that by mixing comedians together you will produce laughter the comics involved have to actually like or admire each other or be willing to put up with each other's go west with the marx brothers had buster keaton write the script as a gag man <UNK> did not think too highly of keaton's ideas and embarrassed him at a script meeting and though some of keaton's gems still appear in the finished film such as the gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun the film was one of the weakest the marx brothers ever made br br a better film but also affected by <UNK> comic <UNK> was w c fields and mae west in my little which <UNK> the script for a series of <UNK> of one liners between the leads but the one liners were equally funny so the film remains a success br br but six of a kind is an example of six film comics who worked well together the reason is simple it is really three comic teams working together charlie and mary <UNK> george burns and <UNK> allan and w c fields and alison and <UNK> were paired in about half a dozen comedies during the 1930s usually with <UNK> as a somewhat <UNK> wife and as a nervous wreck of a husband fields usually a single act was paired three times with <UNK> and gus and if i had a million were the other two times <UNK> always figured out how to control or counter the <UNK> activities of her man it the present film she takes action into her own hands with the stolen money that is being searched for she knows that the local sheriff fields is not the one to trust with this as for burns and allan they manage to effortlessly involve themselves with the put upon and <UNK> on their cross country trip by car br br quickly gets to realize what a mistake it was to agree to travel with <UNK> at one point she manages to cause him to fall off a cliff and <UNK> from a branch he is relatively helpless when she insists on 1 <UNK> him on his <UNK> and 2 his <UNK> the presence of george and <UNK> <UNK> dog ran <UNK> <UNK> is it's name does not make travel <UNK> easier for charlie and mary br br fields has some choice moments when he insists on shouting at the <UNK> he says he's allowed to do so he's the sheriff he also explains during a pool game the improbable story of how he got his <UNK> <UNK> honest john you have to listen carefully to the tale as it is interrupted with his attempts to play pool a few times once getting accidentally by a <UNK> ball but it does show that there were items that even fields would have had no reason to steal br br oh in the summary line i mentioned a forgotten actor named <UNK> page he was the man who is responsible for the trouble that <UNK> is suspected of <UNK> has to have a reason to leave town in order to catch up with the <UNK> and <UNK> so he <UNK> his girl friend he tells her to call back his job and say that he has to leave town because somebody has died there is a pause as he apparently hears a question shot back by the girlfriend anybody he says clearly annoyed although the bulk of the humor in the film is carried by the <UNK> of performers mr page happened to have the most <UNK> unexpected line in the film
<START> <UNK> is a fantastic film noir that is both a product of it's time and a timeless classic this film achieves this by addressing issues that haven't been brought to the screen before its <UNK> release and by being a high quality film that holds up to this day with a good script great look and fantastic performances from it's actors the first american film to take the issue of anti <UNK> head on <UNK> is <UNK> in classic standing set in post world war ii america a lurid <UNK> develops after a jewish man is found murdered br br the story is great its anti hatred theme wrapped up in a dark multiple character crime thriller and along side the anti <UNK> angle is some great post world war ii dialogue and themes as well unlike other mystery thrillers the audience is <UNK> to who the <UNK> is almost immediately however the film's story is still engrossing because of the struggle of all the great characters involved are going through while trying to make sense of the situation outside the great overall story and themes the entire script is simply smart complete with meaningful messages and razor sharp <UNK> between characters br br the film's captivating story is played out wonderfully by the its excellent cast robert young is fantastic as capt <UNK> the leading investigator of the murder case <UNK> my favorite character of the film he's just a cool character dry as bone and tough as a two by four and stopping at nothing to bring the killer to justice robert mitchum is also great in the film very vivid in his soft spoken army sergeant character due to his superb screen presence gloria <UNK> gives a memorable performance in her small oscar nominated role george cooper also does a good job as the sick and <UNK> <UNK> mitchell paul kelly gives an eerie portrayal of a bizarre character and steve <UNK> sam <UNK> <UNK> white and william <UNK> also give strong supporting performances robert ryan ends up being the most talked about performer of the film giving a chilling performance as <UNK> and also being nominated for an oscar br br <UNK> has a terrific look director edward does an extraordinary job with the film's execution and cinematographer j roy hunt does a masterful job with its black and white picture picture is as dark and <UNK> as its themes covered in shadow with an almost glossy <UNK> yet also very raw in parts ironically the film's great look was not the result of hard work or even intention wanted to spend more time and money on the actors rather than the lighting so that's what he did less lights less <UNK> around a 6 hour work day and it resulted in a fantastic looking film not just a well done piece of cinematic art <UNK> is also a great example of a cheap film that ends up a rich classic
<START> one of the <UNK> most strikingly eerie and creepy horror films to come out of the 70's tourist trap even by the loose free <UNK> convention <UNK> anything goes standards of its time rates as a real yet it's the <UNK> very <UNK> a masterfully <UNK> uncanny atmosphere of <UNK> off <UNK> supernatural dread which from the get go <UNK> as <UNK> spooky and becomes more increasingly <UNK> and frightening as the film progresses offering up ample shocks amid a few scattered moments of lovely dream like <UNK> and ending on a <UNK> ironic <UNK> <UNK> note with a haunting final image that's hard to shake which makes it such a unique and <UNK> unnerving experience br br five teenagers traveling through the desolate california desert by car get hopelessly lost they stumble across lost <UNK> a seedy <UNK> <UNK> dive that's one part gas station three parts crummy wax museum and all parts <UNK> and foreboding the lonely seemingly <UNK> and harmless owner <UNK> with <UNK> hammy <UNK> by chuck turns out to be a deranged psychic killer with lethal <UNK> powers brings his freaky assortment of <UNK> human like <UNK> to life and picks off the kids one by one so he can add them to his ever growing collection of victims br br director david the arrival <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> every last ounce of tension he can squeeze from the <UNK> ambiguous and open ended script he co wrote with j larry <UNK> said <UNK> stubborn <UNK> to provide some rational excuse for all the bizarre stuff which <UNK> throughout the movie often wrongly criticized as one of the film's principal weaknesses is actually the movie's key strength giving the picture the scary anything and everything can happen common logic be damned quality of a true nightmare come <UNK> to life which never would have been achieved if there was some kind of credible explanation offered for what's happening <UNK> beautifully chilling understated score nicholas von shadowy cinematography and robert a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> production design add immensely to the film's profoundly unsettling mood excellent performances are another significant plus with the pretty <UNK> <UNK> jones <UNK> jo turner in the great texas dynamite chase particularly fine and <UNK> as the most <UNK> and sympathetic of the <UNK> teens even <UNK> roberts <UNK> well as a <UNK> <UNK> who has a knife <UNK> into her head offbeat and unusual tourist trap is well worth visiting
<START> the three part series ended last night on <UNK> which i believe was its first wide exposure to an american audience the <UNK> of its text and the unique quality of its filming are high points it seems very novel to view and hear an action play <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> england jane <UNK> filmed drawing rooms being the primary example of that form of speech yet it is the scope of drama overwhelming the senses that makes quaint language fit perfectly into each and every scene such bold exposure to an old reality is <UNK> of literary giants like <UNK> or shakespeare while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a c s or patrick <UNK> sea saga the <UNK> of basic human condition lies at its center br br narrator <UNK> as played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of <UNK> surely not even dickens could beat that one <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> and extreme vulnerability an acting tour de force indeed i cannot recall among this very fine cast any <UNK> of interpretation that is a tribute not only to the actors themselves but to the director as well br br the most impressive element however is how perfectly life aboard a man of war en route to australia in the early <UNK> is presented that is especially true of how the motion of the ship becomes almost a character itself something sea stories rarely take into account except as backdrop anyone who has ever experienced <UNK> de <UNK> in person will recognize it instantly and appreciate all the more how difficult it must have been to recreate within the context of filming br br this is no <UNK> pirates of the <UNK> some effort must be <UNK> in <UNK> an understanding of its nuances
<START> robert downey jr in a <UNK> century wig and dress was enough to make me <UNK> but i couldn't believe a great actor like sam <UNK> actually took a part in this movie the whole thing was unbelievable i especially like cure for the <UNK> they dance and hey <UNK> everyone's happy and they're all better i guess i just didn't like the character too much therefore watching a whole movie about his supposed transition from a <UNK> <UNK> into a great <UNK> was <UNK> br br also i'm not entirely sure but i didn't think the plague as well as the famous fire of london took place simultaneously
<START> it's a deeply stupid humor but i loved it jean is a great actor in this movie is cute it makes fun of all the secret agents like james bond refreshing it's probably the most hilarious movie i've ever seen i already saw it three times and i still want to see it again buy the dvd as soon as you can you won't regret it it's the kind of movie in which you don't need to have a great scenario because it's a parody the only <UNK> is that <UNK> <UNK> is too short it's a jewel it's not really frequent to see a french movie get success in the usa but i think that this one has everything to succeed trust me
<START> first i would like to admit that <UNK> was not my cup of tea this movie was evidently not targeted toward the masses it's the type that critics would enjoy watching the hype and publicity were quite misleading br br i was expecting something very dramatic like <UNK> understanding that the story and time period demand it i found the movie extremely slow paced br br i'm a die hard <UNK> fan and i regret to say that i thought she was miscast the role of <UNK> required an actress who can portray herself as <UNK> not innocent and naive everyone else gave a good performance depiction of the human condition does come across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme
<START> well to start off i was like wow this is new so when is the film starting and out of this in between stuff but it never ended the film is just one big in between and after 10 minutes of waiting for something to actually happen apart from water <UNK> around i just started getting angry there is nothing in this <UNK> and nothing will be learned completely boring and rubbish
<START> ed wood is rolling over in his grave he could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this waste hole the worst script in memory it makes x men 3 <UNK> like citizen kane the most amateur directing pre k cinematography the <UNK> special effects i'm talking about friday the 13th sequel territory and throw in a pointless revolting deeply disturbed <UNK> ward sequence the lack of any talent or sensibility that put this garbage on screen is astounding that the industry might reward anyone involved in this celluloid <UNK> pool with future projects ought to be cause for serious alarm
<START> a fascinating <UNK> of the <UNK> cultural political aura of the late 60s taking in the class struggle as well which ironically in view of its outdated and occasionally embarrassing conservative views makes full use of the that <UNK> for a while in mainstream cinema and which came about as a direct result of the liberal attitude it <UNK> to criticize norman <UNK> <UNK> oscar nominated script is superbly <UNK> by peter boyle in a <UNK> performance who manages to make his <UNK> down to earth yet <UNK> and <UNK> character with a barely disguised fascist streak which comes to the <UNK> in the remarkable violent conclusion likable even admirable indeed he comes across <UNK> like a <UNK> version of the young marlon brando similar to other generation gap movies of its era like taking off 1971 and hardcore 1978 but also <UNK> vigilante films like death wish 1974 and taxi driver 1976 interestingly enough two of these also feature boyle joe ultimately emerges as an engrossing and powerful drama which could have been a masterpiece if it had had a more experienced director at the <UNK>
<START> it's nice to see julie andrews trying a straight dramatic role here something she hadn't done in awhile but her character of <UNK> wise they didn't try to pass her off as a has the old <UNK> manners and <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and andrews <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as any other actress would interpret <UNK> it's a surprisingly bland drama set in <UNK> involving omar <UNK> not the <UNK> leading man around not even in 1974 hoping to make andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom <UNK> outing does have some camp value the james bond like credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot as for julie she's quiet and <UNK> but that doesn't do much for the audience or for the film blake <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> thing like a funeral from
<START> i don't know if i should be amused or insulted by drivel like this put out by lifetime television for women should be <UNK> lifetime television for shut in drama queens because i've yet to see a movie that wasn't a tear <UNK> pot <UNK> this film was no exception you know a film's going to be bad when the biggest <UNK> is <UNK> spelling completely a creation of bad plastic surgery and spoiled <UNK> minus any real talent everyone else matched her in unbelievably bad acting and the storyline was beyond dumb as if anyone could believe any of it if i hadn't have been helpless on the <UNK> <UNK> down watching with the same fascination you view a gory car wreck i would have changed the channel
<START> this is a cult classic for sure br br it is <UNK> to follow at times but then again so is a film like <UNK> ladder or even say fight club if you want standard fare then i figure go rent the care bears movie or perhaps an old disney classic but if you want to view the world differently then i would say open yourself up to and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think br br for me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout so while i have seen some complaints all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy
<START> i bought this <UNK> from a gas station in the 3 99 bin for one reason billy <UNK> who is one of my favorite actors he is <UNK> creepy and good but that's where it stops the movie itself is a dirt cheap <UNK> awful attempt at a horror western and manages neither never mind a successful <UNK> of the two genres the acting besides <UNK> is so bad i wanted to put the couch <UNK> over my ears the production values are nonexistent and the script i don't even know where to start br br avoid at all costs unless you are a die hard <UNK> fan like me br br terrible shameful unforgivable
<START> it's a shame that they didn't trust the original enough to build on it br br but <UNK> 2 takes the great ideas imagination and characters of the original and <UNK> them with all the stereotypes that sequels have to offer br br the beginning commercial was cute and so was the scene that follows reminiscent of the beginning in guys and dolls but aside from a flash of thought here and there this is one film that is a slow dirty <UNK> down into the middle of nowhere br br ideas are introduced then dropped interesting characters from the original hardly get any screen time here most of the new characters cain juliette are so boring that they wouldn't hold up no matter what the movie and then there's the tone br br in the blessed original paul verhoeven knew how to direct with the kind of attitude where if you <UNK> up the attitude and the sensibility of a good pulp comic even the most <UNK> violence would be entertaining <UNK> although he did direct a star wars sequel doesn't and scene after scene either makes you cringe look away or just tune it out altogether br br and what's with <UNK> he should be the main thing here right but there's whole scenes where he doesn't even show up and what scenes he is in are so half thought and <UNK> written that you don't know or care if he's part human or part cyborg since he's all boring br br never have i seen such a rapid fall from grace why does hollywood make such bad sequels on purpose why did the film makers have a bet going br br only one star for <UNK> 2 the fx are good but the story doesn't even try to match them
<START> chan is in new york and he gets involved with an attempt to <UNK> a new aircraft design br br the war was over a year away from reaching america but the second world war was already raging everywhere else in the world and so it colored everything since most people probably realized that war was coming here the war isn't mentioned but the fact that the film deals with the production of planes at the very least <UNK> to it the mystery itself is pretty good it the notion of plane <UNK> lends itself nicely to a couple of rather tense moments to be certain we are talking about charlie chan so we can be certain that he would live to fight another day but there was no guarantee what condition he would be in not whether anyone around him would survive br br i really like this film a great deal its not one of the nest and far from the worst it is one of the truly rare things a truly enjoyable one definitely worth a look or six
<START> i watched the movie with tears and smiles <UNK> anger in me to see the ruin of <UNK> after the 12 day <UNK> and by living in the country right now with my parents who's been living in <UNK> for 50 years i understand that we're much better off now and would have been better if the american didn't bring war here watching the movie i learned more of the different kinds of wars that the america planned in vietnam and what disasters they caused br br the series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people but i don't like it that some people only give generic opinions like the <UNK> near the end of the series i forgot his name br br there should also be more documentary images like the life in the army camp of the south vietnam and those of the north if possible there's also a sudden change from the year of 1972 to 1975 i'm not sure if the in between was <UNK> because i watched this series on tv
<START> from the <UNK> imagination which brought you the irresistible <UNK> 1983 comes its even more preposterous read <UNK> sequel right off the bat we get another <UNK> beginning of time prologue which even <UNK> to completely <UNK> these same events as set up in the first film a <UNK> montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a superman like <UNK> credits sequence narrative wise here we have four rebellious gods who steal seven all important but poorly animated  a crime which for one thing sets the moon <UNK> on a <UNK> course with planet earth faster than you can say <UNK> <UNK> once again played as a white haired <UNK> man by the relatively young <UNK> <UNK> sends his champion  who has now rightfully taken his place among the elite thanks to one <UNK> the almighty tasks performed in the first film  to find his <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> in store br br no sooner has <UNK> lou <UNK>  as if you didn't know touched the <UNK> surface that he comes in contact with two attractive <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in need of his getting them out of distress the former who would go on to become an italian tv personality seemingly has the ability to talk with the little people  which look <UNK> like the tiny sisters from godzilla vs <UNK> 1964 just so they can <UNK> as much footage from the first film as is <UNK> possible the divine <UNK> of villains <UNK> good ol' king william <UNK> again from his <UNK> <UNK> and pit him once more against his eternal enemy typically <UNK> is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly <UNK> including a <UNK>  an awfully <UNK> sequence which ought to have led to a <UNK> <UNK> suit had the film makers behind the much superior clash of the <UNK> 1981 bothered to watch this flick complete with the same reflection in a shield come <UNK> and <UNK> by the <UNK> letting the audience in on his tactics before <UNK> them as if to show us how clever he is and just to make it crystal clear that he wears his influences on his <UNK> has <UNK> and turn into a <UNK> version of king kong vs godzilla for one of their battles and later still king kong gets to grips with a large snake an encounter lifted straight out of the classic 1933 original i swear it this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth br br as had been the case with the first film the cast is full of old <UNK> like the <UNK> mentioned <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> with a truly bad hair day and up and coming <UNK>  not just <UNK> but also maria as a younger <UNK> <UNK> pamela and once again eva robbins whose costume here easily her appearance in the first film for what it's worth <UNK> score for this one is recycled from musical <UNK> featured in his soundtrack for the previous film if you have stuck with this review so far you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take either dismiss it in one <UNK> sentence or spend an <UNK> amount of time <UNK> its flaws i'm sure i've left out some of its but i wouldn't forgive myself if i failed to mention the single greatest laugh out loud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair yes it even <UNK> the <UNK> mentioned animated titanic duel for me namely the <UNK> of the rebellious <UNK> <UNK> which is in the shape of a giant br br at this stage one might well wonder why i gave this film and its predecessor a rating instead of a not entirely <UNK> bomb in the past i've had various <UNK> online discussions on whether one's star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality or its sheer entertainment but these are two instances where i deemed it necessary to be <UNK> influenced by the latter in <UNK> on my final rating i don't know maybe it's because i'm in a sword and <UNK> state of mind at the moment with some 10 more respectable examples <UNK> for the coming days but after all <UNK> for me i decided to add these two films to my dvd collection simply based on the fun i had with them in this recent <UNK>  and that alone must count for something no
<START> the seven ups seems like a replay of the french connection which was released two years prior both the late roy <UNK> and tony lo <UNK> make appearances as well as stunt driver bill <UNK> br br but we aren't dealing with french drug baddies instead we are dealing with a war against <UNK> <UNK> and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a <UNK> we get to see <UNK> and a pre 1990s new york city br br i love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action and it is a reminder of a <UNK> time that said when one <UNK> the car chases mr <UNK> had involvement in the three most compared this movie <UNK> and the french connection each chase scene has its own qualities and this one is simply superb br br and i am glad this title has seen the light of day on dvd
<START> the director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west <UNK> too bad the producers and writer director michael <UNK> spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the johnson county war was really about a lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for <UNK> the <UNK> didn't want the poor sheep on the land to compete for on this cold <UNK> <UNK> the entire epic makes no mention of <UNK> sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war br br the worst scene is the battle between the <UNK> and the hired killers the <UNK> are shown <UNK> the <UNK> like a bunch of indians would do in much earlier hollywood movies the true fact is that johnson county sheriff william red <UNK> with a <UNK> of 200 to 300 men <UNK> the <UNK> and trapped them in a <UNK> at the <UNK> ranch i doubt any women took part in the siege br br ellen ella also known as cattle kate watson and her second husband james were <UNK> by a lynch mob about three years before the johnson county invasion ella was never a prostitute this was a spread by the <UNK> stock <UNK> association in order to <UNK> her the fact that the plot makes her out to be a <UNK> <UNK> only serves the interests of the br br i object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction there is no fact in the events time lines or backgrounds of the characters why michael <UNK> would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the johnson county war and events leading up to it is beyond me br br the movie could have been much more interesting if it had <UNK> on the political <UNK> of the federal government <UNK> in a state <UNK> affairs and what happened after the <UNK> were saved by the <UNK> some effort was made to <UNK> the <UNK> who were responsible by the johnson county attorney but since johnson county could not afford the court costs and the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> w <UNK> backed the the charges were eventually dropped br br overall i think the movie was just an excuse to show isabelle <UNK> naked for much of the three and 3 4 hours of running time on the dvd version
<START> the first 2 3 of this film wasn't that <UNK> to the american mummy films of the 30s and 40s two lovers in ancient mexico <UNK> to defy the law and were doomed to die one became an aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love and the lady was <UNK> in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her so far it's all the typical mummy film though it's quite a bit slower and <UNK> than the american versions oh and of course the aztec mummy looked really really crappy br br however into this standard but boring film there is a super villain why i <UNK> it sure didn't make any sense to have one it seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to <UNK> the lady and have her show them where the aztec treasure is buried why does he need the treasure well to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots <UNK> but first he has to <UNK> a single mummy to defeat the mummy as the mummy has so far been <UNK> br br you've got to see these human robots as they look like the enormous clunky robots from flash gordon and other serials but they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside they really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the <UNK> mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie both battle in super slow motion like they are <UNK> in <UNK> and it's done in such an <UNK> and silly fashion that it is bound to <UNK> chuckles certainly not thrills br br overall the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled mess especially at the end however for bad movie fans it's a must see it's bad but unintentionally funny and great to watch and laugh at with friends
<START> if you find the depiction of violent murders and <UNK> police brutality expressed in a plot less film with <UNK> pacing entertaining then you're bound to enjoy <UNK> this film was garbage for both the mind and spirit the notion that this is a thriller is comical that would imply some kind of tension and twists you kept waiting for the story to actually finish starting it never rises above a <UNK> of weak minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life picture all of the violence of no country for old men without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters thrill killers run amok the acting is good mostly but the script is a pile don't bother and tell your friends to don't bother
<START> this movie features a pretty decent fx sequence of an <UNK> for 1936 the reason you haven't seen it is because audiences in the 30s were <UNK> of the <UNK> macdonald picture in which the eponymous star her way through countless songs while plots came to a complete <UNK> the fx cross time very well <UNK> songs do not and the awkward <UNK> of said songs to show off her only typical talent is not good br br the <UNK> device of two friends growing up to become a priest and a <UNK> is given another run through the <UNK> manhattan melodrama the <UNK> at the 30 minute mark you've already heard the song <UNK> three times entertainment in the thirties is generally an <UNK> of <UNK> only grand hotel from the decade <UNK> annoyance to the degree shown in san francisco dinner at 8 little <UNK> <UNK> all quiet on the western front les <UNK> etc
<START> naked city does a pretty good job of <UNK> its two a b stories <UNK> i'm not all that fond of multiple plot movies and scott <UNK> and <UNK> b vance make a great on screen <UNK> however i'm not sure what kind of message a movie sends when two flat foot country girls can get off scott free with murder grand <UNK> and to top it off win a free flight home in first class no less at least from the looks of their <UNK> anyway gee i guess that blue wall of silence is still rather think br br rating 8
<START> meryl streep as kate a woman dying of cancer performs her role admirably no wonder she was up for an oscar in the part she proves that caring and <UNK> <UNK> are just as important as their sisters out in the business world and the lesson she teaches about life's expectations and their lack of <UNK> as the relationship grows that is the most important thing she teaches her daughter we can expect too much of our mates realize that there are many slips and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life this is a <UNK> movie and the ending though sad shows <UNK> between the father and daughter i give this one a ten
<START> this movie was a modern day scarface it had me on my <UNK> this movie is one of those rare epic films that makes you want a sequel i especially liked <UNK> his performance deserved an academy award which he deserved for his performance in blood in blood out the only thing i didn't like was the behind the scenes because it didn't show the intensity that the movie had and i would have like to have seen less narrated scenes but the movie was great and it is in my top ten movies of all time plus the acting was great there wasn't a bad scene in the movie i loved it jennifer <UNK> was perfect as well as all of the cast i can't see how anyone wouldn't like this movie it was a great definitely a must see
<START> never having read or seen the <UNK> original work i can't begin to compare this work to his story so i won't instead i will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects and some that looked a little lower in budget but still decent enough to enjoy i thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing the style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing but i thought it was well done
<START> at first sight the <UNK> man seems like several other movies books rolled into one <UNK> the trial <UNK> <UNK> the fall and rise of <UNK> and <UNK> day instantly spring to mind a man <UNK> arrives in a <UNK> city where he is immediately given a job in an office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend however there's a catch his colleagues are all friendly bland and utterly <UNK> and everyone he knows including his girlfriend seems to have only one topic of conversation interior design welcome to the hell of modern <UNK> in which people throw themselves from buildings and no one raises an <UNK> or spend their days reading furniture <UNK> and eating food that tastes of nothing br br <UNK> quickly realises his <UNK> and spends the rest of the film trying to escape in various ways suicide turns out not to be an option and when he finds a new girlfriend she is just as <UNK> of feelings as the old one there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to move in with him and all she can say is 'i don't <UNK> br br in fact much of what the <UNK> man has to say has been said before and after about 45 minutes you begin to feel that you indeed are experiencing a certain sense of <UNK> <UNK> yet its point is one that is probably worth repeating over and over again an <UNK> life is one that is not worth living added to which it provides a decidedly modern take on the <UNK> theme of how capitalism is destroying our souls more than one character reminded me of people i've known especially his furniture obsessed girlfriend and if by the end of the film the film makers have run out of ideas maybe that's the point there will no end unless you can find other people who share your sense of alienation
<START> <UNK> delivers a semi believable part as the president of the united states with politically correct maria <UNK> <UNK> as the female vice president the movie just stinks with so many plot holes its a wonder they got it to stick to the film it was shot on <UNK> to late night hbo time <UNK> this film is not worth seeing at all 10 minutes into it you are asking yourself why it was written 40 minutes into it you are wondering why you are watching it save the effort and watch a re run of <UNK> <UNK> or something anything is better than this <UNK>
<START> in a nutshell skip this movie it's that bad in short this movie is about a weapons factory where secret weapons are being developed because they make bad things they aren't popular so to speak a new female <UNK> comes in to clear things up and make sure the reputation of the company will be improved she does this by <UNK> company <UNK> information to the press do you believe this furthermore she starts to fire people she has never seen incredible uh a <UNK> group tries to destroy the <UNK> <UNK> because there are the <UNK> located of those secret weapons this <UNK> is located in the bottom of the building hidden in a kind of vault of course the movie would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot which is the ultimate killer machine which resembles like an <UNK> from the alien movies the mad scientist likes the female <UNK> br br the mad scientist <UNK> the robot to kill everyone and so <UNK> his job rise in chain of command and make the movie interesting the <UNK> team up with the <UNK> and another person of the board of directors to escape from the robot further down the line they agree to blow up this evil computer <UNK> whilst avoiding the robot they also discover that the factory was developing a part man part machine soldier they can <UNK> a persons memory and replace it by a veteran <UNK> one one of the <UNK> is transformed in such a soldier and will hunt the killer robot i guess the mad scientist also wrote the script of this movie this super soldier looks and acts much the same as <UNK> though not as funny br br it <UNK> down to this people are running being chased by a killer robot are hurt by it but they do not seem to troubled by that besides <UNK> a bit and of course the female <UNK> is the leading character of this movie and cannot be killed i e survives every attack explosion you name it i won't bother you by the chase let's skip to the end they have lots of weapons yes the <UNK> too and they know how to use them when they're at the roof of the building they empty all there weapons upon the killer robot they step into an elevator which is used to clean outside windows and then the female <UNK> knows some magic as well at the roof she was complaining about being out of bullets and like magic the gun is <UNK> this way she can shoot the <UNK> and let the elevator <UNK> 70 stories or so and let it stop right above ground surface by pulling the <UNK> and to top it all off the police is waiting there for them the robot jumps after them and kills the cops hilarious no the robot chases them down the vault where the <UNK> is and when finally the robot is so close to her that he can touch kill her it stops because the mad scientist did not want her to be killed a better name for this guy would be the idiot scientist although he is the one who made this movie watchable at this moment i was already pulling for the killer robot to finish them all of so the movie would end br br i cannot believe that this movie rates this high and this is why i wrote this comment avoid this movie like the plague it's a monster and i'm not talking about the death machine
<START> this movie is funny in more ways than one it's got action it's got humour it's got attitude it's got <UNK> all girl army of kung fu and that's just what the movie offers as a film it's also badly acted by some the <UNK> makes more than one cameo appearance and some punches miss by feet but when you make a movie this cool who's got time to pay attention to those details this movie rocks rent it tonight if you can find it i had to buy it to see it but i don't regret it
<START> cowardly and cynical the represents the <UNK> of <UNK> special brand of celebration of the status <UNK> disguised as satire br br thanks to ham handed director arthur <UNK> this ludicrous script gets the visually ugly poorly paced presentation it deserves br br only a great performance by george c scott in the sort of mean spirited role he was born to play keeps the from being a complete disaster br br ironically though scott's performance does viewers a <UNK> his <UNK> keeps them watching when they might more turn off the vcr and clean out the <UNK> stare at the clouds or watch re runs of <UNK> ' br br certainly anyone who emotionally <UNK> in the set up modern medicine apparently gone amok will feel cheated by the dismal payoff where reveals that the system works just fine so quit your <UNK> br br while the first half of this film provides some entertaining black comedy it all turns out to be a red <UNK> before that becomes clear though gives some good lines to scott as his middle aged middle class white male stand in br br bitter alcoholic <UNK> scott's dr herbert has <UNK> those who know him best and he has the <UNK> to keep <UNK> them in <UNK> all that of course makes a <UNK> for a hippie chick half his age br br playing a collection of <UNK> the long haired long <UNK> and almost bust less diana <UNK> struggles in the part of the girl ' the british <UNK> is miscast as a <UNK> free spirit but any other actress would struggle as well like the rest of a good cast gone to waste <UNK> can't overcome a script that isn't interested in any character except or any philosophy beyond <UNK> br br for fans of george c scott this is another star turn and worth watching for fans of black comedy turn it off after the first 45 minutes for anyone else don't bother
<START> maybe this <UNK> them in the 50's but this is one of those flicks that doesn't age well it's got that preachy earnest <UNK> working man vibe of a 2nd rate rod <UNK> live tv <UNK> broadcast the plot is by the book the <UNK> character's troubled background seems tacked on and the love interest is unconvincing and half hearted br br sidney gives an ok performance but man he sure was an annoying <UNK> <UNK> if i had to work with this guy in a warehouse i'd probably want to hit him with a <UNK> hook too jack warden is good because as usual he plays jack warden br br like 90 of the films rated on imdb whether they are classics mediocre or <UNK> somehow this one gets rated with 7 point some stars it is in no way deserving of that save your time
<START> i am almost a two decade old human who's been reading comics most of my life i'm not a huge fan of the fantastic four but i'm fairly familiar with them in 1994 roger corman b movie legend produced the first i think feature length fantastic four film the result was such pure schlock that it was never given a release still copies exist mostly on the net and at conventions if you're looking for a laugh and can find a copy do yourself a favor and check this thing out br br the film basically <UNK> the origin and an encounter with doctor doom and a villain named the essentially the mole man with a <UNK> for petty <UNK> as is the case with these comic book movies everything has to tie into everything so the <UNK> play a vital role in dr <UNK> creation and he and the play a vital role in theirs br br first i'd just like to mention that despite everything that went bad in this movie i actually sort of liked the guy that played doom he doesn't get many decent lines but when he does he hits them the armor looks pretty good too br br as for the rest it's a dirty dirty mess bad plots bad acting bad effects bad everything basically <UNK> especially to jay <UNK> bringing new meaning to the word overacting as johnny storm he's not overacting he's br br as for the <UNK> well they all sort of look right and <UNK> played by a very attractive actress but they just don't seem like a real team for one thing they have no reason for sue and johnny to go into space in an early section ben and reed go to visit the two <UNK> like 8 and <UNK> about 12 it only stands to make their eventual romantic pairing a <UNK> lot <UNK> the thing costume looks more <UNK> than anything else not very rocky and the only time the human torch is really a human torch he looks like the silver <UNK> <UNK> red br br i could type for hours but i think the scene that best sums it up is a climactic encounter featuring the aforementioned not so human torch he's racing a laser <UNK> and he eventually destroys it with a punch yes a punch a laser <UNK> with a punch then he flies around and goes a whole lot <UNK> the camera <UNK> down and he flies back toward earth evidently reed the intellectual forgot to inform johnny that fire doesn't exist in the <UNK> of space this and many other scenes operate like looney if the character doesn't know they are over a cliff they don't fall br br i laughed i cried i was glad it was never released
<START> this all but ignored masterpiece is about the <UNK> becoming aware that they are fictional characters in a movie head and that everything they do or say had already been written in an unseen script they seem to be following head was written by jack nicholson and peter during a three day <UNK> trip in a <UNK> at an expensive hollywood hotel the other three <UNK> only acted in it br br they fight this every way they can by doing things not in the script they deliberately <UNK> their lines walk off sets tear up scenery punch other actors for no reason and ultimately commit suicide by jumping off a bridge br br for instance in the rapid flashes of a psychedelic party scene if you watch frame by frame you can see sitting next to the camera and cameraman very deliberately shooting into a mirror he is revealing that the party is actually fake and is being shot in a studio with actors who suddenly drop out of character and walk away in the middle of a conversation when the director yells cut br br the <UNK> however never drop out of character because those characters are also who they really are that ends up being the core of the revelation soon to come br br at every turn they realize their increasingly bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the scripted film they can't escape being in you say they went crazy and walked through the sky which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as the <UNK> background no problem hey hey they're the <UNK> and those wacky guys just keep around br br in the end even their deaths did not set them free that was how the movie was supposed to end and their <UNK> <UNK> bodies are <UNK> out of the river put in another box and <UNK> in a film studio warehouse until the characters are needed again for another studio production br br this is made all the more poignant by the fact that the <UNK> really are fictional characters who forced themselves into the real world they did it through the power of their music br br ironically near the end peter has what he rightly sees as a hugely profound revelation that <UNK> their problem but unfortunately no one <UNK> br br peter realizes it doesn't matter if we're in the box the film he means that it doesn't matter if will is free or <UNK> and that the only important thing is that you just let the present moment occur and occur you need to just let happen as it happens without <UNK> or <UNK> or judging whether the experience is valid by some abstract definition br br when you can't even tell the difference will being free or not doesn't matter <UNK> to figure out if you are the real you is just a pointless waste of time br br i saw this film at a very important time in my life i was trying to figure out how to escape being just that geeky creepy nerd girl by thinking about it intensely instead of just having fun i e sex like everyone else did but the revelation in head broke my self <UNK> <UNK> trap and helped me more than or nicholson or will ever know br br for decades i've watched head and wished i could thank pete br br was this a good movie br br <UNK> how about like br br yes
<START> i saw this movie in the early 1990's when it had been out on vhs for a little while at the time i found it to be interesting and was especially struck by the ken russell segment with the visions of the accident victim in <UNK> and surgery br br last night at a 2nd run showing of the latest indiana jones movie the vision of john hurt <UNK> an unexpected flashback to <UNK> which i had not thought of in years and the sudden memory of the russell piece itself was enough to cause an <UNK> of tears for a little bit br br if i can make this observation i note with interest the love hate reaction that people have expressed to the russell segment and i have found this interesting difference in other movies that delve into deep trauma and its <UNK> some get it others do not interesting br br i see by the comments and the rating that the overall work hit people in various ways this is how it affected and affects me
<START> this was a rather unnerving look at an ostensibly <UNK> family confronted by their daughter's <UNK> boyfriend father <UNK> with and ultimately kills <UNK> boyfriend <UNK> in guilt he reveals to a drunk redneck what he has done things spiral rapidly out of hand before <UNK> completely the ending you dread stalks the viewer throughout but is still able to <UNK> when it finally arrives
<START> getting eaten by a bunch of snakes is more entertaining than this film getting eaten by a bunch of snakes is more entertaining than this film getting eaten by a bunch of snakes is more entertaining than this film getting eaten by a bunch of snakes is more entertaining than this film getting eaten by a bunch of snakes is more entertaining than this film getting eaten by a bunch of snakes is more entertaining than this film getting eaten by a bunch of snakes is more entertaining than this film getting eaten by a bunch of snakes is more entertaining than this film getting eaten by a bunch of snakes is more entertaining than this film getting eaten by a bunch of snakes is more entertaining than this film
<START> maverick director <UNK> <UNK> finally was able to film his dream project princess <UNK> and in a way it's lucky he didn't try this in the 1960's special effects and computer graphics certain made this sort of production easier to achieve than the old film <UNK> technology would have br br some <UNK> with japanese history and theatrical traditions will help with the enjoyment of this film much as <UNK> with shakespeare's the <UNK> would help with peter <UNK> dense <UNK> books these two films actually have a bit in common although princess <UNK> is much more colorful and easier to watch for someone without the background to fully appreciate it br br while the art design acting and direction are fine for most of the film it seems to this viewer that the energy runs out in the last third of the film most of the interesting sets have been already been introduced and the camera seems to step back for more of a filmed stage play experience br br this is certainly a unique film experience and i recommend it to anyone who is interested in alternate forms of film performance it's not really meant for children although nothing happens that would upset them if the last third was better i would have given it nine stars
<START> dire beyond belief obviously set on the <UNK> of man <UNK> as the us very badly and full of cut rate british actors who can't do american accents a monster that looks like an <UNK> cut out for alien from a movie store with the most <UNK> feet ever seen girls in the shower <UNK> blah blah blah you get the idea don't watch it run away hide avoid
<START> robin williams is a national treasure specially when he cuts loose and puts aside his <UNK> approach to drama he manages to <UNK> up the usual restrained pacing of barry <UNK> and there are moments in this film when he truly shines br br as the funny elected american president in man of the year williams <UNK> the hilarity and <UNK> that used to be associated with him what makes him so appealing is his humanity and <UNK> here is a man who can <UNK> at his audience but truly loves them too his humour is like <UNK> wire and yet it is <UNK> it is what makes him very appealing to the people in the film and in real life br br laura <UNK> is once again portraying an intelligent woman in distress she is a fabulous and very talented performer but i think she has <UNK> into a stereotype and unfortunately it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case walken pretty much walks through his <UNK> role and the climatic scene in the snl skit barely <UNK> above water br br go in for a few hilarious moments and those are priceless enjoy williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise entertaining movie
<START> i have to say that this movie was not what i expected even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with with the title ruins you would think that out of 3000 years that some kind of <UNK> or ancient animal or god would be the <UNK> this is like another movie <UNK> where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most but not a crocodile either way this film was like that it <UNK> you to think about ruins of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect but plants come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd as for this movie it will hit the <UNK> list in no time i have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see but it didn't make up for the rest of the film and a plant <UNK> a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am a fan of horror films but i am not a <UNK> <UNK> fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects i do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense the thing had a better story line than this did even the ring had me jumping for more but the ruins is just that ruined for using a plant to <UNK> victims into killing or be killed by the villagers the premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of <UNK> can easily do the trick to end those <UNK> plants with a flesh eating disorder
<START> a <UNK> crime drama with a good amount of action the unique nyc location shots adds to this tough little film technically well done with good direction and acting needless to say the wild car chase that seems to begin in downtown <UNK> through the upper west side washington heights across the george washington bridge and into <UNK> has to be one of the best ever on film all around a fine flick that for me gets better with time 8 out of 10 easy
<START> that's right we've got a 2008 film using themes of brief encounter and the bridges of madison county it's basically the story of lost loves redemption and a triumph of the human spirit br br the performances by richard gere and especially diane lane are very good gere gives the kind of restrained performance here as a doctor who is searching for meaning after a patient dies on the operating table lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a nice young son who has split from her wandering husband and has also <UNK> the loss of her father in the same year br br scott glenn steals the show in a one scene meeting with gere he is the <UNK> husband and he <UNK> his love to his <UNK> wife it will bring tears to your eyes br br fresh from her triumph as an mother in doubt <UNK> davis appears as an understanding friend in the film and literally hangs her hair down in a rather <UNK> performance
<START> to answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked the name of the u s official mentioned in the name of the character is mr <UNK> frank <UNK> is reported as having been at that time second secretary at the u s <UNK> in the <UNK> subsequently among other <UNK> he was <UNK> u s <UNK> to <UNK> deputy director of the central intelligence agency secretary of defense and is now the <UNK> of the <UNK> group it's hardly surprising that <UNK> sketch on his www com web site fails to credit his service in the <UNK> <UNK> if his name was deliberately <UNK> from the hbo version of it may have been to avoid the possibility of <UNK> being <UNK> in u s <UNK> name however is clearly mentioned in the theatre version of that i saw recently in the event i expect that he would deny any involvement in murder br br others have commented on the <UNK> with which the film treats the parties concerned supporters other even <UNK> a somewhat more sinister view emerges i think from the bbc documentary entitled who killed based on the book the murder of by <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> when examined closely these films demonstrate that the fate of and the history of the <UNK> is not just a matter of black and white only murderers believe that
<START> it is the best movie released in bollywood <UNK> date the best comedy the best acting and the best direction till now <UNK> <UNK> writing and direction proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry <UNK> khan was absolutely amazing salman khan looked good the way he acted <UNK> kapoor was good but over acted as usual this comedy is still copied by people and no other writers and directors have been able to make this thing again even <UNK> <UNK> hasn't been able to make this cult classic again this movie was a flop when it released but it has been a cult classic since it released and loved by all kinds of people br br star br br acting 10 10 br br dialogues 10 10 br br screenplay 10 10 br br direction 10 10 br br music 9 10 br br lyrics 9 10 br br overall this movie is strongly recommended if you didn't watch it till now you missed something big it is a laugh riot and the best comedy i have seen till date classic films like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> do are not even half as funny as this br br great movie hats off
<START> oh my god this is so idiotic completely pointless offensive and repulsive why do the writers have such a problem with actually getting <UNK> and chase together we all want them too in normal shows there's actually more than one plot conflict in the show wow what a concept also you cant even tell the <UNK> 101 episodes apart from each other because the same thing happens every time quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing nicole is <UNK> and stupid <UNK> is just kinda there chase <UNK> after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice and logan is a jerk repeat quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing nicole is <UNK> and stupid <UNK> is just kinda there chase <UNK> after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice and logan is a jerk repeat it's like a <UNK> bottle and the end of the movie <UNK> again so pointless nothing happens it's like they specifically designed it so that the movie could fit between any two episodes of the show and the show would go completely <UNK> after the movie plot
<START> retro puppet master starts in during 1944 where puppet master andre <UNK> guy <UNK> his living puppets plan to escape germany hold up in an <UNK> puppet master <UNK> <UNK> about his early life the point at which he learned the secret of giving life to dead objects way back in <UNK> in paris when his younger self greg ran the he describes the <UNK> night when he met a 3000 year old egyptian <UNK> named jack <UNK> the eventual love of hi life the young beautiful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he tells the story of how passed the gift of life to himself gave life to his own wooden puppets that were part of the theatre show however the gift of life was also a curse as the ancient god whom the secret was stolen from in the first place by wants it back everyone who has <UNK> it dead br br as of late i have been on a bit of a puppet master <UNK> as being a big fan of the first three i decided to watch the rest of the franchise as such i have seen puppet master 4 1993 puppet master 5 the final chapter 1994 curse of the puppet master 1998 now retro puppet master in the space of a couple of weeks boy was it tough to get through them all especially this one as it's the worse of the series so far retro puppet master feels like a cross between puppet master iii <UNK> revenge 1991 with it's period setting puppet master 4 puppet master 5 the final chapter with trying to kill everyone associated with his stolen life giving secret there's not much continuity here either again there's none of the green serum featured in the earlier films despite andre <UNK> committing suicide in 1939 at the start of the original <UNK> 1989 he is seen alive well during 1944 in this the majority of the story is told as a flashback concentrates on andre <UNK> himself rather than the puppets the film focuses on his relationship with <UNK> him learning the secret of life it's all rather dull tedious stuff to be honest even at only 80 odd minutes retro puppet master feels long padded with no real pace the no central concept as the plot never really <UNK> down generally <UNK> around a lot then of course there's the <UNK> decision to totally <UNK> the puppets which i found incredible i mean why would the makers take the one basic thing that made the puppet master films so memorable completely do away with it the puppets are seen briefly at the start the end but otherwise we get these <UNK> looking wooden caricatures that are nowhere near as cool as their modern re <UNK> it's never even explained why these puppets were used rather than the ones all puppet master fans have come to love although one suspects that full moon was hoping to make yet another sequel which dealt with that very question br br if a poor story a complete lack of our favourite puppets wasn't bad enough full moon decided to go with a pg 13 rating for this making retro puppet master the only puppet master film not rated <UNK> in the us obviously other countries have their own film ratings systems therefore there's not a single drop of blood in the entire film the puppets don't kill anyone there's no swearing no nudity either this is <UNK> than tame kids stuff all the way besides the puppets themselves being rubbish the special effect are the of the series too there's no stop motion animation at all in this one no cgi computer effects surely in 1999 cgi was cheap enough all the effects are of the stiff rod puppet type effects i mean whenever you see a puppet the camera is always <UNK> above it's wait so it's legs don't have to be shown there's obviously some production assistant just pushing the thing along that's as complex state of the art as the special effects get br br the one positive thing that retro puppet master does have going for it is that it looks rather nice the period production design costumes props are actually quite impressive it's a fairly handsome film to watch at times apparently filmed in <UNK> in romania which <UNK> up quite nicely for turn of the last century paris the acting here is awful maybe the worst of the series br br retro puppet master is more or less the final puppet master film as the next one puppet master the legacy 2004 basically edits together footage from the previous seven films it's a pretty crappy way to round the series off which started so well with three excellent distinctive little killer puppet flicks don't bother with this just watch one of the first three again just remember the good times the killer puppets would return in the terrible spin off flick puppet master vs demonic toys 2004
<START> some people say the pace of this film is a little slow but how is this different from any other hitchcock movie they all move very deliberately and as a point have <UNK> of suspense and brilliant montages <UNK> through it this movie gives us just the right amount of comic relief which make the suspense scenes seem all the more suspenseful the albert hall scene is one of the best examples of pure cinema that exists in hitchcock's collection the best probably being almost all of rear window pure cinema for hitchcock meant a series of usually small pieces of film fit together without dialogue in order to tell the story visually this is of course the basic definition of the albert hall sequence as well as the shorter <UNK> sequence at the end of the picture br br not many slip ups by hitchcock here and the acting is superb especially by doris day in a rather surprising serious role
<START> you know this movie reminded me so much of so many people i know i think that's the reason why i loved this movie so much i was just on the floor laughing because this had such a serious and document feel to it but the dialog is so hilarious that you can't help but have a good time basically the movie is about these crazed dog owners who are competing in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously it turns out the owners are just as insane <UNK> one of the dog owners goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special <UNK> <UNK> toy for her dog br br there is another couple that is just great <UNK> and cookie this complete nerd and attractive woman that are just so lovable in the beginning of the movie <UNK> describes how many boyfriends cookie had throughout the movie her lovers see her and hit on her even in front of <UNK> it was just great and fun to watch <UNK> looks this whole movie is just a hoot and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up it's a great movie is just fun to watch i'd highly recommend it now i have to find a nice way of showing this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves d br br 8 10
<START> this film is superb it has the same low budget first film feel of <UNK> and <UNK> but has the style of also by writer director christopher nolan the score sound effects photography and editing are almost <UNK> and the story shows that christopher nolan is best when writing and directing don't be put off by the low budget look and acting or even the short length of the film and just watch it
<START> the love letter 1999 starring kate <UNK> tom everett scott tom <UNK> ellen de gloria stuart <UNK> <UNK> jessica <UNK> alice <UNK> bill <UNK> <UNK> margaret ann brady walter <UNK> patrick <UNK> lucas hall christian harmony christopher <UNK> smith marilyn <UNK> spielberg jack black director peter chan screenplay maria br br based on the novel the love letter by <UNK> director peter chan's film version released in 1999 was not a big box office draw not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements while it was not as popular in theaters it soon became a beloved film on cable television and on vhs dvd set in a town in the good old usa i forget the exact location this is the story of a mysterious <UNK> written love letter who sparks emotions and confusion among the principal characters each who think the letter is personally addressed to them by the end of the film we don't know who the lover or the beloved is but the power of the letter has altered the lives of nearly everyone in the small town the cast is made up of wonderful actors who have <UNK> well on tv and film among them kate <UNK> in the lead role of middle aged beauty helen a <UNK> owner <UNK> ellen <UNK> as her friend employee janet hall young <UNK> tom everett scott as johnny the young 20 something guy who falls for the older and an older tom <UNK> as the <UNK> george <UNK> who must compete with johnny for <UNK> affections there are cameo roles by veteran old hollywood actress gloria stuart who is best known to modern audiences as the elderly rose in titanic 1997 and a cameo by kate <UNK> own daughter with husband steven spielberg jessica <UNK> the love triangle is between a middle aged woman an older man and a young man each of whom feel as <UNK> for helen as the writer of the mysterious letter the conflict lies in <UNK> <UNK> will she choose the right person which man has the most to offer her johnny is in a relationship with a girl his age who loves him with a passion all her own and is in fact a kind of reminder of what helen was like at her age george is in the process of <UNK> his wife and has lived a <UNK> and <UNK> life a <UNK> intellectual he takes helen on an opera date where the tragic death of <UNK> ultra italian heroine <UNK> moves helen to explosive tears there are lots of beautiful <UNK> of the charming <UNK> town rendered beautifully by cinematographer <UNK> the score is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs i've never been in love before i'm in the mood for love and only the lonely ellen <UNK> as janet hall who is consistently late to her job at <UNK> <UNK> who endlessly dates men without being able to find the right guy is simply wonderful she has not lost her comedic flair even though at this point in her career she was not appearing much on tv or film because only about two years before her hit mid 90's tv show ellen was cancelled because of her coming out as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject matter of the show here you even find comedian jack black long before he made it big in the bit part of a <UNK> this is a moving film about human emotions and making decisions that are significant about the human need for a passionate <UNK> love and the general love of <UNK> brought not only through books letters and music but through a genuinely loving and secure relationship this is a great film with wonderful moments and an <UNK> romantic spirit
<START> it's funny one day before i have seen this movie i had been watching a documentary about <UNK> <UNK> so comparison kind of came automatically of course there isn't any br br this movie is weak in every aspect acting is not convincing especially the one who plays and unnatural editing in confused and always leaves a taste of unfinished shot music doesn't fit the story doesn't flow it gets boring and the movie comes out much longer as it is oh and the characters aren't very well shown you actually can't tell much about the girls except what you see the movie also tries to shock with explicit <UNK> which is very laughable br br so 2 10
<START> after reading the terrible reviews of this movie including comments said to be <UNK> from colin i almost didn't bother to add this film to my <UNK> film collection however being the <UNK> fan which i am intrigue got the better of me br br to my surprise i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it had suspense drama and intrigue and v sexy colin <UNK> the plot kept me guessing right until the end credits and i felt that once one got past jennifer <UNK> opening <UNK> that the actress played her role convincingly colin was as brilliant as ever and its great to see him play a character from the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> went down my and after watching this i can't wait to see recent film to be out on dvd br br ok perhaps it a film that was <UNK> your <UNK> so to speak and one couldn't <UNK> to sleep on the <UNK> especially towards the end as there was a lot going on but that was what i liked about it the acting was subtle thankfully not overdone like many suspense thrillers this made the film all the more chilling to watch one just couldn't second guess what character ross <UNK> or for that matter jennifer <UNK> character jamie harris was going to do next and there were quite a few surprises in store i sat on the edge of my seat throughout with a <UNK> handy br br personally i am very glad that i watched and i shall certainly <UNK> and view again i think that any <UNK> fan would benefit from watching this film if they didn't like the plot then just watch colin
<START> i love <UNK> <UNK> cop movies rome armed to the teeth is my favorite and his desert <UNK> pretty much the italian euro war phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie give him guns machines some guys to run around talking tough and it's hard for him to miss br br what a shame it is then to encounter his eaten alive and cannibal <UNK> they could have been by anybody really and one watches them with a sense that he was under contract was told what kind of films to make was assigned a cast crew and given a budget <UNK> and script then went out and executed his films the same way that a guy at <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> of french <UNK> of the two eaten alive is the more original which is kind of amazing considering that it features extensive footage <UNK> from three other cannibal movies and easier to enjoy than cannibal <UNK> though not much br br i will let others outline the plot what fascinated me about the film is how staged it all looks and yet what a somewhat infamous reputation this film has as some sort of all out assault on good taste it isn't though the film is an exercise in bad taste complete with a title <UNK> scene where two of the pretty supporting ladies are quite literally <UNK> up and eaten alive by cannibals which is the film's high point the problem is that lets us get a good long look at the cannibal feast scene and it has the convincing ring of a 3rd season star trek episode complete with a fake jungle set for the really gory close up shots and i don't know about anyone else but if someone was <UNK> off pieces of my person and eating them i wouldn't just lie there and look <UNK> br br my problem with the film might be that i have a lot of respect for as a filmmaker and again this could have been directed by anybody all of your cannibal movie conventions are touched on but it never feels like they are filmed with any real conviction other than to try and bully <UNK> <UNK> out of the <UNK> the two directors certainly must have known each other and either had a sort of juvenile rivalry or an actual dislike for each other's work and a conscious need to <UNK> them invented the cannibal genre with man from deep river <UNK> blew it away with jungle holocaust fired back with eaten alive <UNK> blew him and everyone else away with the superior cannibal holocaust and fired a last <UNK> <UNK> with cannibal <UNK> which is about as realistic as that <UNK> commercial where the guy his <UNK> to a and hangs in <UNK> br br this film is less desperate and a bit more <UNK> to push viewers into the <UNK> with everything holy than <UNK> which remains as a sort of misguided attempt to <UNK> cannibal holocaust this one is more of a <UNK> mash with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a jim jones like suicide cult the cannibals seem like they were added as an <UNK> rather than the reason for making the film i think that fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of <UNK> films looking for something new by the <UNK> director it isn't as entertaining as slave of the cannibal god adventurous as his own man from deep river and certainly lacks the <UNK> of cannibal holocaust combine those <UNK> with the recycled footage stomach <UNK> scenes of animal violence misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and <UNK> wooden <UNK> of film making and what you get ends up being an ok jungle thriller with two or three standout scenes and <UNK> was capable of so much more br br 4 10 gore freaks will go nuts however
<START> i was wrapped to see many other people also enjoyed this film first watched it when i was in my early teens and then again several times late at night a few times after then sadly no more i'm now nearly <UNK> and so wish it could be made available on dvd why not the best anthony quinn role no one could have been more suited for the part or parts he plays i've mentioned it to other film buffs of similar age and alas no one i know recalls it as the daughter of a generation that went through wwii and its aftermath and myself deeply fascinated by what that generation endured i guess this film at the time gave me a wonderful cinematic insight into some of the heartbreaking issues of the day for classic final scenes this movie is a stand out
<START> at least the <UNK> by tim <UNK> was <UNK> roberts is the his usual inept self characters are inconsistent dull <UNK> roberts changes his accent even within one line
<START> ah another movie with <UNK> <UNK> angels <UNK> and steve a lame o as the not so cool car driver this movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking pot smoking and lots of moronic acts <UNK> rendition of a dying cat during his i love what i know <UNK> had me <UNK> for hours bike chick linda makes out with everyone <UNK> did the best acting since he just <UNK> and makes sounds i also dare you to try to make out what <UNK> is saying you wit private stock this is <UNK> folks br br i liked the ending what better place to have the climax than a <UNK> you have to see this to <UNK> it br br die <UNK> die
<START> has the <UNK> of relatively high quality shows on the <UNK> tv networks made it possible for people to produce direct <UNK> and or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to is that a good thing br br this film does not answer the latter question either way but it does appear that without <UNK> jeff would not have been able to make i want someone to eat cheese with br br like most new producers directors jeff independent piece <UNK> a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for <UNK> and yet is it a sensitive guy film he isn't really a sensitive guy likable sure <UNK> indeed br br what this film really is about is a bit hard to say i can only relate what i took away from it br br i rented the film because of the trailers particularly the scene of a <UNK> portrayed by amy <UNK> <UNK> james aaron that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because she is a <UNK> <UNK> i just about fell out of my seat based on that scene alone i ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie the reason i thought the school <UNK> <UNK> was talking about beth portrayed by sarah silverman i imagined a romantic comedy between the <UNK> silverman and the fat i didn't think the story would be anything original but that the dialogue would be snappy and the scenes would move along at a satisfying pace in short i thought it would be a comedy br br it was intriguing that the film started out that way but then took a much much more realistic turn when beth gives james the <UNK> ho because i've never really been with a fat guy before that is how brutally we live life and it was completely realistic i applaud the decision it just meant that beth has now left the building and with her the one snappy person in the film br br <UNK> relationship with his mother was also interesting that part made me wonder if the whole concept did not start out as a play it had that intricate feel to it the whole marty movie within a movie thing was utterly lost on me as i have never seen that film br br there were serious doubts i had about the character of james aaron though is it really possible that at <UNK> he had not had a serious relationship and he is an actor that did not really square with me to me his persona was less actor y and more corporate i could not really buy his <UNK> either no doubt he was extremely disappointed that things with beth did not work out we felt that but then did he really care br br another thing how in the world can both he and his mother afford to move out at the same time hasn't he just lost his job the last one he had that was one reason he did not seem ordinary to me where's the funding for his life coming from br br and yet i have read reviews that talk about the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness so there is that yes it is very realistic the way we must be satisfied with what we have because it is all that we have the way we sort of disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions james and stella some kind of self that takes place just to move on to the next moment that <UNK> with the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments our thoughts the way james had with beth it's really <UNK> br br very well done
<START> i caught this movie a few years ago one night and it was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen however since it is supposed to be an action movie i cannot give it more stars since the humor was unintentional br br chuck norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family and within the first five minutes the conflict <UNK> which leads chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film good thing too the sub par acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast actually the judge was pretty good but i can't really describe what makes him work you'll have to check it out for yourself br br and the <UNK> van chuck norris drives is <UNK> classic
<START> i think this movie has got it all it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head it has cool looking characters is really funny you know the kind that you'll crack up on the ground and you'll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks despite the bad acting bad cgi and bad story about cops going after a robot its really cool its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch get together eat pizza laugh like crazy and watch it two more times br br there are so many funny parts like when kurt was trying to get <UNK> attention and gave him the finger and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball on that part i kept saying remember remember to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened there was also a really funny part when ran into the room and kurt was there just before they fought and kurt was talking about his strange dream and how he was superman i loved that part although it has been a while since i saw it so i don't remember that part everything the actors said were funny like how kurt says i worship you like a god to the robot br br although there was some bad things in all it was a great movie man i can't stop laughing i wish i had that movie
<START> the <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece it tells the tale of a stuffed toy dog who <UNK> for an orange after he <UNK> the mother tell her daughter she hasn't any money the dog gets picked with other toys to be sold off in the truck after the others jump off while the vehicle runs the dog stays and waits to be picked up from store before setting off on his own he manages to get orange after biting woman's leg as she was holding and selling the fruit as he runs he encounters the devil and accepts his offer to stop at nightclub there he meets the other toys who jumped off truck the cat who was next to him in vehicle is especially determined to get <UNK> orange i'll just stop here to mention that other wonderfully bizarre things happen in nightclub that you'll have to see for yourself suffice it to say if you love <UNK> and is interested in all animation from the past i most definitely recommend you seek this one out
<START> the first thing you should know about is that it was shot on video so it has that peculiar home video ish look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a real film and indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a real serial killer thriller it's not quite that but it's not as bad as it looks either having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre <UNK> adams gives an <UNK> amateurish performance in the role her obvious <UNK> in front of the camera somehow works for her plus she puts up a great fight against the killer at the end the red herrings appear ludicrous at first but ultimately they work i guessed the killer <UNK> and you have to wonder if perhaps tarantino had seen the guy when he came up with the idea of the <UNK> for pulp fiction 1 2
<START> if you haven't seen this yet you really should on dvd i can't believe how much i enjoyed it it is amazingly realistic and believable true much of it is <UNK> and i would have liked to have known more about what was <UNK> and what were <UNK> facts there aren't many of them but it handles everything quite well with a cruel mother nature theme it will remind you of the nature programs that you've seen on animal planet and the discovery channel only the animals here are dinosaurs they act natural they eat kill mate play and fight for survival you will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others br br for the most part the effects are excellent at times they will look a little too much like but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic in some cases you will actually be convinced that you've seen a dinosaur my favorites were the the <UNK> the the the and the <UNK> <UNK> i was most disappointed with the t rex however which looked a little too computer generated at times br br in any case you should definitely see this production it is educational well made and very entertaining for what it is its an a
<START> okay so i'm a sucker for a good documentary particularly where it tells a modern day don <UNK> story a <UNK> i met mark in the winter of 1995 <UNK> while he was still working on <UNK> but i'll save that story for later american movie which <UNK> production not long after accurately portrays the person that i knew although in greater depth than i expected or believed existed this is simultaneously a very funny and very sad film and is brilliantly executed mark comes across as his own worse enemy his <UNK> ambition and optimism which i admire is <UNK> by his apparent artistic <UNK> as well as his bizarre <UNK> expectations but he's also a charismatic guy his loyal <UNK> sidekick is equally likeable loyal if <UNK> to the core like don <UNK> american movie presents an often ignored <UNK> aspect of freedom that people will be drawn toward <UNK> to which they are not particularly well suited <UNK> of repeated failure it is a great film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> actually directed a good movie who <UNK> thought i sat through two previous films <UNK> directed wisdom with then girlfriend <UNK> moore and men at work with brother charlie sheen they are lousy films badly acted directed stupid and offensive <UNK> is a good actor but lousy as a director i turned this on in pure <UNK> it has a great cast and i had nothing else to do damned if it didn't pull me in br br it concerns <UNK> coming home from vietnam <UNK> <UNK> by what happened over there his parents kathy bates martin sheen and sister <UNK> williams try to reach him but can't something in vietnam has affected him deeply and he's about to explode br br a bit overlong but still very good a lot of the material is <UNK> but the cast is so good that they make it seem new <UNK> is good sheen is terrific and real life father williams is touching and bates is just extraordinary trying to hold the family together it all leads up to a powerful ending which really surprised me br br well worth catching br br
<START> opera is a great film with some wonderful imaginative imagery an opera singer <UNK> is being stalked by a killer who forces her to watch him murder everyone she knows by <UNK> her up and <UNK> <UNK> under her eyes this idea of the <UNK> comes from the fact that <UNK> doesn't like it when people cover their eyes while watching his movies for years i've been annoyed by people covering their eyes during the <UNK> moments in my films i film these images because i want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away so i thought to myself <UNK> would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to watch most gruesome murder and make sure they can't <UNK> their eyes 'the answer i came up with is the core of what opera is about says <UNK> plenty of suspense wonderful cinematography and brutal gory murders one guy is stabbed in the throat with a knife causing a <UNK> wound daria gets shot in the eye while looking through the <UNK> etc for anyone who hasn't caught this one yet give it a try highly recommended
<START> obviously with this film going straight to dvd i wasn't expecting a lot but this film is so unfunny it is unbelievable the only part of the film that you actually may find remotely funny is before they even get to the island where <UNK> son is <UNK> out of the bathroom by a jet of water and then that's it why do they bother at all the first christmas vacation with chevy chase was brilliant and hilarious this is not they rely on jokes concerning a dog with <UNK> and a character called uncle nick who is about 80 and keeps trying to get his way with beautiful women when they approach the island on the boat the island in the background just looks so fake and randy quaid although funny in the previous film just overacts and seems like he's trying too hard to be funny you have been warned
<START> this oscar winning short film 40 minutes based on a short story by william <UNK> takes us back to small town <UNK> in december 1941 two brothers one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs obviously a huge <UNK> item for boys in the south around this time well the japanese bomb pearl harbor and the older brother pete decides to <UNK> he gives his prize egg to his little brother willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and <UNK> to his little <UNK> well willie isn't having any of it if pete can be a soldier so can he he heads to <UNK> showing his <UNK> and determination as he gets the better of several adults along the way after finding the <UNK> center in <UNK> he demands to see his brother pulling a knife on a lieutenant and <UNK> him in the process we are shown the devotion and love of a little brother jonathan he delivers a impeccable performance as a stubborn strong <UNK> boy in the <UNK> times of <UNK> the movie tries and mostly succeeds in showing how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in one's youth as the two brothers reunite shortly the movie delivers a <UNK> cry as the <UNK> love <UNK> us all br br this movie is like a cold bottle of water maybe or good clear water with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but not pure natural spring water like still it your <UNK> and you don't doubt its <UNK> and effects it is more run of the mill and less expensive than some but gets the job done leaving one <UNK> and afterwards 7 10
<START> one of if not the most visually beautiful film i have ever seen in my life there is so much to learn here in how to play with the camera color costumes and set up a shot the work that went into the official film web sites in english and french also give you a good idea of the sheer beauty contained in the film
<START> perhaps one of the first slasher film that came out after halloween although made from irwin from halloween i must say i honestly found tourist trap to be scarier and <UNK> tourist trap is one of those remarkable treats you find every now and then and are left with the most enjoyable feeling of surprise it was destiny i tell you but one night i was at my local blockbuster one or two months before it went out of business and had nothing to get then i stumble upon this movie i think huh seems like a laughable b movie i rent it and took it home boy was i in for a good scare tourist trap comes off as a bad movie it definitely has it's cheesy moments but in the end you're having to much fun with it to really care br br the things that impressed me the absolute most and the things that made this movie one of the scariest ones i've seen is number one the setting a horror movie without a good setting isn't very fun not here i just love love love the location it feels like we can relate to it it almost feels like we've been there before which makes it <UNK> next is the characters non of them are really stereotypical and they all have a real personality for example they're not <UNK> <UNK> or even sex obsessed people they feel like normal young adults plus they look realistic enough and then their is chuck <UNK> who gives a great performance as mr who we all take an instant liking too because again he's so real he feels like that nice guy <UNK> figure we adore the last and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us the audience jump half way out of our seats and turn on the rights for the right reasons for example most of the time in horror films we mainly just jump because of a sudden change in the music pitch but in tourist trap prepare yourself that's not the case with it's perfect use of lighting <UNK> and weirdness you feel utterly <UNK> out plus i love because although they may go a bit over the top with some things you still feel like this could happen which is exactly what a horror movie who takes such a <UNK> premise should do and that is make us the audience feel <UNK> and terrified br br overall as far as any major problems go i have none only that it's weirdness may get a little too weird at times however in the end tourist trap holds a place near and dear to my heart for being one of the few horror films to make me turn on the lights and feel <UNK> about traveling
<START> hi i have been looking 4 the soundtrack or a song from the film does anyone know who sung the title song i think it was called welcome home or coming home br br it is played throughout the film and for the end credits please can anyone help either the artist and or title of song thanks mike this is for all you movie buffs lets see if you know your stuff br br hi i have been looking 4 the soundtrack or a song from the film does anyone know who sung the title song i think it was called welcome home or coming home br br it is played throughout the film and for the end credits please can anyone help either the artist and or title of song thanks mike this is for all you movie buffs lets see if you know your stuff
<START> allegedly the true story of de the <UNK> daughter of the catholic queen <UNK> yes the same who <UNK> <UNK> expedition the film <UNK> the progress and <UNK> of her morbid obsession with her husband the philip of <UNK> known as the handsome and played in a rather manner by italian hunk <UNK> at his most and <UNK> here this is a <UNK> familiar story of late <UNK> c early <UNK> c intrigue betrayal and <UNK> ripping it <UNK> destructive lust from start to finish but while la <UNK> <UNK> succeeds in making cruel <UNK> and ruthless cut throat intrigue entertaining to watch la just doesn't pull off it just ends up feeling like a big budgeted soap opera with below average lazy or over keen acting looks positively bored and <UNK> de in the title role  though to be fair she may mature into a proper talent  just seems to be trying too hard switching back and fourth from two dimensional horny looking to <UNK> teenage <UNK> all the way through some of the supporting cast are ok with the exception of another italian pin up <UNK> and beautiful but really no actress to speak of i couldn't in fact bring myself to feel any concern towards any character nor for that matter did i feel strongly in a negative way against any of the supposed villains what a waste of a substantial film budget this one sadly is just so <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to other films in the genre rather than to its source material history for inspiration it seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historic era deserved a far superior film maker to evoke it
<START> the <UNK> musicians eva <UNK> and jan <UNK> max von <UNK> have been married for seven years and live in a small farm in a remote island to escape from a civil war in the continent they provide to a couple of <UNK> to raise some money and buy some supplies they love each other and eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby but the reluctant jan who is a weak and sensitive man does not want to have children when the rebels arrive in the island their peaceful and calm lives turn to hell and they get in the middle of <UNK> from both sides when colonel <UNK> <UNK> stalks eva jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man and the love and affection they feel for each other change to hatred and indifference br br shame is an <UNK> movie by the master <UNK> bergman focused by the eyes of a couple of artists that are <UNK> and does not listen to the news but when the war arrives to their lands they have their love friendship and affection destroyed by the senseless soldiers <UNK> and max von <UNK> have top notch performances as usual and i do not recall seeing the breast of <UNK> in any other movie the process of of the pacific and sensitive jan <UNK> by the war is impressive and the bleak open conclusion is <UNK> and adequate to the dramatic story my vote is nine br br title brazil shame
<START> i think this is one of top five movies along with deliverance <UNK> and the <UNK> boogie nights and city heat he also directed this one so he had a talent for that too like his buddy clint eastwood i wish he made more films like this or even a sequel to machine than the likes of <UNK> ace or <UNK> run ii this is a tough gritty cop thriller with reynolds at the top of his game having the beautiful rachel ward in it of thorn birds fame helped too henry <UNK> is the bad guy and he always does a good job at that the film also a great soundtrack too i highly recommend this wish it was on dvd in the uk an audio commentary from reynolds would be great as well 7 10
<START> this is a movie that should have been a mini series as it tries to get too much information in too small a space the whole story is constantly being <UNK> with sub plots character introduction and meaningless pieces information that go nowhere there is a underlying plot where boy meets a girl she has doubts but gets married anyhow and then her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real they turn out not to be but her husband won't believe that she was not <UNK> and her almost boyfriend doesn't want her as she was not <UNK> to her husband with that said there are no less than 1000 sub plots and character <UNK> that make this plot almost incomprehensible in the first 15 minutes you are <UNK> with so many things and situations that you just stop caring you don't care about any of the confused and screwed up cast that <UNK> in and out of the story like <UNK> feeding on a corpse each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer after a half hour and completely <UNK> i stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity i couldn't imagine where it was going but like staring at a fire i just couldn't get up and turn it off the production values are superb but the resulting movie is a waste of time wash your <UNK> instead
<START> this is the best comedy period it is so underrated clever witty humor great casting jerry stiller is the jewel in the show he is so incredibly funny and quirky simply a comical genius doug and carrie have great chemistry i so do not see what the hype is about when it comes to everybody loves raymond it is so overrated with lame jokes mostly forced humor and just not the witty show i can't remember laughing in more than 1 episode king of queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you serious belly laughs which is normally caused by arthur <UNK> i think its about time this comedy gets the hype it deserves and not the lame raymond co
<START> spike is a comic genius demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of odd ball <UNK> that have made shows like <UNK> and the daily show successful his <UNK> is <UNK> he seems to find the unique angle of the joke not the predictable sitcom path thank god his comedy is reminiscent of the award winning arrested development cross your fingers that has a longer life span the topics he highlights tend to be those things that pass by <UNK> by everyone else yet when he creates a joke around them out you wonder how you missed it the first time around i particularly enjoyed the sketches unfair target will be a cult classic in no time set your <UNK> people this is a show not to be missed
<START> the movie is really cool i thought it sticks to the original game quite well and some of the battle scenes are depicted in such high detail it's incredible i thought the movie could have been a little better if they'd give you a little more information before the end but trying to figure out what's going on is what <UNK> on you this movie br br the cg is beautiful i don't think they could have done a better job graphics wise every little detail the way they move the way their swords look everything is perfect the way they make the characters look is almost like they're real people br br the music was great and i found it entertaining to listen to just how much of it was <UNK> from the original game with new <UNK> and effects br br all and all i'd recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys fast paced action and a good storyline i would definitely play the game before i'd watch the movie though
<START> the <UNK> runner began as one of those important films that most people <UNK> over because they are told that they should if they want to be among the elite and quickly <UNK> into an idiotic film of <UNK> outlandish proportions br br i've never read the book and never felt the need because i honestly don't care sure i'm called <UNK> for saying it but i truly have no interest whatsoever in just another pull at your <UNK> copy off of all other story lines to get emotion from the readers novel even if it is set in afghanistan br br that said i watched the movie i heard good things about its beauty and how touching it was and decided why not as it turns out there was a very good reason why not not only was the so called main character completely unsympathetic i get it he was young and this is a film about redemption but honestly he was horrible i hated him and not in that good <UNK> <UNK> way he was just a dull idiotic self absorbed character that i felt nothing towards but the rest of the story was so completely absurd that i couldn't believe how everyone else was <UNK> over how beautiful it was and how they cried and it moved them i'm sorry but i only feel moved by something that feels realistic sci fi has been known to move me fantasy as well but this please this <UNK> many other movies for pure absurdity my biggest <UNK> <UNK> was brother really you sure you didn't just rip that off from a thousand other stories positive that that particular <UNK> wasn't just added in to try to pull more tears out of your audiences <UNK> the type of people who look for reasons to cry during a movie i was rolling my eyes when that twist was revealed knowing that it could only go downhill from there not to mention flashing back to star wars <UNK> <UNK> is your brother <UNK> that's not true that's impossible oh and it certainly did filled to the <UNK> with <UNK> and just plan dumb storytelling like good guy miraculously escapes bad guy against all odds with help from <UNK> kid who despite being <UNK> <UNK> and having no clue who you are is willing to help out with a conveniently placed weapon that holds special meaning to you <UNK> and don't forget the oh so idiotic finally getting vengeance on the kid who <UNK> you when you were little who surprise surprise has turned into a <UNK> adult trust me guys i understand you like to live <UNK> through movies but that'll never happen you know that kid who <UNK> you in high school he's no terrorist he's probably an <UNK> br br oh and i must mention the cgi <UNK> <UNK> i think those were on par with the matrix movies and transformers bravo you guys bravo br br it seems this movie was just made for western audiences who need to a reason to care about the middle east hey an overly emotional friendship story will work this is one of the most shallow movies i've had the misfortune of seeing it poses as deep well but when you get right down to it it's nothing special br br unfortunately the core of america's audience will do what they're told and follow the it's about controversial material so it must be good way of thinking
<START> i watched <UNK> the other night i have to say i was very impressed with how real the film seemed it felt very much like a documentary i also think that the film presented realistic possibilities in the film the war in vietnam <UNK> to the point where china has become involved what if that had happened i think the scenarios would be similar to the one portrayed in the movie we have had camps before in this country and still do br br highly recommended for everyone especially <UNK> br br i kept saying that if i were in the position that those kids were in that i would just lie my ass off i love america and its grand wars <UNK> <UNK>
<START> dr <UNK> micheal harvey runs a mental asylum he has a different approach to the insane he <UNK> <UNK> methods of treatment he treats everyone like family there are no locks on the patients doors and he lets some of the inmates act out their twisted fantasies he lets sergeant hugh dress and act as a soldier and harriet <UNK> <UNK> be a mother to a doll including letting her put it to bed in a <UNK> dr stevens is outside letting judge oliver w cameron gene ross chop a <UNK> up with an axe it turns out to be a bad move as once dr stevens back is turned the judge plants the axe in his shoulder soon after nurse charlotte <UNK> <UNK> arrives at the <UNK> having arranged an interview with dr stevens about a possible job she is met by the head nurse <UNK> masters <UNK> as anne mcadams and is offered a trail position she gets to know and becomes well liked among the patients however things eventually start to turn sour the phone lines are cut an old lady named mrs <UNK> <UNK> has her tongue cut out and she starts to get a strange feeling that things just aren't right somehow then one night all the <UNK> dark secrets are violently revealed produced and directed by s f this film has a great central idea which builds into a cool twist ending but ultimately is a bit of a chore to sit through because of it's low budget <UNK> and a rather slow script by tim <UNK> there are just too many long boring stretches of dialogue by the inmates not a lot really happens until the final twenty odd minutes the film has no real visual quality as it's set entirely in the <UNK> and it's grounds which is basically just a big bland house in the middle of nowhere there's no graphic gore in it a few <UNK> of blood here and there and thats <UNK> lot there's a bit of nudity but like the gore not much the acting is pretty strong especially and the photography is flat and <UNK> and i can't even remember what the music was like the twist ending is great but it just takes far too long to get to it a film that had a lot of potential that was probably held back by it's budget ok i guess but i think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been turned into a half an hour <UNK> form the <UNK> episode
<START> i finally watched the third film in <UNK> trilogy fire to begin i'd say that water was the <UNK> masterpiece on all levels fire comes next with earth close behind in order of quality fire there is so much going on in this film that i'll need a few more viewings to drink it all in the writing is superb the script creating <UNK> that starts the entire process of heat from the beginning until the end when it really does <UNK> into a fire the conflicts moving into complete <UNK> of relationships br br <UNK> is one brave lady she sees with a clear eye much that is <UNK> false and <UNK> about the great society from which she came from india is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change that she met with such <UNK> opposition to the making of water after having had the script <UNK> shows that there are still many taboo subjects which indian people more than less cannot look <UNK> in the face cannot examine or discuss them worse if someone like <UNK> has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues she faces death <UNK> so as much as india thinks of itself as a <UNK> society the facts are not always so whereas earth was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after indian independence fire and water are pointing at personal social and religious issues which as i say are considered so strongly in a negative sense that an open artistic dialog is still many years away as i write this water is <UNK> to actually be shown in india later this year i'll believe it when i see it br br fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional <UNK> that i saw in a price above whether it's arranged <UNK> which it used to be like among jews about 150 years ago or like it is among many modern indians they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women or just plain <UNK> <UNK> however this is not the real issue <UNK> is clearly <UNK> with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep <UNK> in misery water or else keep women <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> fire i am no expert regarding either the <UNK> or <UNK> laws concerning divorce the film seems to imply that the <UNK> of divorce is almost as bad as the sad marriage in any case <UNK> film is a very moving powerful attempt at sexual <UNK> that holds modern indian relationships up to <UNK> <UNK> that all three of these films have made themselves felt in india as an <UNK> attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable <UNK> of a <UNK> mindset <UNK> is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much <UNK> i admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough superb disturbing provocative taboo shattering
<START> <UNK> is <UNK> accused of <UNK> and goes on the <UNK> looking for the real <UNK> the familiar hitchcock theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime is nicely played out in this entertaining fare that has elements of the thirty nine steps and north by <UNK> although it is not as good as either of those classics there are some impressive set pieces including the finale on the statue of liberty the plot is implausible and unconvincing and after a terrific start it seems to run out of steam <UNK> is likable if somewhat stiff in the lead lane is the blonde but not the cool variety of the director's later films the supporting roles are generally well played
<START> victor mature as a barely <UNK> and mostly out of control mountain man and <UNK> may be on the poster but robert preston as a failed union colonel who led his men to get cut to <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> and is sent to a <UNK> in <UNK> for his incompetence has the most interesting part married to a young and hard to recognize at first anne <UNK> the <UNK> mature <UNK> for the <UNK> wife giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference another man's wife at one point by james <UNK> who plays <UNK> older and <UNK> mountain man father figure directed by anthony mann this film is lost among his more famous westerns with james stewart but even so you really don't need the indian menace to make this a film worth seeing although preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the indians under <UNK> in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a <UNK>
<START> i cannot get over how awful this movie was my eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are <UNK> blood from the horrible awful one song soundtrack there are four kids and dog and they run away from a hospital then get away with stealing two cars and a bus no one gives them any punishment or anything to correct them the acting is just so awful it sounds like an <UNK> video for social studies class i cannot think of one thing that i like about this movie nothing even the kid that loses his dog made me want to vomit he gets his dog back without the lady even seeing the dog run out the door maybe the dog was trying to escape out of this movie then there is some horse <UNK> in the whole mix it was torture watching this movie then at the end the oldest boy says something like staying together isn't a crime and they all hug him and love him stealing gas is a crime stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have went to juvenile hall or something avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together
<START> crazy scottish warrior race stranded deep in outer space low on food and budget free started ten now down to three who will help these men of <UNK> with visual effects that semi suck but i kinda liked the freaky being if i met one then i'd be fleeing but not if i had scottish mates we'd <UNK> swear and avoid that fate so in the end it wasn't <UNK> it was a dvd i'm glad i watched but if they ever make a sequel dump some actors not all were equal some were good with gritty acting some were wooden and should maybe pack it in but the action kept me watching all the shooting shouting didn't <UNK> i'll tell my friends not to fear and watch again in another year
<START> well now that all of the director productions <UNK> friends and relations have posted their <UNK> reviews after seeing this at various festivals i guess it's time to show reviews written by people who actually paid 10 bucks to see it br br like the director's dear jesse the only other one of his films i have seen <UNK> suffers from a lack of focus and too many ideas <UNK> into an indie budget i swear this guy might have better luck doing miniseries i kept waiting for the various plot threads to come together but they only <UNK> at points blatantly <UNK> in a way obvious to all but the most dense viewer it was like watching a season of lifetime made for tv movies <UNK> into one long did i say <UNK> sketch on the old carol <UNK> show maybe an <UNK> male <UNK> could take his girlfriend to see this and then <UNK> hey remember all of the chick flicks we went to last year the one about the <UNK> mother the one about the gay guy the one about the christian housewife we went to three chick flicks last year so now we have to go see terminator 4 i guess one has to do anything to cast a familiar actor to get funding but what oh what is bonnie hunt doing in this flick she isn't exactly known as a dramatic actress and this attempted performance won't be sending mr oscar to her door i mean speaking of lifetime original movies wasn't valerie <UNK> or <UNK> fawcett available ms hunt has always come off to me as cold maybe she should have played the other mom i wish i would have chosen capote to fill my weekly gay themed indie <UNK> oh well maybe next week i think there is a good reason why capote is playing at tons of theatres all over the nyc area and this one is playing at only one let the <UNK> faith in this flick assure to to run in the opposite direction if you don't trust this review
<START> infamous horror films seldom measure up the hype that <UNK> them and i have yet to come across a worse <UNK> than wes craven's the hills have eyes having held back from watching this for years i was really pleased when i got it for christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle down and watch it knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying i <UNK> have bothered br br after a promising if familiar start that firmly sets the film in the world of survival horror things rapidly go to pieces when the protagonists and <UNK> meet in the deserted <UNK> br br looking like it was shot on a budget of 5 with the cannibal costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that <UNK> in faux <UNK> and red indian <UNK> the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic <UNK> who take a <UNK> on a road trip to california to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone when they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesh <UNK> and have to fight to survive br br while hoping for another deliverance texas chainsaw massacre wrong turn or devil's rejects i actually realised i'd stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and <UNK> in a <UNK> video <UNK> bargain bin br br with <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> for blood and a couple of gruesome wound close ups i can kind of see how an 18 <UNK> in the uk is justified but with those close ups <UNK> this wouldn't have looked out of place as a saturday afternoon thriller on <UNK> br br the whole silver mine nuclear test site subplot is just a <UNK> to justify <UNK> the family against the <UNK> but given how easily the <UNK> get their <UNK> <UNK> it stretches credibility to think that they had survived for a generation <UNK> on <UNK> by br br and then there's the ending or lack thereof the hills have eyes seems to be missing either a third act or at the very least a satisfying denouement instead i was just left wondering yeah and
<START> i was so happy to learn that <UNK> <UNK> will finally be <UNK> released in 2007 i saw this film three years ago at the <UNK> international film festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so i could send everyone i know to see it it's like taking a trip to india colorful magical thought provoking aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto <UNK> chase scene this movie is very realistic this is not a bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy the characters are a little <UNK> drawn but the acting was very good visually this movie is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through <UNK> is like <UNK> sometimes it's hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is real the movie has that same quality great soundtrack too
<START> i recently saw episodes 1 4 and now i can't wait for 5 6 to be available i've heard they are coming soon <UNK> seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy it's obvious that the budget was small but the care taken in <UNK> the script is quite evident in fact the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more is a master of the put down i just wish i could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting co workers let's just say that if you don't like <UNK> i'll personally see to it that your <UNK> get extra
<START> this movie was amazing from beginning to end the movie is packed with fun laughs music enjoyable rock music hot chicks more music action drama and the f bomb br br although some scenes are entirely bizarre and <UNK> they were fun to watch and enjoyable all in all this movie left you feeling great and happy especially those that love rock music br br the soundtrack is great the laughs are <UNK> and the storyline is simple entertaining yet complex you have to see this movie if you love rock music br br overall vote 10 out of 10
<START> my first <UNK> rather enjoyed it great format and peter <UNK> character extremely good wonderfully quirky he can take his place next to <UNK> miss <UNK> and also the likes of <UNK> and rick diamond i can see why this series has such a following br br as a professional musician i have to say a few things first of all a conductor who merely produces these pedestrian performances of the most basic examples of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is never going to have a house like that or fame like that or cars like that much less be called a genius and the <UNK> that the actor does is so bad as to be laughable no orchestra would take him seriously br br there are several little things too such as his rehearsal of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> why <UNK> it when they've just performed it for tv any <UNK> musician would be able to play it in his or her sleep anyway his <UNK> to the ensemble are downright nonsensical and when columbo asks <UNK> <UNK> what means she says it's it's italian as are the vast majority of musical <UNK> br br and finally no two great musicians would ever have the following play something what should i play <UNK> music is their job and passion they know it well something far more specific would be asked for and offered br br i know i should get out more
<START> i really liked the movie joe it has really become a cult classic among certain age groups br br the producer of this movie is a personal friend of mine he is my father in law he lives in <UNK> west side and has a <UNK> in <UNK> long island his son in law live next door to his <UNK> br br <UNK> he does not do any producing but in a business with hbo movies br br as a person mr <UNK> is a real gentleman and i wish he would have continued in the production business of move making
<START> this game is very good for the <UNK> you can <UNK> as tony <UNK> bob steve <UNK> <UNK> eric andrew reynolds <UNK> jamie thomas rodney <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and maybe some more <UNK> the game doesn't have mike v or <UNK> <UNK> well anyway the <UNK> is awesome the level school ii is a great level with so much to <UNK> in career mode you collect <UNK> get money get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes there's create a <UNK> which is pretty cool i created a <UNK> named butt <UNK> a black guy with an <UNK> and a girl board there's park editor some cool <UNK> parks free <UNK> and there's single session where you <UNK> for 2 minutes and get a score you can watch <UNK> which is always cool each <UNK> has 2 styles a and b the graphics aren't that good well they're good for an <UNK> game i wish i had a <UNK> pack so i could save my data overall this game is awesome i give it an 8 10 for <UNK> but with the version it's just as fun as the <UNK> version but kinda hard to control i give it a 7 10 for so go out to a place that still sells <UNK> games and pick up a copy there's also versions for <UNK>
<START> as you can read the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually watch it at his church br br anyway movie had a good b movie sci fi beginning everything was there to make a good entertaining easy to watch movie then everything felt in this religious jesus will save everyone <UNK> mode br br story start with 2 main characters 2 <UNK> but it fast give the first role to that jesus freak who is there to save everyone's soul with this con <UNK> attitude br br in a few words this movie goes from entertaining to <UNK> in about 30 minutes br br waste of time waste of money avoid it
<START> this was painful recently given away as a free dvd with a british newspaper this british <UNK> co production from 1977 could've fooled me it looks ten years older than that at least is quite deservedly obscure and if you make it past the half hour mark consider yourself a <UNK> the combining of animation and live action is <UNK> at best and downright dreadful at worst which makes you wonder why it was decided to even attempt making the film in this manner when clearly the technology wasn't really there harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless i've seen with the obligatory moments especially where the animation of the <UNK> type character is involved that rendered countless cartoon features from the late sixties <UNK> instantly dated the screenplay by don black provides a convincing argument for the usually <UNK> <UNK> to stick to what he does best and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored as for adults stick to jonathan <UNK> original novel
<START> in <UNK> this series was shown on local tv here in southern california i and many others have been <UNK> bbc for tape or dvd ever since now all of a sudden here it is on amazon i pre ordered in january and now here on march 30 it arrived it was a long wait 48 years was it worth it so far i have just watched richard ii i've only had the dvd since 2 <UNK> and i can truly say <UNK> totally worth the wait the acting direction and production are superb and even better than i remember the production is in b w but somehow it fits the video is clear and very good the sound is flawless further proof of how timeless shakespeare truly is br br i gave this 10 stars even though i have only seen 1 of the 8 plays i am sure that when i have seen them all i will change my rating to at least a 12 br br it's currently in stock at amazon us region 1 at a reasonable price br br i'd better stop now so i can get back to watching next up is henry the iv part 1 of which is my all time favorite shakespeare play
<START> this movie lacked credibility for two reasons one no mayor of a major city and new york is certainly as major as it gets would allow a <UNK> in his city to <UNK> into such a violent place to live especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security all of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly jewish or <UNK> at <UNK> years of age i have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did even escape from new york which was fictional up front i e they told you that this was science fiction didn't resort to such deep <UNK> violence in this movie most of the elderly victims were <UNK> and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them also in this movie and i have not seen the prior two is more <UNK> than the escape movie secondly gangs as far as my research shows have never been as <UNK> as this movie makes them out to be on the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he's killed yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang <UNK> the next gang over is welcomed with open arms outside gang members are always viewed as <UNK> and are stopped we are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang the other gangs want to be all into it why did the outside gangs come to help i believe that more than one gang from outside came to help what did they come for another question why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his <UNK> to attack <UNK> character this was not a great movie and i could go on but i won't
<START> oh if any day u wanna see a supernatural thriller turning out to be a comedy watch this movie br br this film was a shocker as it had so many actors in it but what they do and how they fit in br br the handling of the college scenes is like a school play where each person comes talk and then the next person comes <UNK> br br okay reasons to laugh at the film 1 akshay <UNK> <UNK> kapoor <UNK> as college students 2 akshay carries a gun in college 3 some pathetic stunts and <UNK> br br there are several more flaws like why doesn't the snake save his lover from being raped and comes in so late also why he doesn't kill all of them together there only br br but <UNK> they have to make a 2 <UNK> film so hence you have a movie br br the movie is painful to watch the film was directed by <UNK> who was an expert making such films in the past and had a successful record of films like <UNK> <UNK> 1979 and <UNK> wants to help his son's non existent career right from 1992 <UNK> <UNK> 1993 and 1996 all <UNK> he tried hard to promote his son and he also casts big stars so that his son gets noticed sadly nothing could help his son's career br br the film has several comical scenes like the death scenes how the actors after being <UNK> by the snake are so fit to fight him again and the climax br br direction by <UNK> is bad music is bad br br that brings us to the cast akshay kumar ordinary stuff he has nothing much to do rather then stunts <UNK> <UNK> awful the worst <UNK> award goes to him he gives cartoon acting a new meaning terrible <UNK> nothing to do kapoor bad <UNK> <UNK> sunny <UNK> is comical in the scene when he comes to save lol ordinary <UNK> pair <UNK> kumar <UNK> are as usual raj hilarious for wrong reasons the girls are awful which brings us to this guy has a huge <UNK> he is even more stronger and <UNK> then akshay kumar sadly he comes across as poor man's akshay his voice is awful his expressions are painful the only thing he has to do in the movie is wear glasses and make an evil face <UNK> is awful
<START> i first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on <UNK> as we all know <UNK> went the way of the 8 tape sigh it really had nice picture quality too anyways i'm glad i found this movie again i've been searching for it for more than 10 years this movie falls into the category of movies like airplane continuous jokes <UNK> funny actions mark <UNK> is absolutely hilarious his transformation from the shy dr daniel <UNK> into the sex crazed mr hyde is unforgettable complete with and the part i loved best was when he <UNK> the car from this poor guy and then drove to <UNK> woo <UNK> totally psychedelic experience without the drugs if you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it when i first seen it i had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing this is a movie i could watch over and over again i highly recommend it
<START> this is the type of late night cable flick usually associated with andrew stevens or shannon <UNK> though unlike most of <UNK> and <UNK> t a <UNK> vehicles this is <UNK> dull br br let's cut to the chase the real reason for watching this non thriller is to see shannon breasts anyone who states otherwise is a liar however most of her steamy sex scenes appear to be all smoke and mirrors br br notice that all the shots where her head and chest show at the same time are quick <UNK> a boo flashes the frames where the camera <UNK> on her nude body there's little or no face attached or she's behind a dripping wet shower door br br all you <UNK> <UNK> out there know what that means body double br br i must admit though that the finale where is bound <UNK> and <UNK> with a knife provided a certain <UNK> thrill br br if you find a vhs copy anywhere buy it as all involved are probably too embarrassed to ever let this come out on dvd
<START> the ghost 1996 the director made this too sappy a production maybe it's the generation but i really liked the charles <UNK> version there is a time and place for <UNK> and this production does not translate very well patrick stewart <UNK> shakespeare was very good but still inappropriate would neither recommend nor watch again the close ups and padded text and sub plots were lost on me adding <UNK> material and scenes takes away from a truly great work the screenplay writer should find another profession in which to his talent maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better <UNK> check out the really good version and pass on this one
<START> i think this movie had really bad production value the lack of acting makes me think they should mark it as an early <UNK> it may have had no money available for its making i feel bad that it was a <UNK> ride into the major league for jackie robinson br br i believe he was much better than many of the white players of his day he had to be really great to break the color <UNK> of the time no getting around that this was a really bad movie br br wish there was more info about its makers they may have been limited by the quality of actors that were willing to take on the project maybe no money to get good people
<START> almost four years after the iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever that's right so all those flag <UNK> who were so sure of the right and might of the american way are now chasing their <UNK> isn't that true you bet it is this movie said so from the beginning it is kind of freaky how much the film or should i say filmmaker knew what was coming it is almost like going to a fortune <UNK> and hearing what was going to happen in the future there was a point when i felt the <UNK> standing up on the back of my neck as <UNK> announced that <UNK> combat <UNK> are over on top of a visual of a broken down <UNK> being away with the american flag waving in the rear view mirror you have to see it to understand what i mean but even if you are <UNK> or even if you are pro war this movie will have some kind of impact on you because it is so <UNK> in history
<START> never have i seen a movie like this didn't plan on seeing it but it was worth the turn of the tv channel i am mostly a scifi movie watcher but i would be more than happy to add this one to my collection it starts out as a one sided film with a simple love triangle then became something a little different can't tell more then that but it does involve two guys and one girl <UNK> not the way you would expect also this movie starred hugo <UNK> from the matrix and the lord of the rings in a role i would not have expected very funny guy this movie is playing on here tv but if you do not have satellite it is worth a rent so give it a try you won't be disappointed
<START> i caught this on late late mexican cable and i have to rant about it the title was translated as secrets well there's a secret that has an important part in the movie but come on we are not stupid we know there's a novel behind this br br anyways the movie is pretty interesting and it's carried by it's solid performances the always beautiful and stunning <UNK> <UNK> and christopher <UNK> deliver great performances and have such great chemistry between them cameron is also good although she has minimal on screen time <UNK> <UNK> is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching sad great performances br br character and her sister's ex boyfriend travel to europe in order for her to deal with his demons and understand why her sister died through flashbacks we learn the sad truth and we can't help but feel sorry for the whole family the ending is truly moving br br so there's nudity but it's minimal in fact the sex scenes are artsy and do not intend to be steamy or sexy br br to be honest i kept watching it for <UNK> on screen charming and beauty and i ended up liking the story and the dramatic <UNK> br br give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features great movie the last last scene was very sad the two little sisters through flashbacks
<START> i found it charming nobody else but <UNK> can do so little and yet get so much you might think i'm weird but i was so <UNK> that i couldn't speak during the movie while during other movies i comment a lot the short movie made by him for <UNK> et the one with the eggs that one is <UNK> in my heart but this is wonderful too i liked it better than ten <UNK> is maybe the best director in my opinion because he can see things he doesn't need to use a lot of stuff brought from home to illustrate his images he simply grabs a camera not many can do that maybe i don't know to much about movies but i don't care about <UNK> stuff all someone has to do is touch my soul <UNK> does
<START> director <UNK> film the <UNK> are flying is a glorious piece of cinema from the screenplay by <UNK> based on his own play shows us a vision of the <UNK> of war and the suffering by those left at home <UNK> with countless war movies showing us the and the carnage the topic itself becomes tedious and <UNK> however this russian gem shows how the tale of <UNK> can be told in a different way by telling us straight from a <UNK> mouth how war is hated by all that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting we see a new vision of wwii we have young men <UNK> to <UNK> war for peace to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than <UNK> fighting a battle they don't believe in with so much hatred towards our current situation in the middle east and how people are dying for no reason against their will it's nice to see a film that shows just how <UNK> and heroic these soldiers are as well as those awaiting their return br br communist russia shows how involved all were in the war while boris may have <UNK> to go to the his father is head doctor of a hospital <UNK> in the of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl <UNK> doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love an entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration even the factory that boris and his friend work for send <UNK> over with gifts of <UNK> whether this is all a <UNK> look into russia at the outset of wwii or not i don't know there are no <UNK> or <UNK> of these boys <UNK> their lives for a country it is all praise and thanks some in america could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not <UNK> and <UNK> havoc in its name only <UNK> what these men and women are <UNK> each and everyday br br the acting is top notch throughout but some deserve <UNK> out i really enjoyed in a small role as <UNK> grandmother she is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language as the <UNK> <UNK> brings what is perhaps the best performance as spoken at the end about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears <UNK> those sentiments he puts on a tough exterior especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his <UNK> just hours before he must leave but when boris <UNK> to go to the <UNK> station we see the true pain of the man <UNK> in sorrow at the table he loves his son <UNK> and although he may not be able to show it to him his actions throughout the film express it to the audience is effective as boris a happy go lucky young man and <UNK> doing what he believes is right and <UNK> is good as the villainous mark staying home due to his talented piano skills or maybe just to steal his <UNK> love that love played by really draws the audience in to her grief and slim <UNK> of hope the true star of the film she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way needing to steer back on course hoping that she did so soon enough for <UNK> return br br besides the realism to the story as well as being <UNK> to use tragedy to get the theme across i also loved the visual style of the film <UNK> cinematography is amazing especially when considering the movie was shot in <UNK> it is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen <UNK> it is completely different to do so in a square frame right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a <UNK> along water a bridge in the background at the top as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance there are multiple instances of the camera being behind <UNK> yet still allowing for the action to be seen creating unique <UNK> depth and interest at all times sharp angles are <UNK> as well as careful <UNK> to allow for <UNK> shots and exaggerated <UNK> of characters in frame together br br the real <UNK> however are those instances of the long shot used well towards the end to follow <UNK> through the mass of returning soldiers it is magnificent earlier on as she <UNK> through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she <UNK> for boris her own farewell needing to be said the planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people the camera focuses on couples kisses people yelling to one another and more all <UNK> in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema it's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style the <UNK> are flying shows how successful placement and <UNK> en can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible composition and <UNK> from the actors and crew can work wonders adding something that huge <UNK> and special effects can never do
<START> i just cannot believe the low scores for this movie <UNK> reason has to do with the low number of votes meaning few people have seen it this is simply a fantastic movie there are so many stories inter within but it's not complicated each character grows with the movie and we experience with them <UNK> life changes the scenery is simply amazing and the end credits are the best ever in any movie i have seen just like a shakespeare play yes it's a little dated filmed in 1982 but the issues the characters face are very current it could have been filmed in 2002 without <UNK> to the story line <UNK> julia is amazing best role ever in a movie this is his signature piece a young molly <UNK> is excellent as she <UNK> from girl to young woman susan sarandon is perfect as a young <UNK> woman and john cassavetes is the force that puts this all together do yourself a favor find this movie view it enjoy it come back to imdb and score this movie into the top 250 of all time where it really belongs
<START> perhaps i was just in a really good mood when i watched this film but for whatever reason i really liked this film was it terribly original no was it a bit predictable yes and so what it was still a really nice movie i've always liked bruce willis well almost always there was hudson <UNK> and the fifth element after all and he portrayed a selfish sarcastic b perfectly maybe this movie isn't academy award material but it sure is feel good material go rent it
<START> the title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence but it is not good at all one 15 minute sequence with jack black beautifully playing one of his songs and <UNK> on acid while <UNK> through the woods does not save this movie at all every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things except for the main girls i could not think of one movie where i had seen them before i hate to bash movies but i also hate not being able to find something decent in movies the film is sad not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast if it were <UNK> and written over it could be awesome if you want a good movie to see stoned watch <UNK> boy or half baked or <UNK> and confused but this is not a movie to be seen at all
<START> this is a wonderful new movie currently still showing in cinemas in my country its director the <UNK> is in my humble view perhaps the only contemporary italian director along with <UNK> <UNK> to deserve being called great that is apart from the old masters <UNK> still around and occasionally still <UNK> out movies it's one of my greatest regrets that contemporary italian cinema has been <UNK> since the mid 70s mostly due to a dire lack of funding and <UNK> of new talent something which can be transferred to most fields and which makes italy one of the most static countries of our time production wise both in an industrial and cultural sense unlike say china and this among other things is precisely the subject of latest movie few directors can speak to me about the true present state of my country and the world as can yet his pictures also have a precious <UNK> and <UNK> and for those already worrying that they may be slow <UNK> and worthy rest assured of the ones i've seen they most certainly aren't at least not if you're used to quality european cinema br br the basic plot outline vincenzo is a <UNK> at an <UNK> steel plant factory somewhere in italy probably the north he is played by sergio <UNK> one of contemporary <UNK> most versatile and talented actors when a major chinese steel company <UNK> some of the italian steel <UNK> industrial <UNK> vincenzo who struggles to make himself understood with the non italian speaking chinese director tries to tell him that the machine is <UNK> and its needs <UNK> an element he's working on <UNK> building himself he warns them that not doing this might have very dangerous consequences meanwhile a young chinese woman called liu acts as <UNK> between the two men but seems to struggle to find adequate <UNK> for some of <UNK> technical <UNK> the italian eventually loses his patience with her virtually pushing her aside and asking her to hand him the chinese italian <UNK> so that he can do the <UNK> himself br br despite <UNK> <UNK> the following morning he finds that the chinese factory director and his employees have returned to their own country while not <UNK> his advice about the adequate use of the industrial machine at all thus vincenzo <UNK> with his great integrity sets off for china and here begins an endlessly fascinating road movie through china a very <UNK> 21st century odyssey through the asian giant a latter day <UNK> quest for the secrets of the mysterious nation not quite as in all of movies the journey itself becomes far more important than whether its ultimate mission is carried out or not in fact the way in which the point is literally brought home not without a touch of humour is a lovely poignant <UNK> and irony which made my eyes well up while i was simultaneously smiling the <UNK> is let in on the secret that <UNK> trip was ultimately completely useless but he himself doesn't know it and goes home a satisfied man a <UNK> innocent at least you figure he's happy sort of br br the <UNK> that characters <UNK> on totally and <UNK> them down to their bare human <UNK> they are <UNK> without name status or someone to put in a word for them these theo <UNK> like themes are also explored in actually my favourite movie closely followed by la stella che non in order of personal <UNK> in the 1994 movie two italian <UNK> travel to <UNK> to do business just like vincenzo they intend to go there do what they have to do and then go back home instead one of these two italians accidentally ends up on an almost <UNK> journey through this <UNK> land just after the fall of communism br br but let us go back to la stella che non once vincenzo is in china he predictably discovers that the seemingly simple task of <UNK> the to its new owner is anything but straight forward the piece of new location is seemingly almost impossible to determine unless he <UNK> on an <UNK> journey through china when he comes across liu the young <UNK> he'd <UNK> now working as a <UNK> he tries to speak to her but she <UNK> in a hostile manner <UNK> him that because of him she'd lost her job as <UNK> back in italy played by the relative newcomer <UNK> <UNK> liu soon becomes a <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> when she <UNK> figures that she could do worse than to act as guide and <UNK> for the italian on his trip obviously for a consistent sum of cash this young chinese actress may not have the beauty of <UNK> zhang nor the movie star <UNK> of <UNK> li but her charming <UNK> and pretty face <UNK> a combination of <UNK> strength intelligence dignity and <UNK> humour that'll make her features difficult to forget once you've seen the movie furthermore she and <UNK> have wonderful emotional chemistry as co stars br br weaves dramas that are serious poetic mythical post neo <UNK> and humorous all at once while maintaining a heart warming ability to explore the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday <UNK> circumstances a documentary like <UNK> <UNK> what is actually a <UNK> conceived <UNK> of faces and places a <UNK> which also manages to <UNK> a cinematography of breath taking beauty the photography here is <UNK> yet gorgeous as <UNK> a movie on the <UNK> in an industrial and emotional <UNK> br br <UNK> eye is a grown up <UNK> one yet also never a cynical or <UNK> one the masterful camera angles also often gives a sense of <UNK> <UNK> in the eyes of the chinese bringing home a sense of <UNK> and cultural <UNK> that's very rare in movies about a familiar <UNK> exploring an unfamiliar non western country i cannot recommend this movie enough
<START> this movie has got to be one of the all time <UNK> of michael j <UNK> generally respectable career i should have known how awful this movie was when i rented it and found the movie only half viewed and not <UNK> by the previous <UNK> never a good sign fox plays a grown up child star who's now an agent for other show business kids his character is <UNK> in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being <UNK> his big break comes when he meets angie vega a talented child vega is <UNK> and not at all likeable in fact the only likeable character in the whole movie is <UNK> <UNK> as a brooklyn <UNK> <UNK> for the agency one of those movies that makes me want to stick a post it note to the box warning others not to waste their time
<START> for us an <UNK> and <UNK> movie is something you have to be in the mood for i'm very happy i recorded this my wife remembered it from when she was young but i had never seen it the family wanted to watch something not too serious before bed and this was selected br br our daughter has watched many of the old movies with us always complaining in the beginning but most often coming around she mostly ignored this in the beginning <UNK> to check her email but she started enjoying herself many times laughing out loud to the <UNK> br br it's wonderful to think you can have a fun evening with a old the <UNK> colour introduction that <UNK> into the full colour fairy tale it's a fun twist of a story that everyone is familiar with that includes a little song and a little dance along with everything you expect lou and bud to delivery br br watch it with your children and have a very fun evening
<START> a great production that should be <UNK> <UNK> i doubt that it would be out of date i'd love to hear from anyone who knows whether videos exist of this series or any other information about where it could be found or viewed
<START> i have to agree with the other two comments i waited over a month to see this great new show a e had been <UNK> what a disappointment the show is pretty much all about ryan his voice overs are campy not creepy it sounds as if he is talking into a can as of the second episode which is roughly 30 minutes or so if you take out the commercials he is being chased or followed by something that he knows is demonic he can't say the name anytime someone needs to convey that name they write it on a piece of paper and hand it to someone else not particularly informative or entertaining or believable for the rest of us why can't he say the name supposedly it would give the demon more power funny i always thought demons wanted to hide their true identities if you know the exact name of the demon doesn't it make it easier for you to cast them out now the next episode which <UNK> in just a little while is titled <UNK> so is ryan in need of an <UNK> already not to say that it couldn't happen but the show so far has not given any evidence or proof of anything i can tell ryan that if i were a small child hell if i was an adult and someone gave me a little bottle of holy water to chase away something that was terrifying me i would look elsewhere for help besides which if you don't use holy water <UNK> etc in the right way don't you risk just further <UNK> whatever is already mad at you i will probably watch tonight but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first it will probably be the last time i watch it
<START> i'm seen this documentary in its feature form in a movie theatre and the pictures are astonishing one really wonder how by <UNK> did they manage to film those waves those animals those is that a plant a predator a creature from the movie anyway it's remarkable sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on tv with weird animals and so on but none with such a beauty a <UNK> a deep emotion the only downside is the commentary in french it's narrated by <UNK> usually good and familiar with beautiful documentaries but the text is not good at all not enough informative of too much
<START> this has got to be the worst case of over acting since the silent era not just one or two actors but virtually the entire cast lee <UNK> and bo <UNK> were fine but the rest of them look like their first time acting br br so the budget was not tremendous much of the costumes and set were believable but there were many things that jump out at the viewer to let us know that they couldn't double check or get all of the props to match the period br br i can't think of one aspect of the film that i liked or didn't shake my head your time will be better spent burning <UNK> <UNK> from your
<START> this is a wonderful film taking place during the romantic period of the civil war this film is a must see for eastwood fans and eastwood claims this is one of his most favorite films that he did i couldn't agree more watch out this is a spoiler eastwood does die in the end eastwood and director don <UNK> rightfully <UNK> that the ending should be unexpected and should be unhappy for a few reasons they wanted to stick to the book for one secondly there can't always be a happy ending <UNK> this was written during the vietnam war they wanted a negative statement to this terrible struggle of war where people were needlessly dying i agree with all of this it is a wonderfully shot film and i love most films involving the civil war it is more of a portrait of how <UNK> women can be that they can be more dangerous than men hence the title has much to do with the statement of the film <UNK> to be <UNK> the song sung by eastwood at the beginning and the end of the film is another statement against not just the civil war but the vietnam war and maybe <UNK> the women he comes across during the film wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes note this film is rated r for no reason there is hardly any language it is probably some of the subject matter involving sex but there is no nudity really excellent film 9 10
<START> not a film of entertainment but of real lives limited ambition for the working class in 60's enjoyable because of my upbringing not sure it'd work for most people typical <UNK> full of tv actors actresses of 70's 80's 90's
<START> my brother plays <UNK> in this film although most of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor the funniest line is the movie is nothing wong with <UNK> so anyway this is filmed in <UNK> or where we grew up the dance club is was called up front fx what i loved about this movie is that the main character who is not named on the box because <UNK> brings more <UNK> is supposed to be a police detective a great opportunity to drive around in a red <UNK> <UNK> i need to get a copy of this preferably the director's cut so i can see all the scenes my brother is in the only scene he is in is the beginning when they are in the dance club he got the spot because he was dating this <UNK> from a semi pro football team called the <UNK> it is interesting because his name comes up as the first entry in imdb fame has him fortune not so much
<START> an example of genius <UNK> the epic story of three major stages of life for a young boy told with <UNK> and raw <UNK> rarely does a film come along that causes me to out loud say during most of the viewing this is a really good film again and again that is exactly what happened when i watched this film i really do not understand how anyone could not like it i found myself at moments crying and laughing at the very same moment unable to control how i felt about the scene the acting is outstanding eric why is he not all over movie screens he was really extraordinary his seemingly <UNK> attempt on the screen <UNK> me in deep visceral ways i thank him in my opinion eric <UNK> is one of the best <UNK> around and i hope he continues to rise to the challenges that he faces while trying to give us art in the face of <UNK> commercial <UNK> br br
<START> a stunning film which brought into the open so much about <UNK> that generally makes people afraid it showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled individual br br love friendship fear frustration joy humour and so many others things were so well captured the 2 lead characters were very well played by the 2 able <UNK> actors and invited your laughter tears concern joy and <UNK> br br i approached this film with a mixture of interest and <UNK> worrying that it might be too much a play for sympathy or <UNK> only on <UNK> it was however a beautifully crafted story of 2 friends br br i loved it
<START> this movie is all about reality submarine <UNK> in ww2 was not a clean precise science there were no computers giving exact enemy details there was no precise <UNK> to 100 control the sub not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart and a smile on their <UNK> br br people with expectations of seeing a pretty war in this movie will be grossly disappointed good they deserve to be disappointed they deserve to have reality shoved into their face br br war is not clean exact fought by people about to break into song it is endured by scared cold burnt hungry desperate people willing to do anything to survive br br we dive at dawn is a fine example portraying a desperate situation needing desperate actions
<START> the play is cleverly constructed begin with the porter <UNK> let the audience see the background unfold through his eyes the film follows the play with great <UNK> working no doubt on the simple premise that it couldn't be <UNK> now throw in a host of superb character actors the result is a <UNK> triumph a definite must see
<START> hero and the terror is a fairly dull thriller a la no real character substance predictable plot and boring for a thriller i found this movie slow in working up to its pitiful climax as it just seemed to drag along until <UNK> wife's baby is born and then it drags on from there until it reaches the end which i can hardly remember already even though i only saw the film 10 minutes ago br br i give this film 3 out of 10 for the first 10 20 minutes
<START> if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made the film has great actors a master director a significant theme at least a would be significant theme <UNK> of fifties existential world <UNK> <UNK> scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care it is about <UNK> and about <UNK> in a healthy way br br not quite ten years after the film i knew air force officers who taught my r o t c classes at university they were <UNK> they thought deeply about their work they has senses of humor one had been a crew member on the first plane to drop a <UNK> bomb i have wondered if any one of them died in vietnam i imagine that they flew missions there br br <UNK> the film fails the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very <UNK> that <UNK> the narrative no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie her susan holland is a woman that one would flee not embrace <UNK> james stewart who as then a colonel makes a good stab at this role as lt <UNK> and later <UNK> dutch holland but the most interesting thing he does in the role is bite into a <UNK> i'm not kidding stewart was good as biting in <UNK> as he did in the spirit of saint louis br br one might think of ted williams but i don't when i watch mr <UNK> in the role i do think of william <UNK> as lt harry <UNK> in the bridges at <UNK> the comparison is not good for mr stewart who seems wasted in this film br br footage shot from a b <UNK> looks like <UNK> from commercials for an <UNK> though beautiful the <UNK> shots are mundane for the time they might have impressed viewers the crash in <UNK> involves <UNK> <UNK> you expect the outcome to be good br br the <UNK> the subtext for the film voices the tedium that air force flight <UNK> must have felt during their long missions and the <UNK> that the air force used to make its business well business like any other business one <UNK> how a la <UNK> vague director might explore this theme and then one begins to think about how someone with imagination might have filmed this movie little moments are missed when <UNK> returned from long missions the members of the crew got a shot of <UNK> and a <UNK> before <UNK> the mission showing that might have helped br br <UNK> was the image the air force wanted and mr mann <UNK> the <UNK> maybe in that sense the film works but not for me br br i <UNK> when i watch the movie because i think all of us director actors crew viewers and members of the armed services might have enjoyed giving and getting much more than we get here br br i don't think that this movie had to be dr <UNK> or 2001 both of which it <UNK> but it had potential never realized yet i enjoy watching it i think of the <UNK> on their long missions and the ground <UNK> in isolated places there is a certain sense of honor celebrated here and i celebrate that honor br br i certainly understand why people who praise this movie here and other places appreciate it if there were no intentional <UNK> it would get a 10 from me br br
<START> what starts as a <UNK> comedy drama and then halfway turns into a melodrama made a major star of john garfield and <UNK> so but jeffrey <UNK> is not to be <UNK> as the object of affection of the four daughters <UNK> is very handsome and is so charming it's easy to believe that all four daughters could fall for him although garfield received most of the kudos <UNK> became a major leading man at warner bros as a result of this film br br michael <UNK> insisted on location shooting for the <UNK> scene making it the highlight of the film throughout the <UNK> is enough to inspire awe a soap opera by <UNK> <UNK> has been turned into a cinema masterpiece
<START> i love this movie and i recommend it to anybody <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> played their roles perfectly just the characters alone pull you in to the movie the directing was also magnificent the most creative shots i've ever seen i was stuck to the screen throughout the whole movie not one scene was slow the movie also has a lot of action packed scenes cars blowing up etc the movie is just an all around masterpiece if you like real entertaining movies then watch this because you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time i put this movie on my top ten all time list because there is never a dull moment in the movie and that is my type of movie 2 thumbs up all the way up
<START> from director billy wilder double <UNK> the seven year <UNK> some like it hot i can see that this is a bit of an under shown and underrated film one to be seen this is the <UNK> story of charles <UNK> <UNK> james stewart who in <UNK> wanted to be the first man to cross travel solo flight from new york crossing the atlantic ocean to reach paris in a small <UNK> the first half hour or whatever is seeing <UNK> getting <UNK> to do it and the construction of the plane named the spirit of st louis and making all necessary <UNK> then of course the rest sees his <UNK> journey crossing the journey <UNK> <UNK> near fuel loss and moments of losing sense of direction but he was successful also starring murray hamilton as bud <UNK> patricia smith as mirror girl <UNK> robinson as benjamin frank <UNK> robert as harry knight sheila bond as model dancer marc <UNK> as father arthur space as donald hall <UNK> as and <UNK> as apparently <UNK> was a bit younger so stewart was a <UNK> too old to play him but then again you can't think of anyone else that could do better it is a witty and emotional drama with stewart as always being fantastic great music score by frank <UNK> and good direction from wilder a good little known gem it was nominated the oscar for best special effects the only award it was ever nominated james stewart was number 12 on the 100 greatest movie stars he was number 3 on 100 years 100 stars men and he was number 13 on the world's greatest actor very good
<START> i have read and enjoyed many of james lee <UNK> mysteries when i read <UNK> the electric <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> was being filmed and tommy lee jones was playing the lead i was thrilled after watching it last night i ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up don't get me wrong i don't mind blood and gore i love 'the and 'the godfather perhaps it was just that i had previously seen and <UNK> just before watching this i know that <UNK> books are violent lyrical and especially in the case of <UNK> the electric can be like the <UNK> <UNK> he writes about full of things that are never fully explained in a book that's fine in a film that's confusing many of the previous reviewers are also <UNK> <UNK> of dave which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie or they are <UNK> of bernard <UNK> or both even as a fan of all the actors and especially vince i felt it was such a waste of their talents overall they gave good performances in a film that didn't hold together now i say this having only seen the usa dvd and hoping that <UNK> cut will make a huge difference on the plus side the soundtrack was wonderful the scenes at place were perfect just as i imagined the bait shop to look like mary <UNK> was excellent as as was walter as if you read the books you know why is an even <UNK> person in the beginning of the film and then starts <UNK> people with various <UNK> overall i wish that they had filmed more of the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> and left out large portions of methods of <UNK> explaining gifts and his bond to dave as well as <UNK> to the general then i wouldn't be feeling today as i did last night when i turned it off what just happened
<START> for a teenager who has never read austen this adaptation might be fine but only for them this is a disjointed cliff notes version of <UNK> park and if you have not seen another version or read the books parts of it would be head scratching br br why has it been so hard to do a good adaptation of this book the one in the 1990s took such liberties that it barely seemed to be the same book the mindset was completely modern and <UNK> br br here we have <UNK> <UNK> who looks like a pretty country <UNK> she has a charming personality that develops nicely but she has <UNK> died blonde hair with black <UNK> and through much of the <UNK> dark brown roots so much for <UNK> cousin it is incredibly distracting and the rest of the cast is in the <UNK> hair <UNK> clothing genre that shows a real <UNK> for period accuracy br br one thing is good here <UNK> is the best mary crawford of all the versions she is note perfect <UNK> without being at all modern or suggestive <UNK> and completely without any moral or <UNK> <UNK> henry here is actually good looking enough to be a slight temptation for our heroine br br redgrave takes one of the most interesting roles in the story and manages to make her actually boring until her last scene much too sensible this is just a production that really missed the mark a real low for austen fans br br the only <UNK> version is the one with odd duck perfect for the role la despite the very very gay henry crawford he's just laughable
<START> the elite sniper team that has inserted or so earlier have instead of digging in and making them <UNK> invisible decided to take cover behind a big rock in one of the first scenes when the hero runs to rescue his wife he actually <UNK> when inside a building and aiming for a target only some 20 30 <UNK> away the hero uses his scope besides the fact that most non elite soldiers would make that shot from the hip and still hit there is also the fact that the scope probably wouldn't be able to focus that close there is a satellite that can actually look into buildings br br the list is endless and the film is the biggest heap of crap i have ever put in my dvd player
<START> this movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes nicholas sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as the <UNK> but whats sets the two apart is the <UNK> had a dream team of leads in mcadams and <UNK> but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of <UNK> <UNK> br br i felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he cant act leaving an awkward and uneven situation amanda given a great performance only to have <UNK> drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene cant recover br br this story deserved to be cast right but what it got was a pretty boy who cant act <UNK> should stick to what hes good at movies that are more about his physical ability albeit horrible like <UNK> joe step up and fighting the less he talks the better br br try not to think of me as a jaded <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> i went in to this movie with an open mind because i've been surprised many a time by the likes of adam sandler in reign over me i gave the same chance to <UNK> i didn't view him here as the sum of his past roles purely just by his performance in this movie which sadly was a letdown
<START> b kennedy tried to make a sequel by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> western not as <UNK> as the g kennedy sequel that came after this one br br this is the <UNK> film of the two ugly looking it is <UNK> b kennedy made it without having the genius for that hundreds of hundreds of mexican hundreds of women a desert <UNK> landscapes a largest scale br br everything in this clumsy sequel likable only in a weird way is phony br br the movie itself is very ugly looking <UNK> who made the best part in the first film doesn't look good at all in this one br br <UNK> plays a priest he will be a political leader in the next sequel of the franchise br br it is true that when you have that many characters you may not need a very interesting storyline sometimes e g <UNK> meets mcqueen then they pick other or b spencer meets coburn etc it's fun to see where and how they'll meet the rest of the crew etc but you need at least these several characters unfortunately burt <UNK> installment is not very good at that br br return of the seven 1966 begins with a <UNK> <UNK> and chris meet there they decide to rescue the third survivor of the original who belongs to a huge group of 300 <UNK> by the mexican <UNK> we find out the name of appealing <UNK> chris must <UNK> again a small here we have a dirty dozen chooses his men from the <UNK> another member of the <UNK> is a <UNK> who will take good care of the wives left without husbands the sexual humor is especially <UNK> and <UNK> in this film it <UNK> to seem smart and <UNK> it is simply <UNK> and dumb and gross br br the choosing of the members of the small army was one of the greatest <UNK> in the mcqueen film unfortunately in the first sequel there is the most <UNK> of the three <UNK> assembled under the magnificent name br br robert fuller makes a lousy <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> <UNK> br br in this attempt a mexican revolutionary leader has a <UNK> kidnaps 300 and uses them to build a village and a church in the memory of his lost sons useless to say that this insane mexican <UNK> doesn't equal <UNK> part in the first film b kennedy <UNK> exclusively on camp and stuff ugly landscapes a <UNK> <UNK> lightning a desert a huge battle between the <UNK> and the revolutionary of course return of the seven 1966 completely abandoned the good sense of the mcqueen film br br what is particularly shocking is that this sequel came quite quickly after the original everything changed meantime in the way of making westerns br br both the sequels look weird
<START> robert <UNK> plays a scientist <UNK> with passing objects through solid matter but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four dimensional atomic age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci fi in its time with psychological overtones yet seen today the film is mildly <UNK> and naive it's a camp fest <UNK> made for tv's late late show wooden performances by <UNK> and lee <UNK> barely rate as one dimensional though patty duke playing a cute brat pre miracle worker gets a colorful memorable exit br br from
<START> i for one was very anxious to watch this movie br br though i knew it was going to be another type of movie in the style of revenge of the <UNK> i was still impressed br br there is plenty of truth to the fact of this type of learning and believe very strongly that it should be allowed in a new style of <UNK> br br conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know br br this approach to teaching should be further sought out in true academic <UNK> br br while there still was too much of the <UNK> scenes it obviously had to be thrown in there for hollywood's sake of making a comedy about college even though we all know that life isn't really like that by any means br br a touch unbelievable still funny and with a killer ending br br awesome ending crucial to the entire story and very surprising br br without the final scene the movie would have been half as good br br i liked this movie and it didn't have to have overly amounts of swearing or nudity or gross out jokes for it to be good br br great crew and cast story and even the generic <UNK> of the obligatory <UNK> frat members was well done br br american pie 1 2 3 and american wedding or whatever <UNK> it makes <UNK> not measure up to this by 1 3 br br far better than most comedies about first year college with no <UNK> stupid jokes to make somebody throw up with br br i liked it even though it was simple it was interesting and even had heart my only regret for watching this movie is that it wasn't longer
<START> a fairly typical australian movie where the underdog saves the day <UNK> of himself i guess there is no real reason to see this <UNK> if you have seen the castle or the dish it still leaves you with a positive feeling at the end and it as good or better than most hollywood stuff
<START> <UNK> is great actresses are great but <UNK> did not have to do it like this it is ok that he <UNK> his position on the <UNK> an extremely delicate issue but doing it like this makes him lose his point the movie is a false offensive to the intelligence full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring some scenes are advertising material more than a movie women are incredibly attracted to this mind sick man who wants to make someone to kill him not understanding the <UNK> of that he seems not to care about no one and thank them for their caring love and attention i think that <UNK> might have make people think about this issue in a different way but the way he chose to do it i believe is not correct he could have make his point more powerful exposing the other side of the <UNK> without mocking it
<START> <UNK> is a very dumb show you can predict pretty much anything that's about to happen barbra jean is just too stupid it's like she's not even a character a show like this should at least have someone who resembles a real life person i guess barbra jean represents a retarded person <UNK> or whatever her name is <UNK> <UNK> they're all stupid <UNK> is like the <UNK> person on the show and she's still stupid everyone is stupid that's my opinion on <UNK> since i have said all i can say about this show i'll just take up the next few lines of text by saying what i am currently saying right now and do it until there's 10 lines there <UNK> gets 2 10
<START> i love this movie the cast were all terrific in the portrayal of their various characters <UNK> did so well portraying a weak <UNK> <UNK> who was passive aggressive in her complaining and self involved character that it was a relief to see the character's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was equally appealing in her role as a somewhat <UNK> jewish mother devoted wife and loving sister <UNK> bob <UNK> <UNK> and lisa performed their roles equally well br br if you enjoy movies that relate to going through challenging times without <UNK> your sense of humor and hope you will love this movie
<START> a pig <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> drinks milk <UNK> and kills her sister and her sister's boyfriend after they have sex she goes to an asylum makes a best friend out of amy karen russell and the two blackmail their way out of a mental institution by sleeping with their <UNK> one is played by carol <UNK> show regular <UNK> <UNK> on the outside these two man hating mafia <UNK> stop taking their <UNK> and invite six <UNK> ex boyfriends over to their large country home for a party where they're <UNK> slaughtered in very gory ways by a <UNK> leather clad mystery killer br br the hideous david barton fx are so bloody but so unrealistic that they take on a sort of <UNK> quality same goes for the movie the dialogue is so strange and stilted the film so <UNK> paced and edited and the acting so other <UNK> you'll start to doubt your own sanity this film actually attempts to have a plot and three dimensional characters but it's all so poorly handled it's almost like what would happen if ed wood did a rewrite of an <UNK> bergman script and like any good bergman film this has a mature moral to <UNK> by any good party needs a proper guy girl ratio so there will be enough chicks to <UNK> your lizard see it for yourself or don't br br <UNK> the only reason i was even interested in watching this to begin with is very amusing in this one has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eye popping nude scenes unfortunately she also completely disappears from the final third of this film and the movie suffers because of it br br score 3 out of 10
<START> this is possibly the worst of the cockney gangster genre that has <UNK> the british film industry since <UNK> guy ritchie unleashed lock stock and two badly acted <UNK> this true life story of <UNK> <UNK> who has everything that is wrong with this genre a truly awful script that consists of people <UNK> cant cant and i'll kill ya ya cant ad <UNK> the acting is uniformly dreadful with the two most <UNK> cast members being two former soap stars quite out of their depth for some reason the film assumes we have heard of these people and i can assure you anybody north of <UNK> hasn't and that we should be interested in some low <UNK> story why this isn't <UNK> despite the <UNK> on the dvd cover the story <UNK> around a football <UNK> turned <UNK> turned gangster who's friends end up getting shot boo <UNK> the fact that these people are totally unsympathetic is the only minor plus for this film in all of the action scenes it seems that the camera was tied to a piece of string and <UNK> around while people <UNK> to fight and the story of somebody most people have never heard of and nothing really interesting happens too is a complete waste of time people talk about how violent the film is as though it's the sign of a great film and although many great films have violence in them this is just an excuse for the fx man to show what he can do overall this film is a reminder of why the british film industry is <UNK> and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic <UNK> the better
<START> i have watched this movie over and over since it first came out i was fifteen and even then i knew it was cheesy it had such great potential and i constantly rewrite the script in my head the ruined what could have been a good drama i loved the fact that it was shot on location too bad that the characters were underdeveloped it's like they wrote a first draft of a script then made the movie right away at fifteen i could have written a better script some scenes and dialog seemed to come out of nowhere and you were left with a lot of unanswered questions and was it just me or did it seem like <UNK> was sexually attracted to his cousin grown into some kind of woman and the way he was always touching her would have an interesting plot twist <UNK> working for her drug dealing cousin who is also a <UNK> too bad they missed the mark on this one
<START> this is one awful movie some people told me that it was not that bad actually but i sure disagree the monster is amazingly cheap and funny looking but this is something we all knew i guess in addition to that the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terrible br br as bad as it is this movie as the quality of being entertaining not always for the good reasons but it's a good so bad that it's fun flick br br by the way there's no such thing as la according to a secondary character in the film named pierre described in the movie as a french canadian there's a legend among french <UNK> about a giant bird know as la as a french canadian myself i can assure you that i never heard of such a legend it sure made me laugh though
<START> othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this film the bad depiction of shakespeare's characters and the terrible rendition of the love that <UNK> john had made this movie the horrendous filth that it is by far othello directed by <UNK> <UNK> is beyond mediocre and atrocious br br the movie othello is a pitiful drama about the love between john and <UNK> their <UNK> to one another will be tested by the man's friend in the opening scene of the film it is clearly shown that the love between john and <UNK> is <UNK> beyond belief moments later ben john's friend pops out into the screen <UNK> the viewers and showing them right away how much of a liar and power hungry person he is br br by far this movie was much more horrid than the shakespeare novel itself with that being said it does have a <UNK> amount of good parts for example the love that was shown between john and <UNK> was depicted very well and it looked that the couple was so <UNK> just as it was explained in the book although the love between them was shown exceptionally well it still did not show the <UNK> that othello had between <UNK> and <UNK> as well as it should br br love <UNK> <UNK> this movie is based on all three of the main topics that were in the shakespeare novel the novel however really explains how all of this came together much better than the movie could for example the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film much more detail is also put into the novel this is why this film is such a disappointment trust me those who have read it will find it disappointing as well br br in conclusion this film was by far the most horrendous depiction of a novel that has ever been put out by mankind by avoiding to see this film not only will viewers save themselves an hour two of their lives but also save themselves an eye or two from the <UNK> face of ben popping out at them
<START> first of all i should point out that i really enjoyed watching this documentary not only it had great music in it but the shots and the editing were also wonderful however all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the <UNK> east meets west cliché that bothers many <UNK> like myself okay this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering and however the <UNK> of the film is that it looks at what it <UNK> as east from the eyes of the west i mean like one jazz musician says in the film maybe there is no east and west maybe it is just a myth a lie created by the <UNK> leaders of western countries in order to keep fear and <UNK> alive so that they could continue <UNK> the world and keep the cash flowing br br why don't you think about that
<START> as a <UNK> i find the idea of <UNK> <UNK> in time and space to america totally moronic i am sure this doesn't apply to imdb users but why are so many americans unable to relate to any film concept that isn't set in their country this attitude does americans no <UNK> in the big wide world out here br br it was bad enough that the wicker man was remade and set in the usa <UNK> stripped of its cultural context and with a correct gender change for a leading character br br one wonders what next robert the bruce as a new york cop mary queen of <UNK> as a soccer mom <UNK> kids a career and relationships br br come on hollywood open up to all the other cultures on the planet
<START> why this worthless piece of french cinema has garnered any sort of attention other than negative is beyond me br br don't bother renting this one it shouldn't have even come into this country
<START> this has got to be the most appalling abuse of the word comedy ever witnessed it is simply not funny and the <UNK> have obviously just tried to use the name of the tv series in order to make a few <UNK> at the box office this film makes a carry on seem subtle as far as sexual innuendo goes no mean feat and has all the charisma of a corpse with a complete <UNK> i'm afraid
<START> i rented this film when my girlfriend was away hoping to see some serious military <UNK> action br br after 10 minutes of watching this movie i was so terrified and horrified and sick of the quality of everything in this film that i was ready to destroy the rented disc with a flame <UNK> luckily i find one <UNK> seen many bad films but this is not even bad it is total garbage and it does not even deserve to be counted as a movie here on imdb br br i feel sorry for the people who have been involved in the making of this total disgrace hope it wins some oscars though d
<START> let me <UNK> that this is not a good movie but i am so glad it is out there i am so glad i saw it and for the role that it plays in my dvd collection it is sublime it is the ultimate pg 13 romp it is college as we imagine it will be when we're <UNK> in high school it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on mars it is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable watching it requires so little sophistication in fact thinking too hard about what's happening will get in the way of your appreciation of this work it makes me feel like i'm 12 again and that kind of experience is worth more than 9 99
<START> the next karate kid is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises it has a wonderful plot and moral that tells a wonderful story <UNK> <UNK> does an incredible job of achieving the role of julie i have seen the actor who plays mr and this is one of his best performances in my opinion the movie is funny and charming and i cannot stress enough about how interesting the movie is i <UNK> this movie a 10 out of 10 i suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie
<START> though not a greek i have had a <UNK> interest in the eastern empire its fall in was the greatest loss to christianity in its entire history yet while the <UNK> empire is not a topic much discussed in american intellectual circles the us did not merely <UNK> golden public architecture the us is much absorbed in the <UNK> <UNK> historical cycle and now has faced many of the <UNK> involving certain people of a middle eastern <UNK> about whom it is said that there is a slight tendency for excessive <UNK> on religious matters which <UNK> great i wonder if the loss of the ability to speak <UNK> was the first sign post on the road to disaster br br john is to be credited not only for his excellent production but also for his <UNK> enthusiasm for the subject which is most refreshing br br not recommended for americans who like political correctness
<START> a remake of the <UNK> silent film based on the <UNK> novel by maurice the detective series would be made into numerous plays films and tv series in the uk the us and france over the years this 1932 version starred the <UNK> barrymore brothers john as the duke and lionel as detective they would also star together in grand hotel dinner at eight and several others over the next couple years <UNK> karen <UNK> shows up in the <UNK> bed during a party in this pre hayes code film first the lights go out in the bedroom then they go out in the main ballroom then the search is on for the crook and the missing jewelry as well as other missing <UNK> you can tell <UNK> hadn't been around too long as they still use <UNK> cards several times also watch for a new kind of safe that doesn't need a combination well thought out plot no big holes but no big surprises here either not bad for an early <UNK> film clever ending
<START> esther williams plays a <UNK> <UNK> water <UNK> secretary who <UNK> to stop walking on the water and be some man's wife van johnson and tony martin are her potential choices for a husband despite fine <UNK> sequences filmed at <UNK> gardens this romantic comedy is awfully stale as <UNK> by plodding director charles <UNK> everything here is made to seem intentionally <UNK> which doesn't lend the picture much staying power even <UNK> big moments in the water are not quite up to the mesmerizing leaps from her other swimming vehicles though they are <UNK> to the <UNK> with the men both of whom are <UNK> <UNK> baker in her film debut as <UNK> disgruntled ex girlfriend is the <UNK> of the bunch flimsy stuff indeed 1 2 from
<START> this movie is great stylish fun good acting i'd seen it described <UNK> as <UNK> stock and two smoking and both of which are excellent <UNK> the plot is simple but it does not detract from the enjoyment <UNK> is a brilliant <UNK> and miller is an excellent drunken gentleman the sets and costumes are stunning and the music and <UNK> are unusual for a <UNK> sense and sensibility it definitely is not my recommendation go see it sit back with a huge <UNK> of popcorn and have a damn good time
<START> i recently stumbled across a tv showing of passion having missed the opening scenes ms in to be praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a strange de <UNK> tale to the screen i am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their parts in producing such a thoroughly fine motion picture it must have been <UNK> shooting so many scenes in the desert and i cannot comprehend how her <UNK> <UNK> such a fine performance from the <UNK> this calls to mind another suspenseful adventure naked prey why isn't this film more well known hope i can find it on video
<START> <UNK> day is a result of the success of friday the 13th both of those films are about creative bloody murders rather than suspense if you enjoy that type of film i'd recommend <UNK> day if not i wouldn't there's nothing new here just the same old killings br br even though i've given the film a 4 out of 10 i will say that it's not a repulsive film it is watchable if your curious about it just not creative
<START> this movie has bad writing and bad editing it is difficult to follow what is going on because nothing any of the characters do makes much sense some major <UNK> occurs every 30 seconds as a result none of the action sequences are at all interesting the movie is two hours worth of throw away scenes which are connected merely by the fact that they share common actors this movie doesn't even have enough of a sense of humor to be a good bad movie
<START> <UNK> it is the same game as the first one just different levels and some new features added for fun br br the <UNK> version still has an issue with giving <UNK> enough air for some ground tricks the <UNK> version which is rarely seen anymore was the best version of the 4 versions <UNK> eventually came out with a <UNK> with it had the <UNK> resolution and the <UNK> looked better and more detailed the <UNK> and <UNK> could handle br br the levels are really amazingly done from start to finish like the first one the school was my favorite i enjoyed that level so much not only for the golf <UNK> that would sometimes run you over but for the length that's what i liked about the first two games they don't make these games <UNK> enhanced they just focused on length of levels which is cool br br overall just as good as the first one and well worth playing
<START> this dvd is barely 30 minutes long and has dull interviews that reveal that the average has an iq of around 30 but these aspects are the least <UNK> here br br the real trouble is that <UNK> is one of the least talented metal bands to ever sell over 100 000 <UNK> of their crap the only reason i say one of the instead of the is because system of a down are even worse much like ed girlfriends this <UNK> music is <UNK> together from age old metal clichés which are to be found in both their image and their ultra dull music in fact their image is kind of fun their videos are like snippets from cheesy horror films hence they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment br br their music however consists of nothing of quality whatsoever just a bunch of <UNK> heard them a million times before played solely at the guitar neck <UNK> that are in no way related to each other and yet are randomly <UNK> together to form songs that have no <UNK> no highlights no nothing but if the <UNK> are truly bad then the <UNK> are even worse singer has a stereotypical hence uninteresting evil <UNK> the kind 90 of all metal bands today have but that is nothing compared to when this <UNK> <UNK> starts trying to sing still what could one expect rule no <UNK> of the <UNK> metal <UNK> says quite clearly you will alternately <UNK> and sing ignore the fact that the two styles don't mix well because most of your fans are so tone deaf they will love you even if you into the <UNK> <UNK> are at their absolute worst when their singer starts <UNK> out <UNK> br br but back to their image it's stolen copied ripped off <UNK> borrowed taken without asking from none other than mr <UNK> you've never heard of them of course you haven't you only listen to <UNK> metal and mr <UNK> is quite far from that and beyond any anyway they too wore masks grotesque horror ones similar to those of <UNK> i might add in the late 80s and early 90s this band whose <UNK> is mike <UNK> from faith no more never hit it big because their music wasn't directed toward the average music fans to put it mildly br br so basically <UNK> aren't even original in the image department they have nothing at all new to offer hence will be forgotten in several years once the masks become boring to the <UNK> of their <UNK> faced fans which is when <UNK> will be forced to compete in the music market solely with their generic music br br speaking of mike <UNK> it's interesting that a number of <UNK> metal bands often site his singing as a major influence predictably and thankfully <UNK> is not <UNK> by this and has denied being in any way proud to have been an influence for one of the worst metal sub genres ever br br having said that enjoy this short dvd and the cheap thrills it might provide to the <UNK> ear and bored eye and then polish those <UNK> posters because in a few years no one will be taking care of them the poor <UNK> br br having seen corey in the documentary get <UNK> i finally understand why he wears a mask he is a blue eyed baby faced ginger looking like dave younger brother not exactly scary br br for more of my music world <UNK> go to http <UNK> com collection <UNK> 1 br br please <UNK> me hard very hard by <UNK> no below that'll teach me
<START> from the golden period of british films this has my vote for one of the funniest of all time screened yesterday at my film society to a <UNK> audience i was <UNK> at how well the comedy has lasted made in 1950 it is really down to the expert timing and <UNK> playing from two of the finest actors britain has produced margaret <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> adapted from a play by john <UNK> this farce is <UNK> handled by director frank the plot is simple a <UNK> mistake a girls' school on a <UNK> school i will always laugh when i think of this film
<START> ok so this film may not have won any oscars but it is not a bad film the original d o a is undoubtedly a better film but that does not mean this film is bad br br the film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after the right stuff made him a star and a very lovely looking meg ryan when she was still now quite famous br br this is more of an update of the 1950 film rather than a remake since the setting is different and the characters too are different the plot is pretty much the same a man this time an english professor at the university of texas at austin is <UNK> and he has only 24 hours to find out who <UNK> him and why meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him jane <UNK> plays <UNK> estranged wife in a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in daniel stern also in an early role before home alone made him famous plays <UNK> colleague charlotte <UNK> is fine too in a supporting role br br the entire cast is top notch the film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end br br i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film
<START> a charming movie enhanced by the musical and vocal background especially during the competition my understanding is that there was never a soundtrack but could you through your sources advise me where i might get information on the singer and the <UNK> of getting a copy of the song he sang your help would be appreciated the song really touched me and my wife and we would like to secure a copy wherever possible so that we might play it as background music when we have our family and friends over for our italian nights if you are able to get this information to us we would be <UNK> grateful even if you can advise of the studio contact so that we might go direct br br regards br br john
<START> i am always impressed when a director and this case director screenwriter takes a piece of classical text and makes it come alive sure shakespeare's text can give you <UNK> even when <UNK> out with self importance but to see a production where true <UNK> makes wonderful words even more so by the <UNK> of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply awe inspiring there are many <UNK> things about the play it is a racist play about racism and that still sticks i have never accepted <UNK> <UNK> of her father without any acceptable reason i have never accepted the position of <UNK> self <UNK> but brilliantly there is a text prologue which helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set and mercifully much of <UNK> part is cut br br the text is quite stripped down with many <UNK> cut but i only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when i expected to hear it and it was replaced by a look that said it all this economy and <UNK> editing has given us a gripping movie not just a film of the play br br and at last there is a <UNK> as to why antonio is so loyal and generous to the <UNK> unrelated you can almost feel <UNK> pulse start to race when he catches glimpse of passing by in a <UNK> or arriving for a visit but it is as subtle as that no more i was <UNK> br br there were many other highlights i felt the arguments during the trial to be heartbreaking and the trials are hilarious br br add all that to glorious cinematography and costumes that <UNK> with the times and you'll understand why i can't wait to see it again and again
<START> last year i fell in love with the tim <UNK> version of <UNK> todd so i wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and i found this one at the library though i think <UNK> is best probably because i like film a lot better than theater this is still a great production of the story i haven't seen any of the other versions but i am trying to get my hands on them br br after seeing johnny <UNK> as todd it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role but george does a fantastic job angela lansbury is great as always and all of the singing is fantastic i found myself singing along this is a play you won't want to miss but try and see it before you see the film version so you won't have a biased view like me
<START> if it was possible to give negative stars i would for this br br don't get me wrong i a good crappy movie i am a big fan of films like wizard of mars queen king and others real classics of b cinema br br but this film actually makes jack <UNK> and boris karloff in the terror look like an academy award winner the <UNK> is so needlessly long <UNK> and mostly <UNK> used ie i will now yes to your wishes the acting might have been a lot better if they had some more logical lines br br the story what story a count is <UNK> because his wife had <UNK> i'm still not sure on that count a rich fleet one and the <UNK> of one of his ships crash on the island people acting <UNK> ok i like camp in b films a lot there lies a lot of it's charm but this was just dumb plain dumb a <UNK> sea <UNK> who sounds as well <UNK> as a college professor a fleet owner who is as clueless as they come i felt this guy had no idea of how to play it one scene he's spanish acting the next english european the count who's not sure if he's a reincarnation or really don't ask me how figures into this after 4 beers my wife friend and i still couldn't figure it out br br the scare factor i could show this turkey to my small <UNK> and only worry about them sleeping through it i like a lot of early 60's horror movies and some still have good shocks but this thing never had a shock or even a hint of of a scare br br on the info on the back it says this movie contains scenes that are so vivid and <UNK> that they will <UNK> your worst nightmare the only <UNK> is watching this movie it's 90 mins the case says it's <UNK> mins of your life you do not get back br br i paid only a buck yes one buck for this and another film i still feel like i am <UNK> 50 cents for even sitting though this br br to sum up <UNK> of <UNK> had no one named <UNK> in it but it did have a lovely cardboard <UNK>
<START> a highly original film using a <UNK> of genres and film techniques to stunning and powerful effect all people involved gave only their very best and it shows on screen a committed film with a committed cast and crew simply brilliant just go and see it now
<START> largely forgettable monster film from the 50s features truly awful special effects the claw in question is a giant puppet that would make jim <UNK> want to kill himself i just saw the movie last <UNK> and i can't even tell you who was in it that's a bad sign i'm told that when the movie premiered audiences laughed it off the screen and that was in the 50s when standards in special effects were much lower basically i should have walked out of the theater as soon as the words produced by sam <UNK> came on the screen if i knew what was good for me but then i sat through also so i guess i deserve it
<START> american <UNK> is one of the best movies ever made i've seen it at least 30 times and am emotionally affected by it each time i see it i <UNK> from high school in <UNK> br br however more american <UNK> is one of the worst movies ever made br br it is hard to believe than anyone associated with the great original movie was involved with this terrible sequel the part of the movie set in vietnam was extremely inaccurate i served 18 months in vietnam with the <UNK> <UNK> division br br the whole movie had nothing worthwhile in any part of it br br if anyone ever wants to make a case against making sequels to great movies more american <UNK> would be the prime example of what can go wrong
<START> i am a huge fan of northern exposure men in trees is a complete knock off of northern exposure there's the city folk from new york stuck in a remote backwoods town <UNK> joel she immediately doesn't hit it off with a local jack maggie <UNK> the town only has one pilot who is not often available <UNK> is only one radio show and the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships too many parallels just like northern exposure except one obvious <UNK> has been altered in each character i'm bored give me something new to think about br br on the upside the writing is pretty good but if this was a school project it would certainly have earned the <UNK> of <UNK> br br perhaps people who love this show were <UNK> from the dedicated creativity and hard <UNK> of joshua brand and john
<START> br br it's common knowledge and has been said before no one can ever play scarlett and <UNK> like <UNK> leigh and clark gable <UNK> <UNK> kilmer no longer kilmer having been divorced from ex <UNK> val kilmer plays her own scarlett and although this is a sequel and not a re make god <UNK> she still cannot rise to the occasion i e her voice sounds evil on several occasions she's got brown eyes scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even <UNK> <UNK> eyes were green and her vocal power was not up to the job either scarlett is a southern belle therefore she has an incredible talent for <UNK> as she did in scarlett the novel and <UNK> of course and to be a great <UNK> like scarlett is you would most likely need a higher pitched voice like <UNK> leigh br br i suppose i'm comparing kilmer to leigh a bit too much but when someone possesses a role so masterfully as leigh did with scarlett you simply can't help but to criticize any new <UNK> timothy dalton should have had no accent whatsoever due to the fact that both margaret <UNK> <UNK> and gable in the film had none his acting has never been truly noteworthy except maybe his portrayal of the evil conniving king phillip of france in the lion in winter and he gives very little if any <UNK> or <UNK> to his <UNK> br br <UNK> in the cast are most notably tina a born actress with plenty of authenticity in her deliverance as the tragic victim mary boyle and then of course there's sean bean as the cold <UNK> and not to mention almost <UNK> evil lord <UNK> <UNK> nemesis and <UNK> eventual <UNK> one thing i could not forgive the writer for was the fact that scarlett is raped in this movie a fact that never occurred in the novel lord <UNK> is cold and of ill <UNK> among the irish in the book but he's nowhere near as heartless as his screen counterpart another <UNK> from the novel but for the film is the character of belle <UNK> played most horribly by ann <UNK> in a cameo role which we all could have lived without seeing as how the book was such a run away <UNK> without <UNK> any assistance from ms <UNK> br br for a film by itself scarlett is a very good one but not quite in that <UNK> of a place in terms of being gone with the winds sequel another actress was highly necessary for scarlett as well as <UNK> br br
<START> there's only one thing i'm going to say about cat in the hat as a kids movie and a good comedy movie it sucks i lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying as for the plot i completely forgot who cares it sucked anyway i'm not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the <UNK> talk and it overly succeeded but so what it was annoying don't see it it belongs in the bottom 100 the jokes are so <UNK> it's funny
<START> peter <UNK> film from the pen of steve is a relatively low key thriller that doesn't really manage to get off the ground story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential asian business man and the subsequent <UNK> of a pathetic vietnam veteran james woods who the police believe may have taken revenge on his ex <UNK> as the <UNK> william hurt never believes his friend is capable of such an act br br hurt is well below his usual strength and one finds it hard to <UNK> with him or an uninspired <UNK> weaver james woods and christopher plummer do a little better in their support roles worth noting is the appearance of morgan freeman as detective black br br in retrospect steve story is only an unlikely romance dressed up as a mystery flick the plot is far too contrived br br friday october 17 1997 video

<START> i didn't really know what to expect from future kill but i certainly hoped it would be a little better than what i got i knew the rating was bad and the reviews were but the <UNK> dvd cover <UNK> looks beyond cool and i can't resist that for a very long too long in fact time this film raised the impression of being an <UNK> sequel to <UNK> with lame vulgar and offensive <UNK> pranks five mega <UNK> one of them resembling an exact young clone of jim carrey desperately want to become members of a frat house but their ultimate <UNK> might just be a tad bit far fetched and dangerous they are dropped in the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces simultaneously with the <UNK> of a violent gang war it doesn't take too long before they are confronted with splatter a seemingly half man and half machine warrior who leads a gang of which i never really figured out who or what they were were they a government experiment <UNK> terminator <UNK> from a distant future does anyone care future kill is a bizarre amateur flick with a scenario that leaps from one subject onto the other without any form of logical connection or narrative the plot borrows vital elements from great cinematic cult classics like the warriors escape from new york and the terminator but the end result is one gigantic sci fi monstrosity the costumes and special effects are quite <UNK> and there's a <UNK> of cheap and gratuitous nudity the acting is terrible but i'm willing to blame the retarded dialogs instead of the cast members one to avoid at all costs in spite of really cool dvd cover art resist it
<START> this wonderful film is a love story and shows that not all relationships are destined to last even so they can be great worth the pain suffering of <UNK> br br director gives us an insight of the period around <UNK> the way society <UNK> treats women and how a very strong woman deals with with great costumes landscapes lovely music and good actors and acting this draws you in for the length of the movie br br at first the ending is a bit sudden a page describing the rest of her life <UNK> on reflection this is a great the best way to have your own fantasy create the rest of her life br br this was the second movie for me that had people sit while the end titles by the first being <UNK> list apparently the movie had this effect on everybody
<START> a friend and i went to see this movie we have opposite opinions about but after watching this movie we agree on the following the <UNK> way to have an inaccurate documentary is to make it about a foreign country in which you were not present when the events happened no matter how talented or how much you <UNK> in the film if you are truly looking to learn about another countries history watch something made by natives of that country otherwise you won't be able step away from your bubble and those who try to force their views and opinions about something to which they don't belong are really <UNK> their power to make it even worse the director chose to not talk about the embarrassing involvement of the cia with regime she decides to <UNK> dealing with the only subject for witch her country has much to explain to <UNK> but this is not surprising because both the director and the cia are <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> by trying to affect the <UNK> <UNK> at very different levels of course br br if the director was really interested in helping <UNK> she would have <UNK> a native to make the documentary in any case there are numerous <UNK> made documentaries films and books about the subject such include <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> las <UNK> de la etc the director of the fall of should spend her time <UNK> the numerous problems in her own country or at least the involvement of her country in the matters of other nations
<START> this movie really sucks this is my second review because its so bad the girl on the cover is hot but the girl in the movie is not i cant believe it was rated r there is no violence no sex no nudity no swearing nothing really crap film
<START> i've been a huge fan of the videos jackass and <UNK> la <UNK> for a long time they've had a great run and i expected my laughter to end eventually but it hasn't yet this movie kept my mouth open the entire time i'm still laughing randomly i went to the theater with low expectations thinking it wasn't going to be better than the first oh how incredibly wrong i was br br there were many great moments in the movie if you're <UNK> don't like randomly placed raw humor or if you disliked the first movie you probably won't like this but with that said i almost wet my pants from laughing so hard it had all kinds of different pranks <UNK> humor toilet humor <UNK> laughing some great falls and massive damage done to all of the cast ryan <UNK> even <UNK> rear end with an image that will be stuck there for a long time i'm sure you can only imagine how raw this movie is br br no pain no gain right this movie has already done well causing theaters all over america to laugh so hard they'll be wishing it could last longer i know i did this movie did not feel short at all especially with the credits continuing the footage but i still wish it could've gone on forever now let's just wait and see when they release jackass number 3 overall an excellent film if you can get past the male nudity and a few sickening images keep your kids out of this film they don't need to see this at least until they are older support the crew and buy this when it comes out on dvd i know i will
<START> this movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie unhappy are not pleased with being out west so they hire a drunk <UNK> master john candy to lead them back east sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one and richard lewis gets on your nerves very quickly but then i honestly don't like him at anything he does ed <UNK> is hilarious as the bumbling villain br br the movie was dedicated to candy he died from a massive heart attack ten days before the movie was completed a stand in and digital <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character to be seen in the final scenes candy was a very good comedian and gave us some real good <UNK> <UNK> belly laughs in his career this movie was just not the caliber of his best br br also in the film you will recognize william <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ethan phillips ellen greene and rodney a grant

<START> screenwriter steve <UNK> effort following upon the wildly <UNK> breaking away is a <UNK> of clichés coincidence and <UNK> melodrama perhaps he lived some of this if so i'm sorry to say he was inexplicably unable to <UNK> any of it convincingly br br in fairness he's not helped much here by arthur penn a talented director who's done remarkable work in the past bonnie and clyde little big man but fails to <UNK> any energy or <UNK> into narrative br br the cast struggles as best they can but are <UNK> with weak motivation and dialogue <UNK> should be reserved particularly for craig <UNK> whose <UNK> performance <UNK> the impending quick fade of his leading man career as well as the embarrassingly <UNK> <UNK> miscast as the film's extremely unlikely <UNK> fatale ' br br it all seems longer than it is and any points made are heavy handed and obvious see arthur <UNK> earlier take on the subject of the 60's the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> restaurant it's everything this one isn't
<START> i'm no director or writer or anything related to a movie but watching more than 1 movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not so here it is the quick and the undead is a rip off of the quick and the dead i was thinking that it could be a little bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it but oh no i was really in for an very big disappointment br br to put it simply the movie sucks i'm a big fan of gore movies but this one just gives you gore here and there but they are not that consistent br br but i have to give them credit in creating gruesome characters which has given me a little bit of <UNK> br br if you're a big fan of zombies watch this if you're not better look for other rob zombie films
<START> first of all the nature in the movie is beautiful and there is a bit of <UNK> music well the horses looked <UNK> and the <UNK> but that's about all what was <UNK> in it oh is played by a <UNK> actress albeit a lame performance but she is pretty which <UNK> a bit the lack of performance on her part br br but i totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful to watch piece of 1 30 hour fantasy created by mr <UNK> the plot totally lacked any sense of <UNK> there was no logic behind the development of the plot in fact there was hardly any story at all just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in <UNK> clothes speaking some kinda <UNK> that is supposed to sound like <UNK> most actors were either japanese russian or chinese most scenes were shot in china <UNK> or russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a <UNK> the dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow the battle scenes are laughable all the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story br br the japanese actor was like a wooden doll and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> he looked sleepy soft stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie br br and i don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste to see khan half of the movie as a slave to see his two first kids be born from other men to see his wife selling herself to the <UNK> my blood starts to <UNK> and where is the beautiful story about the friendship between and one could make a great movie out of it where is the story of the rise of of his childhood of his relationship with his family with his brothers of how he <UNK> to survive among mighty enemies of his family where is van khan who helped him a lot where is the depiction of life in the of the life of the <UNK> of their traditions of their relations with the other nations around them br br where is development of the characters we totally fail to see what brought together with and what brought them apart and most important how became khan how he an <UNK> with no wealth and military power managed to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history all this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters but unfortunately we didn't see any of it in <UNK> creation not even a glimpse
<START> back in 1993 <UNK> released a dull lackluster video game of one of the biggest films of all time quickly realizing their mistake they <UNK> out a different version of the game claiming it would be bigger <UNK> and better br br neither were both were slow boring games br br you can choose to be either dr alan grant or a <UNK> both have their problems why would dr grant go around killing all those army guys just what are they doing in the game and why a <UNK> be killing other <UNK> weird br br obviously not learning from their first mistake <UNK> really dropped the ball on the original release and the so called rampage edition one of the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i have ever played
<START> i am a <UNK> year old man on a rainy afternoon my wife suggested that we go see the women after reading the reviews i thought it might lead to an afternoon <UNK> wrong this movie held my interest from start to finish it was great to finally see meg ryan looking super again let's face it meg looks much better with long hair <UNK> <UNK> looked different to me in every scene she was in <UNK> <UNK> is showing her age as is carrie fisher the daughter molly was exceptionally acted by young india i was able to understand the dialog which is tough in many current films due to rapid speech <UNK> <UNK> and the woman from <UNK> were terrific as the <UNK> who <UNK> their regular duties the nyc scenes were nice to see oh and bette midler had a short role but as usual was terrific so i gave this chick flick a 9 guys go see this even just for the eye candy like eva <UNK> it won't disappoint
<START> the box is one of the strangest movies i have ever seen to explain my experience let me use this word picture imagine that you have been on <UNK> sticks and paint <UNK> for the last month while watching nothing but twilight zone reruns the resulting coma lands you in a hospital where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting <UNK> into your iv the dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie br br summary a man shows up at the door of a couple he gives them a box with a button on it press the button they will get a million dollars in cash and a person they don't know will die i'll try not to spoil anything but from there things <UNK> into a plot so <UNK> and complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity but hey most of us have been sane for a while now and change is good br br pros amazing storyline overall good acting not a slow moment once it gets going it asks questions of human morality that are rarely if ever asked in popular culture this movie is deep it has meaning its not summer blockbuster special effects fluff not that there's anything wrong with that this movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places but i think it is perhaps that very thing that makes me like it so much br br cons the first twenty minutes before it gets going are really quite slow at the end of the movie you will be so confused that you just have to sit down and think for a good half hour i can guarantee that this movie will not get rave reviews from your peers or most critics it is far too strange and there aren't explosions every three seconds in fact there are no explosions of any kind in this movie besides your brain popping from trying to understand exactly what the heck just happened personally i don't think this is a bad thing but many will br br rating easily a 9 10 i have never had an experience like watching this movie the only reason i can't give it a 10 10 is that it is just too wrapped up in itself there are several large things left unexplained at the end that are still <UNK> me as i sit here writing this but overall this is the best experience i have had in a movie theater in quite a long time but be warned you will not like this movie if you can't sit back turn on your suspension of disbelief to about 150 and prepare your brain to do some impressive <UNK> br br visit www com for more reviews
<START> its very tough to portray a <UNK> novel along cinematographic lines and if you forget an obscure production of 1967 then its the first time that <UNK> has been done on a grand scale overall the sets looked fantastic with the right touches for making a successful period drama so used to doing crass commercial stuff made a good effort i saw the version and found that voice was dubbed which made her dialog delivery a bit poor while the director did a good job portraying each of the characters with <UNK> yet there was very little in the way of meaningful plot probably a lack of the story itself however the development of the characters including those with minor roles seem to be the strongest point its tough to make some <UNK> stories into films as only the visual parts seem to get realized
<START> not all movies should have that predictable ending that we are all so use to and it's great to see movies with really unusual twists however with that said i was really disappointed in ending in my opinion the ending didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie and it basically destroyed the story that was being told br br you spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings but the events in the final 2 minutes of the movie would have <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> character but the movie ends and leaves it all too wide open br br overall though this movie was very well made and unlike similar movies such as <UNK> all the scenes were believable and didn't go over the top
<START> twins effect is a poor film in so many respects the only good element is that it doesn't take itself seriously other than that this is not really a movie but rather a <UNK> tool for the film's two stars popular pop <UNK> in their native hong kong br br the film itself is poorly constructed and acted the direction offers up some silly martial arts which is odd since the action director and supposedly co director is <UNK> <UNK> like many hong kong films <UNK> for the teen audience the major <UNK> of actors like the twins the two girls who stars in this film and <UNK> <UNK> there is so much bad music to <UNK> the audience into believing certain scenes are funny clever etc br br the final conclusion it's all for <UNK> even as a fan of hong kong movies this is a poor film not funny enough not serious enough and just generally too bubble <UNK> fake for its own good br br 3 out of 10 br br go to http www <UNK> com for a more in depth review of this movie and other foreign films
<START> this isn't so bad it's good it's so bad it <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> on cruel and unusual punishment only by reading the synopsis can you even figure out the plot of this straight to video disaster it's a <UNK> <UNK> of grainy stock footage spliced together with some of the all time worst acting you'll ever have the misfortune to see comparing this incompetent turgid <UNK> mess to dead men don't wear <UNK> is like saying that <UNK> is like citizen kane the talentless cast are <UNK> in cheap j c <UNK> to church clothes and there isn't the slightest attempt at period <UNK> or make up if you really want to see how this sort of homage can work check out the lost <UNK> of <UNK> it's clever well written and best of all performed by actual actors who aren't such agony to watch for that matter seek out the work of phoenix artist paul wilson whose sci fi short the attack of the 70 foot courtesy lady leaves this film in the dust the people in terror in the <UNK> look and sound like they were pulled off the street and given their scripts to read during the one and only take this is an insult to bela lugosi boris karloff <UNK> <UNK> and anyone else involved in the films they <UNK> to make this schlock fest money isn't the problem a lot can be accomplished with very little expense a good script decent actors and above z grade costumes and production design should have been a given before the so called director created this <UNK> pile of cinematic <UNK> let's hope the promise of a sequel doesn't come true that was by far the scariest thing shown in the whole movie
<START> what is it now a days that minority comedians feel its okay to <UNK> their minority and expect to get away with it br br carlos <UNK> is no george lopez there is a difference when watching comedian carlos <UNK> i think he hates his own people and more than that i think he was forced to pattern his show as the hispanic latino spanish version of the dave show what a horrible mistake note to <UNK> please do not do a block party movie as much as i would like to see <UNK> el christina jennifer lopez and the reunion of the cast of <UNK> da <UNK> on one stage don't br br carlos <UNK> likes to use the word as much as dave liked using the n word neither is funny and neither is acceptable even if it's from own <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also likes to say if you're offended too bad it's not the offense it's the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted br br <UNK> <UNK> goes further he everyone for what he assumes is comedy it's not comedy it's not funny there is a <UNK> to being able to look at yourself and make others laugh out of comedy and not laugh out of <UNK> stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning br br mind of <UNK> needs <UNK> because carlos <UNK> needs <UNK> find out what is funny and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then do it until then the show mind of <UNK> is a pass
<START> the opening scene of the beach at while amusing in itself unfortunately provides a suitable metaphor for the film insipid and washed out it is actually not as corny as most of the others in the carry on series but maybe because of that doesn't really deliver much fun it's a fair bet that the title will appeal to fans of the benny hill show but those looking for attractive females in <UNK> and <UNK> while they will see some in this will probably enjoy some of the other titles in the series such as carry on abroad or carry on up the jungle more the <UNK> of early 1970s <UNK> is used as a plot device which seems rather self <UNK>
<START> in out was a funny comedy with good performances by joan cusack tom <UNK> matt dillon and kevin kline the thought of kevin kline being gay was very funny if i was him i would hate to say i'm gay at his own wedding with his family friends and his going to be wife there very seldom would that ever happen i also loved when he was dancing around when the voice on the radio was talking to him i'd say that in out was a silly comedy with a lot of laughs and <UNK> this is a recommended comedy and kevin kline had a great performance as a gay guy trust me you'll like this movie br br 7 10
<START> this film has possibly the worst title for a <UNK> short ever <UNK> up somewhat fitting given the actual fifteen minute content br br i can do without any of the <UNK> a d stuff but i will admit to having a few lol moments from the two man comedy offered by moe and larry in some of the new footage and kudos to those guys for trying to give it their all considering the position they were forced into in even making these dogs br br another bright spot to this and the last a d <UNK> <UNK> on the ocean is the decided lack of screen time for joe palma and the back of his head no attempts to have him speak or <UNK> his arms like a chicken see hot stuff may be worth an extra rating point br br 2 10
<START> i saw this film at school and absolutely loved it based on a true story this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film seriously i couldn't find anything wrong with it one definite plus is how it was filmed set in <UNK> in <UNK> the wind and the lion is filled with stirring images like the great on <UNK> especially the cinematography was <UNK> the editing was crisp the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking and i have to mention the music from jerry <UNK> it was phenomenal i have used this phrase a lot recently but <UNK> ain't my favourite film composer for nothing his score here is so rousing and exciting it shows the man's true musical genius and this gem of a score should be up there with <UNK> best scores with legend rambo first blood <UNK> and the secret of <UNK> br br the action is <UNK> and the screenplay is intelligent and sophisticated the direction is <UNK> handled too the performances were astounding as well with sean connery ever the picture of charisma and <UNK> magnificent as the great he almost <UNK> the entire picture on his own he is joined by a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> john huston and a captivating brian keith in one of his more understated performances the history is fairly accurate perhaps flimsy in some areas but with the acting music and visuals so good i am past caring 10 10 <UNK> cox
<START> just saw this movie on opening night i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it i must say i was not impressed i'm so <UNK> that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money br br first of all the is very predictable and just not much of a thriller it might be scary for someone under 13 but it really did nothing for me the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution br br furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub par suspense scenes br br if you've seen previews for this movie then you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters
<START> the <UNK> man is one of the best foreign films i have ever seen all the technical aspects are in my opinion perfect lighting acting directing pacing etc the story is breathtaking br br seemingly beyond death our main character finds himself <UNK> a world without beauty passion or anything remotely pleasing to the human senses his work is cold and uninteresting his relationships are <UNK> and uninspiring and when it all becomes too much he seeks to end it in front of a train but it doesn't end he can not leave this strange world by suicide working his way back to a man who seemed to be feeling he same isolation and loneliness our main character joins him in <UNK> a stone wall in hopes of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music just as they break through and i will not reveal that much it all comes to an end and the movie ends as oddly as it began br br suffice it to say you will either love this movie or hate it i feel that it is like a magical poem open to many different interpretations and all of them as valid as the next if you enjoy new experiences in film and want to be taken away from hollywood's crap feast try this movie br br 9 10 and i don't rate easily because in spite of its darkness this movie left me with a sense of something greater something mysterious and beyond ourselves well done
<START> i am surprised that so many viewers didn't find all the symbolism in the movie it's what made the movie an incredible work of art the story deals with some of the saddest content a movie could hold yet it is one of the best movies i've ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the storyline br br if you will pay close attention the message is there the younger brother is killed by the <UNK> the older brother made up the story about the <UNK> flying as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death there are those that would argue why would he lie to his own children with the story to me the answer is because he doesn't want to share such <UNK> with his own children or that he has <UNK> it out and replaced his memory of the horrific event with the thought of his brother flying away to safety i've read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered although this is an interesting idea i love the imagination used to come up with that i don't think he would have <UNK> to his own children about having a little brother but i do find it plausible that he would have <UNK> about his little brother's death however i like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at all br br there are many different takes you can have on the movie but if you take the movie at face value two brothers creating a <UNK> that flies to escape an abusive <UNK> you've missed the brilliance the fact that i was able to see the subtle messages in the script were what made the movie so incredible to me it requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work dig deep when you watch it you'll be amazed at the genius contained in the film the only other movie i've seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is <UNK> but that's a comment for another movie
<START> <UNK> is not <UNK> for his outstanding directorial skills in fact nobody cares as long as they got the laughs quite a few here to be honest scattered in the whole process thanks to <UNK> half wit characterization and the dialogue <UNK> puts in his mouth br br but this is not enough to make a great comedy since there's no movie outside of the usual <UNK> premise a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character in la or les there was a real story going on over the fire vs water proceedings le diner de cons although it was a play managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe would cause in <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> about the vengeance is both redundant and too weak to <UNK> our interest plus the <UNK> are lame both on screen and in the script br br now what's wrong <UNK> <UNK> this up creating no action no rhythm instead he uses <UNK> and <UNK> maybe he met william <UNK> in hollywood and the really <UNK> that lack of nerve and a <UNK> in the story br br so you'll have to be content with <UNK> performance
<START> now and again a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity we just finished studying the novel <UNK> <UNK> at school and decided to <UNK> our memory of this <UNK> piece of <UNK> garbage with the bbc adaptation br br the funny thing about <UNK> <UNK> is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself the film is nothing like the book for example the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes john looks like a <UNK> on acid while <UNK> plays the role of slut catherine the main character is the most <UNK> stupid and irritating actress on god's earth she looks like a coffee addict her eyes are like whilst mr looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double the plot goes completely off the <UNK> at certain points of the film i don't know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all a 7 year old black kid who we've never met before takes the main character out of the <UNK> and starts in front of her yes that's right nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by <UNK> fantasies in which she is being carried around a <UNK> by an ogre br br <UNK> <UNK> is basically visual <UNK> so if you want to murder your boss or something like that bbc have basically discovered a new way to kill someone <UNK> is a barely laughably bad film don't watch it unless you're in a padded cell
<START> at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of <UNK> called 'the final at least where i come from a bloke is trained by an ex cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood and that's about it lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue has one of the <UNK> array of costumes i've seen in a film for a while and a massive <UNK> which is apparently only run by 7 people great job on the dubbing too guys best moment when our hero loses a <UNK> and is about to be <UNK> through the neck he just gets out his gun and bang why not do that earlier it's a mystery as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place i'm still puzzling over that one myself now 2 10
<START> i rated this one better than awful because i liked seeing <UNK> from buffy in something again even if it was the same role br br first the concept is kind of cute for a short but not an entire movie the writing was forced and contrived i have the feeling that the movie suffered the most during editing br br second amanda <UNK> always looks like her eyes are crossed even when she's not trying to do it she's just not funny she always plays some sort of <UNK> girl who <UNK> by being herself ironic considering amanda seems to always be a caricature i would actually like to see her in something serious i really want to give her a chance but she is always cast in these trite roles where she and makes faces and somehow that's a good thing br br finally the whole i'm a <UNK> segment was ripped off from revenge of the <UNK> there was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable br br shame shame shame
<START> successful films on <UNK> subjects are rare but <UNK> morgana is a good case you can <UNK> up the large subject to the ambitions of youth but <UNK> does an amazingly good job the movie's point is to show human beings and even the world from a non human point of view br br the movie is in three parts creation paradise and the golden age the imagery of each is in <UNK> to the voice over although the text of the from the a <UNK> myth refers to the <UNK> <UNK> the scene goes no further in <UNK> the myth it <UNK> on the waste and on various <UNK> of destruction fire smoke <UNK> vehicles the images from <UNK> are anything but that and the golden <UNK> is darkly comic  the highest culture is the strange <UNK> musical act br br the suggests that mankind is the central object of creation but the movie does everything it can to <UNK> this notion its <UNK> <UNK> has no <UNK> in human historical time there are no human characters to speak of when a boy stands with a dog in an extended shot the initial suggestion is of the boy's point of view by the end it is much more the <UNK> likewise the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it and the <UNK> partner barely looks human with his big <UNK> br br animal stories and nature documentaries always but <UNK> morgana has none of that certainly the <UNK> look like a female body but the cuts both ways presumably only humans can <UNK> easily between their creation and nature and here <UNK> and <UNK> are presented alongside mountains <UNK> and <UNK> people and civilization are all part of a <UNK> natural landscape br br in 1979 <UNK> put a new twist on the idea when he remade <UNK> from the <UNK> point of view
<START> good lord this movie needs to have a new <UNK> on its cover watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do i am disappointed i was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend needed an <UNK> rush and that awesome <UNK> sensation going down my spine but this movie didn't do it a reasonably good story but pretty awful acting dialogue and filming it was disjointed and sometimes outright silly we had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera people talking out loud by themselves and <UNK> what they feel and what is going to happen shadows of equipment in some shots silly clichés like i just need you to hold me in the totally wrong places and situations thank you for allowing me to and sorry if i'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money
<START> you know i was very surprised when watching this movie it aired during the day once when i was sick and having nothing else to do i continued watching this is by far the worst movie ever but to my surprise i kept watching i sat there saying this is terrible but yet didn't change the channel because i was so amused at how bad it was maybe it was the guy that looked like big tom from survivor or the dreadful <UNK> and these characters had that kept me watching however the girls weren't half bad but if that's what you want there is far better oh and there's ninjas and boys br br so if you like bad acting hilarious and terrible dialogue and two twins who are five feet tall and killing everything in their sight then this movie is for you it's so bad it's good however i just had to give it a 1 out of ten i couldn't have put a 10 on it up there with lord of the rings br br enjoy
<START> move over <UNK> back off <UNK> it doesn't take a baby genius to know that <UNK> beach vampires for the rest of this <UNK> is now and always will be unless someone makes a sequel to the <UNK> the worst film ever the only horror in this thing is watching it i wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie if this was the case the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie it's dreck no wait i <UNK> the word dreck by calling it dreck <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> man fame would call it uber dreck or it should be used to torture prisoners if you find it on a shelf in a video store back away from it quietly and <UNK> the authorities
<START> since watching the trailer in the little mermaid ii return to the sea dvd i had a feeling that this movie is gonna be great 'cause i am a huge disney fan and guess what i'm right this movie is a very worthy <UNK> to the original classic lady and the tramp br br it tells the story of <UNK> lady and son <UNK> who wants to be wild and free instead of living a life though the movie might not be as good as the first one it has a great moral that you couldn't find anywhere else until you watch it br br i admit that the movie isn't for everyone but those of you who hate it all i can say is that you don't have a spirit for this and i suggest that you shouldn't go see it again but hey it's really an awesome story packed with brilliant animation music and star <UNK> voice talents featuring scott wolf party of five and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so if you haven't seen the movie why standing there go and grab the copy
<START> it is great to see a new <UNK> of puppets creating havoc in this series i found this chapter a lot of fun in fact it would probably be my second favorite in the series this movie has very little violence and is only rated pg 13 this is notably different from the other r rated puppet master movies which were loaded with gore and violent mayhem the lack of violence does not <UNK> the fun though this film also has notably better special effects than the last movie in this series good
<START> is one of my favorite books thus i was looking forward to this film unfortunately the film is absolutely horrible the dialog is so bad it sounds like <UNK> half the time the new storyline makes me think they took the book and a couple of <UNK> threw them in a <UNK> and used what came out for the screenplay it's a disgrace to the book and independent film making the only reason i even managed to get all the way through the film was my hopes that it'd get better unfortunately it only got worse <UNK> in a really retarded ending br br that's not to say everything about the movie is bad the cg is acceptable in a 1990's <UNK> sort of way which i assume is what they were going for and i suppose you can't go wrong with people getting chopped in half and <UNK> blood all over the place
<START> miles <UNK> stars as <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> hero who resembles a dancer the conan wannabe must do battle with an evil guy in a cher wig and protect the earth from the <UNK> a sort of primitive atomic bomb watch closely for visible <UNK> and tire tracks mystery science theater 3000 made fun of it under the title cave <UNK>
<START> this movie took me by surprise the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation after that we're <UNK> into a semi cheesy production <UNK> its low budget the characters typical american teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this by the time the hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities it's a slow <UNK> set up kind of like the ride up a <UNK> of a really tall roller coaster thankfully once the action kicks in it's full blown old school horror steve <UNK> make up effects are awesome equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films and the scares are <UNK> kevin <UNK> delivers his best movie ever with heart stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set ups the tongue in cheek sometimes cheesy humor marks this film as pure 80s horror as opposed to the <UNK> tone of earlier genre fare like night of the living dead or hills have eyes but for true horror fans this one is worth checking out play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of house on the haunted hill the set up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually <UNK>
<START> jamie foxx does a fine job of <UNK> the famous blues soul country singer ray charles to the film's credit it shows both the good and the bad regarding <UNK> character and the choices he made both personally and <UNK> br br this is a slick looking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place not only does it look good it sounds good i only wish there was more music in here when it's inserted it's fabulous but there isn't enough of it br br assuming at least for review purposes that the story was true i was impressed and disappointed with charles meaning the story left some memorable impressions since i'm writing this 16 months after viewing it main impressions include br br good re living <UNK> immense talent and his <UNK> to step out and take chances <UNK> such as going country for awhile the man had supreme confidence in himself but didn't come across as arrogant about it also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction with no help that's just amazing br br bad i also remember through this film how easily hooked ray got in the first place and disappointed he was so <UNK> to his wife a really sad comment was that his wife was more upset with him for missing his kid's little league games than she was for all the cheating he was doing on her even <UNK> a child with a member of his singing group br br the only negative i had with the filmmakers was the <UNK> of his problems being blamed on one early childhood event the accidental death of his brother that tragedy was used as cop out for all <UNK> as an adult which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions br br note there is an extended version with the dvd but word has it that it is so poorly edited that it's not worth watching so stick with the theatrical version
<START> it's not really about wine no real targets are those who would <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> of local wine production for business purposes to this end he has made an excellent objective film spirited <UNK> emotional and flawed independent wine producers are <UNK> with media and <UNK> europeans the art of wine making against market driven product <UNK> it's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion br br film is occasionally <UNK> to watch cameras are neither <UNK> nor <UNK> by any means there are also plenty of <UNK> as well as subtitles to <UNK> through often too short a time on screen br br however it does <UNK> michael moore at the game moore can't play anyway the characters speak for and therefore <UNK> themselves well worth a viewing 7 10
<START> paul <UNK> and his brother leonard wrote <UNK> and in so doing clearly drew parallels between the life of <UNK> <UNK> and his work the film is divided into four sections beauty art action and the <UNK> day when <UNK> held an army general hostage and spoke to the <UNK> only to have it <UNK> him and his <UNK> ideals of the samurai code <UNK> committed ritual <UNK> on november 25 1970 and he planned it as a <UNK> of beauty art and action <UNK> edits scenes <UNK> that day with three different scenarios from novels temple of the golden house and runaway horses the moment of <UNK> is perfectly realized in relation to its shocking climax via pulling back the camera while simultaneously <UNK> in br br black and white sequences are <UNK> with the colorful moments depicted in novels the black and white scenes represent memories from childhood and youth <UNK> <UNK> some of these <UNK> moments with scenes from the novels that often parallel real life such as his <UNK> development of his <UNK> obsession and his <UNK> of the samurai code each of the three themes of beauty art and action is <UNK> in the chosen depictions from the respective novels the color sequences are reminiscent of early <UNK> technicolor films giving the film perhaps an intended surreal quality considering the subject matter br br ken plays the real <UNK> with <UNK> determination headed to the <UNK> office on that <UNK> day and resembles the real <UNK> <UNK> took tremendous risks with this film in focusing on the novels he did and with <UNK> them <UNK> to both personal life and his literary ambitions the editing of the film between the three main sections of november 25 1970 the black and white growing up segments and the colorful novel scenes clearly point to the deliberate <UNK> of these elements of beauty art and action in life at times it is difficult to follow and there may be little to recommend for the <UNK> viewer of 4 stars
<START> if you are like me and you bought the new <UNK> d album the day it came out and went into the film knowing all the lyrics to all the songs then you will certainly enjoy this film yes i am biased as a huge <UNK> d fan but i really did like this film which made me chuckle quite a lot br br this movie was pretty much everything i expected comedic genius backed up by great <UNK> and some great cameos from ben stiller and tim robbins i particularly enjoyed tim <UNK> part br br if however you are unfamiliar with <UNK> <UNK> hbo series and fantastic debut album then this may not have quite the same comedic impact on you i would still recommend you go and watch that because it still worth every <UNK> of the admission price and will make you smile even if you aren't in <UNK> the whole time
<START> we start all of our reviews with the following information my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years recently we were <UNK> by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost so we can see whatever we want whenever we want the point of this is that critics count for zero your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not therefore it is our belief that if you get your <UNK> worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us we never ever listen or read the critics we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us well enough about that br br when meryl streep the head of the in the movie says the united states does not torture it got a big laugh at this movie it is of course a lie that the bush administration has denied time and again it is a very good movie and it is scary in what they can do to us as we lose all of our civil rights they can simply snatch you anywhere and tell know one that they have done it in this case they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9 11 he is of course just like you or i and so they take him to a secret location outside of the us to torture and him br br very frightening well acted by jake and reese and the entire cast
<START> this is an utterly forgettable picture a friend of mine picked it up in a bargain bin at a local rental place for 50 he should have <UNK> a <UNK> or at least a <UNK> br br the plot is something like this a giant monster threatens the earth and aliens decide that the most average human being on the planet must be chosen to save the earth thus a tiny <UNK> space alien appears before a <UNK> worker and tells him that he's it br br the devil is in the details when it's time to rate a movie and on that count the <UNK> fails miserably the monster only has a few brief moments on the screen <UNK> maybe 5 minutes tops with a generous <UNK> the cute alien <UNK> has even less screen time and might be the most interesting character to look at and only because she's wearing a <UNK> <UNK> stereotype outfit complete with a <UNK> short <UNK> the climactic final battle with the monster is over before you can say <UNK> tango <UNK> over in the next moment you are left to <UNK> whether you've just experienced a train wreck or if someone just <UNK> 3 <UNK> of blood out of you br br admittedly though this movie did deliver one line that my friends and i to this day still repeat and laugh at and was about the only bright spot in this otherwise abysmal picture as the cast of protagonists is being <UNK> by the <UNK> one of them responds to the questions with the statement what are you some kind of a question it is delivered in such a preposterous manner that if you're sitting with a group of friends who won't be your friends long if you actually talked your friend into watching this you may actually experience a <UNK> or two of <UNK> laughter br br while this is no <UNK> or it's not even bad enough to be <UNK> bad this movie will still bore you with its awful dialog unimaginative characters and nonexistent special effects and still deserves to inhabit the bottom 100 br br 1 5 10
<START> as a sci fi and casual angelina jolie fan i thought this obviously low budget movie might be worth a look maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults plus it might be interesting to watch angelina as she was <UNK> on her star bound career br br oh how wrong i was one thing i learned at 18 angelina jolie couldn't act so to make her comfortable the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldn't act seeing this jack palance who can actually act decided to <UNK> watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes out br br to the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script insipid dialog bottom of the barrel cinematography in fact add bottom of the barrel everything br br the story features angelina as a cyborg <UNK> by her corporate <UNK> as an assassin she escapes the corporate <UNK> with the help of her combat <UNK> the corporation sends bounty hunters after them stupid stuff happens the end i would tell you more but i didn't want to waste my life watching this dreck br br i <UNK> you this is not worth watching its not even worth thinking about watching save yourself the pain and move on
<START> frank sinatra has one of his best roles as a <UNK> heroin addict coming back to his chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic he plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer but he can't avoid running into his old friends he had been arrested originally not for any drug related charge but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game his skill at poker has earned him the <UNK> of the man with the golden arm and the men who run the game one of them being his former heroin connection want him to deal again meanwhile frank has to take care of a woman whom he injured in a car accident <UNK> parker and make up with his old girlfriend molly kim novak the film is great at putting us in sinatra's mental state when he feels sure of himself at the beginning of the film i felt good for him but when a promised phone call doesn't come one day he <UNK> into depression and goes back on the <UNK> later when he finally gets to audition he arrives completely strung out his embarrassment when he can't play the correct beat is devastating he had such big dreams and the other musicians don't even pay him a bit of attention as he rushes out of the room the film moves quickly and it shows <UNK> drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture the actors are uniformly fine elmer <UNK> score is one of the best of its time the only thing i don't like about the film is the ending br br spoilers br br although i really like the character of and parker is very good in the film they could have done a little more to fill in her <UNK> the ending is a little too pat while there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film <UNK> death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly frank is free to love molly and he won't go to jail also his dealer is dead so at least the immediate threat is gone well i guess in hollywood there's always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package it <UNK> the film a little but as it stands it's still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction i can think of 9 10
<START> this movie is one of the worst i've ever seen even being <UNK> didn't help the plot is lousy if existent the relatively large number of beautiful girls are unable to help i guess seeing an episode of temptation island with the sound turned of would give the same kind of experience do not see this flick
<START> 1st watched 2 18 2007 4 out of 10 <UNK> leon leonard fair adventure movie based on a novel by the author of <UNK> dick fame herman <UNK> this movie is about the captain of a ship who had stolen the eyes that were extremely rare black <UNK> from a native <UNK> god <UNK> and hidden them somewhere that only he knew about before leaving the island of he got very sick and was on a secret voyage to go back to the island to retrieve the <UNK> for himself while others like his daughter thought that he was going back to be treated by the local medicine man others didn't know the reason for the voyage a <UNK> actually knew the real reason for the trip to return the eyes to their god the silly part is that the <UNK> were hidden very close to the statue and all this time the natives ran their tribe without their god having eyes causing them all kinds of problems along the way we are treated for some reason to a short underwater nature show with an electric <UNK> fighting a local <UNK> i guess only herman <UNK> knows what this was all about once they get to the island the captain dies but passes the <UNK> of the <UNK> to his daughter but she also gets the sickness curse as well one of the bad guys finds out where the god is <UNK> and convinces the daughter to go there and steal back the <UNK> but at this point the good guys find out what's going on and a fight ensues i won't tell you the results of the fight or the ending i'll leave that up to you to find out if you want as i said earlier the movie was ok but some very silly things that i've already mentioned <UNK> it's impact i wonder if that new pirates of the <UNK> got some of it's plot from this one <UNK> black <UNK> a curse i well it doesn't matter those elements didn't make for a very good movie in this case or the other it seems they would learn they're lesson but with the money rolling in on that newer movie i'm sure they won't oh well
<START> to be brief the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away but gene kelly rita hayworth and an <UNK> young phil <UNK> keep the movie <UNK> throughout and at times lift it right up into the air a few of the songs are terrible <UNK> poor john is a train wreck but most of them are great fun and the scene of hayworth performing on the <UNK> huge set for kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed another treat is the perfect faux nyc sets in the best hollywood tradition br br another attraction if you consider such things <UNK> is the <UNK> awful male <UNK> toward women the <UNK> <UNK> and transparent that passed for male charm back then in the movies at least is presented in its most lurid form here some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf br br one minor disappointment is eve <UNK> trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything i can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and <UNK> a missed opportunity
<START> john career as a film director was extraordinary we had watched this film when it first came out but wanted to see it again when it showed on cable recently the film has a faded look as one watches it today but still it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two principals br br if you haven't seen it please don't read any further br br chris and were two childhood friends that came from upper middle class backgrounds chris went to enter a <UNK> to be a priest but gives up became a small time drug user and <UNK> the two lives seem to run parallel as the pair become involved in an illegal activity that will prove their short <UNK> in fact it shows how both young men <UNK> in their attempt to fool the cia and the soviet union these two in a way were so naive in thinking they could pull something that bigger and better <UNK> people couldn't even imagine could be done br br <UNK> motivation is legitimate as he feels <UNK> in discovering the <UNK> role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations in this case australia something he finds by sheer coincidence when he involves we know the whole thing is doomed because no one into drugs as he is will ever amount to anything in fact chris and had no conception of the scope of what they are trying to do or its consequences br br timothy <UNK> was at this period of his career an actor that was going places he had proved he had talent with his work in other films so it was a natural choice for mr <UNK> to <UNK> him a choice that pays off well sean penn also was a young actor who showed an intensity like one hadn't seen before in fact at times mr penn reminded us of a young robert mitchum in the making both actors' contribution to the film is incredible one can't think who could have played this duo but them br br the <UNK> and the snowman while not up to the par with other great john <UNK> movies is an interesting look to our not too distant past
<START> the topic of religion in <UNK> films is a point that one as an eater of films as an eater of art or as a person need to analyze hardly one can see to a satirical <UNK> in la un <UNK> <UNK> or in <UNK> <UNK> is very hard and effective in its critic but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like after you see this work you begin to be <UNK> about its author and much have <UNK> about what seems to be a <UNK> for <UNK> thinks but is better not called in this way i think that there's not any <UNK> in its work only that <UNK> religion point of view is very diverse as unique in films br br this beautiful film is based on the novel of <UNK> <UNK> which told us the story of father who lived a humble simple life dedicated to god and to help everyone he lived in a simple and poor region there lived too <UNK> who is an abused and abandoned wife she don't find any sense of her life without her violent macho man she have a kind of <UNK> to him in the other side is one of the towns prostitutes father has been stolen again he blames to cousin hear this and try to fight without success with the priest who don't believe in violence that night find that her cousin is actually a thief she have stole her fights with her cousin with terrible consequences with this search mercy from the priest decides to help her knowing well that this could be against his church obviously this thing going to have some consequences since here going to be a <UNK> without nothing even without shoes but with spirit and faith but and <UNK> want to be with he and be like he to serve god br br if is the <UNK> <UNK> film that i have seen so far is too the most spiritual is clear here that the thing that most confuse people with the <UNK> is that here we don't see a <UNK> against the power of church we see a <UNK> whose film is about church but not in the typical and great satirical way like it is i don't think that the right word is <UNK> actually i find it pleasant and well done and in spite of contain such religious issues as his i found it more a spiritual film but that don't try to touch in diversity the catholic religion as maybe he touch and laugh of it in another films is of father and its perspective front god and the same religion but all of this is at the end <UNK> in the spiritual life of this man br br the other two women are not a contrast but as very well another two perspectives of faith first we have <UNK> the <UNK> woman that lose all the faith in life first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family this little girl was very sick at side of her was too the prostitute who run of the justice in the family of the child just religious women there a big pain but faith becomes in father when he arrives with nothing to this town he bless the child a say later she is fine the priest want go on walking but <UNK> and have <UNK> the faith in life and want to <UNK> their lives to god with father after some complains father decide to be with them discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith god religion and the person in necessity the people who must request to charity to survive this last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the <UNK> ending this ending we listen the drums similar to that in <UNK> <UNK> and a father walking over asking about this things when he refuse the fruit at the first time and at the end decide to receive it as a symbol of necessity or maybe as an answer for its spiritual road that begin being priest meanwhile the two women must take away of the father for its crime beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father in jail and then she damn the man who hit the priest in jail and <UNK> because she prefer be with her macho man in spite that he treat her bad just because she don't accept that she fall in loved with the priest father and here is maybe the unique place in film to critic church walk to <UNK> the church the religion that he serves br br father is that then is a soft for much but not for me critic for some thing in religion father helping a women who is guilty of a crime of a sin but most of all is one of <UNK> analysis of faith and life and he really got it with a beautiful tender sweet and unforgettable film that is without a doubt one of his best br br sorry for the mistakes well if there any
