<START> i have to say that this movie was really quite awful the acting was average the pacing of the movie was terrible as well as the soundtrack and cinematography i found that i was bored in most parts of the movie and the cliché lines did nothing for me the two boys that played the main roles looked terrible at times and <UNK> pull off the emotion that was needed in the movie the little girl was creepy at times and looked like a doll which was scary the ending wasn't satisfying although the movie to be over the ending didn't make me feel anything for the characters this movie was boring and did nothing for me i recommend this movie to no one
<START> don't mind what this socially retarded person above says this show is hilarious it shows how a lot of single men are in a bar atmosphere and also shows that women are not as <UNK> as men think they are br br the contest aspect of the how is really cool and original its not the standard reality show that we are all used to now a days br br give it a chance everyone we are only one episode in we finally have some canadian programming that isn't absolute crap as <UNK> what do we normally get bon cop bad cop or corner gas come on people show that we are all not as <UNK> as the previous reviewer br br way to go comedy network giving a new show a chance the <UNK> is funny and the contestants so far are pretty good
<START> i saw <UNK> the at a paramount screening and loved it i have to be honest i really didn't want to go and i had become quite jaded about the movies being made today i have to tell you <UNK> the was fresh and wonderfully put together i laughed my ass off it was great story telling i could not believe two guys shot this and put the whole thing together i thought if these guys can do a movie like this with this budget imagine what they could do with big money behind them and then i thought be the jaded guy <UNK> the studios would probably f it up anyway that being said thanks guys i got lost and in your film and that's why i go to the movies to forget the world for a couple of hours
<START> this movie was so bad it was funny for awhile there i thought i was actually watching a parody of a bad movie a la for your consideration the cliffhanger scene at the end had me laughing until my <UNK> hurt the script was dreadful enough but coupled with sean <UNK> terrible acting especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail complete with flashbacks while <UNK> off a cliff makes it a truly <UNK> bad movie worth watching in fact the <UNK> shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie i still can't believe how this thing got made first of all how did such a bad script get the green light how did star actors get attached were they at low points in their careers questions questions
<START> classic author c s lewis once wrote an <UNK> stating that no children's story is worth the reading viewing <UNK> if it can only be enjoyed by children i'd say this film is an easy one to hold up as a <UNK> of his argument br br around the age of five or six i loved it <UNK> it down only three or four years later and found it to be wet poorly animated <UNK> and <UNK> written and with <UNK> repetitive and awful songs i'm looking t you hi showing a production aiming at <UNK> silliness and <UNK> but resulting with an ugly <UNK> frustrating mess br br by all means show this to your <UNK> but i would <UNK> recommend that you don't buy a copy or attempt to sit in on the viewing if you want something set in the same era but with genuine charm and wit go after <UNK> <UNK> or the <UNK> brilliant adaptation of 'the box of
<START> <UNK> the mystery of anna was a two part star <UNK> historical t v movie based on the peter book <UNK> the <UNK> of anna anderson it keeps up historically pretty much names are changed etc but sticks to the real story quite well omar <UNK> and claire bloom do quite well as the russian <UNK> <UNK> nicholas and alexandra what stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by rex harrison and olivia de <UNK> all in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting i was quite <UNK> by the production values when it first aired on nbc in late 1986 also starring was the fine german actor jan <UNK> who had previously starred in <UNK> other russian epic peter the great br br i felt that part 2 <UNK> over some important details of anna <UNK> trip to america it's important to know too that in 1986 less was known about the anna anderson story back then it was still not known whether her claim to be the grand <UNK> <UNK> was genuine by the late 1990's more was known and anna anderson is now <UNK> to have been a fraud br br too bad the networks aren't making fine made for television movies like this anymore
<START> i'm sorry but they did leave the impression that these <UNK> fought zombies before but they sure didn't act like they even seen a zombie before jumping and turning their backs on them like amateurs second the characters are pretty badly written the actors did the best they could with what was given i blame bad writing and bad directing lastly and here is where the spoiler <UNK> are highest they loose the <UNK> twice and the girl jennifer holland doesn't know if she's been bit or not how stupid is that as much as it hurts to be bitten one would think you would know plus <UNK> of blood <UNK> from your body is a good clue dumb the first movie had it's flaws but it has re unlike this disaster of a movie which i could barely get through once i give the house of the dead 2 no guts all stupidity the crap o <UNK>
<START> brilliant thriller deserving far more fame mitchum and ryan are awesome in their starring roles as is the entire supporting cast a truly gripping film noir featuring some wonderfully images and some great dialogue at the heart of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding based on a novel concerning <UNK> this movie attacks post war anti and all <UNK> and hatred with considerable power though parts may seem a little preachy to modern audiences it still has the power to shock and works very well as a thriller in its own right a credit to all involved
<START> 8 2008 when i originally wrote my comments shortly after first seeing this film i took a critical view feeling that lemmon and matthau had basically <UNK> in their performances which paired them in a manner they'd done several times previously br br but upon seeing it again it seemed different especially in view that neither of the two main mega stars lived a great deal longer after its release br br with the exception of <UNK> all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience and likewise <UNK> a lot longer in tooth than we've seen in many of their other film and t v work but isn't almost everyone br br seeing it again while it certainly won't be regarded as a in any of their careers it is a fun film with a lot of interesting scenery as well br br from my viewpoint it reminds me that many films plays etc can often be looked at either from a very critical viewpoint or looking instead to the lighter side without expecting a film to be another citizen kane or in terms of the two leads another original odd couple it also will provide a continuing piece of nostalgia for lemmon and matthau as well as the others in the cast
<START> although this has to be the <UNK> of season six this <UNK> episode isn't badly written or acted it's just that most of us looked to the x files for taut gripping horror thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but <UNK> season 6 gave us a stream of tongue in cheek comedies that <UNK> the show's continuity and frankly made <UNK> halloween <UNK> look like great thriller tv br br in this episode victoria jackson of snl fame plays the long suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a <UNK> however her <UNK> boss is the one who truly loves her and <UNK> winds up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of town br br there's some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but none too sophisticated characterization of <UNK> <UNK> it's nothing you'd want to see more than once br br it's hard to figure out season 6 x files creator chris carter seems bored by the whole story arc and <UNK> responsibility to the black comedy writers
<START> this is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating if you're trying to impress some cute little i would highly recommend playing this masterpiece its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without <UNK> with the plot br br also i was wondering where does a <UNK> ninja hide are ninjas color <UNK> like this is this normal if i were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas i would die of laughter before <UNK> to his sword br br and i finished my black star ninja test the other day it was multiple choice it went pretty good i found there were a lot of questions on how to sneak around and look evil its all about the <UNK> and the attitude br br basically the movie could have been better if 1 there was no color <UNK> ninjas or the color <UNK> ninjas could combine into a super ninja 2 joe died in the first two minutes and patricia had to avenge him 3 <UNK> monkeys were scattered throughout the file 4 patricia didn't talk and patricia was replaced with another character 6 the french guy was also a black star ninja 7 chris tucker whoopi and chris rock were added as comic relief 8 ninja strengths came from
<START> mary mary bloody mary is an ok time killer it has a uniformly attractive cast the action is rarely dull there are a lot of killings and the production values are not bad but in the end it plays like a standard tv episode from the 1970s with some nudity thrown in the film is the end product of an author trying to make a purely commercial film there's very little depth here and the film spends too much time with chases and action scenes except for the scene on the beach with the old man is almost devoid of any scares or suspense or dread the director has very little understanding of the horror genre br br it's watchable even though it doesn't leave a lasting impression
<START> on his recent <UNK> reality show mr shore <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> is best enjoyed stoned no he must have said best watched while a healthy <UNK> might see you through the end credits there is little pleasure to be found save some <UNK> <UNK> at the picture not with it titular absence is the least <UNK> other wholesome <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i dare you to rub out that saved by the bell <UNK> of <UNK> is miscast as a rural <UNK> she's too round of face for <UNK> mr shore himself occasionally displays the odd talent for <UNK> i thought i recognized a jimmy stewart in there however it is never <UNK> used the trite fish out of water formula has yet to be rendered with less grace our hero crawl has precious little wit to account for <UNK> charming his <UNK> <UNK> ultimately i had to <UNK> it's been the worst movie ever p s as another fish adam sandler <UNK> better with mr deeds it may take a shore to appreciate a sandler
<START> i first played this around or when i was with my friends i thought the game was really great and loved it br br the game is simple on one player mode you go around as james bond and complete missions in different places like an <UNK> <UNK> or a city my favorite was one with a tank on two player mode you and a friend choose from any character you wish and go all out with a fight through out the area you are in you will find <UNK> and weapons to help from hand guns to <UNK> to <UNK> and even your <UNK> work br br again with player two mode there are lots of places to go and some to <UNK> i find this game really fun but also very suspenseful because you never really know where your <UNK> is and it's surprising to see them behind a door where you are going br br this game gets 1 2 stars or of very good go play it sometime
<START> i saw about a year ago and was <UNK> the only japanese horror film i had seen before this one was which i proudly own on dvd by the way superb the idea of a town being absorbed by <UNK> sounds exactly like something out of <UNK> certainly it reminds one of shadow over of the inhabitants slowly turning into <UNK> in this case giant <UNK> and who can forget the <UNK> machine sequence i hope we will soon see this one available on region 1 dvd i see that sundance has recently screened it on us tv hopefully they'll do it again very soon so that we can all see it highly recommended
<START> this meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting even with ed <UNK> in a <UNK> role as the chief heavy jim brown kicks ass effectively gloria <UNK> proves again that she can bring life to even the <UNK> roles and <UNK> peters is decent as the cop who plays by the book it's still dull and badly constructed and even the print shown on cable is now <UNK> of its original james brown score
<START> i watched this movie recently mainly because i am a huge fan of jodie <UNK> i saw this movie was made right between her 2 oscar award winning performances so my expectations were fairly high unfortunately i thought the movie was terrible and i'm still left wondering how she was ever <UNK> to make this movie the script is really weak the story itself may have been somewhat believable if someone like mel gibson had played the role of the hit man the idea of jodie running off with dennis hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy into i did think that jodie looked great throughout the movie which was probably the only reason i watched the entire thing maybe <UNK> jodie around with as few clothes on as possible was the only reason the movie was made i saw a tv biography of jodie where basically all of her movies were commented on in <UNK> order and this movie was the only one never mentioned after seeing it i can now see why
<START> this is one of my favourite movies ever i have seen it about a million times and would never turn down the opportunity to watch it again in fact i love it so much that i really wanted to check out the resort where it was filmed on my upcoming vacation does anyone know the name of it if so please email me i watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and i was about age and for the longest time i <UNK> my dad to take me to away somewhere because of course i expected the same thing to happen to me it's just such an amazing setting and such a cute puppy love story this is a definite dvd <UNK> must
<START> yes this bizarre feature was written by john <UNK> shot in toronto it's yet another '80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants into this mix comes the myth of wild thing a <UNK> young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the local crime lord robert <UNK> stir in the local do <UNK> priest sean <UNK> and clueless social worker kathleen <UNK> and you have a recipe for some rather <UNK> action sequences <UNK> is the standout amongst the cast and cinematographer <UNK> does a pretty good job otherwise this is a rather <UNK> action <UNK> that won't satisfy action fans and will leaves <UNK> slack <UNK>
<START> if good intentions were enough to produce a good film i would have rated the turgid <UNK> obvious focus a bit higher than 4 macy does his best but as an earlier poster commented <UNK> little <UNK> asks us to suspend disbelief too often perhaps the novel gives us a bit more background on newman so we can understand how someone who is obviously not without intelligence could be so dense in <UNK> the attitudes of those around him i agree with another reviewer that if one is unaware of how <UNK> average citizens were in america during this time period then this movie might be an eye opener i grew up in the fifties and the good <UNK> of my church found nothing wrong with having the church <UNK> at a commercial beach whose sign <UNK> <UNK> that no jews or blacks would be admitted it is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm and not just in the south as late as 1964 when i <UNK> from a somewhat <UNK> integrated but sexually <UNK> public high school in <UNK> my black classmates could not attend the traditional father and son <UNK> as it was held at a facility which did not admit blacks sadly it was an establishment owned by a jewish family the subject matter of focus is important and we should never forget despite the lingering signs of racism in modern america how truly repulsive the attitudes of that previous generation were the greatest generation indeed so perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in <UNK> the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forties from the likes of steven spielberg and tom but in the end as in far from heaven the <UNK> good intentions are <UNK> by having a protagonist so ridiculously oblivious to the social conventions of their time
<START> <UNK> battle is an entertaining story about two fictional cities and their arms race it is also as misguided allegory about the cold war and arms races in general yes it is a children's book but like so many of <UNK> seuss works it hits people over the head with its moral br br and that moral is what exactly sure it is <UNK> to encourage us to concentrate more on what <UNK> us than what <UNK> us it is even a good thing to encourage international <UNK> but to <UNK> the differences between the <UNK> <UNK> nations and the <UNK> west to a difference in <UNK> <UNK> is just plain wrong to point out the obvious many <UNK> <UNK> nations enjoyed <UNK> periods of <UNK> of <UNK> and bread they would have been happy to eat it <UNK> <UNK> if it were available on a less literal level and whatever your political <UNK> soviet <UNK> versus western particularly <UNK> american democracy is not a mere question of <UNK> and <UNK> br br to make the point even <UNK> nuclear weapons were not developed in a cold war with the <UNK> but in a hot war with the <UNK> powers there is no doubt that germany was developing nuclear <UNK> during the war should the us have <UNK> from nuclear weapons research putting their trust in their less than inevitable victory in the conventional war once the weapons were developed they were used against the enemy who attacked us at pearl harbor what does a nation do at this point when the genie is out of the bottle furthermore <UNK> is 20 20 which is to say that there was no way of <UNK> another half crazed dictator wouldn't crop up with his eyes on developing nuclear weapons the second <UNK> war has shown the incredible difficulty in credible <UNK> and them br br in any event the cartoon is little more than simplistic propaganda which does little to explore the nuances of the <UNK> questions behind nuclear <UNK> and instead tries to fear of weapons technology into children
<START> they say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer to hide certain details from the audience in order to <UNK> their sense of imagination <UNK> into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughts br br that was not the case when i watched under the american title <UNK> now playing at <UNK> theaters near you seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details there will be blood in this film and you will try to look away br br for rest of review please visit http without <UNK> com 2009 <UNK> <UNK> aka <UNK> thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above
<START> is not only great it is also unique even taking into account other <UNK> movies which never lack originality an amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book for the horror genre it has quite a few of subtle and references certainly a lot of fun to have a a bit to think about if one cares to and not to forget a nice music score well the special effects as usual get old faster than anything but that is probably the only <UNK> i've just seen it again after ten years and i still find it something to recommend
<START> the most positive points in this film were the credits text style and some moments in ice <UNK> acting the story line two rival gangs having to fight it out with the sub plots of betrayal power and change are well worn plots but in this case painful very to <UNK> through the <UNK> scenery which added slight believability in places and questionable lighting constantly distracted from any interest <UNK> with the characters the shine off of the <UNK> <UNK> nose was <UNK> not to mention other scenes with the same problem not even half way into the film i wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen a disappointment if you have seen ice t in other roles kudos to other actors actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction side kick and the other restaurant worker
<START> unbelievable i never saw something like that everything is bad really bad from photography lots of scenes without focus to the acting the young female is terrible and what can we say about those <UNK> made in paint brush really amazing b i mean z film br br the plot are bad cliché and bad wrote <UNK> <UNK> to the screenplay seems to work i can't even think a young student of cinema making this movie nothing justify it br br i recommend that you don't even think to see this movie sleep or play <UNK> are best choices br br <UNK>
<START> they said it would be a film greater than <UNK> fruit how dare br br they it's not even 10 of this classic bad acting the only character i felt sympathy for was the one br br played by angela her acting was the best in the whole film the story could've been interesting but it wasn't some scenes were very beautiful filmed lights and camera the br br opening scene for example but the bad acting made the magic br br disappear br br i really don't understand why so many people voted this film so br br good
<START> this show has an amazing plot with good and recognizable actors like the girl from boston legal and boris the butcher from snatch even the extras and the kid whom i thought from the commercial might be a weak link surprised me with his skill it's just the little things that the director needs to <UNK> like the guy who does the <UNK> of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode needs to be fired having a narrator tell you what happened kind of ruins the story the only other small problem i had was that sometimes they take too long to do things but no where near as long as some shows like prison break anyone know when they will resume the season
<START> my introduction to a <UNK> love of shakespeare my brother was 5 and i was not quite 7 when chicago broadcast an age of kings it became a family ritual to watch including the reruns as an <UNK> series my father used to buy us a rare treat for the <UNK> and my mother would pop corn on the <UNK> wonderful acting from actors whose names meant nothing to me then although i will never forget the <UNK> young sean connery as but do now and they published the scripts in <UNK> so we could follow along and figure out the language i managed to <UNK> most of richard iii over that so glad to see it coming out on dvd highly recommended for all ages and any level of <UNK> with shakespeare or english history
<START> a girl named <UNK> becomes possessed by a demon the local priest who <UNK> dated sister must try to save her but the bigger problems are with the family's <UNK> of each other rather than the demon in their daughter br br this film is directed by ethan <UNK> the writer of house and the writer director of house ii i loved the first film and liked the second one even better so you would think this would be a winner alas this one looks like it was thrown together by first year film students dawson <UNK> could have done better i have thought about <UNK> new writer eddy especially because the idea is hardly original are they trying to cash in on the fans of the <UNK> of emily rose but <UNK> should have been able to do his magic br br also you'd like to think veteran horror stars jeffrey combs and james russo would help this film russo playing the bishop barely shows up and combs has a great role as a sheriff for the five minutes he's on screen but i love the mustache so no help here br br after seeing the exorcist all other <UNK> films must be compared to the classic by <UNK> no and the demonic possession in this film was not scary in the least no head spinning or <UNK> activity at all just a girl with a deep voice and <UNK> makeup all the demonic stuff was centered around the father <UNK> everyone of sleeping with his wife as another reviewer wrote you get a lot of <UNK> <UNK> on her bed like it's a <UNK> hiding in her closet and jumping from a <UNK> <UNK> yeah it's chuck e cheese gone wild that sadly sums up the extent of the evil in this movie br br if you want to watch a movie about family members who <UNK> <UNK> and yell at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room off camera this is the movie for you but if you don't mind my saying so you have a horrible taste in film if this is what you're seeking br br the plot seems to focus on the father <UNK> a cowboy of sleeping with his wife who didn't but did sleep with his daughter and of the <UNK> of sleeping with his wife who might have but <UNK> it and then you have a <UNK> who attacks the possessed girl with a <UNK> and tells the family to call an exorcist but once the priest arrives the <UNK> declares he does not believe in god what was all the bible <UNK> you were doing five minutes ago br br a horrible <UNK> movie examples of what combs and russo are capable of and such a sad display of directing after the house series of films became classic i would like to pretend <UNK> had no part in making this <UNK> derivative and unoriginal uninspired film the power of christ <UNK> you to avoid this movie as if viewing it were a <UNK> sin
<START> i had always heard about this great mini series but viewed it for the first time this week july of 2007 i can see why it started the careers of so many young actors the story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the civil war i cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period some of them were stereotypes but they still helped me see how people thought during the <UNK> many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life the costumes and sets were gorgeous i thoroughly enjoyed watching both parts i and ii part iii is a disappointment
<START> the attic starts off well the somewhat dreary story is helped greatly by the two main actors and there's a semblance of a character study going on here but the film goes downhill fast when carrie character buys a monkey not one of those cute little monkeys she buys a real big <UNK> br br this sudden plot device basically kills the movie it's just not <UNK> for a woman like the one plays who has a hard time doing anything because of her <UNK> father for her to out of the blue buy a <UNK> i mean come on forget about it
<START> during an eight year stretch of the 1980s when charles bronson made nine films only one was released by a company other than the cannon group 'the evil that men do ' a <UNK> films pickup from sir <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> entertainment firm bronson was already in the thick of his <UNK> with director j lee thompson which ran through numerous <UNK> until forbidden in 1989 br br expectations should run pretty high with bronson and thompson working for a better <UNK> outfit like <UNK> but 'the evil that man <UNK> is a great disappointment on many levels while still from the low budget b movie mold of the 1980s <UNK> has <UNK> potential for a great film everyone in the production department however took an easy way out and sold hack work <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> 'the evil that men <UNK> had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of bronson and <UNK> best films but instead will go down as one of their most average br br this 1984 political thriller <UNK> opens in brutal fashion with <UNK> joseph <UNK> a british doctor holding his special training class for political leaders in the gray haired passive is an expert on torture methods who is employed by numerous political <UNK> in the opening seven minutes we witness using <UNK> current to <UNK> unbearable pain on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> journalist as you may expect the scene is awful to watch and was cut from the original vhs release br br <UNK> was none other than a friend of holland bronson a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the <UNK> islands holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of but turned the offer down a mexican professor named hector <UNK> <UNK> visits shortly after death to talk holland into finishing the job bringing <UNK> of <UNK> from the doctor's victims while in denial at first holland eventually agrees to the dirty work <UNK> and his <UNK> sister claire <UNK> in <UNK> br br holland enters <UNK> city with help from an <UNK> max <UNK> <UNK> he poses as a tourist with widow <UNK> <UNK> and young daughter sarah amanda nicole thomas in <UNK> as with most of <UNK> later <UNK> his character knocks off henchmen one by one crossing paths with a sleazy american <UNK> john glover and his supporting hit man roger along the way a brutal ending takes place in the <UNK> of an mine where the doctor gets just <UNK> from several of his victims br br 'the evil that men <UNK> is based on a forgotten novel by r lance hill and jumps at american political <UNK> in latin america during the 1980s indeed <UNK> is hard boiled in every sense of the term as it uses <UNK> and doses of brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in plot and character development for every plus this film has there are three or four <UNK> resulting from <UNK> <UNK> br br while 'the evil that men <UNK> has a great concept the film is never truly more than an excuse for bronson to wipe out foreign based <UNK> in the style of bad pulp fiction <UNK> is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand holland despite being played strongly by bronson never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him into becoming a killer for hire a terribly weak part for <UNK> <UNK> is disgusted by holland for much of the way but later feels an affection for him where does her love come from especially after watching holland kill several people and wanting to go home just a few scenes before br br the most interesting characters are actually and his sister claire because so many questions can be asked of them naturally we never find out what has brought them so close together how and where their torture <UNK> started what <UNK> exact role in their business plot holes can go on forever especially with the paint by numbers storyline that seems to make things up as it goes along why is daughter brought into such a dangerous situation other than for her to be conveniently taken hostage by if bodyguard randolph raymond st jacques clearly saw holland and in the <UNK> <UNK> why is he so friendly with them in a bar <UNK> is his memory that short and what really was the purpose other than cheap <UNK> of holland throwing <UNK> <UNK> luke off a window <UNK> when the murder could have been handled more <UNK> in <UNK> apartment br br the overall acting is decent and somehow bronson gives one of his strongest performances j lee <UNK> direction is lacking at points but may have been <UNK> by limited time on site besides filming in mexico the presence of <UNK> is clear through better production values cinematography and music rural locations are well used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of latin america and cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> provides rich color and clarity the <UNK> score by ken <UNK> <UNK> is refreshing in an era of <UNK> junk oddly enough these <UNK> only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to come out peter lee <UNK> editing is better than usual although with more laughable continuity errors br br 'the evil than men <UNK> was perfect <UNK> material for the early 80s and i find it hard to recommend for 21st century action fans the dvd from columbia <UNK> entertainment is an okay presentation offering widescreen and standard format with four language subtitles while the video quality is well above average <UNK> was originally recorded in plain <UNK> audio the theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a <UNK> feel with <UNK> color and fuzzy sound quality br br out of 4
<START> fred <UNK> one of the two or three top <UNK> stars <UNK> <UNK> one of the two or three top american female action stars imagine a film with these two together for the first time now imagine the worst film that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time welcome to night vision of course this movie was made in 1997 and they were both past their prime but that doesn't mean they didn't have what it takes anymore they just needed the help of good writing and direction they got neither here <UNK> does get to throw a couple of kicks near the end but this film is so atrocious that you probably won't be awake to see them
<START> lucio <UNK> cat in the brain is an inventive and somewhat <UNK> tale of a director's decent into madness the director in question is fulci himself who stars in the film fulci has become known to horror fans everywhere as 'the godfather of <UNK> and for good reason as he has provided us with some of the <UNK> and most gruesome films ever to grace the silver screen from the <UNK> violence in films like <UNK> <UNK> to a man been <UNK> to death with chains in 'the <UNK> all the way to the full on gore fest known as 'the new york <UNK> if you want gore and let's face it who doesn't fulci is your man however all this <UNK> for <UNK> like you and i has taken its <UNK> on <UNK> mental state and he's quickly <UNK> into madness brought about by what he films <UNK> problems don't end at his mental state either as his psychiatrist that he has gone to see about his problem has took it upon himself to take up murder as a <UNK> using <UNK> films as <UNK> for the murders br br i've got to say the acting in this film is absolutely atrocious there is one scene in particular that involves a hooker and it's only fit to be laughed at for both it's acting and it's stupidity fulci takes the lead role of the film obviously he's not an actor and it shows but his performance is actually the best in the film it's even safe to say that one the whole the acting is bad for an italian horror film of course nobody goes into an italian horror expecting good acting so it's somewhat forgivable but i do think that fulci could have hired some better ones bad dubbing doesn't exactly help either however something that does help is the fact that the terrible acting is <UNK> by lots of gore and it's extreme to say the least people get their heads cut off a woman is <UNK> in the shower and unlike psycho here we really see it people are <UNK> up fed to pigs and there's lots and lots of <UNK> finest <UNK> weapon the chainsaw on display which delighted me no end the amount of gore is <UNK> over the top a lot of the time which gives the film something of a feel but cat in the brain is obviously a tongue in cheek film anyway br br it would be hard to make a film about yourself and not come across as being a bit of a big head and fulci does indeed come across as a bit of a big head in this movie his name is mentioned often and he's on screen nearly all the time it's not too much unlike <UNK> <UNK> in the ego stakes but it's obvious he had a good time making this and i for one had fun watching it so we can forgive him a little <UNK> the film's ending lets it down i saw it coming a mile off but then didn't seriously think that the movie would take that route but i was wrong it did unfortunately the ending left me cold and the film is a better watch if you turn it off just before the final two minutes however despite it's ending and terrible acting cat in the brain is a lot of fun and will please fulci <UNK> no end and it is therefore recommended
<START> if there's one theme of this film it's that people can cope with <UNK> by having a good imagination this family is poor their father works graveyard and their mother works double shifts and peter is constantly picked on for a variety of reasons and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl he is just starting to approach that age of 10 or 11 where your <UNK> start to change and thinks like your appearance start to matter the backdrop of this story is the 1967 world's fair and the <UNK> of canada the film's greatest moments come during the various fantasy sequences where we see just how they cope watch the <UNK> and if you've ever had a childhood friend that you <UNK> with and then for some reason lost you'll really like this film perhaps kids will like this film but only adults will truly appreciate it including its references to and what <UNK> will do for their children
<START> edge of the city is another movie that owes a lot of credit to on the <UNK> from it's nyc locations to its score to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in you can somehow right your <UNK> br br edge also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism in my opinion that is where the movie does not succeed like <UNK> at 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable br br possible spoilers br br the relationship between sidney <UNK> and john <UNK> could have been further developed in the beginning i don't believe that these two characters from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly br br i think that the whole love sub plot with <UNK> could have been eliminated he is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch the only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can <UNK> him to do the right thing at the end there are other ways that they could have shown this i would have also liked to see some scenes of <UNK> in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is br br the acting is excellent <UNK> is terrific in a role that is beautifully written his role as tyler is interesting and multi layered and especially for 1957 a man who is confident respected and intelligent <UNK> as <UNK> north while very good does not seem quite right for the part warden is terrific as the boss who knows secret although his fight scene with <UNK> at the end is staged horribly too many break away boxes i thought ruby dee was wonderful in role of <UNK> wife br br on the whole edge of the city is a smart movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture without taking the time to let the drama build br br 7 out of 10
<START> this was it i would have never expected the ending if i didn't already know the behind the scenes stuff br br the one thing that i hated was that why was shannon kicked off and not <UNK> i hate her i would rather her character die that what was funny is that in the scene where <UNK> is <UNK> on the hospital bed and was crying by her side i started crying too lol at the time that this aired i was about and my favorite character was <UNK> from the beginning so i was saying to myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore lol br br then the whole go back in time thing was a shocker and really good i also blame <UNK> for death because instead of being with her sisters she had to be a <UNK> <UNK> and be with her good for nothing demon boyfriend br br but i think this episode will be now and forever one of my favorites and a classic br br forever <UNK> blessed be
<START> the film was apparently <UNK> from an idea one of the writers had when he one of his creations in a supermarket the inhabitants of <UNK> <UNK> head into world to <UNK> the writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world br br if that sounds a bit too serious don't be put off within the first few minutes we get <UNK> the vile female <UNK> letting rip at an unfortunate during confession <UNK> the vet who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches attempting to collect <UNK> from a <UNK> mickey thick beyond belief being ah thick and <UNK> <UNK> sister wife and local <UNK> being sweet as ever but still disgusting br br some of the regular characters are missing but a new idea by the <UNK> introduces some <UNK> century characters and we have the <UNK> themselves in the action too if you're new to the league of gentlemen this is an easy introduction and a lot of fun if you're a long standing fan this has everything you've come to expect including the <UNK> of jeremy <UNK> <UNK> br br all told it's got the same <UNK> surreal humour that's the hallmark of the series plus some moments of quite touching <UNK> for example maintains a gentle dignity on learning that he's regarded by his creators as a <UNK> joke <UNK> while most of the characters stay as they are some develop in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they happen br br this film is a <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> but it's also a showcase for the <UNK> who prove that gasp they can write other stuff and it can be very funny but you knew that anyway
<START> it took me years to finally catch this gem of a film and it was worth the wait in nearly all of his films clint always plays the hero be it hero anti hero or <UNK> hero in this film he is pure villain and he plays it well br br as a wounded union soldier he is brought into a <UNK> girls school by the students and teachers to <UNK> soon after he begins to seduce the ladies no matter their age and some are quite young he also plays upon their <UNK> and <UNK> them against each other in the end you are never so happy to see clint die a terrible death br br that is what makes this film such a gem clint has never done any other film like it and after seeing this film you wish he had he plays the role of the villain so well it will make you wonder why he never did any more films like it it also explains why the film is not seen very often most people don't want to see clint as the villain and with dirty harry being released shortly after this film it has become a hidden gem if you are a clint eastwood fan you owe it to yourself to see this film you might not like what you will see but you won't soon forget it
<START> morris and had been the <UNK> of broadway in its <UNK> at ninety morris is a widower he <UNK> his sons the <UNK> and the <UNK> car dealer and his daughter the television writer producer to attend a party in his honor after which he will himself literal minded creatures that they are they take what he says at face value he leads them his <UNK> and some others including an african american jewish psychiatrist reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> on a merry chase through manhattan as they try to stop him or <UNK> him br br the comedy totally works the performances are excellent peter falk is in top form this film does more than deserve an audience it deserves popular success
<START> it's the old old story kids have a party in an old house demons are unleashed death and gratuitous nudity ensues you all know it it's still a lot of fun br br many people okay many horror fans to be specific have fond memories of this movie and it's always with slight <UNK> that you <UNK> an old movie to see if it's still as good as you used to think it was luckily this is br br it has something for everyone well everyone who happens to be male i suppose from a fun title sequence to a <UNK> <UNK> involving cunning use of <UNK> <UNK> ass to the mirror scene to the full on demonic fun this is a blast from start to finish br br the girls are cute the guys are male the death scenes are well done with some good gore effects and unlike some horrors from the era this actually keeps a good sense of atmosphere and even tension throughout don't get me wrong it's still fun first and foremost but it offers some nice freaky moments that should please most genre fans
<START> it's worth <UNK> up on the <UNK> <UNK> before watching this film three main female <UNK> wise <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> as well as three main male <UNK> grave <UNK> playful <UNK> and <UNK> the are all <UNK> to knowing the <UNK> as surely every indian member of an audience does lends a <UNK> to the telling of the present day story in fact one is <UNK> first on stage as part of a lesson in <UNK> and then in the movie's real life fire speaks out against the <UNK> and <UNK> in the society to which its producers are native and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewer's awareness making it a deeply satisfying presentation this is the finest film i've seen in the past ten years very highly recommended
<START> sometimes when i hear an a list cast will be <UNK> up together for 2 hours in a movie i hope and pray that it is good not for the sake of my 10 bucks or 2 hours but for the sake of these actors' careers in the case of be cool everything went to waste br br in the beginning of the film john travolta aka <UNK> <UNK> and a music executive played by james woods are driving in a car talking about movie sequels and how most aren't good if you look passed the fact that this scene was shot the same way quentin <UNK> filmed his car scene in pulp fiction and listen to the dialogue you can't help but <UNK> whether this is 1 a <UNK> to the audience that this movie is going to suck or 2 an attempt to get the audience laughing at the sheer humor of 2 people talking about sequels in a sequel oh the irony in case you were wondering choice 1 is correct the cool and slick <UNK> <UNK> from the first and good film get <UNK> is <UNK> to play a mobster gone music business pro he steals a young hot singer christina from her ghetto <UNK> out jewish manager vince vaughn and turns her into a singing sensation of course a movie about an ex mobster can never be complete without new <UNK> causing havoc this time around the <UNK> of choice are russian played by american actors who cannot act russian if my entire family hit them upside the head with their russian bare hands br br as a russian i wasn't so much offended by the way this film portrayed russians but instead as a writer i was more offended by the horrible dialogue this film tried too hard to get the audience to laugh it turned potentially good lines into a <UNK> the russian black and gay jokes were the same ones only a couple of hundred times after calling the <UNK> character a f he plays a gay bodyguard to vince vaughn and cedric the character a n he played a black <UNK> with an <UNK> who <UNK> those who don't play his tracks with guns i wanted to walk out of the movie theater because it was painful to sit through if this was get <UNK> none of this would've even needed to be in the film to build up drama or a really bad laugh br br what lacked in this film that didn't in get <UNK> was hot attitude he's a completely different person in this sequel for one thing the old <UNK> would've had more dialogue john travolta doesn't have more than 20 speaking lines in be cool because he is out staged by the repetitive lines and the hundred and two cameo appearances by the most random celebrities i won't ruin the shock by revealing all of the cameos for those who actually plan to see this movie please don't but i will say that it will forever <UNK> me that these people agreed to be in a film of such <UNK> br br what was even more stupid was the very lame dance sequence with travolta and uma thurman she plays the widower of james woods who luckily gets killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie <UNK> never made pulp fiction for an idiot like the director of be cool to mess around with this dance number was boring long and just plain <UNK> the black eyed <UNK> playing in the club with a total of 10 people didn't make the scene any memorable br br there were so many plot holes that i left the theater asking myself why everything about this film was a big question mark i just didn't understand the point to anything i couldn't even explain to you why the russians were after everyone or why this film was ever made because i'm <UNK> all i took out of this movie was that everyone in l a has a sidekick and the only way this movie was probably <UNK> was through all of the <UNK> by <UNK> coke <UNK> <UNK> insight hybrid t mobile even the herself is in the movie and the bad screenwriters <UNK> plot holes stupid dialogue too many random cameos horrible acting even by the pros and a not so entertaining attempt to <UNK> pulp fiction makes this film the worst movie of 2005 and it's only the third month of the year
<START> another must have film henry brandon is a favorite i was so surprised when i learned years ago that he was from germany because he sounds looks so typically american and wasn't he great in the <UNK> as chief <UNK> another of my favorites i have it watch it over again now if i could add this one to my collection it would make my day this is a great <UNK> story film for all ages the scenery is so absolutely beautiful the plight of the <UNK> snow <UNK> is told with such great emotion it will spark the interest in <UNK> species in anyone especially children if i could i would give a copy to all of my great
<START> <UNK> must be the most god awful movie i have seen in a long time in fact i want my money back what a waste of time no plot minimal character development questionable motives poor dialogue sub standard acting what else can i say if you haven't seen it don't bother i wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on tv change the channel the only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype which quite frankly is why they added it if you want to see some eating his own brain then fast forward to that bit br br what was the purpose of this movie its like someone just asked 'i wonder what <UNK> is up to these <UNK> and we just went along for the ride he is free in the beginning and he's free at the end in between is a lot of self <UNK> on the part of anthony hopkins and the film makers <UNK> moore tries <UNK> to <UNK> some life into her <UNK> but they gave her a sub standard script and as far as i'm concerned she was set up to fail br br in my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word the only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feel br br i give it a big fat <UNK>
<START> big fat liar is the best movie ever it is funny and cool jason shepherd frankie proves that he was not lying and goes to los angeles to get his paper back from marty wolf paul <UNK> along with friend amanda <UNK> mess up his life since marty won't call dad and say he wrote the paper yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch
<START> <UNK> 4 this movie was continued after the 3rd <UNK> movies this one was released in the same years as <UNK> 3 was released in 1991 <UNK> 4 takes you in space as they hunt for the humans in a space ship i doubt if there will be a <UNK> 5 because the ending for the 4th was quite a good ending which brought the end to the <UNK> as there was no more left i give this movie 10 out of 10
<START> spoof films have come so far since mel brooks in 'the <UNK> 1968 said don't be stupid be a <UNK> come and join the nazi party it brought us delightful films such as <UNK> <UNK> ' and even <UNK> <UNK> but the good die young luckily the genre managed to make it all the way up to the end of the 90's and then the <UNK> brothers unleashed the apocalypse <UNK> <UNK> suddenly the word spoof was an innuendo for crude sex jokes most movies claiming to be spoofs since then have followed suit including <UNK> movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the film to kill the genre <UNK> sure there have been some <UNK> there was <UNK> of the <UNK> and <UNK> will has become a vehicle <UNK> close to every sport imaginable also the wayans brothers quit the <UNK> <UNK> and they have been made by the <UNK> <UNK> brothers while these films have held some value in the rescue the genre is <UNK> doomed to be films only loved by <UNK> males who just discovered what an <UNK> is people who haven't explored the term and cut and <UNK> movies together for a quick laugh no heart no brain just cheap <UNK> sadly 'the has been added to the list dave <UNK> who starred in alongside ferrell leads a teams of <UNK> to win against a coach carl of <UNK> fame who got him back into <UNK> <UNK> has shown promise as a supporting actor but as a lead in this film he just sounds scripted he sounds too much like he's doing a cold read <UNK> also the jokes about being a washed up coach who through the course of the movie encourages the team to fail in school and later runs from the police in his underwear have been done before yes this is a spoof film but let us remember that even spoofs can have quality give the characters dignity and a sort of sophisticated view on modern society also the <UNK> on stereotypes is not going to get us any more laughs who knew one movie with <UNK> talking people could lead to gangster stereotypes not really but you see while i will admit to laugh at least a few times it wasn't on par the football team within itself had a lot of stereotypes including a mexican a cocky jock a fat guy the <UNK> nerd and the mentally handicapped aid even the only female on the team got reduced to stereotypical female humor being mostly scantily clad and giving off <UNK> in fact her character as well as most of the others never developed it's a sad state of affairs for this movie if only it wasn't so <UNK> on stupid sex jokes it could've made something for itself in fact this movie will probably be the butt of jokes alongside <UNK> for time to come <UNK> really deserved better the script in general was poorly conceived even <UNK> the championship 'the toilet so yes spoof movies are dying there is a movie called <UNK> the <UNK> be ahead of the trend <UNK> now coming out that includes a spoof on britney <UNK> breakdown so let those kids keep getting <UNK> but people grow up and lose them we need one day they will learn to stop <UNK> spoofs and <UNK> them hopefully one of the heroes will be <UNK> made by the master mel brooks coming out next year br br rating 2 out of 5 stars
<START> the last film by underrated director <UNK> de martino the <UNK> the killer is on the phone is a truly suspenseful but <UNK> neglected giallo containing pretty much all the <UNK> that makes this italian horror sub genre so magnificent and <UNK> to the fans there are some very disturbing themes child abuse phony loads of creepy moments plot twists left right outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes especially the opening sequence which is some kind of prologue is a powerful piece of horror what is it about ordinary child dolls that make them so creepy when the anonymous man dressed up like a priest <UNK> a little girl and the broken head of her doll <UNK> down a flight of stairs it really sent cold <UNK> through my spine years later the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman bound to a wheelchair she inherited a lot of money but uses her fortune to <UNK> fellow handicapped people to practice sports and to remain positive minded she  joanna  falls in love with her personal coach and they get married right away naturally he's only after her money and starts <UNK> joanna by making her <UNK> the childhood trauma that crippled her the repeated images of a sinister looking priest guided by eerie tunes and a <UNK> rhyme provide formula for a murder with a ton of genuine scares and <UNK> de <UNK> directing is very <UNK> the acting is quite competent with david <UNK> the beyond the black cat in a glorious greedy villain role due some plot holes and a lack of originality this movie might not be able to compete with <UNK> best horror efforts but it definitely deserves more attention many <UNK> obscure and unknown italian <UNK> received marvelous dvd releases and hopefully formula for a murder will be given the same treatment really soon in the meantime good luck tracking this baby down
<START> with hong kong heart <UNK> andy <UNK> and veteran star <UNK> wan <UNK> <UNK> has everything going for it for the beginning part of the movie unfortunately the movie falls apart at the end br br andy <UNK> plays a sophisticated thief who only has 4 weeks to live but still has one thing unfinished he pulls an <UNK> scheme <UNK> the police into helping him however the police is hot on his tail can he pull it off before being caught br br the build up of the movie is good bits of pieces of clues are left behind for the audiences to try to guess at the real intention unfortunately the build up leads to a disappointed final showdown it feels as if in the middle of the script the writer has changed and that all the build up becomes <UNK> br br a 3 10
<START> director <UNK> thoroughly routine <UNK> yarn the yellow 1954 <UNK> the <UNK> against the u s <UNK> with tough <UNK> <UNK> in the middle as the seasoned clad indian <UNK> who has to lead the survivors to safety this united artists western was <UNK> in color but the tv print that turner classic movies aired was inexplicably in black white br br the action opens with adam reed <UNK> <UNK> of black <UNK> <UNK> several indians and riding up to with his old friend and <UNK> chief fire knife lee van <UNK> of the good the bad and the ugly who has killing on his mind fire knife warns adam that his <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> to wipe out a nearby <UNK> <UNK> under construction because it <UNK> a <UNK> that the indians made with the government on his way to inform stuck up camp <UNK> major <UNK> warner anderson of objective <UNK> about the impending indian attack adam discovers a beautiful wood <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> water in a lake <UNK> <UNK> peggy castle of i jury is another of those silly women in westerns that <UNK> nude in the middle of indian country without a care in the world castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes too perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western naturally major <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> warning from fire knife until the commander realizes that somebody has <UNK> his <UNK> dump far outside the <UNK> this is one of the many questions that the richard alan <UNK> screenplay leaves unanswered in this <UNK> <UNK> minute <UNK> why would the <UNK> bury their <UNK> at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the <UNK> no sooner have they made this discovery than the indians attack knock out of hero and leave him as the only survivor before this attack a pair of white <UNK> rides into the <UNK> <UNK> peter graves of <UNK> 17 brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest while adam is getting hot water to help in <UNK> the arrow the greedy <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> in deeper and kills his helpless partner later we learn that <UNK> and his partner had struck gold the question of the of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal adam and fire knife have one final <UNK> wow and fire knife demands that adam hand over major <UNK> or everybody will die naturally adam refuses and the indians begin to <UNK> down the whites james best in a supporting role as a <UNK> gets an arrow in the back for his efforts <UNK> <UNK> jr plays a mexican <UNK> pursued by a sexy indian damsel appropriately named honey bear oscar winning actress rita <UNK> of west side story and robert <UNK> of <UNK> fame is on hand briefly as the ill <UNK> <UNK> officer that kate had planned to marry br br the biggest surprise in this <UNK> western shot on location in <UNK> is that the evil <UNK> officer <UNK> who slaughtered indian men women and children at the infamous sand creek massacre has been keeping a secret that he is a native american too ironically the taut bow that fire knife gives out of friendship to adam at the outset of the <UNK> is what our heroic <UNK> uses to kill the <UNK> <UNK> warrior after he has run out of bullets the yellow concludes on an ambiguous note the survivors reach another <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> where adam and <UNK> <UNK> their respective reports about the issue to an army general but we never learn the outcome of this meeting is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question producer howard w <UNK> is no relation to casablanca <UNK> howard <UNK> ultimately the yellow is one of many pro indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of broken arrow 1950 where the native american is viewed as a noble savage <UNK> treated by some but not all whites who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar <UNK> <UNK> stands out of an above average cast as the always <UNK> leading man and good looking castle is worth watching for her feminine charms peter graves plays a <UNK> as was usual in most of his early roles actually <UNK> did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called war paint 1953 with robert stack incidentally <UNK> <UNK> jr and rita <UNK> both went on to become <UNK> on the <UNK> files
<START> i was surprised after watching this piece of crap if you have seen an episode of tom and jerry in which jerry <UNK> some <UNK> onto him and becomes invisible than you are likely to see the same cartoons with added erotic <UNK> a man becoming invisible and doing s i is the conclusion of the movie involving too much sex in a cartoon themed movie doesn't increase its worth and most of all i was surprised when the same cartoon ending was used to show up the mr invisible and that was really awful i must say <UNK> drops off the rack and our very own mr invisible becomes visible watch <UNK> and <UNK> make a porno i bet you wont get bored br br 1 10 from me
<START> i happen to love this show its a refreshing take on some older sci fi feels and styles they aren't afraid to shoot and when they do people tend to die far too many show's are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having it be a <UNK> <UNK> also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters they all grow on you till the point where it <UNK> you to hear them discuss taking some of the <UNK> ones out of their to make the mini series from beginning to end <UNK> leaves you with a feeling of hope and as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die surprising you every time worth a watch even if you don't have the time
<START> anywhere but here is not exactly anything new but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching sarandon and portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural <UNK> to sunny beverly hills california in search of a better life the main conflict comes from the fact that natalie would much rather have stayed in <UNK> with all of her friends and family and she felt that she was forced to go to california with her overbearing mother br br spoilers while it's true that the film as a whole is <UNK> predictable susan sarandon and especially natalie portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new anywhere but here doesn't cover any new ground but it does have the rare quality of being able to take <UNK> subject matter and make it fairly interesting again also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years seen on natalie <UNK> face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about <UNK> mother <UNK> her to become an actress as well as a very convincing performance from shawn <UNK> as one of <UNK> very close cousins from back home his death is a tragic cliché almost always seen in movies like this one but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this not great but anywhere but here is definitely worth a look
<START> i am having a holiday in hong kong now and i just saw gen y cops at the cinema what can i say it was <UNK> cool br br everything you could wish for was in it basically just see it if ya can i'm gonna get my friend to send me the <UNK> when it comes out br br only bad thing was the dodgy american style of talking employed by some of the actors like edison what's up my man but it did add even more humour to br br see it especially if ya like any of the following action comedy sci fi edison did a good song for it too so <UNK> it edison <UNK> heroes
<START> i have so much hope for the sequel to gen x luckily my hopes have came true you got a whole bunch of action comedy silly comedy and surprises i think the newcomer edison is really a hit in the movie but i really find <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> annoying with english although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue the action always keeps it strong the action set up is much stronger than the 1st br br this movie is getting more of an american feel since 60 of the movie is in english from the <UNK> this movie will not disappoint you i recommended this for young <UNK> that care about pure action packed fun br br
<START> young couple on the road <UNK> their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight yet suddenly they're being <UNK> and <UNK> by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pick up truck hmm where have i seen this premise before oh yeah now i remember we've seen this a thousand times before already and approximately nine hundred and ninety nine of the other cases were much better than rest stop this weak and <UNK> new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most <UNK> horror fans as it doesn't feature a single original twist or memorable gimmick it's very sadistic and nasty but every <UNK> slasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays so that's no real surprise anymore neither the absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots writer director john damn well realized that the ultra thin basic storyline nearly wasn't enough to fill a whole movie with and thus he <UNK> up his film like a <UNK> turkey with <UNK> and nonsensical padding material <UNK> boyfriend <UNK> at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in california killing off her character right away wouldn't result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a <UNK> home family of freaks suffers from visions in which she talks to the deranged killer's previous victims and she has deeply emotional and boring conversations with a police officer who just won't die even though a truck ran over him twice the dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and they're definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movie's length i've ever seen instead of all the pointless padding should have paid more attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable <UNK> <UNK> character nicole is an annoying and brainless girl and you won't really care whether she'll survive the ordeal or not her boyfriend jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still weren't painful enough if you ask me i counted exactly three sequences all including torture and gratuitous <UNK> that were gory and exciting enough to bring a <UNK> smile on my face that's still way too few for a nowadays horror movie basically rest stop is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like wolf creek and hostel but you're better off watching the originals this was the first film of the new production company called they're promoting themselves as the new name in great horror but they'll have to come up with something much better than rest stop if they want us to believe that
<START> spoilers with the title of the film having the name of the killer fish twice not once you would expect to see them in action attack biting ripping and eating up almost everyone in the cast of characters instead you have to wait until the movie is almost over for you to get as much as a glimpse of the even then all you see is the water <UNK> and stirring around as a poor individual disappears under it assuming that he's being eaten whole and alive by the fish br br the movie <UNK> <UNK> starts with this scary looking <UNK> on the screen as the credits start rolling down but spoiler that's the only time in the movie that you ever get to see the killer fish or <UNK> you never get to see a <UNK> is the movie again what you do see is a <UNK> of <UNK> and it's people and the <UNK> jungle along the amazon river <UNK> together with a lot of nice and breathtaking photography of the landscape as well as the people and <UNK> but that's about all br br there is some kind of a story that has to do with this great white hunter william smith which ironically means <UNK> in the native language spoken there is this what the title of the film <UNK> <UNK> really meant the person is played by legendary hollywood <UNK> angles biker and all around tough guy william smith br br at the beginning of the movie this trio of american tourists jim and his sister terry peter <UNK> and their american guide art green tom are on their way into the <UNK> <UNK> to go sight seeing with terry taking photos to send back home terry is terrified of guns as we learn that as a young girl saw her father get his head blown off by a gun even when art saves her life using one when <UNK> attack by a six foot long <UNK> terry almost <UNK> him for having a gun which he promised her he wouldn't take along with him on the trip br br at a jungle rest stop or bar the three run into who we first saw catching <UNK> in the jungle at the start of the movie makes himself more then welcomed by the three with his knowledge of the jungle and his half baked philosophy about life and death as well as his ability to get them where their going to the local diamond mines deep in the amazon <UNK> br br even though a bit strange at first the guy is so in to himself that he doesn't seem to notice that there are any people around him turns out to be a <UNK> and likable guy engaging in a long and friendly motorcycle race through the <UNK> and jungle with art even shows terry who at one time in the movie almost knocked his teeth out the fine points of hunting and shooting wild game that he believes don't really die but become a part of him after he kills them a bit crazy but you have to admit this guy's got imagination br br it's much later in the movie that for some strange reason maybe it was the cheap booze that he was drinking suddenly goes insane and become homicidal attacking and <UNK> terry and then murdering her <UNK> brother and feeding him to the deadly trying to escape from the <UNK> lunatic and then being forced to have to fight it out with him art gets beaten up so <UNK> by the dirty fighting that he's almost left unconscious just when about to finally kill art he's shot to death by terry who after experiencing what this insane nut job is all about finally decided that guns are indeed very necessary and should be used to kill on very rare but life saving occasions br br worth watching if worth watching at all only for the scenery and nothing else it's just a shame that the movie has to <UNK> as a killer fish or <UNK> horror movie when if it was honest about itself it could have been a more or less average jungle adventure flick with smith he does have the build for it playing tarzan of the <UNK> not african jungle
<START> <UNK> the line of <UNK> is one of those hollywood films that shows up on tv quite a bit but although i've seen it a few times i usually end up sitting through the whole thing again why it's good clint eastwood is great as usual and the character he plays is interesting and more fleshed out than usual the character secret service agent frank is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect president kennedy in dallas and now he's forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly <UNK> that he will kill the president however the film doesn't make him a depressed brooding and obsessed character he's charming and <UNK> and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin he's even quite convincing when he <UNK> with the pretty younger agent played by <UNK> russo the killer played by john <UNK> at his best is cerebral deliberate and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death he even goes by the name of another presidential assassin john booth br br the film is consistently enjoyable and it delivers all the goods suspense action romance and drama all in their proper amounts it's a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it
<START> this movie has it all it is a thriller a chase movie a romance story a mob tale a comedy a road movie well in fact it's none of this at all br br all the time you are waiting for something interesting to happen but no you are still watching the same dull uninspiring and superficial cliché of a movie with a very bad soundtrack even the star cast acting is lacking in credibility a hit man with his quirks a girl who's playing hard to get mob guys acting tough and incapable cops yawn br br i'd recommend not to watch <UNK> if you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor go and see 'the three of by tommy lee jones now that's what i call worth watching
<START> most of the <UNK> <UNK> movies i've seen have failed to take full advantage of her captivating screen presence unfortunately she was given few really good roles in movies of <UNK> quality which was a real <UNK> she deserved them and was able to demonstrate her full cinematic power when they came her way as <UNK> in love on a <UNK> we had a clear exception to the trend of light <UNK> vehicles for it was an interesting artistic film by any reasonable measure and in it a 28 year old <UNK> was at her most <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is another featuring an extremely captivating <UNK> in an interesting well crafted comedy that explores how an ambitious <UNK> man can be convinced to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young wife there are several good performances here her playboy husband michel is one the prince played by charles boyer is another with entertaining efforts by a good supporting cast as for <UNK> <UNK> the way she looks in this movie is the way i remember her as a kid in the fifties she was 23 in 1957 and way ahead of her time more beautiful than any other actress of the period including marilyn monroe her <UNK> <UNK> sexuality <UNK> displayed in several <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dresses simply jumps off the screen she was more hip and cute than the women of america are today nearly fifty years later obsessed with their careers and still desperately <UNK> to feminist politics they come off like a bunch of clueless lesbians in stark contrast the sex <UNK> was sexually <UNK> intelligent and clearly independent long before it was <UNK> yet while fully understanding the power of her exceptional <UNK> she used it for a higher purpose than mere self interest she believed in love a still photo simply could not do her justice you had to watch her <UNK> yet <UNK> form with its 20 inch <UNK> lightly cross a room you had to see that wild blonde <UNK> <UNK> into her big brown seductive eyes and listen as her full <UNK> lips spoke french in a <UNK> at the end of this movie she <UNK> and <UNK> with the camera her beautiful <UNK> <UNK> what a babe for fans of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is not to be missed
<START> how can you go wrong with a film that mixes the sophistication of peter cushing the determination of donald <UNK> and the bust of peters easy you give them a terrible script to work with br br peter cushing in an evil role leads a satanic cult that has captured a couple friends of donald <UNK> donald plays a determined but <UNK> priest that desires to locate his friends but needs the help of fred from scooby doo to locate them he <UNK> the help of a new york who dresses just like the hero of the cartoon in his task meanwhile the girlfriend of one of the missing people peters joins the search if all this sounds interesting then you like myself were <UNK> br br it doesn't take long for the trio to <UNK> out the baddies but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are foolish also women will find this a <UNK> every time they get on the bad guys trail our two male heroes tell to stay at the hotel even though she can handle herself better than the <UNK> priest played by <UNK> br br story the script really lets us down no tension is built no worthwhile dialogue is given the stars and you'll need both hands to count the number of times peters is told to stay behind and let men do men work if you're interested in seeing a <UNK> on film don't bother we get a statue of a <UNK> that <UNK> flames br br violence there are some attacks and a few sacrifices but those of you who <UNK> for gore will be letdown br br acting even though there are three of my favorite actors in this film there is nothing <UNK> here peter cushing doesn't have much screen time donald <UNK> is clearly aware that he is on the set of a stinker and peters is ill used this should have been much better given the talent involved but then again the <UNK> lose a game here and there too br br nudity peters takes a bath but you see next to nothing she isn't as <UNK> here as she was in the flesh and blood show
<START> a friend of mine loves tacky horror films so i often get to see low budget stuff like this this is however the first time i have been compelled to write a review of one br br put simply this is probably the worst film i have ever seen even worse then <UNK> creek ii br br the entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when dr <UNK> stands in this chamber thing turns all vampire ish br br the only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers but for all the wrong reasons
<START> i was in my early <UNK> just <UNK> from college when this movie appeared seeing it was event of great impact not only because of the high quality of the film as <UNK> by its many awards but because of its place in the historical context of 1959 because of social progress since then it is nearly impossible to <UNK> that my college had only begun <UNK> carefully screened black students in 1953 a mainstream high budget with an almost entirely black cast was a distinct novelty in 1959 br br the movie was given a <UNK> <UNK> reserved seat presentation in only the best theatres complete with a <UNK> program <UNK> the lavish care that had been taken with lighting and color multi track <UNK> sound etc almost every black entertainer that we white people had any knowledge of was in the movie <UNK> music superbly performed and the sheer universal humanity of the story was tremendously moving br br i was recently able to obtain a faded copy of a two hour cutting of the film and repeated viewings have confirmed my opinion time has made what seemed steamy sex scenes in 1959 seem quite tame but the musical quality has not <UNK> sammy davis and pearl <UNK> are masterful in their portrayals what a crime that the young black artists of today are unable to see these performers at the peak of their careers
<START> i've seen three of the <UNK> episodes and this is my favorite of all of them the second renaissance provided a flimsy back story to the already flimsy universe program was a <UNK> impressive number it just felt kind of silly i guess what gives this one it's special touch is the direction from <UNK> director of the incredibly popular and for good reason series cowboy <UNK> it has some of the best elements of <UNK> slick sci fi adventure a no nonsense slightly <UNK> hero working for hire a bounty head more or less and a chase scene all wrapped up in an excellent film noir <UNK> <UNK> tarantino style <UNK> comes through here full <UNK>
<START> the 2005 edition of the royal <UNK> came live from the save mart centre in california the two top <UNK> of the wwe were being <UNK> the undertaker was battling in a <UNK> match shawn michaels was taking on edge in a grudge match that had been building up since last october and of course the every man for himself over the top rope royal <UNK> match itself who was going to take the price this year chris benoit edge eddie <UNK> edge john cena <UNK> edge shawn michaels there was no <UNK> of <UNK> br br it was <UNK> that picked up the popular victory in the main event battle but not without controversy or should i say a <UNK> finish <UNK> and john cena were the final two men in the ring <UNK> was supposed to dump the young <UNK> star over the top rope but it all went wrong and they both went <UNK> to the floor the <UNK> acted on their feet as we had an arm raising contest similar to that of <UNK> hart and lex <UNK> back in 1994 this brought out the <UNK> of the board <UNK> mac walked down to the ring the way only he can but injured himself badly getting into the ring it was unusual to see vince <UNK> sitting legs out telling the two men to <UNK> the match <UNK> then did was he was supposed to do first time round and dumped cena to the floor <UNK> his own future with a championship match at <UNK> 21 br br the <UNK> for this years royal <UNK> had a very solid line up with many of <UNK> biggest stars competing in matches each brand had two big matches each br br raw opened the night with the match between shawn michaels and edge this was a good technical contest back and fourth all the way until edge got the <UNK> this was a smart <UNK> decision and kept edge as a <UNK> to the world <UNK> championship br br the second match of the night was the <UNK> ending <UNK> match between the undertaker and the match was not a classic but then again have their been any classic <UNK> matches it was entertaining especially when got involved and then kane popped out the <UNK> to a great pop the undertaker surprised no one when he got the win <UNK> the <UNK> on and this mediocre <UNK> br br the first of the two championship matches of the night was john <UNK> <UNK> of the wwe championship in a triple threat match against both kurt angle and the big show this match was very good again not a classic but entertaining none the less <UNK> took the win after <UNK> kurt angle his celebration was short lived however when <UNK> teddy long informed him at no way out he would defend the wwe championship in a <UNK> wire steel cage match against big show not a very nice way to spend a sunday night br br and of course there is no show without punch punch of course being <UNK> world <UNK> champion triple h his <UNK> from <UNK> 2004 with randy <UNK> was lot better than the original encounter it's a pity because they just don't seem to click to well in the ring and this would be an excellent <UNK> if they did <UNK> played the <UNK> role very well and went down in defeat to the game br br so the first big one of 2005 was a good one it achieved its goals <UNK> ended and new ones began we were now officially on the road to <UNK> 21
<START> how to <UNK> this film it is simply impossible why you should see it maybe for the story very probably for the actors <UNK> catherine above all for the universe and the poetry this is a tale sad sometimes dark but a tale i love this film just waiting for the dvd thank you mister
<START> this movie is based on the game series final fantasy this one particularly is about or final fantasy <UNK> i loved the game and i was very happy to see it be transformed into a movie i loved the cg that was awesome <UNK> of great fight scenes action and characters to make the movie memorable if your a die hard fan of the game you will love this movie personally i'm not a die hard fan of the games but i am starting to become one br br my favourite character out of final fantasy <UNK> besides cloud would have to be <UNK> i love <UNK> i think he's cute i was amazed how real the cg images were it was amazing it's the game in 3d i had a great time watching the movie and by the way i love the <UNK> to especially he's great overall i gave this movie a 9 because yes i loved it i thought it was a really really good movie and yes it's on my list of movies to get the characters were amazing loved the cg story was wonderful with <UNK> of action and fight scenes all in all it's the best movie i've seen yet based on a video game
<START> the whole exercise is pointless why make the film at all the lighting is ghastly but the sound is just a joke like a high school production whoever put the budget together for this film should be drawn and <UNK> for allowing it to be made without the proper budget for with equipment fit for recording br br so much dialog is <UNK> due to <UNK> in echo or the lack of <UNK> to the <UNK> economy should have been made on any other area the whole production is lifeless and just lame with such amateurish half <UNK> production it lacks warmth clarity and has no design to it
<START> this film is truly pathetic in every <UNK> department awful awful awful it's only around <UNK> minutes long but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an andy <UNK> film then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting br br where to start the <UNK> script the disgusting cinematography the so bad its bad acting the spectacularly dismal effects dreadful music or just the <UNK> thin plot that <UNK> resembles a <UNK> this film is an incoherent <UNK> br br a particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a <UNK> when dominic decides to shoot a cat cue the waitress watching through the <UNK> window who comments with an average english accent god damn to right that woman god damn this horrendous monstrosity br br everyone involved should be <UNK> ashamed of themselves let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again
<START> i'm not sure how this could have been better so i gave it a 10 the acting was excellent the main woman was so hot the <UNK> who played was a <UNK> <UNK> character who showed the inner turmoil he was suffering the truck <UNK> death is one example excellently the storyline was believable and the series length was just about right i e i love lost but will it ever end as a brit i tend to think of <UNK> as <UNK> ho the <UNK> were in their ill advised attempts to arrest him but the other <UNK> were portrayed positively my main thought about <UNK> like this and the also excellent 24 is could it happen would it happen is it happening now possibly probably br br i hope they do another series but after reading some of the previous comments it would appear not br br to <UNK> if you haven't seen it make sure you do
<START> i am a huge fan of the 5 50 dvd bin at my local <UNK> hopefully you have one at your local branch you can find a bunch of campy flicks a bunch of trash and the occasional surprise this movie is one of the surprises my friend recently bought this one and in thinking it would be another cheesy kung fu laugh riot i was genuinely surprised at how good it was i watch a lot of movies and as a result i can almost always call how a movie will turn out and if there's a plot twist what it will be not this movie the directing is brilliant the plot is awesome and the fighting is unbelievably inventive if you see this one sitting around somewhere at a dirt cheap price get it if you see it at full price i would still recommend it
<START> before the days of home video stan <UNK> pre hardy comedy <UNK> or <UNK> was known to the extent that it was known at all only because a few sequences were included in robert <UNK> film and <UNK> laughing knew what he was doing the best gags in <UNK> or <UNK> were brought intact into his <UNK> while the rest of this only mildly funny comedy remained on cutting room floor br br laurel portrays a commercial <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> medicine cried professor i o <UNK> knox all that name is the funniest joke in this movie which ain't <UNK> much i should point out that this movie dates from <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> during <UNK> quite a lot of americans purchased <UNK> medicine if it had <UNK> <UNK> so if knox all contains alcohol <UNK> job in this movie is less desperate than the one which he and ollie <UNK> had in <UNK> <UNK> selling christmas trees in the summer too bad for this movie that it's not nearly so funny as <UNK> <UNK> br br we see stan but don't hear him in this silent film delivering a spirited sales talk to a man who seems to be paying attention until we learn that they're standing outside a deaf mute institution and this man is deaf a <UNK> woman emerges from the gates stan quickly tries to engage her attention by <UNK> his fingers at her of course she's not deaf and she promptly <UNK> him with her <UNK> i found this sequence offensive not because it involves deaf people the deaf aren't the butt of the joke but because it <UNK> the very widely held <UNK> among hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf by merely their fingers randomly and performing without actually learning the highly complex <UNK> of sign language br br more <UNK> a <UNK> in this movie has a pet <UNK> named <UNK> as in <UNK> and there's a gag involving trick photography to <UNK> a man to hide behind an object that's than his body i've seen this device in several cartoons and live action movies but <UNK> or <UNK> is i think the earliest movie to use it that i've seen so far br br stan laurel an under rated actor does one bit of physical business here that's worthy of chaplin or keaton in which he conveys his emotions and a change in his <UNK> while walking away from the camera with his back to us still laurel never really became a first rate comedian until he united with oliver hardy to form the greatest comedy team ever <UNK> or <UNK> barely rates 3 out of 10
<START> this movie is the best one forever upon the warm feelings of this real love story during the korean war by the story of <UNK> sun the <UNK> doctor and mark elliot an american at the shadow of different <UNK> between east and west upon his <UNK> in the love scene between two lovers when he invited her to dance the relationship between east and west must be close in spite of chinese <UNK> and customs that destiny made their great role by between them to replace the pains for both elliot suffered from failure marriage and <UNK> sun suffered from the <UNK> shoot of her husband by chinese <UNK> at the time of <UNK> <UNK> dung in 1949 br br she could not stop the decision of destiny in spite of her practical profile because love has a <UNK> spirit for everyone seek for happiness soul and brilliant memory as the final <UNK> by the voice of elliot after his death and the sadness receive for <UNK> sun for this hard situations when she went to the hill the source of this love under the tree to say goodbye for his body and live with his soul among their <UNK>
<START> i picked out this dvd out of the bin at <UNK> because the cover showed one of the planes i flew during <UNK> <UNK> c i did not fly for air america but knew being a c <UNK> pilot i knew a lot who did including those who flew in my <UNK> unit back home i am not a movie critic but wonder about the <UNK> motivation of directors and writers who make movies like this the best part of this movie has to go to the cameraman the flying shots and stunts although totally cartoon like are excellent the movie begins with hollywood's favorite fall guy in 1969 but the fact is <UNK> did not start air america he did not begin the lies johnson was responsible for air america and <UNK> inherited the lies the war and air america its not fair or accurate to portray <UNK> as a liar on the subject of air america all <UNK> have inherited the lies of their predecessors nobody smart enough to fly a c <UNK> was dumb enough to not know what they were joining that makes the downey character unbelievable a c <UNK> was a rugged airplane it could easily fly on one engine or the two <UNK> jet <UNK> the three stooges shooting a duck with one shot is more likely pilots who flew with air america were <UNK> employees of the cia they were not reckless soldiers of fortune they had a good reason to behave and believe in a future if they survived their extremely dangerous job they were given double time towards a retirement <UNK> they weren't required to sell <UNK> or guns to get a good <UNK> <UNK> was legal and a way of life in sea as it still is today in <UNK> if individual pilots tried to make money on the side it was not cia policy the cia was fighting a war on communism not drugs the writer based his story on war stories pilots love to <UNK> anybody who will buy them a beer and listen the writer and director who had an <UNK> to <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> see the movie and remember how it starts it blames <UNK> for what existed for years remember he didn't become president until jan 20 1969 br br my favorite scene is the landing up hill in the jungle air america pilots put planes in places the aircraft <UNK> never thought possible their were plenty of funny stories that could have been shown instead the director chose to use the rubber scene to show how dumb the cia was this scene shows that the director and writer fell for some pilot bar talk and the joke is on them br br <UNK> <UNK> valley virginia
<START> i had seen in <UNK> and the new <UNK> so i thought i'd give this film a try br br at around 4 <UNK> i bought it at around <UNK> i started to watch at around 8 i fast <UNK> the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasn't at around 8 i threw the dvd into the <UNK> and that's where this film belongs br br what ever happened to british humour the humour so fine and witty intelligent and <UNK> that you find in yes minister <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> towers or the fast show the black humour britain is so famous for i don't want to insult anybody but i presume even stupid children wouldn't find this funny they deserve more intelligent fun and you can do better so please do
<START> when you get ahead of a film you know you are wasting your time watching the movie in question that is exactly how i felt while i was watching darkness i could see <UNK> every twist and turn easily it is a combination of the <UNK> horror and a <UNK> of films that deal with the occult it is so silly that i almost found endearing its <UNK> i cannot say i was wholly bored but i found the film way too derivative for my taste director tries to <UNK> his early spanish hit the <UNK> but he cannot pull it off i admit a few sequences were creepy enough but i just <UNK> when i can figure out what is going to happen next also i hated to see good actors like lena <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sweat so much over this piece of dreck finally anna <UNK> as the star of a horror film this must be a joke she is cute but she is one of those good child actors that have become a very monotonous adult actor you can live without watching this one
<START> this was one of the <UNK> movies i have ever had the <UNK> of sitting through after the introduction where we are given the <UNK> of something killing a couple people in a farm house we are introduced to a white <UNK> family that is moving to a farm and nothing happens for a time then they meet this drifter who helps out on the farm and nothing happens again for a very long time then finally the girl of the family has some stuff happens then some more happens the drifter guy goes nuts and the movie ends in between its all about how this family had to move out <UNK> the girl got in some trouble back home and they have no money and its done so poorly that i could care less about these pathetic people i cannot believe i actually went to the theatres to see this not only did this movie suck but some a hole answered his cell phone dumb morons were making noise and the movie sucked thats why theaters suck bad movies <UNK> crappy food and idiots in the theatre i'm staying home and watching dvds from now on at least i could smoke if i was at home while watching this stupid movie stay home and <UNK> some pie rather than going to a theatre to see this piece of typical crap dumb stupid crap
<START> <UNK> some pretty good rick baker <UNK> special effects and <UNK> <UNK> in a small role this pretty lame italian movie deserves some recognition gets some credit for still making gore flicks while most of the other italian directors <UNK> <UNK> sergio martino <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> g <UNK> have moved on to lower key tv movies as for <UNK> it's half <UNK> half the thing with people into monsters <UNK> women and causing general mayhem the ultra <UNK> sleazy and over <UNK> feel of the film makes it hard to enjoy only available in italian language work <UNK> floating around
<START> in the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and the texas chainsaw massacre monster man surprisingly well made though mindless little horror throw in a little buddy comedy nice gore and intense scare it's hard no to say that monster man is really entertaining the low budget seem pretty obvious but it doesn't <UNK> the presentation of the movie in general and put more big budget horror movies in shame br br yes the plot somewhat generic as possible pair of friend adam eric and <UNK> justin <UNK> are driving cross country to <UNK> the wedding of a woman adam has always loved while adam is more nerdy type <UNK> is a self <UNK> ladies man and very offensive <UNK> adding a bonus to the plot then they picked up a sexy <UNK> sarah <UNK> brooks things turn into nightmare when a monster truck with scary face drive stalking them when dead body starts counting they must do the race against the time before their own life on risk br br the plot is obviously reminiscent of many prior famous horror movies but michael davis as the writer and director succeed in keeping the tension the scare is build well enough where characterization is never be the best but fairly okay the script also <UNK> with comedies that works for the funny moments and they quite enjoyable rather than annoying and also wait for the twist in the finale it's hilarious and shocking in the same time which is pretty amusing br br as conclusion monster man surprisingly entertaining it deserves more attention in the big screen it proves that big budget doesn't make an effective horror movie but skill does something that the director has shown and delivers
<START> i was really beginning to enjoy this show it just started out slow and it wasn't given the chance it deserved it is <UNK> so many people are not at home watching television i know there are a few talent and singing <UNK> but i enjoy them as do many other believe it or not when american idol is done for the year i miss it even though this was not american idol i thought it had potential i feel bad for the singers on the show who wee really starting to grow on me i wish they would <UNK> and put the show back on i think it was a <UNK> move to <UNK> my only complaint about the show is i did not care to much for the judges
<START> according to the article at http <UNK> com article <UNK> one of the actors in the film <UNK> was forced to appear in this movie for free she was the victim of an infamous kidnapping shortly before this movie was made and later photos of her in distress were published in a magazine which has since been forced to shut down and its <UNK> sent to jail the actress <UNK> she was <UNK> but there was a movie <UNK> on net that allegedly showed her being gang raped the hong kong press out of respect for her has mostly refused to report on the incident but <UNK> will turn up a few <UNK> about it
<START> if not the best movie ever made <UNK> feast is certainly among the most loving this is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of artistry <UNK> loyalty and grace humor is mixed with tender longing characters are treated with searching honesty but also deep respect there are <UNK> here on memory fate old age and <UNK> marvellous camera work by cinematographer seldom have <UNK> faces looked so <UNK> in the candle light the meal is accompanied by delicious period music <UNK> and simple folk <UNK> enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit for as the general says mercy and truth have met together and <UNK> and bliss shall kiss one another
<START> sorry folks i love ray work but the one thing he ain't is a leading man maybe if you pretend he's the last man on earth this romantic plot might work but now br br here's a movie that exists simply to showcase the title song which was a big hit for the <UNK> band the year before 1951 and some pretty nifty singing and dancing save it from being a total disaster br br however the story line is pathetic even by <UNK> musical comedy standards and the other songs are equally as forgettable as evening in paris <UNK> the dialogue <UNK> the stars day <UNK> only claude charms keep his character three dimensional br br so how to enjoy this movie on video br br a fast forward through all the dialogue br br b surrender yourself to doris day's <UNK> and ray loose <UNK> <UNK> and don't miss hilarious take on a rain <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of april in paris br br c finally keep a couple of <UNK> of <UNK> and handy br br bob raymond
<START> a group of <UNK> travel to an island to <UNK> a secret lab that is <UNK> on animals when they arrive they discover that they are to late apparently the government made a scientist test his experiment on a <UNK> and yes you guessed it a <UNK> which made them grow very large i'm not sure that this movie really needed or deserved explaining since it is almost identical to curse of the <UNK> which also sucked the computer effects are as <UNK> as ever an the <UNK> <UNK> like a dinosaur which really got on my nerves like <UNK> vs python this movie is not worth seeing and is about as much fun to watch as it is to nail your hand to a table avoid
<START> how bad can you make a film a good question which house of the dead 2 succeeds in answering i could not believe it was possible to get something worse than the first house of the dead but amazingly the director has succeeded the only feeling you get from the film is that its bad just bad what with overacting bad fx and a stupid story its this kind of movie which gives a bad name to z movies in general why could they not learn the lesson from the first house of the dead movie anyway i guess you will have understood by now that you should not see this film it is but a waste of time watch bad taste or dawn of the dead if you want to see some good zombies
<START> team spirit is maybe made by the best intentions but it misses the warmth of all stars 1997 by jean van de <UNK> most scenes are just not that funny and not that well done the actors repeat the same lines as in all stars but without much feeling
<START> i'm sorry folks but these enthusiastic reviews on this <UNK> site about this movie are very strange to say the least is <UNK> <UNK> i ask and didn't find an answer of course the movie is beautifully filmed at part it's almost a documentary but then the fact is that when it comes to the women <UNK> she shows every sign of a deep illness and i was wondering throughout the movie what the heck she has her behavior is absolutely <UNK> and the shocked citizens of the village are very right indeed in wanting to send her off to a proper institution to see what can be done about her condition she needs treatment <UNK> behaviour like hers is <UNK> to everybody around her her husband the poor children especially and the fellow citizens let's not be <UNK> romantic about this i hated this <UNK> portrait of a mentally ill why for god's sake should the husband not want to have her <UNK> or at least try to do this why the horror of going to <UNK> a big city sure but lots of possibilities of capable persons to cure her <UNK> anyway i inspired myself on this site for renting the movie on dvd and after seeing it i had to post this for others to make themselves an opinion on it frankly i understand why the movie did not get any further as an indication to the cannes selection
<START> this movie <UNK> the word confused all the actors stay true to the script <UNK> the pity because the acting is fine but the script is a confused <UNK> of pseudo psycho <UNK> random ideas the pacing is mind numbingly slow and the soft focus lens cinematography gets on the nerves quickly i give it 4 out of 10
<START> high school years and decades later some look back on it with <UNK> others with embarrassment but few find it easy to forget it's one of the most critical <UNK> of our lives when changes come fast and furious whether we're ready or not no longer children not yet adults irresistible forces <UNK> us pushing and pulling us in every direction br br fame did its best to capture this <UNK> chaotic period for its cast of young characters for the most part it succeeded it <UNK> but did feel like a slice of life this movie holds a special place in the hearts of the class of <UNK> we had just <UNK> farewell to a decade and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years we were headed out into the cold cruel world leaving home for college then parts unknown as we approached our <UNK> event this newly released movie was like a two hour <UNK> for us we couldn't escape the titular song on the radio that was us up there on the screen those were our friends rivals and classmates as we had faced our own dreams <UNK> <UNK> and failures br br it's especially poignant for those who attended any of new york city's other elite top <UNK> high schools especially <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of science or brooklyn tech like the kids here we were considered the best of the best we had no <UNK> but instead <UNK> entrance <UNK> perhaps even more than the performing arts kids we were expected to change the world although not necessarily become famous like them not all of us made it but the pressure <UNK> environment <UNK> extraordinary <UNK> and de <UNK> not unlike the toe <UNK> hot lunch jam in the <UNK> on our own <UNK> day our spirits <UNK> almost like the <UNK> <UNK> in the rousing finale the film leaves us <UNK> on a single <UNK> note at the end of i sing the body electric pointing to the <UNK> bright <UNK> future and all the promise it held br br fame couldn't have been set anywhere else this story never would have worked in a small or suburban school los angeles has a stronger <UNK> with movies and television but nyc is a <UNK> for all of the arts home not only to what was then called <UNK> but also world renowned nyc is a cultural center <UNK> by any other city in the world it's also a time capsule of the rest of the city of the time showing the <UNK> <UNK> and dirt that was <UNK> of a new york still struggling back from the <UNK> crisis that had nearly <UNK> it but most of all it showed the <UNK> since muted by the <UNK> of <UNK> disney and <UNK> br br what i wouldn't give to be young again but with fame at least i can remember what it was like
<START> if i was british i would be embarrassed by this portrayal of incompetence a protection agent of the special branch unable to defend herself against a sick <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the home office sends a single science <UNK> to investigate a possible level four <UNK> and that <UNK> doesn't have the sense to wear even a mask and <UNK> totally <UNK> london police officers working side by side with <UNK> in full <UNK> suits the <UNK> and his bodyguard the <UNK> of a <UNK> doctor <UNK> on human subjects without any <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one wonders whether the producers could not afford to hire any technical <UNK> or if for some <UNK> reason they <UNK> decided to portray the principals as hopelessly incompetent even my wife who has no background in either medicine or law <UNK> was rolling her eyes in disbelief after the first episode i was <UNK> now that i have seen two episodes i give up
<START> what could have been some <UNK> creepy stuff ends up being an incomprehensible nutty motion picture that even the filmmakers themselves probably didn't understand had they shown more of the satanic ritual or whatever it might have been <UNK> but as it stands now this is a waste of time and brain cells is anybody else getting sick of the whole little kid drawing creepy pictures with <UNK> thing could there possibly be a bigger horror cliché probably not i know i know it's from some different country and it's far too <UNK> and sophisticated for me to understand so i shouldn't expect the plot to be <UNK> fed to me blah blah blah whatever i still say the movie blows
<START> most of the other <UNK> beat this movie up and deservedly so i've just got to <UNK> in on the technical <UNK> of the film makers it would have been nice if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a gun was because he had no clue br br spoilers ahead you have been warned br br stupidity br br <UNK> <UNK> team assembled from various military <UNK> whose members have never met each other before br br maybe two people in the unit had weapons that used the same magazines parts <UNK> etc br br the sniper school <UNK> uses a sub machine gun pistol caliber as opposed to a rifle which we would assume she would be more <UNK> with br br one poor team <UNK> night vision <UNK> <UNK> more than the rifle does you can tell when he handles it that it is seriously top heavy br br the team leader sends out a team member to challenge the <UNK> man when they first confront him challenge a 200 year old <UNK> native american <UNK> with a long <UNK> and an attitude riding an undead war horse with a severe <UNK> i think not <UNK> br br bullets do not spark when they hit trees mr director a couple of people have already mentioned this br br the teams air support consists of a <UNK> black helicopter only this one has a couple of <UNK> <UNK> underneath someone forgot to tell the <UNK> crew that the <UNK> man doesn't fly and they are over the american <UNK> where there won't be any enemy aircraft they should have carried some air to ground <UNK> instead br br the air to ground consists of a door <UNK> with a semi auto <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> needless to say he only hits dirt should have brought a belt fed light machine gun br br door <UNK> later finds out that a <UNK> <UNK> is pretty useless as well br br a wooden arrow from a freaking <UNK> bow does not down <UNK> mr director br br i pretty well could not take anymore after this point about 30 minutes and gave up you seriously need a <UNK> <UNK> to make it through this flick it is just that painful
<START> this movie <UNK> to be a character study of <UNK> some reviewers have been <UNK> into assuming that because <UNK> is depicted the film is psychologically deep actually considering the <UNK> material it is surprisingly tedious and shallow with no <UNK> substance why is the main character the way she is you won't find out from the script for a better treatment of the same theme and a more entertaining movie try <UNK> belle de <UNK>
<START> the kid was born retarded it pulls in a half dozen directions features dialog and action lifted from much older and better known <UNK> and might be funny if only the writers knew what funny is br br disney stuff has gotten a lot better in the last couple of decades but don't let that fool you they should have given the kid a wide <UNK> sang it a <UNK> then ran the train into a <UNK> mercy killing
<START> altman is very proud of the fact that people in his movies talk over each other because he says people do that in life well people also <UNK> <UNK> go off on <UNK> etc the point is that just because people actually do something doesn't make it compelling cinema that's one issue br br the bigger issue is that this just isn't a very clever or direct or hitting or relevant satire in 1988 or 2004 <UNK> <UNK> is still living in the 1960s and thinks everyone except a small core of <UNK> elected officials is a 60s style hippie liberal i mean the guy still <UNK> out in his strip a character that is a complete <UNK> yet <UNK> still employs him as if he is representative of a large <UNK> of american youth br br don't get me wrong i am a conservative but i'm not saying that this is bad because it's got a liberal bent it could take a liberal <UNK> and be funny and relevant but it's not it is mainly a vanity piece with a bunch of prominent celebrity <UNK> including the <UNK> <UNK> ron reagan jr at times it feels <UNK> and the rest of the time it has a <UNK> air of self importance and aren't we oh so clever <UNK> br br someone said that this show insists it has a cult following i think its cult status is more wished for than actual i'm certain there are two or three people out there who taped all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them but if that is the standard then every show ever aired is a cult classic to some degree if <UNK> didn't have the names altman and <UNK> attached it would be another forgotten hbo production from the 1980s instead it's presented as hard hitting <UNK> political commentary from guys who are at the top of their game the reality however is about as far from that as possible pat <UNK> presidential satire is more relevant than <UNK> ever was and he's been dead for a decade
<START> if this film were to be rated on a scale of 1 to 10 one would need to create a new rating system as this one should not even qualify the film's plot if you can call it that revolves around charlie stephen baldwin an ex special <UNK> agent who is being targeted by the brother of a man he killed while he was still working for the us <UNK> if this sounds like an interesting scenario please don't be fooled as this film will not deliver that which its action themed story suggests br br comedian chris rock once said that when one sees an actor doing a bad film that it makes one want to send the actor 50 given that the actor must be desperate for money to be doing such poor quality work after watching this film you may want to send stephen baldwin 100 br br it appears that baldwin did not put any effort into his role in the film in the film baldwin is forced to run all over the city of los angeles in order to protect his <UNK> wife from being murdered by the brother of a man he previously killed however throughout the picture it appears that baldwin can barely pull off maintaining a light <UNK> his laid back performance succeeds in from any suspense that the film might have intended to portray br br if you are the type of person who enjoys watching very bad films and laughing at their shortcomings than this film is for you however if you are looking for a well made action thriller it would be best to look somewhere else rather than renting this film
<START> possible spoiler alert br br it's unlikely that seagal will ever again scale the heights of he did with on deadly ground mainly because no one's ever going to let him direct again but he sure tries don't he br br this one's a typically brainless and badly written little fantasy about how indian folk <UNK> are much more effective than western medicine seagal seems to actually believe this nonsense although he never explains why life <UNK> in the <UNK> and europe is so much higher than it was in <UNK> br br kinda like he never explains how his supposed water <UNK> <UNK> work in on deadly ground br br even the action in this one sucks
<START> the italian concept of <UNK> was the grace and <UNK> in social manners that led to success in love as described in the <UNK> century <UNK> the the film <UNK> is worth watching for the <UNK> of the concept in the dynamic performance of will smith br br smith plays the character of alex <UNK> <UNK> who is a professional dating <UNK> to those short on luck and confidence the best scenes are when <UNK> <UNK> the painfully shy and <UNK> albert in his quest to win the heart of a new york <UNK> and in <UNK> own attraction to sara and a surprise for her when visiting <UNK> island in these scenes smith is supported with good work from kevin james and eva <UNK> but this film is driven by the charm and <UNK> personality of smith br br from start to finish smith rises above the average comic script to make <UNK> an <UNK> watchable and entertaining film i do not believe there is another actor working today who is capable of delivering the charisma and the perfect timing with the comic moments like will smith in this film and his secret is in the <UNK>
<START> i was 19 or 20 years old at the time and living in salt lake city <UNK> and i still remember the new <UNK> theater called the century 21 <UNK> that <UNK> and a new sound system large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater we felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film <UNK> da da da <UNK> da <UNK> <UNK> i can still hear the opening music <UNK> <UNK> and the crash of i loved the interplay of characters and the filmed <UNK> i know peter <UNK> and <UNK> and sally had some trouble with the lip sink but hey this was a feel good go feel better about things film what i regret is the way they cut the meaningful heart out of it showed the cut version and then called it a flop i saw the cut version and i can see it lost its view of the vision it had in the preview edition yes i <UNK> a bit at <UNK> effort to make love through music but you know i didn't see it that way when i left the theater when they <UNK> us as we left i regret any comment i made that may have altered the original i liked it then and still see it while i listen to the music on my <UNK> most of my family has heard me sing much of the sound track and i can use the films monologues in our games of what movie is this i wish a director's cut on dvd was available it is available on vhs but its not quite the same i would particularly like a full serious lord of the rings style commentary about its origins struggles and <UNK> <UNK> people should leave things well enough alone bring it back
<START> another example of the women in prison genre this is not exactly a genre known for quality films but this is a notch below most a bunch of women are taken from the where they work to a prison on a rocky island once there they are subjected to lots of poorly directed sex and atrocious dialog for a film with an astounding amount of sex and nudity there is really nothing erotic about any of it the sex scenes are <UNK> acted and some scenes like the shower scene seem to drag on and on that said there are at least some minimal production values on the w i p scale i would put it above fur but below <UNK> heat
<START> oliver stone hits the <UNK> eye with this film aided <UNK> by <UNK> screen presence and biting brilliant screenplay every moment <UNK> with a <UNK> growing tension <UNK> in a truly memorable movie going experience if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to <UNK> two highly <UNK> into a <UNK> union of creativity then this is it the result is a <UNK> achievement made more <UNK> now perhaps because of our <UNK> disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame br br an ultimate <UNK> of our <UNK> increasing <UNK> and self sickening <UNK> for the next big thrill br br a film not easily forgotten i highly recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature
<START> i am in a movie club at my school and i was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film the film's story is not dismal but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal the acting was absolutely dreadful the children were overly whiny a metal pole could have done a better job i wanted desperately to fall asleep but because the television was so loud i was kept from peace the <UNK> are neither cute nor are they funny the drama is laugh worthy i cannot remember when i saw a more dreadful film the story is weak thin predictable and completely fake the adults try to be good actors but they just can't seem to break through stereotypes the girl even appears to want to leave the film via falling off a hill during the movie in order to leave it i don't blame her micheal anderson should <UNK> apologize for this film not just to me but to everyone else who was forced to sit through this awful film in fact i apologize to you even if i had nothing to do with this project i apologize for this film because this means at least someone will this film even surpasses the <UNK> of films that of rob schneider and the <UNK> girls i would even go as far to say that it is even worse that <UNK> <UNK> collection of films but that's pushing it just please don't see this film or else you'll be pushed to write a review similar to this one on how awful this film is i'm very sorry
<START> i remember seeing this in the early 90's on uk tv and was hooked the international scope of the production is breathtaking and watching how the characters develop through the five hours it runs for is magnificent the scenes set in <UNK> and afghanistan are of particular interest and as a viewer you get a real sense of a grounds eye view of the culture and vibe of these countries during the closing stages of the cold war the characters of and helen develop really well throughout the series and rivals modern shows like the sopranos and six feet under in this area in the uk the vhs goes for about <UNK> and the dvd about <UNK> a quality bargain i thought <UNK> version was great too but clearly owes this masterpiece a huge debt
<START> this started out as a good sketch comedy the first few shows were very good and i was looking forward to a long run what was really funny was the <UNK> carey imitation and the take off on beverly hills <UNK> featuring the hair fight the <UNK> burke vs william conrad heavy weight battle was also good unfortunately the following shows went downhill relatively quickly the writing became uninspired and oh so predictable as if the show had acquired a cult following in it's young <UNK> nothing fresh was being offered and the recurring skits were boring one example is the gun family or whatever it was called which became a weekly feature this sketch was not all that funny to begin with let alone being a regular feature an example of a quick promising start then a sudden fall
<START> this series has recently been <UNK> and <UNK> can be seen at least within britain via http www <UNK> uk tv id <UNK> <UNK> presumably there is some hope that the series may eventually become available more widely the problem is that this series was followed by the series the wars of the <UNK> that had a similarly stellar cast and which has been available to cable tv or at least <UNK> the market br br the two series are quite different in <UNK> the wars the plays through extensive <UNK> and shifting of scenes an age of kings follows shakespeare more closely both series benefit from integral casting
<START> this movie was over <UNK> by 'the bruce willis richard gere which was released the same year having seen both films i can honestly say this is the superior film br br granted the production value of 'the was very good it probably had a <UNK> bigger budget however 'the is well written and has a fascinating story <UNK> quinn is flawless in <UNK> roles <UNK> quinn and director christian <UNK> did a great job of establishing a deep and multi layered relationship between the title character and his family i particularly liked the ending br br i was reminded of the jack ryan character in the tom <UNK> movies both are naval officers thrown into unbelievably dangerous roles as they <UNK> work on behalf of national security and yet both harrison ford and <UNK> quinn reveal their respective characters as <UNK> who manage to be both <UNK> and gentle they have a genuine <UNK> and vulnerability in their relationships with their families br br what i don't understand is how the opinions of all who have posted on this movie myself included can be so much more positive than the luke warm reception the film has received this is a movie that has enough complexity and subtlety that it remains compelling after multiple viewings if you are a fan of espionage genre films i recommend 'the <UNK>
<START> from the dire special effects <UNK> i was absolutely <UNK> <UNK> at how bad anyone can make a film lets put it this way i have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film i thought 'i can do better than that whilst sat watching this <UNK> the acting in this film was terrible i suppose the best actor was the guy from <UNK> man but the french guy from was so wooden i wondered how he got the former job in the first place the storyline was mediocre and i suppose like most films if the rest had been done well it would have stood up i don't usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating must be cast crew i felt i had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this <UNK>
<START> story chinese tall story tells the story of righteous monk who along with his <UNK> monkey sandy and make their journey west on a quest to recover ancient finally they reach the final leg of their journey in city but all is not as it seems when the city is attacked by evil tree demons monkey tries his best to battle them but is overwhelmed knowing his master is in grave danger he uses his <UNK> golden staff to thrust to safety br br the monk ends up being knocked out when he land and when he wakes up he finds himself in the presence of a young lizard <UNK> named who takes quite a shine to our young hero after many verbal <UNK> becomes convinced loves her so when the monk decides he must rescue monkey and the others she insists on accompanying him so the <UNK> pair begins their adventure together br br review okay so it's another journey to the west movie which isn't a bad thing to me since i love the story and the characters associated with it so i was a little excited to get my hands on the dvd so i think i'll start off my review with the story which is all over the place at first it was your standard fantasy film then it became a ridiculous comedy then suddenly became full blown sci fi if the director jeff <UNK> was <UNK> with mixing genres then he did a pretty <UNK> job with this movie i think it's a pretty unique approach by having the story centre on a character other then the infamous monkey king especially taking a character as <UNK> as and then putting him into what is at it's core a love story so overall i liked it br br the acting is for the most part solid with leads nicholas <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> putting in some really good performances though ah <UNK> does spend most of her screen time behind some rather ugly make up the supporting cast is nicely put together it includes all the usual main stays so and <UNK> <UNK> make appearances one actor i'd like to mention is wilson <UNK> who plays the monkey king he did a good job with the limited material he seemed to have been given he played a version of the monkey king who was subdued yet arrogant i had a feeling he'd be twins effect ii territory but fortunately that's not the case here i hope he gets to do a follow up to this with himself in the central role since the film does leave itself open for a sequel br br okay so let's get down to the directing which again is kinda all over the place <UNK> gives too much time to the stephen <UNK> esquire nonsense comedy which includes a scene where in order to <UNK> himself up dresses up as spider man which i assume lead to many a head scratching moment since the film is meant to be set in ancient china he does create some really nice and tender moments between the two leads and does delve into sappy territory but this reviewer does enjoy a bit of <UNK> on occasion so it didn't bother me in the slightest br br right now onto the cgi which for the most part is quite bearable there are a lot of moments which probably belong on a <UNK> like many other reviews have stated but there are some cool moments particularly the scene in which monkey battles a flying <UNK> a lot of the cg gags are provided in the form of the golden staff which turns into a range of different things ranging from a giant fly to a <UNK> suit straight out of the matrix <UNK> so yeah it sounds crazy but i guess you'd have to see it to believe it br br right so in closing a chinese tall story isn't a movie without it's flaws but it keeps itself together long enough to be able to entertain and generally be a overall enjoyable movie if all of the above doesn't swing you to see it how about i put it this way it's much better then twins effect ii
<START> this film is about a <UNK> wife who lost her husband through suicide she is tormented by her son who refused to speak after that br br child grief is rarely explored on film so it is refreshing to see a film like <UNK> wall however due to the very nature of the film there is no tension or drama apart from a few key emotional moments everything in the film is very plain the abrupt ending that does not solve any mysteries certainly do not help the film to be more watchable <UNK> wall could have been much better such as exploration of the <UNK> of the wall a more <UNK> care program to help <UNK> to go through his trauma instead the film feels very unfinished and non engaging
<START> i hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem except to say that it represents young buster keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half dozen best short comedies ever made the goat is twenty minutes of smoothly paced expertly photographed beautifully executed gags two <UNK> of non stop comic invention driven by an <UNK> <UNK> of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending which wasn't always the way with <UNK> comedies see cops for one case where <UNK> ultimately got the better of him or one week for the victory of <UNK> if i had to describe this film in one word i'd call it <UNK> but if i were <UNK> two i'd call it seemingly <UNK> for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic <UNK> that unfolds with such sublime ease still they didn't call him the great stone face for nothing buster never let the public see him sweat br br a <UNK> title card tells us that our opening sequence is set along row i e on a bread line in a grim urban setting where buster waits <UNK> at the back of the line and as a result doesn't get fed but it needs to be <UNK> that not for one moment does he play for pathos buster has our sympathy but he never asks for it before long through a series of <UNK> <UNK> and absurd <UNK> buster is believed to be an escaped killer named dead shot dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around and yet while he's clearly <UNK> by this turn of events there is never a hint of self pity or even surprise we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him and that he hasn't time to feel sorry for himself anyway he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trap br br just as buster <UNK> from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either which is especially impressive because the goat must be one of the most laugh packed short comedies in existence this is the film that features that iconic shot of buster riding a <UNK> cow <UNK> right up to the very lens of the camera which isn't a gag exactly but sure is laugh provoking in its own strange way meanwhile there are gags involving guns dogs cops an incredibly <UNK> mustache and a clay statue of a horse that <UNK> under <UNK> weight a surreal sight indeed but some of the biggest are saved for the finale when buster is trying to <UNK> his primary nemesis big joe roberts a <UNK> cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady virginia fox trapped in big <UNK> <UNK> room buster leap <UNK> over him and <UNK> through a turns a phone booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his <UNK> and win the girl in time for one last fade out gag br br to say more would be a <UNK> to first time viewers i only wish i could see this film in a theater full of people who'd never seen it before and <UNK> on the laughter live musical <UNK> would be nice too and incidentally the musical score <UNK> by <UNK> for their home video dvd version of the goat is first rate serving as <UNK> on an already tasty cake
<START> there's something going on in this film directed by x files <UNK> john that has <UNK> me you get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems yet i feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward it's about perception there are characters the heroine nicole <UNK> alexander meets in the film that she talks to that up and <UNK> this might seem like a spoiler but it's something that really only <UNK> a wee bit of focus on the <UNK> part they seem to be <UNK> fun at us as we watch curious at whether we should trust what nicole is seeing or not it never gets a proper answer and i for one was a bit clueless at the point there comes a time in a film when ambiguity can just be frustrating because the viewer is led on a wild <UNK> chase that ends at a dead end with little explanation at what we just saw it ultimately feels like an <UNK> exercise instead of a thrilling psycho drama now there's nothing wrong with ambiguity itself but give us something to <UNK> onto or you will <UNK> us that's how i felt as i watched rest stop this film is supposedly about a young woman named nicole who decides to run off to california with lover jesse joey to make it big in hollywood they make what is supposed to be a slight <UNK> at a rest stop so that nicole can pee but it <UNK> into terror for her when she finds that her jesse is completely missing someone in a <UNK> dusty yellow truck is a nut job who seems to be causing a lot of trouble to nicole and we soon realize that he is behind <UNK> disappearance when things start to occur signs provided to her if you will she will have to find a way out of a very difficult situation nicole is far from any existing town and with limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who provides her with some strong evidence of how evil he can be br br that's the easy part when a female character comes into play the film makes a really bizarre leap from logic as we are not sure where she ever came from how she got there and more importantly where she goes once nicole tries to break her free from her supposed prison in the <UNK> she meets another a police officer in the area joey lawrence who might seem like her <UNK> but when he too is a victim of the truck driver startling things occur again that questions if he was ever actually even there to begin with the truck driver commits <UNK> acts to nicole like her up in the <UNK> and as she tries to <UNK> a wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock she receives a nasty bite from him he then sets fire to the <UNK> leaving her without a lasting place of <UNK> from the beast br br it's the timing of the truck <UNK> attacks that has me <UNK> perhaps he just likes <UNK> her but he appropriately appears in certain situations where nicole has time to flee or prepare it doesn't make much sense his motives which <UNK> the film into an illogical idea why does he make himself so obvious why does he allow her to prepare it seems i'm going out on a <UNK> here that he likes having his <UNK> believe they can find a way of escape only to <UNK> that hope out when he comes up with his next grisly attack yet why does decide to play with the viewer by having nicole experience odd <UNK> with people that don't exist what is and the writing team trying to say and to cap off the film's unhinged weirdness is a family in a <UNK> they play a small part in the scheme of things as religious <UNK> themselves but the film doesn't do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film at all
<START> and obviously i didn't see it br br but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead i know now to avoid this like the plague i hate it when hollywood producers writers directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one won't you say br br and i can't believe that someone like louis <UNK> jr would return for something like that br br did jason really decline this well i hate to say it but even if he took the role again it would have still had that same continuity error i bet if he really turned it down he must have been <UNK> seeing that his character died in the second film br br i'll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd
<START> i found this dvd in the library and based on the jacket notes it looked like it might possibly be interesting a black comedy set in 1940 france just as the germans are <UNK> in boy that should have them rolling in the but it does this is a clever original suspenseful and funny film i don't recall seeing anything like it before  foreign or u s that the writer director can find humor when we know part of the outcome the germans will <UNK> france for four years is remarkable that he does it with such charm is part of the delight what starts off as black comedy and fluff even ends up having a couple of serious moments  including a race to spirit out a <UNK> of heavy water which was part of the <UNK> research for the a bomb and a quick history 101 intro to the <UNK> of the <UNK> government that would <UNK> southern france for much of the german <UNK> but don't let any of that that scare you off the movie itself is funny charming and romantic and races ahead at steady clip br br one of the best things about it is the combination of actors we've seen many times <UNK> and depardieu and others we've never heard of before along the way there are two star making turns <UNK> and both are impressive but mr is especially so according to imdb he was in ten films before this one  but he also won the <UNK> as most promising actor for this role so apparently he was not all that well known even in france he is a combination of romantic lead and comic actor  and he makes it all seem so <UNK> you may be reminded of cary grant in bringing up baby and <UNK> and old <UNK>  it's hard to do comedy on film because the risks are enormous that the actor can come off looking inept but grant pulled it off <UNK> and this guy does also i should think we're going to hear more about him in the future br br to be sure this film won't please everyone  there's a little bit of violence although nothing you don't see on tv every day but if you're up for something original you may feel after you've seen this that you've <UNK> a cinematic gem br br the so called spoiler in this comment
<START> it carries the tone of voice that <UNK> the book into the jungle of vietnam and into the wild eyed look of martin sheen and dennis hopper and the mystical <UNK> surrounding colonel <UNK> i don't say marlon brando because after watching the documentary hearts of darkness i am skeptical as to how much credit brando is due for that quality the tone of voice i'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing everybody gets what he wants i wanted a mission and for my sins they gave me one they sent it up with room service it is indulgent without being narrow and <UNK> a good example of is <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> madness <UNK> <UNK> lines written by t s <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> into his <UNK> monologues i mean the man's a he'll walk right by you without even saying a word and sometimes he'll grab you by the collar and say did you know that is the middle word in you can hold your head while all around you they are losing theirs and then i mean he's a wise man he's a great man i should have been a pair of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> across the floors of silent <UNK> the first one's <UNK> the second one's <UNK>
<START> if you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting jokes props and overall film making as me and my friends you need to rent this br br from simply reading the tag line and seeing how not funny it is you should assume more not funny poor quality great hilarious content through out its a tale of some of kids who defy every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern day big screen tv to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends not to mention a hilariously serious scene where t rex becomes a father figure for one of the kids yeah br br it should be in the comedy section but you'll find it with kid movies if you find it at all so call your friends over sit back relax get ready to laugh and enjoy you will be <UNK> the laughably horrific one liners in this movie for weeks whats with all the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> made back to back with nights of the living <UNK> with the same cast and setting but for certain this one does not have laura <UNK> much <UNK> by all i rather like this movie sure enough the storyline and dialogue are <UNK> but this is so beautifully filmed in such a marvellous setting and i actually like the hardcore i find it at once <UNK> and exotic and that doesn't just mean there is a black girl and some limp <UNK> i find the numerous and varied sex scenes very believable even if two are set upon a tree <UNK> at the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly <UNK> around the creature does not <UNK> to appear until half hour before the end and is it has to be said a disappointment still in the time remaining he manages to kill off all but two of the expedition and in the case of the girls having sex with them first or afterwards in at least one case and this film is not as slow as some maintain moreover there are some fine moments of <UNK> not least the lady scientist and her urge for two and the glorious finale when the two survivors speed off in their boat <UNK> back at the island they have escaped from and find there is still time for one last act of <UNK>
<START> <UNK> water is a very beautiful movie i would put it straight under the wonderful short movie <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> it's not only about coming out but also about tolerance and acceptance in general i am looking forward to seeing more of laurel work in the future the actors angie <UNK> and nina are quite good the main characters relationship could have been a bit as we understand there is a very strong bond between them but maybe this could have been explained a bit i am surprised that angie <UNK> doesn't appear much in other movies a great first step as a director for laurel <UNK> i am sure there's more to see from her skills
<START> even with all the cinema dealing with the trauma of the vietnam war <UNK> ladder the deer hunter apocalypse now and taxi driver to an extent one feels that we don't even know the half of what happened even <UNK> the horror feels <UNK> and a progression or <UNK> to the <UNK> that it <UNK> is a key part of apocalypse now <UNK> greatest and one of the most important films ever made loosely based on joseph <UNK> <UNK> classic heart of darkness which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with distance from civilization a <UNK> of a <UNK> nature as it were a la lord of the flies it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to vietnam the story is of <UNK> a general <UNK> on a special mission to cambodia after his first tour of duty in vietnam is served <UNK> at the beginning of the film is stuck in <UNK> psychologically unable to go back home <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the deer hunter so he is <UNK> his mission is to <UNK> a <UNK> green <UNK> who has isolated himself in a remote <UNK> on the river and who has <UNK> gone completely insane <UNK> like a god by the natives and killing <UNK> this man's name is colonel <UNK> played by marlon brando in the second best role of his career the best being stanley <UNK> in a <UNK> named desire as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in an army boat with some soldiers accompanying his witnessing the horrors and the insanity and the overwhelming <UNK> of it all leads to an eerie sympathy and <UNK> with <UNK> before they even meet by the time they do methods don't really seem as wrong or as they should and they certainly don't seem too unusual or out of place apocalypse a place beyond morality the <UNK> on the end of the world the loss of civilization the loss of judgement of self monologue about an atrocity he witnessed as a green <UNK> and his later revelation is one of the most chilling and well delivered speeches in cinema history the film is about trauma about the human spirit and its breaking point here it's a lot like the deer hunter and just as good apocalypse however takes the boundaries of what we can endure to a global level <UNK> sweeping footage of the <UNK> murky <UNK> of cambodia and an opening sequence of <UNK> amid exploding <UNK> and an orange sky set to an oddly fitting doors soundtrack as well as chilling scenes on the river and of an air raid on a village with wagner <UNK> from <UNK> a scene which has gone down as one of the most chilling darkly humorous and strikingly pointless war scenes ever this all contributes to the sense of apocalypse the end of the world and not at some distant point in the future but apocalypse now and forever the deer hunter is much more up close and personal you can even tell by the title and shows the effect trauma has on the individual psyche the breaking down of the human soul and its ability to either surrender completely to forces of darkness or to limp on this is why both films are equal they are two parts of the same thing in heart of darkness <UNK> is shown as conflicted between morality civilization and his inner savage in apocalypse now <UNK> has left all conflict behind he is beyond good and evil he has let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand in the moments before his death <UNK> indeed is only waiting for death <UNK> t s <UNK> in his temple to himself lost in the jungle his last words and the words <UNK> at the end of the movie are the horror the horror he is referring to the <UNK> void of existence of the human psyche and to the pitch black <UNK> within his own mind where atrocities are born again it is impossible to express in words the experience one goes through watching this film the experience in short that <UNK> experiences on his journey the end part at the <UNK> almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in the deer hunter is one of the most deeply <UNK> and <UNK> disturbing things i've ever seen
<START> eric <UNK> gives as great a performance as you'll ever see in an oliver stone film his barry character is an assault rifle disguised as a man and he blows away anyone on or off the air that <UNK> him adapted from stage play talk radio is a vicious and frightening ride that doesn't let you off until it's too late by then you've become familiar with the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> wannabe <UNK> and mere prank <UNK> who listen speak and <UNK> in the dark of dallas nights br br stone behaves himself if that's even possible letting <UNK> dominate every scene from <UNK> humble <UNK> to the make or break point when his radio show can reach national <UNK> the rest of the cast are uniformly excellent as the lovers and or co workers that all have being used and tossed aside by barry in common br br the only thing i'd change is the recurring theme music bad to the bone i'd have used <UNK> turner not fragile a better song one i haven't heard in a film so far and a driving relentless tune whose ominous riff is like the true soundtrack to <UNK> life br br listen if you dare
<START> <UNK> <UNK> lance <UNK> brings a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter <UNK> what they don't know is that she was killed by a sasquatch and it's still out there waiting for them br br it was a late night when i this into my dvd player i seriously wish i could go back in time and stop me most people will tell you that films like house of the dead or s i c k serial clown killers will be the movies you wish you've never seen wrong this will be br br i've seen a lot of crap but this is the only crap that's haunted me how i wish i never watched this the acting actually isn't so bad it's just the writing and the directing and the pacing and everything i am actually a fan of sasquatch films but not this one br br please listen to my warning don't watch this
<START> i wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script who then he travels to hollywood to get even but hey it's still a fun film frankie of <UNK> in the middle fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and amanda <UNK> as his friend is also very good <UNK> the film does work as an <UNK> for universal studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film but i enjoyed it anyways grade b
<START> i will not vote this movie as an awful one mainly because i kind of like it i was one of those summer days that i was so lame to do anything and decided do rent a movie in the stupid section of the <UNK> besides that i didn't slept in the <UNK> before and the movie got me awake let's just start the <UNK> ok the movie <UNK> a strange plot first is isolation there is an expedition they get isolated in an island because there is no gas on the boat something like that there is not a single convincing performance on the actors part so far the main problem starts after the isolation idea the <UNK> of a snake then another then another then snakes that change then false <UNK> a lot of them and when we believe the movie is going on a good way for a b flick keeping the suspense it fails because after ten or eleven <UNK> we don't get carried away the one scene that all is the scene when we witness a drunk lesbian show watched by snakes that seem to dance after this it's becoming not a horror adventure but a comedy driven movie the adventure part is <UNK> also br br for me the problem in a movie is the third act it is the one section that just drives the movie for a already guessed conclusion or if it succeeds we don't noticed it like a ninja smoke in our eyes well snake island <UNK> a bad conclusion it all comes to a the ending with a confront <UNK> and escape sequence it was predictable in the moment i rented the <UNK> copy the other real problem is concept concept is very important it is the reason you believe in dinosaurs coming to life or a corpse full of <UNK> that just wants to live the main concept about snakes that want revenge after decades on torture by the human civilization well hmmm just <UNK> <UNK> on the wall one thing you will enjoy if you watch it with an opened mind is the more b z sequences naked lesbian girls some amateur camera angles the <UNK> homage with the grass cutter the black dude <UNK> die first and thats all if you want to see snakes black <UNK> and comedy and you prefer bigger budgets go and see on a br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the characterization in this movie is among the worst i've ever encountered the dialogue is trite and cliché to the point of extreme distraction none of the issues the characters face are developed at all they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point also the depiction of the chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired i find it hard to believe that the chinese father learns flawless english from a book or so it is implied in one scene so he can teach it to his daughter etc br br the smile train is a great organization and it's a nice idea to make a <UNK> <UNK> film about the impact a program like this can have on kids' lives but overall i found this movie to be more frustrating than anything
<START> the <UNK> children was on tv again this weekend and i had forgotten how good it was br br if i have a criticism it is that the episodic structure sometimes shows a little too clearly there being little narrative flow from sequence to sequence the charm and beauty of the film are such that this matters very little however br br i won't <UNK> the comments of others other than to add my vote for the final scene on the platform as being possibly the single most emotional scene in the history of british cinema as a cynical old <UNK> passing through middle age rather too quickly i too find i cannot even think of that moment without being hit with a severe case of i've got something in my eye in fact it's not just something in my eye it moves things around inside me too with that beautiful happy pain we sometimes feel br br and jenny <UNK> was <UNK> beautiful in this film standing with one foot in childhood and one in young <UNK> and bringing qualities of both to her portrayal of a girl having to grow up rather too quickly br br plus a quick for bernard <UNK> regarded mostly as a lightweight actor he <UNK> created a <UNK> of great humanity
<START> the plot in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a y <UNK> <UNK> virus a hot female genetic engineer a man in a lab is intriguing despite the somewhat promising premise the movie falls flat in nearly every regard the dialogue is laughable the characters are paper thin the exploration of a single gender world is shallow the worst part of the entire movie is the asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and contrived that you'll want to vomit br br i can't imagine how on earth this trash got produced most of the movie is male bashing all men are violent all men rape women men are only animals all of the women even the <UNK> seem to display anger toward fear of and hatred for men if you want to see a sci fi film something along the lines of this movie's premise you'd do best to look elsewhere
<START> the dead spots and picture <UNK> <UNK> of out of africa just about buried any interest i might have had to read so when my brother bought me <UNK> feast and knowing it was based on a story i didn't exactly race to the vcr but as the titles rolled it became clear that this was no ordinary movie <UNK> where it's set is not africa the chill <UNK> that <UNK> on the camera shots is not <UNK> the cold <UNK> sea the heavy gray clouds the pale icy green <UNK> translate to <UNK> that show on the faces over which director gabriel <UNK> draws the curtain the is as <UNK> amid the <UNK> merits of this movie the most memorable is that face it stands like a map laying before us the <UNK> wonder of her minister father's like a <UNK> of long overlooked where the complications of her <UNK> and commitment hang like <UNK> br br i gather it's point how the world is drawn inexplicably to christian dedication when <UNK> is rejected by her only serious <UNK> because he fears he'll never measure up to the rules and <UNK> of her small religious <UNK> and he returns to find her mistress of whom he regards as the greatest chef on the continent i figure it's also her point that christ answers the doubts and regrets of those who give up <UNK> success sister <UNK> <UNK> efforts by a visiting <UNK> jean <UNK> <UNK> whose creates an uplifting <UNK> to the of spirit that <UNK> his discovery to turn her into an opera star the title character leaves france and an <UNK> reputation and seeks <UNK> as the servant of two <UNK> sisters to pursue artistic <UNK> for only god and those closest to him to witness but it's <UNK> who weaves the of these people's lives with the <UNK> of voice and <UNK> table and effects a <UNK> you'd never expect from a movie about sacrifice faith and religious conviction br br what sets this movie apart from other religious movies is its sly humor <UNK> feast that is the <UNK> itself a <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> birthday is a beautifully <UNK> clash of sensibilities that delivers comic moments by an ensemble of actors that are <UNK> in their subtlety it's just this <UNK> comedy that <UNK> the <UNK> sentiments at closing together they do something <UNK> movies seldom do they leave a believer hopeful and unexpectedly <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is for me an object of my deepest affection it's got everything a gang of karate fighting prostitutes <UNK> <UNK> his fist through willie <UNK> director martin stomach high <UNK> and 100 <UNK> <UNK> print hats moore's unique comedy <UNK> actually <UNK> are close to the roots of hip hop no wonder dr <UNK> mentioned <UNK> 3 times on his classic album the <UNK> add the best list of characters to ever grace a movie like the horny preacher the <UNK> <UNK> and of course the one who no one knows until it's time credit should be given for style to director martin a <UNK> who doesn't get as much attention as he should around film fan circles i've been looking for a copy of his and fred movies from the early 70s for years and can't find them br br a lot of people are really down on this movie and say it's really bad and it is true that you can see boom <UNK> appearing everywhere look to <UNK> nicholas <UNK> von <UNK> for whom i think this was a very early effort there are a lot of things going for this movie number one there is no other movie like it number two you get to see <UNK> ray moore do a highly <UNK> everyone who hasn't seen moore's outrageous live act will have to use their <UNK> cinematic version of his <UNK> plus him living the life of his comic book character come to life the action scenes are pretty poor but the characters' dialogue when they're talking trash more than makes up for it it's full of strange little details like the fact that the <UNK> <UNK> is wearing a <UNK> t shirt inside out was this intentional or did the guy just pick up whatever shirt was lying on the set and put it on that keep you coming back to watch it again and again br br at least i have br br
<START> warning may contain spoilers br br the <UNK> in the wake of the first jaws movie were still prominent in the 1980s as well as beyond movie monsters went from being <UNK> <UNK> to unknown and <UNK> <UNK> lurking in the <UNK> <UNK> of human experience ie the ocean deep space <UNK> although jaws was a <UNK> in this particular realm of film horror few films have been able to match the visceral impact of the original shark <UNK> aka devil fish or red ocean is a <UNK> <UNK> of the original jaws formula after several hapless <UNK> and are brutally murdered by some ocean creature there is an initial drive to discover the beast then a failure to study it without horrible results and a final push to destroy it although the filmmakers attempted to <UNK> some fresh life into the <UNK> by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy the result is nothing short of disastrous this movie sinks under its own weight of ghastly editing <UNK> acting and cheap scares br br the most <UNK> compelling feature of devil fish is its cookie cutter editing from the <UNK> of the film when 3 different scenes are <UNK> together the viewer gets a sense that the film lacks any technical credibility it appears as if the <UNK> cut the scenes around a set musical score instead of cutting the film and then making necessary changes to the music furthermore every cut is an <UNK> and it would appear as if the <UNK> had never heard of the terms fade wipe or <UNK> the impact of scenes can never settle in because they are immediately cut short after a final line and a new scene begins silly camera tricks abound such as when two of the principle characters share a private moment on the beach and a sort of time <UNK> image of their act is <UNK> over their bodies br br the music is equally bland the creature theme is a hopeless <UNK> of the jaws theme with slight variation although i like to keep my reviews devoid of mst3k influence mike most <UNK> described the somber score as soft core porn music failing to produce tension in a film that relies so heavily on it is a death blow to devil fish the acting is stale the relationships <UNK> and the whole conspiracy is laughable the question remains that if <UNK> had advanced to such a level to create a huge <UNK> of a sea monster to protect <UNK> interests why couldn't a more practical use be <UNK> to better mankind one of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of the monster even though its film presence is less than stellar br br overall this movie is bad enough to <UNK> below mediocre if jaws had never been made then the film could be described as average because its subject matter would be new and exciting even if it was executed <UNK> sadly as a <UNK> copy of spielberg's original thriller it sits most <UNK> on a garbage heap of cheese
<START> what <UNK> me with so called programs such as these is that it is presented as if it were a fact that dinosaurs live of years ago firstly nobody can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions <UNK> of years old it's a shallow theory based on inaccurate dating methods with huge <UNK> thrown into the <UNK> pot br br secondly nobody can prove that evolution ever happened all <UNK> missing <UNK> are still missing if you look at all the <UNK> anywhere in or on the earth they are complete animals of a certain kind <UNK> a dog or a cat nobody has ever found the <UNK> of a dog turning into a cat or in the example presented in this series a dinosaur turning into a bird br br this is utter <UNK> there's more proof that santa claus exists than any animal changing into another kind of animal br br all the ideas presented in this series is an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and the everything in it was created br br this series is not science it is a religious world view that hides under the <UNK> of science science is something we can observe and repeat what you are seeing here is science fiction br br if you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit that it's a science fiction program then rather watch star trek or star wars
<START> i had the unlucky experience of stumbling upon a preview for this movie and thought it might be interesting i am a fan of the two main actors and i even find <UNK> to be oddly appealing but that couldn't compensate for the <UNK> plot of this movie this movie attempts to make social comments and be <UNK> intelligent i am sure the audience gets the <UNK> message clearly but has to suffer in the process personally no matter how bad the movie is i can't stop it in the middle something drives me to finish the worst of movies but i often regret it this is one of those
<START> a mixture of alien and ghost <UNK> br br starts very promising then slows down to almost boring br br <UNK> contains some awesome special effects they were able to make in the mid 80's the story is intriguing but becomes quite lack <UNK> in the end it was rated r because of the <UNK> sex and gore <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and savage naked beauty is very apparent through out the whole movie a bizarre movie and cost a lot by the time it was made br br this could have been a bigger classic with a better script but unfortunately it wasn't a great hit i think it actually <UNK> quite bad br br so something went wrong with this one but still it's very entertaining
<START> teenager <UNK> jenna <UNK> has it rough she's <UNK> by all the popular kids for being shy <UNK> <UNK> and because of her interest in witchcraft all of the football players and <UNK> are especially angry at her for writing an article on <UNK> abuse for the school paper on top of this her <UNK> a drunk her mom's not around and she's secretly in love with her supportive english teacher matthew <UNK> the popular kids set up a cruel prank to <UNK> her accidentally kill her during a struggle bury the body in the woods and make a <UNK> to keep silent to their shock the very next day <UNK> walks back into the <UNK> looking seductive and uh dressed to kill yep back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against everyone involved she also takes time out to make her sexually abusive pop eat a beer bottle and tries to seduce her english teacher away from his wife <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> at the school br br acting and writing are strictly mediocre you can also tell the people responsible for this have seen such movies as carrie 1976 hello mary lou prom night ii 1987 and the craft 1996 because it borrows <UNK> from all three of those superior films there's some gore a guy cutting off his ear and tongue and then stabbing his <UNK> probably being the best bit a nasty <UNK> scene and a few campy witty one liners not an awful film by any means but not much originality went into it either
<START> first off i'll give this movie a low <UNK> 4 out of 10 it was nothing more than a wannabe film i felt very let down watching this film i was lead to people it would be more drama and more facts about the true story it's based on instead i spent over an hour watching middle aged mean break the law and take drugs br br it's like football factory but with no real storyline and not a good ending after watching the film i was left wondering what was that film all about if you like films with no real storyline and a lot of drug taking and swearing then this is the film for you br br i'm a big fan of mob and gangster movies but this film did not live up to the hype i can see where the writer was trying to go with the film but it never reached it's destination one of the worst british films that i have ever watched if only the movie had more of a storyline this would have bad an excellent movie
<START> i saw this film from <UNK> recently at our local film archive it seems that the danish film <UNK> has <UNK> it in 2006 to celebrate the <UNK> <UNK> of which was one of the largest in the world in the early 20th century i believe there are several copies with english <UNK> <UNK> around europe at the moment br br i found the film fascinating and the trip to mars well thought out the plot line is certainly original but i really don't want to reveal any more of it at the moment as now the danger of spoiling things for you really exists br br the film is also available on dvd <UNK> the danish film <UNK> <UNK> web pages at <UNK> with to get more info
<START> my main criticism with the movie is the animation i totally agree with everyone else it was very poor some of the characters seemed to have darker skin tones than they did in the first film which is much better also the background colours looked rushed and somewhat static it is also a shame that michael j fox didn't voice milo he did such a good job and james arnold taylor wasn't sure whether he was supposed to sound like milo or <UNK> i have also taken into consideration the lack of a good storyline the third story was confusing and clumsily told and the second story suffered from poor scripting to make things worse the first one i can't even remember other than a fishing village being haunted or something like that however there was some nice music and good voice talents from john <UNK> <UNK> summer <UNK> brown and tom wilson that saved the film from total disaster all in all a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good film 4 10 <UNK> cox
<START> to sum it up in a nutshell this film was disappointing and could have been <UNK> by twenty minutes br br the acting was sub par the only decent actors of the bunch being the killer and molly the music was slightly lame but fitting and the special effects were much too <UNK> the story <UNK> was poor the unnecessary torture romantic scenes being dragged on for way too long and a disappointing ending br br the start of the film was rather slow the fake looking gore not much of interest arrived at the house and there was some premise for a good storyline br br started to receive the threatening phone calls which <UNK> the suspense this <UNK> suspense the best feature of the movie began to build but then the friends crashed the place <UNK> all potential suspense horror in the film br br the plot then becomes <UNK> from here on chemistry sparks between the two couples and then the killer picks off frank and the other girl this scene was dragged on and unnecessary br br the killer then makes her way for and ties her up there is an overdone torture scene which goes on for at least ten minutes too long as the gore is done badly this is not entertaining at all and it <UNK> more than shocks br br in summary the first thirty minutes of this film sound promising but then poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot ruins this film br br 3 10
<START> writer director john <UNK> takes a little known incident from american history and <UNK> wildly in all the right ways the result is a grand adventure tale that showcases two of its stars in memorable larger than life roles sean connery as the <UNK> arab <UNK> with an inexplicable scottish <UNK> and brian keith as president theodore <UNK> <UNK> for the chance to put that big stick to good use br br aided <UNK> by billy <UNK> glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent score by the always reliable jerry <UNK> this early effort seemed the <UNK> of a talent to rank with <UNK> lucas coppola and spielberg although <UNK> served up <UNK> glimpses of his ability in scripts for johnson and apocalypse now his career seemed to take a <UNK> turn not long after he started directing ultimately <UNK> on dreck like conan the barbarian and red dawn br br here's hoping that he will again find his way
<START> the summary is only for those who hate this movie as finding the movie ok or average is acceptable visiting this movie on imdb has made me nostalgic as i can't help myself going back in the year 1994 i was one of the few lucky ones who saw this movie in theaters it instantly became one of my favourite comedies and took some years to make it my favourite how can i say what made this movie my favourite was it the excellent writing story was ok but screenplay and dialogues were fabulous was it the <UNK> performances was it the mood of the film br br after thinking about it for so many years i say it has to be a mixture it is one of those movies which didn't have any flaws not even its music the other movie coming up in my mind right now is sholay br br ps <UNK> <UNK> please keep a balance between your drama and comedy movies only 1 comedy is not enough i want
<START> wow after the first five minutes of watching this film i was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain and end my life it's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about i honestly don't know what kind of human being would even <UNK> a piece of <UNK> the film looks to have either been shot on video or <UNK> i normally don't have a problem with movies are <UNK> made <UNK> films but this was just so awful and where did they find these actresses i have seen some bad acting but this takes the cake watch the first 5 minutes and you'll see what i mean <UNK> entertainment should be for <UNK> this god awful <UNK> this has to be the worst film i have ever had the <UNK> of viewing i want my <UNK> minutes back if you are able to sit through the first 5 minutes without either shooting your tv or committing mass homicide then give a shot after all what have you got to lose
<START> this movie wasted my time i saw only part of it and i was crying about the wasted time that i could of spent doing something <UNK> and useful towards this earth for everyone that has watched this movie more than once i am <UNK> them for global warming as the the amount of black <UNK> that got entered into the earth from this piece of crap were not needed and if they came from a different movie i would have forgiven them robin williams <UNK> his standards to actually participate for more than 10 seconds in this film and tim robbins how he went from this film to the redemption i have no idea please do not watch this movie for the safety of the earth stop releasing black <UNK> into the earth from a film that they should have never <UNK> or released please burn all copies before anyone else has to watch this crap
<START> snakes on a train starts as mexican couple <UNK> a j castro <UNK> julia <UNK> cross the <UNK> into the us they then <UNK> board a <UNK> hour train to los angeles however family didn't <UNK> of her relationship placed an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her <UNK> into snakes ain't life a b <UNK> as the snakes pour out of mouth <UNK> away to other parts of the train they begin to <UNK> the other passengers with the same unusual <UNK> br br edited directed by the brothers although the imdb claims it's just one guy using a <UNK> peter one has to say that i thought snakes on a train was crap it's as simple as that really it seems the entire film was set up made to cash in on the samuel l jackson cult flick snakes on a plane 2006 by every horror fans least favourite production company the asylum who <UNK> in ripping off big budget hollywood flicks that style of money film making is no more evident than here with snakes on a train making a film just because the title <UNK> with a more successful film is not a good starting point the script by eric is rubbish for a start snakes on a plane was great fun whereas snakes on a train is a lot more serious when you actually break it down look at it this should have been much more light hearted in fact it probably would have worked better as an scary movie 2000 type spoof you know something i am struggling to find one positive thing to say about snakes on a train it's that bad for a start the character's are rubbish it's impossible to <UNK> with anyone the story is downright awful makes no sense if people <UNK> all those small snakes up where did the huge ones come from why did <UNK> turn into the giant snake at the end why did kill the train driver how was he going to stop the train once it reached los angeles where did that <UNK> come from at the end it takes itself far too seriously the first <UNK> odd minutes is so boring <UNK> i am surprised i stayed awake it's just a very very poor film on just about every level br br director only has a few train <UNK> car sets which all look pretty much alike so the film becomes very repetitive dull to watch there's barely any blood or gore there are some snakes <UNK> under a few peoples skin someone gets shot that's about it the special effects are rubbish too the giant cgi snake at the end is truly awful the least said about it the better it's not scary there's zero atmosphere it's a bit of a bore from start to finish the real live snakes are a problem too they are just so <UNK> <UNK> if you look at any scene featuring a real snake an actor the snakes never make any move towards them or act <UNK> in fact always appear to want to <UNK> away in the opposite direction br br shot in california technically the film is obviously low budget it show's basically it looks cheap because it is the acting isn't great not that the actor's are given any sort of material to work with br br snakes on a train is rubbish i am sorry but that's how i feel i don't quite know how else to describe it i really can't see what anyone would get out of watching snakes on a train it really is that bad
<START> i recently had the pleasure of meeting mr <UNK> at the 2005 film festival for the u s <UNK> of this film not only was he <UNK> enough to <UNK> my copy of blade runner he took the time to answer some questions about the film before screening the room for a packed theatre br br i was so impressed by the film that i used it as the <UNK> by which to compare all other films i had seen at the festival it was powerful and moving yet subtle and brief the film tells the story of how a young man older version played by <UNK> one day finds himself <UNK> by a seemingly ordinary room in an <UNK> building near the street walking by he notices a single window always open from which a haunting melody can be heard each day he passes by the room sometimes standing for hours outside watching it through the <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> in the light <UNK> hoping to get a glimpse of its <UNK> towards the end of the film we find out how significant this room really is and what has drawn our protagonist to it br br the film was cut beautifully not a second of screen time was wasted on an uninteresting shot any single frame from the film could stand alone in an art gallery <UNK> is amazing he is mysterious yet <UNK> his dialogue <UNK> a series of <UNK> on a life that has run it's course for better or worse his words <UNK> familiar feelings and thoughts from the audience i was particularly moved by a scene in which he is looking at some old photos remembering his favourite dog his favourite horse and his first love you get the feeling that you are in his presence as he allows you into his world to glimpse precious memories of a life that is <UNK> its end br br i loved this film and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something fresh intelligent and moving should be required viewing for all film <UNK>
<START> bill paxton has taken the true story of the <UNK> us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra ordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early <UNK> century and touches upon the profound anti catholic prejudices of both the british and american <UNK> but at heart the film is about that <UNK> favourite of triumph against the odds br br the acting is <UNK> throughout stephen is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is <UNK> who delivers a <UNK> <UNK> and highly sympathetic performance as a working class franco irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england <UNK> establishment for those who are only familiar with his slap stick performances in even stevens this <UNK> of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh <UNK> as the ten year old <UNK> threatens to steal every scene in which he appears br br a old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final scene an <UNK> nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie
<START> the reason i am reviewing this is that the previous review was written by someone who walked out of this film not even half way through unfortunately for him he missed out on a film of tremendous beauty agreed the film was very slow to start in fact the friend i was with fell asleep briefly i woke him before his <UNK> disturbed the rest of the audience thankfully the film developed from there into a story of love drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the experimental 60s fantastic performances from the two leads and a great look to the film that gave it a real authentic feel be patient like many great films its well worth the wait and is certainly a film that i will look forward to <UNK> 8 10
<START> there are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how i felt about this film so ill keep it short br br the grinch i thought was marvellous jim carrey is a truly talented physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor in my opinion mike myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying i used to like him very much in his <UNK> world and so i married an axe murderer days but <UNK> never been fond of austin powers and the cat in the hat has just finished me off br br this film was horrible the gags were horrible inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they <UNK> amused anyone for 50 years the plot was messy messy messy its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was mom they probably could have picked a better villain than alec baldwin but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for myers ugly revolting over acted portrayal of the cat br br i mean did myers even glance at a script was one written the other actors seemed to have one but the cat just seemed to be <UNK> it br br on the other hand i would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous but unfortunately they cant save this film br br poor dr seuss the man was a genius dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy messy way br br 1 10
<START> this is the 4th movie in the karate kid series however it has nothing to do with the previous 3 the only character remaining is mr this time around mr meets troubled teen julie pierce <UNK> before she was famous julie having all kinds of problem including being <UNK> at school by a guy <UNK> to a pseudo military club on campus naturally she is trained how to fight anyway through julie learns karate and becomes a better person <UNK> and learns how to respect herself and in the end <UNK> her respect i like the unique idea of the antagonist being a female and having a male as her enemy i there are also some fight scenes which are done quite well very low key and minimal violence none of the fighting is graphic the ending is also good and a bit surprising it is predictable but not a typical ending for this kind of film the film has echoes of the original obviously especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned it is not as good as the 1st movie and certainly not as good as the 2nd it is however a giant leap forward compared to the <UNK> 3rd entry this is a very entertaining under dog movie that is suitable for the whole family 8 10
<START> i have just finished watching this movie and for me it takes ages to finish because it is so boring and the storyline is extremely bad br br now where should i start o the movie is called sinking of japan yeah yeah it does show that japan is actually sinking but the action part is very bad compare to the movie the day after tomorrow i would have rate it at least 8 10 br br the sinking of japan does not show much about the disaster that actually happening right in front of our eyes there isn't much excitement at all boring all i can say br br one more point i would recommend this movie to have a better title maybe something like the romance of sinking of japan because this movie does have lots of waste of time talk nonsense the love story is extremely boring have been dragging too long honestly i almost get frustrated br br overall this movie does not show enough details of the disasters e g many people running like hell to avoid death love story part was extremely not touching enough for me br br but hey there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though its has got good songs
<START> the music is by and not by stupid incompetent philip glass and was written ten years before <UNK> unfortunate birth the staging is simply extraordinary the narrative in japanese adds a threatening quality and intensity that the latin version does not have <UNK> version the giant heads and hands are totally justified by the <UNK> aspect of the tale the props and make up used for the plague are simply spot on it's best work the singers are very good especially is quite moving and clean and norman finds the right expression and her beauty is <UNK> here and finds its right place larger than life simply a must
<START> i saw this cartoon accidentally on television one night when i couldn't get to sleep it didn't help in the slightest i found myself staring up at the ceiling trying to forget that face i could quite happily never see this cartoon again simply because of that face br br now don't get me wrong i love fairy tales and <UNK> <UNK> as much as anyone but this twisted and terrifying rendition simply is disturbing it is mainly the cruel laughter and the exaggerated features that <UNK> me and i still have nightmares because of it please i urge you not to allow your children to see this it is far far too scary please i pray you keep it away
<START> a very good episode although not as devastating a finale as the end of season 1 the idea to make it a <UNK> flashback worked very well and henry ian was fantastic perhaps putting in the best performance of this entire series but my only complaint would be the michael plot line felt very much like a subplot and after three minutes the previous episode i thought it would feature more but the strength of character and performance pulled it through the plot developments as always left more questions then answers like who are the others something we still don't know and where are they taking jack <UNK> and kate what was the white light what impact has it had are locke <UNK> and <UNK> dead as the <UNK> <UNK> around them if they are it would be a major mistake because these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and terry <UNK> has been fantastic throughout both series as locke a fitting finale to a better series then the first
<START> i have never read a <UNK> <UNK> novel but i have also seen valley of the dolls based on another of her books on both occasions i thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age certainly contrary to the books the reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion design and behavior <UNK> and in this aspect the love machine offers quite a lot the set design fits the story perfectly and all the characters fit in too they're perfect in the way that they complete a well balanced general picture they are superficial and do not develop it is true but in this movie i wouldn't want it any different br br david <UNK> <UNK> the role he played in <UNK> blow up and it's more than a rip off he's a fashion photographer looks <UNK> aged and seems to start going slightly to seed robert ryan <UNK> the role he played in max caught he is smith all over again greedy bored and boring uninspired and uninspiring it's possible ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted <UNK> on the other hand he might have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance whatever happened it fits the picture <UNK> cannon is great fantastic wardrobe she <UNK> every scene she's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie the burning of a <UNK> bed and the knocking down of the <UNK> character with a academy award <UNK> br br the title the love machine is of course meant ironically robin stone is a kind of a barry <UNK> of the pop era incidentally the movie is slightly that he chooses a tv station to work his way up to the top seems to be a mere coincidence he sees love meaning sexual <UNK> merely as a means for personal <UNK> there are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie homosexuality is treated very casually probably not the standard for mayor movies of the period the open cynicism of the tv executives need not fear comparison with other good movies about the subject like a face in the crowd or network or truman show they are producing crap they agree among themselves it's crap and they know they will make a lot of <UNK> with it br br i did not regret spending the odd <UNK> minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if it picked up a cult following provided it's given the chance meaning a dvd release
<START> <UNK> dahmer was one sick guy there's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said except that the many documentaries and films made about him are probably better than this one it's ridiculously cheesy it's so cheesy a guy who posted the whole film on youtube added some to make the viewer laugh br br carl crew who's he stars as serial killer jeffrey dahmer who's killing spree began in 1978 with a young guy dahmer just wanted to be friends with a finally in 1991 with a man he wished to have sex with and eat br br i didn't bother to watch the whole film through it's basically a documentary that shows all the attacks dahmer pulled off before he got caught and since this film was made in 1993 one year before dahmer was <UNK> to death by a fellow <UNK> the death of dahmer isn't shown but it probably would've been as cheesy as this cheese fest br br 1 10
<START> intelligent summary isn't it br br if mad max was something of a simple straight forward nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film they totally made up for it with it's sequel the road warrior so in theory with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy now it's not br br such a huge disappointment beyond <UNK> was it's main premise is pretty cool with an <UNK> think a mix between metropolis and the time machine but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction add the obnoxious tina turner and the no good story line of the people waiting for a plane and this is just one huge stinker br br maybe they can <UNK> things up again with part 4 although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budget explosion kinda thing because this just isn't right br br 3 10

<START> it's complete nonsense i've studied <UNK> and read many <UNK> from the day the parallels use most of the classic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and then compare it with complete <UNK> about what <UNK> 1 3 of the planet it's crafted for an audience of polly anna <UNK> who <UNK> heavily on <UNK> fed <UNK> horribly thought out arguments irrational conclusions <UNK> ideas and nonsensical logic br br who made this hit peace easy br br when all is said and done <UNK> <UNK> that is who benefits in the long run br br you don't you sacrifice money and rights muslims don't they get our bombs try again answer this and you've <UNK> a major door
<START> i'm surprised that the comparison hasn't been made yet between mind of <UNK> and the television program the awful truth which ran a few years ago <UNK> by controversial director michael moore the show would begin in the exact same <UNK> as this show with moore <UNK> with the audience and introducing segments namely short documentaries and skits which had been put together in an attempt to <UNK> thoughts about current issues the difference <UNK> rarely <UNK> past the superficial and the <UNK> what he says and does is often <UNK> and rude and insults the ability of his audience to make decisions for themselves there's a difference between being edgy which i have no problem with but <UNK> tries too hard to accomplish this and ends up coming off as arrogant and with little backing he does however make points occasionally but often in order to get to them one has to sit through some pretty mind numbing attempted shock humor
<START> i gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars br br unless you like wasting your time watching an <UNK> actress in this film it's <UNK> <UNK> behaving like a <UNK> don't bother br br <UNK> <UNK> plays sara novak a young college student who becomes intrigued with a game of <UNK> that leads her down into subway <UNK> underneath the city a dangerous thing for even a well armed man to go in alone br br there are various <UNK> in the film a weirdo <UNK> who is apparently stalking sara a cynical <UNK> who runs some kind of offbeat hole in the wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto a <UNK> dim wit that hangs around the shop and a woman named emily gray who is back in prison br br <UNK> father is a lawyer who is handling emily <UNK> case br br a few years back emily gray attempted to <UNK> a 12 year old boy emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years and for some <UNK> reason they let her out again even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged br br the only explanation emily has ever given for her crime is i never <UNK> br br it's all part of the design br br well my friend don't expect to ever get any better explanation than that because you won't
<START> the long kiss <UNK> is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller and a career breakthrough for <UNK> davis the plot is very familiar to that of the bourne identity but so what the fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the <UNK> is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours br br it's directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches <UNK> davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual good wife role samuel l jackson is good as usual as the supporting player the film's baddie is overly cheesy though and you can tell what's going to happen to him br br it breaks away from the usual run of the mill <UNK> such as <UNK> and on deadly ground and is <UNK> one of the best <UNK> in years good fun and good popcorn entertainment 7 4 10
<START> looking at these reviews and seeing all these high ratings leave me to believe that large amounts of red corn <UNK> will please just about any brain dead idiot this movie is beyond useless all the <UNK> of a slasher film without any substance i am sure i could go in to details about the movie but why bother when you can sum it up obviously everyone wants mandy lane and she apparently wants none of the guys throughout the movie you will see this br br when she stops being friends to the typical boy trapped in friend zone loser he goes <UNK> and when she goes on a road trip to the middle of no where of course he begins to hunt them one by one sounds decent so far right but what made this movie suck beyond belief is when you find out that not only is her loser friend the killer but she is as well the plan was beyond ridiculous lets together kill all our friends and then kill each other they give no reason why they wanted to do this and given mandy <UNK> <UNK> too shoes demeanor it makes you scratch your head even more as to what is actually <UNK> these characters to do anything they are doing it's sad this movie had lots of potential but the director or writer apparently can't relate to the audience in anyway
<START> i saw two hands back in sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all time favourite films it's got action adventure comedy and romance all rolled up into one and a bit of <UNK> thrown in for good measure like much australian film the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging and jordan should <UNK> feel proud of his work br br anyway it was on tv just now on channel 4 in london and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie but indeed any movie had been cut out so if you watch this movie make sure it's the original version
<START> and my reasons for which are simple there are so many great films presented and discussed here most of them by their own directors and stars so many clips of infamous moments in 70's movie history and in fact a number of films i have yet to see that it wouldn't be fair to grade this work by this logic i shouldn't have given <UNK> to other movie documentaries like martin <UNK> personal journey through american movies and my voyage to italy but while those films were on the basis of one man's view of cinema <UNK> through most of the way richard and the late ted a decade under the influence lets the films and the creators speak entirely for themselves br br what makes worth at least one watch for film buffs or just anyone who likes the films of the late 60's 70's in america are the levels that it goes to that in the uncut version three hours not the theatrical version which i have no comment on plenty of ground is covered interviews include the likes of scorsese robert altman sidney lumet julie christie jon voight francis ford coppola paul <UNK> pam <UNK> bruce dern peter bogdanovich roger corman dennis hopper robert <UNK> etc and there's a constant flow of insight from start to finish the way the clips and directors actors pop up edited together in a flashy and quick style is also fascinating br br the one down comment i have on the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported on in various books like easy riders raging <UNK> and though i haven't seen the movie version of that book yet i'm sure it would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents as here in fact the book of that is one of the best i've ever read however this documentary serves as something special for film buffs and occasional movie goers of the future they can look at this and learn not only about such well known pictures as easy rider the last picture show annie hall coming home and <UNK> <UNK> like scarecrow panic in <UNK> park the <UNK> joe they shoot horses don't they they can also learn about who influenced them new waves of europe and asia who they served as influences for and how the subject matter that created controversy after controversy still serves as intriguing and <UNK> material for the contemporary crowd seek this out
<START> is truly one of those shows that just has it all great acting great cast great writing sets chemistry muppets it's got it all and then some except a home this fantastic series it's seem has it all except and ending seem to think this is a series that is <UNK> single set shows when anyone who watches know this is an ongoing one epic love story that has an end that must been seen if you have never watched <UNK> do a favor and check it out on dvd when the season 1 will be released in october and season 2 is the best there is watch the reruns on the scifi channel to catch up and then the new season starts in january through march when most shows are going in to and be sure to watch if all goes well we will get our ending
<START> when hulk hit theaters in 2003 it wasn't long before dvds of the old incredible hulk tv show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the <UNK> we saw a similar <UNK> a year prior when spider man cartoons appeared on dvd to <UNK> with that hero's big screen debut companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial <UNK> of a hot brand br br so the fact that this picture never <UNK> on the shelves of wal mart as its featured heroes <UNK> the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot i guess everyone involved would just rather forget to be fair the fantastic four is not as bad as everyone says let me <UNK> that it's not as <UNK> as all of its negative reviews might suggest br br veteran television actor alex hyde white no you don't remember any of his roles leads the way as reed richards the brilliant scientist who along with his crew <UNK> bizarre powers after an outer space <UNK> he's left with the ability to stretch and <UNK> his body to outrageous <UNK> his future wife sue storm rebecca can suddenly turn invisible while her brother johnny jay <UNK> may now <UNK> himself at will then there's poor ben <UNK> michael <UNK> smith the lovable <UNK> whose body <UNK> into a mass of <UNK> orange rock br br just as the friends are becoming <UNK> to all of this they are called upon to rescue the world from certain chaos it seems <UNK> old colleague victor von doom joseph <UNK> is living up to his name and that villainous ian trigger isn't exactly helping old ladies cross the street either can our heroes save the day of course they can like any superhero movie it's just a question of how and when br br what's striking about the fantastic four is how amateurish it is in virtually every aspect the dialog is so lame and tired it sounds like it was written by a junior high drama class the acting is so <UNK> it makes a third rate afternoon soap opera look like shakespeare the special effects are surprisingly good considering the <UNK> budget but there are still some positively embarrassing moments when the human torch fully <UNK> his body for instance the entire movie briefly turns into a cartoon i can just hear that production meeting oh no one will notice they'll be too intrigued by the action i mean really a cartoon at least give me a <UNK> on fire held up by a string prior to that the scene in which the <UNK> come to on earth after their spaceship crashes is pure teens in the backyard fare the crew simply found a field and lit a vaguely spaceship like object on fire that's the only <UNK> of such a major disaster br br of course there wasn't a whole lot to work with in the script there is a fairly coherent story here but it's all so <UNK> when reed and ben decide to go into outer space they simply drop by the house and ask if they'd care to join them is it really that easy don't these sort of things require oh i don't know years of training and expertise not in the world of these writers who seemed to be inspired by the underrated genius on display in full house reruns but as bad as that may be nothing can compare to how painfully clichéd dr doom is he was pulled right out of those awful superhero cartoons from the 1960s right down to the evil laugh and <UNK> his <UNK> fist down on the table to <UNK> his remarks no comic book least of all fantastic four has ever featured a villain so <UNK> one dimensional br br ultimately the fantastic four is saved from being a complete turkey because it's just so damn innocent you can tell the people involved as little talent or experience as they had really tried they didn't know the final result would be so embarrassing they were under the impression that this was their big break that people would flock to the theaters it bears repeating that they had virtually no money to work with and i'm sure half of that was eaten up by the cool thing costume all things considered they did well and for its many flaws the finished product is a fair amount of fun for comic book fans
<START> i hate you you hate me barney stole your <UNK> with a great big bunch and a kick from me to you wont you say you hate me too <UNK> <UNK> batman <UNK> grandma had a gun shot barney and made him pee and now there is no more barney the moron now why the heck would come up with a idiotic show like barney so what i'm saying is barney is a <UNK> from the underground world and the kids on this show are like 12 years old if i were them i wouldn't believe this stupid idiot called barney now producers why do you believe this crap that barney says they are always happy that is stupid they should be sad sometimes am i right bottom line barney is so stupid who watches that ugly creature
<START> the idea for the movie wasn't too bad a horror film shot in a corn <UNK> on halloween the bad part was the shoddy camera work the ten million shots of <UNK> and corn and the hour and a half long walk this guy took in the <UNK> oh i'm sorry the <UNK> i picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn <UNK> near where i live and i thought it was a cool idea for a movie but taking everything into consideration it seems that your average joe could take the same idea and run much further with it bill acting wasn't too bad in fact i would say it was pretty good but the lack of talent from his co stars didn't help his efforts here's to hoping his next movie will be easier to swallow
<START> first off just to say i didn't get the edition i thought i would i chose the italian version over the <UNK> but what actually arrived was a uk release from 1998 claiming to be a special edition i never knew there was a uk dvd release but the promised were not actually on the disc just a couple of duff trailers anyway as to the film itself just as i was recovering from night train murders my second <UNK> <UNK> thriller turns up in the same month this time in an italian uk <UNK> <UNK> are being <UNK> and teacher <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> married but <UNK> one of his students becomes the main suspect <UNK> <UNK> is the detective on the case sorry to say i was less than <UNK> it was watchable but more than equally miss able and aside from the aforementioned gruesome nature of the crime the surprise killing of <UNK> <UNK> which was actually <UNK> by the dvd cover telling me about it <UNK> and a surprise twist that cast the victims in a new light i thought this was very routine put me off the two sequels though with <UNK> <UNK> brooks <UNK> and <UNK> i spit on your grave keaton
<START> i can't say that i embrace this as a romantic comedy as i found little funny about it i did find it endearing entertaining heartwarming and <UNK> sweet and while there were some witty moments i found them more bittersweet than outright comedic br br i liked this one barrymore has grown so much as an actress and it's always wonderful to catch her on the big screen but this <UNK> well to the small screen too in fact on subsequent viewings i like this one more and more br br if you're a fan of the romantic comedy then you may be a bit put off by lack of comedic effect with this one but if you're in it for the romance it's definitely here to be found br br it rates a 7 8 10 from br br the fiend
<START> <UNK> <UNK> to watch this trash and pay for it with hard earned cash <UNK> no hint of laughter god knows how it won a <UNK> br br we've now been subjected to <UNK> for twenty years when oh when is the great british public going to see this awful soap for what it is crass <UNK> this programme no more depicts reality in the east end of london than everyday life in <UNK> and never has done br br the <UNK> i know the real ones are kind courageous <UNK> and loyal and one of their greatest attributes is humour it was the <UNK> who went through the worst of the london <UNK> and still stuck two fingers up to hitler and what do we see on our screens for five days of the week including an <UNK> nothing but a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> dead from the neck up <UNK> who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day <UNK> at each other what a great <UNK> for britain that is do the writers actually believe this garbage they're <UNK> out obviously the <UNK> minded section of the public does but then i've heard that apparently anyone can be <UNK> into believing anything
<START> this is lucio fulci at his best if only all the films he made after were like this br br this extraordinary film is as intriguing as <UNK> the bird with crystal <UNK> br br if <UNK> an <UNK> fan but you <UNK> like lucio fulci films like br br the beyond manhattan baby the house by the cemetery etc this one has nothing to do with the others this is what the italians call giallo that would be something like a who done it movie in a nutshell br br you <UNK> know who the killer is until the last moments of the film br br but apart from that <UNK> the plot some maniac living in a small village starts killing little boys a journalist <UNK> a sexy young woman barbara <UNK> a priest marc <UNK> his mother irene <UNK> and a witch <UNK> <UNK> are the main characters in this <UNK> bloody story br br talking about the actors i want to say that <UNK> is superb like always and <UNK> <UNK> is terrific as the village witch br br do you want to know who is the killer br br i cannot tell you but i can tell you that you must see this film br br 10 out of 10 of course
<START> the filmmakers apparently had enough money to be able to afford decent makeup effects but not enough for a creature that would move around and attack convincingly we never get a chance to see the monster move from one place to another whenever that happens supposedly the camera focuses on the terrified reactions of the humans that are nearby and when a man is attacked by it he simply seems to be holding an <UNK> object against himself so that it won't fall to the ground this is still not the worst alien rip off around the two <UNK> films are even worse for example it's actually <UNK> entertaining if you've got <UNK> minutes to spare 1 2
<START> when my parents rented this movie i was expecting a very funny movie as randy quaid is very funny in comedy movies however this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too you can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only <UNK> one minutes long so i can honestly say it is not a movie that is on my favorites list it may work for some people but it just did not work with me at all proving to be rather slow in the build up with virtually nothing that amused me within the entire movie randy quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very bland actors and actresses the premise of the movie had potential as did the casting of quaid but all of it just <UNK> and the inclusion of the horror element just seems very unnecessary granted the one dream sequence the kid had when he jumped on the bed and it suddenly became a <UNK> of blood was very nicely done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure horror instead of one that lists comedy as its first genre
<START> br br i used to think reeves was the worst actor in hollywood i not so sure anymore willy gives some stiff competition with his i'm made of <UNK> performance in this movie br br combine that with the fact that there is almost no plot and not a single likable character and it's pretty hard to recommend this turkey br br natasha tries her best but even julia roberts couldn't save this flick from obscurity br br avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else on oh heck in that case just read a book
<START> the storyline is a <UNK> off claim <UNK> made a deal with the devil to find gold and is forced to protect it forever a bunch of friends find the gold and gets talked by the old <UNK> and they're forced to blow the gold to <UNK> in order to send him back to hell br br i mean seriously how did this film not win the oscar for movie of the year what a compelling storyline of late 20 year olds running from a claim <UNK> straight out of the <UNK> i love how in other movies you can't kill the monster but they can knock it out this movie they write the monster as completely <UNK> br br the opening of the movie clearly rips off nightmare on elm street part 4 but what the hell not like that movie was a 5 star classic either br br highlight of the movie is when we're introduced to a girl who's never been to school never been out of the town never learned to read or write yet speaks perfect english is smoking hot and wears the latest fashion how did the <UNK> miss that br br ok i'm done with the bad jokes this movie is pure crap and only watch it if u have nothing better to do and all the <UNK> on the spice rack are in order already br br 2 out of 10
<START> i got this in the horror six pack from echo bridge home entertainment this one is not the worst movie ever made but it still sucks in fact this movie sucked so hard i don't know how i'm gonna write this review especially since 1 i popped it out of the dvd player because i couldn't even watch another second and 2 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is coming and god knows how long <UNK> it take for me to get this review done br br the movie starts off with a scientist and his wife the scientist receives a valuable <UNK> and <UNK> it when this supposedly urban legend known as the <UNK> man kills him and later on his wife then br br i'm sorry but there's really not much else i can say about this <UNK> except don't bother i'm currently using the disc as a coaster and if you see this you might want to do the same casper van <UNK> and michael <UNK> must have needed cash badly br br ps i'll pretty much be reviewing the movies in the <UNK> and might do a new review on <UNK> iv
<START> i can't believe i bought this movie on dvd i don't even remember it being shown on tv last year why in the world couldn't they have just done a real sequel to one of the best christmas movies ever made damn and randy quaid looks like he's been on the same drugs as jerry lewis i didn't know about this movie until i bought it tonight and thought i would check it out on imdb and see how it was rated boy did i make a mistake if your reading this review be warned stay away from it and just stick to the first christmas vacation well at least i didn't pay more then 10 bucks for it maybe i can trade it in and get half of that back at tower records then again maybe not ps i still haven't watched it yet my dvd player went on the fritz tonight watching another wonderful movie the chronicles of <UNK> <UNK> director's cut woo freaking <UNK>
<START> first of all despite the low rating on this site i saw something quite worthy in this film and will gladly defend it and no i'm not connected to the crew in any way br br i came across the dvd of the wind by accident and had this strong feeling that it wasn't going to be quite like the video <UNK> described so i took a chance and was pleasantly surprised by this strange very different drama i'm assuming the dvd marketing and summary were the work of home video to hook a rental or sale the tag line love comes in many forms was changed to terror comes in many forms sure smaller <UNK> <UNK> and sales depend strongly on grabbing a person's attention especially if they've never heard of the film before a similar case happened with the film the item that's probably what is working against this release as horror fans read the description of an ancient wind carrying with it <UNK> of the apocalypse it's easy to think that that is what this film is all about and will turn some college students in the story into crazy <UNK> that go on a killing spree thus at the time this review was <UNK> is most likely the reason for the lower rating on imdb i can understand people becoming upset and thinking they were fooled by that summary seeing the apocalyptic intro but then experiencing a dark drama i can forgive the marketing choice since i enjoyed the wind and thought it was a refreshing change of pace from major hollywood offerings it's just that if the intended audience was given the attention more might voice a higher rating br br the wind in this film is basically just a metaphor for society and is the story of four friends who make some bad choices and how their lives quickly turn into ones of desperate self <UNK> after going too far in a to one of their own a death occurs and each person tries to save his her own standing manipulation between them becomes the norm and by the end we see how self <UNK> becomes their main motivation over good judgment <UNK> to savage basically this is very apparent throughout by <UNK> that the use of a knife <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> and kicking are <UNK> of violence instead of guns these characters are in a way doing all the wrong things for the right reason just to stay on top of the situation since they've already taken things too far while there are many implied violent images it's interesting to see that there is an absence of <UNK> and nudity br br what works in favor of the wind are the unknown actors bigger stars were originally intended but i find it works better when you have lesser known capable actors this way you can get into the story without sometimes thinking oh that's tom cruise for instance instead of an actual tormented person dealing with an extraordinary situation even unusual conversations like between <UNK> and billy in a field and <UNK> confronting claire in her bedroom hold up well and feel quite natural in the strange universe of <UNK> which has <UNK> homes a forest and wide open fields i kept thinking of the calm landscapes <UNK> darker secrets in the <UNK> skin which director michael mentions as an inspiration in his commentary br br the wind manages to get messages across without being heavy handed about it br br sure if you look carefully you'll see many symbols and dialogue that other directors would just pound you over the head with i even understood the infamous kissing scene between claire john and billy within the context of the story without being surprised it happened i am still amazed at how some people guys mainly who complain about two men kissing in a scene would obviously have no problem if the scene were of two <UNK> kissing instead all is handled nicely here and additional viewings will make things more clear without making you <UNK> and say oh man how did i miss that things sink in gradually and i appreciated that or you could listen to the dvd commentary as well for more things revealed br br for those of us that got the intentions of this film the wind is a breath of fresh air no pun intended in a time when most films are made in order to just make money and be heard knocking other films out of their box office competition standing when mentioned on entertainment tonight or <UNK> br br years later it's always the great little <UNK> like the wind that stay in my mind not <UNK> star driven blockbusters br br get past the marketing <UNK> from home video and you just might find this an engaging story indeed i strongly recommend it to friends that seek out unusual films like this one
<START> this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters <UNK> this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and <UNK> whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but i feel that <UNK> two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama certainly one not to be missed
<START> in the of 1942 two soviet soldiers are captured by nazi friendly in <UNK> the attitude of the two men toward their fate <UNK> greatly one of the soldiers manages to find an inner strength and <UNK> incomprehensible to the other man last film is one of the most beautiful war films in cinema history the cinematography by <UNK> is incredible particularly in the opening sequence where long slow tracking shots depicting the <UNK> and almost desperate nature of winter landscape in rural set the mood perfectly it is easy to draw comparison to <UNK> films even more so since <UNK> alter ego has a small but important part in the <UNK> the acting is overall brilliant especially by boris in the part of the film reveals an old fashioned belief in the strength of religious passion which feels related to characters such as <UNK> prince or <UNK> stalker however this is not a weakness of the film but rather one of its greatest strengths the religious content seems so honest and human that it is impossible not to be moved the emotional <UNK> of the film cannot be <UNK> the answer is not as <UNK> as a short summary of the plot would make you think the slow development of the characters and the emphasis on their complicated relationships to each other are somewhat reminiscent of the <UNK> another great soviet film the <UNK> deserves a second watching as well as a third and a <UNK> it continues to provide interesting ideas beautiful images and emotional complexity
<START> this is a great movie to look at since it so nicely directed by but at the same time i wished the movie would had some more depth in it in terms of its story it's an historically relevant movie about the last days of the french revolution but yet the movie forgets to focus on the character's motivations making the movie perhaps a tad bit too shallow to consider this a brilliant and relevant movie to what br br somehow it doesn't make the movie any less great to watch though it's made with passion and eye for detail every aspect about the movie is good looking such as its settings costumes and camera work br br also the story still works out as powerful though at the same time it could had been so much better and more powerful with a just bit more character development and insight historical information guess if you're completely familiar with the french revolution and the stories of and <UNK> in particular this movie will be a perfect one for you to watch br br it's somewhat typical for a french movie to tell a story slowly and subtle without ever stepping too much in detail often this works out <UNK> but in this case the movie could had really done with a bit more depth other than that this movie is still one fine example of french cinema despite the fact that it's being directed by a polish director and stars lots of polish actors in it as well br br <UNK> depardieu is great in his role though the movie also decides to concentrate a lot on many other different characters the movie perhaps has a bit too many characters but each and every performance is a great one so this doesn't really ever become a big complaint other than that it slows done the story a bit at certain points br br a great movie that could had been brilliant br br 8 10
<START> the <UNK> the snowman offers some of the best acting from its two leads <UNK> in a brilliantly understated role <UNK> portrays the confusion and angst of a man who seemingly turns <UNK> for no other reason than as rebellion against his father penn as the co <UNK> basically just along for the ride and drug money <UNK> turns in one of the strongest performances of his multi talented career
<START> the silver screen gets <UNK> polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life's <UNK> there's plenty of silver hair on this silver screen but the film's <UNK> is more like 85 going on 25 with his energy humor and lust for life the story of entertainer <UNK> uncle frank his devoted wife aunt and the <UNK> residents of the local area <UNK> homes <UNK> us to live each day as if it's your last and brings a <UNK> of hope to those often <UNK> golden years a great movie for young and old audiences
<START> if you've not seen this then look out for it it is available on dvd it is a channel 4 uk production possibly in <UNK> with german and danish tv if you've seen the film it is basically the same plot several stories are connected through the drugs trade the story jumps between the housewife played by the excellent <UNK> <UNK> trying to complete a deal on behalf of her husband who to her surprise is an international drugs dealer and generally dangerous man br br a minister who is <UNK> in his job to the <UNK> of his family is investigating the whole state of affairs with international drugs <UNK> he gets a few eye <UNK> to the reality of heroin when his daughter turns out to have a he then visit <UNK> officially where he seems to be taught that the abuse not simply the drug or its casual use is the problem and also gets to <UNK> some produce an excellent scene where he simultaneously realises what the attraction is and why it is and why it is such a problem in <UNK> we get to see the other side the desperation of <UNK> who can barely survive turning to <UNK> production and crime <UNK> the pointless attempts at <UNK> resulting in the system getting rich and a country so <UNK> in drugs yet only a relative <UNK> of the abuse we have in the west around all this a customs official <UNK> agent tries to catch the connection in heroin <UNK> seeking justice for his murdered partner this really is a masterpiece super understated performances from all the main actors in a way only european cinema can really do br br a must see especially if you have seen the film they compliment each other present some subtly different opinions attitudes from both sides of the pond
<START> i couldn't wait for the end this is absolutely the worst film i have ever seen if you thought that just about anyone could make a watchable movie these folks prove that there is a minimum skill set required this is a film with no redeeming features whatsoever it scores a zero in every department this is more than just <UNK> as the audience is given no consideration or regard at all there is no serious attempt to act or entertain the storyline is <UNK> pointless and senseless the cast look very uncomfortable and completely lack direction the technical aspects of the film are poor br br as a dvd it makes a good drinks coaster
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is an entertaining and engaging film that falls short of delivering the <UNK> that should be connected with the films subject matter the idea of <UNK> ignorance in the medical science world is one that pushes the viewer towards <UNK> and the realism of the <UNK> and the special effects make it a not entirely easy film to watch br br however the characters the script and the <UNK> of the film all seem too familiar with the scream movies that this sort of genre sadly then whilst the subject is one to care about the viewer is presented with another movie full of college student characters that we don't really get a chance to care about <UNK> subplots and hammy stage killings that have been <UNK> themselves since the memorable drew barrymore opening scene in scream several years back br br steven makes a fair effort of the script and the direction but pushes no boundaries other than the general theme whilst we are presented with an entertaining film with some reasonable performances we are unfortunately left with the old feeling nothing is wrong with this film but nothing is extraordinary either br br an entertaining film and an interesting chance to see how foreign filmmakers have been influenced by the post scream <UNK> culture 6 out of 10
<START> if you're into alternate realities <UNK> what's real and what's just a fantasy this is an edge of your seat thriller that'll keep you guessing and really make you think try to get a copy of it and see for yourself i watched it at an l a film festival recently and it was by far the best one in the group that i saw it helped that it was actually about something unlike the others that were screened it's very well directed and the production value is top notch i would compare it to <UNK> ladder in that it keeps you guessing as to what the true reality is of the world that we're in you should definitely try to hunt this film down and if it's screening at any festivals near you try to check it out
<START> yeah a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction now it's a prison again kind of well it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange so i guess in that way it's like a prison not really though when <UNK> steven <UNK> character is being admitted into prison he's standing <UNK> in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend like he's in line for the security check at the airport then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches <UNK> around a couple of security guards br br let me tell you something you assault a <UNK> officer in a federal prison they'll shoot you on the spot <UNK> rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch oh and there are guys wearing <UNK> and and <UNK> in prison federal prison br br you can't dress like that at most high schools in america br br speaking of <UNK> rule i have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth including <UNK> rule himself had to have been 50 <UNK> just before i watched this movie i saw one of those shows on tv about the greatest celebrity <UNK> ever and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 <UNK> who had lived the thug life for real and <UNK> rule who had not every time i saw <UNK> rule on screen the only thing i could picture was 50 <UNK> laughing his ass off <UNK> rule looks like a <UNK> 9 year old every time he appears on screen br br anyway getting back to the plot it's funny <UNK> is an fbi agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization he's sentenced to five years and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly <UNK> nothing else in the movie matters after that it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences most of which aren't even well choreographed br br oh how about this a helicopter crashes through the roof of new <UNK> at one point accidentally <UNK> all of the inmates and what do they do they all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block without so much as a basket they had a ball but it doesn't matter the scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing br br so some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in state of the art execution chamber evidently not for stealing 200 million dollars in gold but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught br br hey good thinking people if you can't get information out of someone kill them that's a great way to learn the truth so some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the 200 million for themselves br br oh and the 200 million is in gold <UNK> i doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into <UNK> br br there's also the issue of the warden at the prison he's some tough talking <UNK> who thinks he's a hardcore from the <UNK> which reminds me of a joke i saw this comedian once talking about people in california who talk all tough calling each other <UNK> and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense these people go to mexico the comedian says and they're like oh my god people live there that's like a total shack br br the best is when the united states supreme court justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside his prison i don't care if she is a united states supreme court justice br br this woman could him like a <UNK> and he thinks he's in charge ha br br and by the way the supreme court justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is <UNK> that's a year younger than steven seagal i just thought that was funny br br the only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where <UNK> rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of <UNK> balls by this little asian woman that was the funniest thing i've seen in a movie in a long long time br br you know i work for the company that produced this film which i why i watched it and i still don't have a single positive thing to say about it except of course for that one scene with <UNK> rule getting <UNK> by that asian woman br br so read my review of and you will see how strongly i sometimes disagree with professional film critics like roger ebert but in his review of this movie ebert wrote something that i agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written br br i imagine the at the mpaa <UNK> each other on a good day's work as they rated <UNK> past <UNK> pg 13 after giving the anti gun movie for an r br br way to go guys
<START> some ugly weirdo who had three families cheated on and neglected all of them built ugly useless buildings all over which are now <UNK> and <UNK> his bastard half jew son runs around <UNK> random jewish <UNK> people who we care nothing about and shows his dreadful <UNK> and writing skills while tragic piano music plays this goes on for almost two boring hours and amounts to nothing br br all you shallow hippie people who watch these stupid documentaries eating and <UNK> think all this crap is so important it's not save the <UNK> no one cares
<START> i loved this movie it is a very simple plot and from what i understand it is based on a true story growing up in the 80's with hard rock hair metal may have something to do with my love of this film but even aside from the music it is a really fun movie to watch give it a try you will like it unless you are the hardest of critics and only like movies of citizen kane caliber
<START> this is a true feel good movie full of genuine <UNK> and admirable people although the premise requires a significant suspension of disbelief it is worth the trouble to do so the director writers and actors truly convey what it feels like to be in love
<START> this movie was a waste of the celluloid it was <UNK> on it is a disastrous scene much like a particularly gruesome train wreck br br watching this is like trying to explain the meaning of life the main plot point is that the character played by steve <UNK> is a party animal who's not supposed to <UNK> because that would <UNK> his <UNK> the kids he befriends refuse to play with him as coach for a while because he <UNK> but a few minutes later after they've won the championship a large sum of money saves their shelter and where did they get the money gambling add this to the creepy scenes at the funeral home why exactly are there <UNK> in a funeral home and the useless <UNK> character
<START> i caught this little gem totally by accident back in 1980 or i was at a revival theatre to see two old silly sci fi movies the theatre was packed full and with no warning they showed a bunch of sci fi short spoofs to get us in the mood most were somewhat amusing but this came on and within seconds the audience was in <UNK> the biggest laugh came when they showed princess having huge <UNK> <UNK> instead of hair on her head she looks at the camera gives a grim smile and <UNK> that made it even funnier you gotta see played by what looks like a muppet it was extremely silly and stupid but i couldn't stop laughing most of the dialogue was drowned out because of all the laughter also if you know star wars pretty well it's even funnier they deliberately poke fun at some of the dialogue this really works with an audience a definite 10
<START> that distinction has to go to the <UNK> of <UNK> at least ed <UNK> misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious star power of bela <UNK> <UNK> johnson and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> has no redeeming qualities whatsoever what could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a <UNK> aristocrat on a <UNK> colony perhaps in the style of the island of dr <UNK> or mysterious island is <UNK> by the heavy dialog and <UNK> <UNK> acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead <UNK> into a sea of stupidity the special effects which took place in someone's <UNK> further doom this film to the dung heap even the treatment of <UNK> is something out of a victorian interpretation of the bible the fact that <UNK> can not be <UNK> from an individual in its last stages <UNK> the plot line that the aristocrat fallon and his lady <UNK> contract the disease and end up as the original <UNK> of the castle de <UNK> doomed to insanity and <UNK> cruelty it is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film no wonder talent <UNK> talent lack of talent <UNK> oblivion which is where this film should find its <UNK> end
<START> i watched this because of the description and cover art and yet again was <UNK> i am getting sick of all these new stupid straight to dvd horror movies once in a blue moon 1 will be ok it started out with a confusing scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a couple one night during a <UNK> which was ok because i like <UNK> and it set a nice mood then it turned into a cool road trip where they ended up at a diner <UNK> bizarre people the rest got weird and then got confusing i did watch it <UNK> the end but was even more confused when it ended so badly i had higher hopes for this movie but it was more like a science fiction then horror and something that should have been made for tv
<START> punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema shot in the southern br br california desert using his <UNK> faux documentary style br br creates a film like no other he follows two groups of prisoners one br br pre sentenced the other post sentenced throughout the picture after br br they're tried by a military <UNK> they have the choice of either br br serving out a prison sentence or they can participate in punishment br br park a <UNK> three day <UNK> through the desert with nothing but the br br clothes on their backs whilst being hunted down by local law br br <UNK> officers who use the park as a live action training br br ground i can't say enough about this movie sometimes it feels as if br br you're watching a real documentary this is one of peter most br br accessible films i advise you to look out for it you wont regret it br br highly recommended br br a br br
<START> an object lesson in how to make a bad movie which <UNK> as horror without going in too close i would imagine this is the results of a bunch of film school students all adding bits to the story and then actually acting in it its like a film <UNK> of some kind and its a film badly in need of an editor in which case it would have lasted 10 minutes the director of this garbage probably had more money than sense consider the number of <UNK> scripts or even <UNK> films which would have <UNK> from this the so called <UNK> who was killing people in some pretty stupid ways looked like christopher lloyd in back to the future or maybe the musicians johnny winter edgar winter it starts off with 20 minutes of crass boring nonsense <UNK> out by the students something about paranoia giving this rubbish 1 is because it can't get any less it has not one single redeeming feature and when one of the girls thinks the body on the floor covered in blood is the guy <UNK> about she has to actually taste the red stuff before she knows its not <UNK> <UNK> its an insult to the intelligence of an idiot
<START> for years i've been a big fan of <UNK> work and old boy is one of my all times favorite br br with lots of expectation i rented this movie only to find the worst movie i've watched in awhile it's not a proper horror movie there's no suspense in it and even the light part is so lame that i didn't know whether to laugh or cry br br i introduced my younger brother to chan <UNK> park and what a disappointment he got from this for me an idol has fallen br br if you loved movies like old boy the mr lady vengeance or even his short films on three extremes don't waste your time the film's not worth it
<START> i knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going but when i saw the beginning credits i said oh my god bruce walter <UNK> from star trek <UNK> gerard from buck rogers and he's almost <UNK> then i saw john callahan who used to star on my favorite soap all my <UNK> put on a few pounds but he can still act then there was <UNK> <UNK> too bad i didn't sick around to see her in the film i <UNK> out 20 minutes into he film it was that bad never did see william <UNK> from perry mason and the american hero br br all these stars and one lousy film i hope hey got their paycheck br br bad bad bad
<START> not having seen the 1936 version of this story i cannot offer any comparison there i can however state that stephen <UNK> musical treatment of this story is absolutely genius only <UNK> could come up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right yet perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject matter if anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is they should see this and dr <UNK> as well when mrs <UNK> goes from having the worst <UNK> in london to a <UNK> business with high acclaim we aren't talking soylent green but the ingredients are similar particularly brilliant is the song where mrs <UNK> <UNK> her idea to mr todd even in the <UNK> number the line they went to their maker <UNK> <UNK> gives a great indication of the premise the drama and the comedy to come outstanding
<START> first let me make it clear that i'm a big fan of bad sci fi especially when it involves gigantic city <UNK> monsters but this one is so fantastically lame that i can't even like it for being bad they apparently didn't <UNK> enough money off the budget by <UNK> on the props the only prop we have to indicate the size of the alien girl is an <UNK> novelty <UNK> available at <UNK> gifts for about fifteen bucks they also decided not to <UNK> for concept or plot the monster does look okay in my opinion but it doesn't have enough interaction with the backgrounds i e not enough destruction to suit most fans of the genre the general rule of giant monster movies is if you don't have a lot of fake looking buildings to smash then you'd better have another fake looking monster to <UNK> with this movie has neither i can't make my final complaint about the movie without giving away the ending but suffice to say the origin of the monster and the method found to get rid of it just don't hold water not even as well as most of these movies skip it
<START> i consider this a breathtaking but <UNK> film because it seems so simple and straightforward a vietnam survivor tells his harrowing tale and some of the story is on location reviewers sometimes even claim that <UNK> presence in the film is minimal but how wrong they are we know that all documentaries are to some extent and this one has <UNK> subtle hand all over it most notably in the stunning music the unbelievably expert selection of <UNK> footage and the management of <UNK> images the <UNK> power of this film is astounding starting with its title the opening title card from the book of revelation and the initial voice over this is a movie that one can watch repeatedly with increasing wonder not a simple <UNK> that is <UNK> down with one's favorite <UNK> on the way to the evening news this is one of those movies that can <UNK> with you for a lifetime
<START> don't torture a <UNK> is one of <UNK> earlier and honestly in terms of story line better films and although not the typical bloodbath that fulci is known for this is still a very unique and enjoyable film br br the story <UNK> a small town where a series of child murders are occurring some of the colorful characters involved in the <UNK> either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both include the towns police force a small time reporter a beautiful and rich ex drug addict a young priest and his mother an old man who practices witchcraft and his female <UNK> a mentally handicapped and a deaf mute little girl all of these people are <UNK> into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed br br don't torture a <UNK> is neither a classical giallo or a typical fulci gore film although it does contain elements of both it is more of an old fashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of <UNK> later works this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end recommended for giallo murder mystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of <UNK> non splatter films but don't despair don't torture still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of <UNK> but if that type of material doesn't bother you then definitely give this one a look 8 5 10
<START> the old man mouse in this cartoon would have you believe that all men are created equally evil so if we have to kill men in order to stop hitler we are just as bad as hitler was killing the jews well i don't buy it mr mouse but i guess it paints a pretty picture and makes a cute cartoon but it wasn't the reality then and it ain't reality now
<START> the story is disjointed and poorly written we are given threads and a possible hook in act one only to see it <UNK> had the writer bothered reading his work carefully it <UNK> have been apparent that character's initial problem and meeting with the <UNK> girl suggests that there will be a troubled alliance between them as they try to solve his problem br br the problem goes nowhere the relationship goes nowhere and there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships no one <UNK> anyone and no one is appealing the writing and directing is laughable you can feel someone struggling with the mess and shifting the story focus about trying to <UNK> some excitement there is none the writer director is simply a <UNK> whose muddled efforts somehow became a movie from simple errors such as ' they took ' in japan in 2007 to insulting errors such as nudity for <UNK> this movie is an insult you cannot make them much worse br br and by on the talent list the producers thought they'd have some success he is hardly acting asia certainly is and the result is some heroin <UNK> <UNK> br br give it a big miss
<START> primary plot primary direction poor interpretation
<START> every role down to the smallest has been cast and acted with <UNK> br br the extraordinary <UNK> malone never takes a <UNK> her two co stars are equal to her in this film ryan <UNK> may be the best actor of his generation chris <UNK> gives his best performance to date this is a thought and conversation provoking film that should be seen by teens and young adults you'll think and talk about this film for days highly recommended
<START> <UNK> is one of those low budget but well taken movies it's a cup of coffee entertainment with no violence blood or jump out of your seat excitement which most <UNK> films have however it does have some of it's own is a <UNK> and down to earth young woman who is not afraid to confront any sort of situation even her offensive mother in <UNK> <UNK> for her she even backs out of the wedding because her fiancé doesn't stand up for her however her air of confidence and independence is enough to make <UNK> a rich young gentleman living in the city <UNK> to be her new husband his father accidentally kills her parents in a car crash anyways so why not pay her back but is not the kind who will fall for charming smiles and polite behavior she puts him through a bunch of situations continuing to be rude and a pain it's not until he stands up for her and saves her life that she understands she loves him too but complications
<START> if you really loved <UNK> you will find quite disappointing the story those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south will be probably satisfied with this decent tv production i consider an important miscast the choice for scarlett but let me say that considering the novel nothing good could came out of this br br i've read <UNK> more than 20 times and i can really appreciate the adaptation mrs mitchell did for the film it took me some time to understand how good the ending was scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover <UNK> since she always got what she wanted but there was no kiss in the end br br then alexandra <UNK> came to fix this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty scarlett could be and of course describing in detail how exactly she gets <UNK> back even when she had an important affair with someone else nothing could have been further from mrs mitchell mind i am sure br br the story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending br br if margaret mitchell could came to live again she would die one more time at the very moment she'd find out what scarlett became after <UNK> br br sure it's not fair to compare this to the original but this is not <UNK> fault isn't it is it any good if i don't compare it to the original maybe sorry to say i don't really care br br i would expect little more compromise to continue someone else's <UNK> work otherwise don't even try
<START> i saw this film at the 2004 toronto international film festival since i work in the wine business i had been quite eager to see this documentary and i wasn't disappointed reportedly drawn from over 500 hours of footage the good news is that will be releasing not only a theatrical cut but a ten part ten hour series of the film on dvd by next christmas <UNK> is <UNK> it the bad news is that it's still a bit of an <UNK> beast when it was shown in cannes it was close to three hours long for toronto he's cut about half an hour but it still <UNK> in at <UNK> minutes now for me that's fine i love wine and i love hearing about the <UNK> raging in my business but not everyone wants that much br br around the globe from brazil to france to california to italy to <UNK> talking to wine makers and <UNK> people and <UNK> and critics about the state of the wine world the theme that emerges is that <UNK> and the <UNK> influence of wine critic robert parker are forcing a kind of on wine small local producers are either being bought up by larger american as well as local or are being <UNK> by market forces to change their to suit the <UNK> of mr parker who <UNK> taste to most of the american and world <UNK> br br it's a complicated subject and i can understand why wants to let his subjects talk there is robert <UNK> of the <UNK> wine industry and his sons tim and michael whose efforts to buy land in faced opposition from local and government officials there is <UNK> and wine maker of <UNK> <UNK> of plans and <UNK> for that express local terror there is robert parker himself expressing some <UNK> with his influence while <UNK> to stop writing about the that he <UNK> there is flying wine maker michel <UNK> for dozens of all over the world <UNK> them how to make parker friendly there are many many more fascinating personalities in this documentary br br if you are a wine lover you will want to seek out the ten part series as well as the theatrical version of this film but even if you're not into wine the film is an interesting look at how the forces of <UNK> are changing many of the world's oldest and most established traditions the effects on local cultures and <UNK> cannot be ignored br br 8 10
<START> honestly the only reason i picked up this movie from blockbuster was because aaron carter was in it okay first <UNK> first do you notice how ugly aaron carter has become i mean he used to be so cute but now with that <UNK> body and skin <UNK> i think he should stick with singing and the directors of the movie could've found a much better looking guy who could lip sync no offense though i thought this teen movie was <UNK> lame and this is coming from me being a teen myself the girls' in there are oh so predictable the acting is so amateurish it makes you cringe at times especially from aaron and overall i just didn't enjoy it although i give out points for the storyline that was alright but not at all realistic anyway stay away from this movie by all means you can unless you happen to have <UNK> of cash on hand and have absolutely nothing better to do with <UNK> minutes of your time it's not worth the 6 50 br br p s this review of mine may not be <UNK> to younger kids under the age of 13
<START> i wasn't impressed with the <UNK> artist despite it's artsy aka low budget <UNK> appeal there is little dialog and at least for me i was disappointed that it didn't give more credit or promote the work of <UNK> artists such as these instead it was a story that covers familiar territory two guys who basically do little more than tag buildings become friends <UNK> partners and eventually experiment with a relationship they seem like <UNK> rather uncomfortable together little is explained about their backgrounds and the things between the two young men happen at rapid speed although this i can understand because it's only 70 minutes or so there's been countless numbers of similar plots and productions in recent years to the point that the <UNK> of independent film is starting to become just as <UNK> with this particular storytelling just as the mainstream has become <UNK> with this and more br br much of the film may bore the viewer who needs immediate dialog and purpose the primary figure of this story at least <UNK> performs his routines with nearly no dialog no insight and nothing else to carry the viewer and for a short film i wished they could've gotten to the point a lot faster that aside from the typical plot annoyed me yet there was something about a <UNK> glimpse into the daily <UNK> of at least two <UNK> artists even if most of it was rather <UNK> time br br recommended if you're tired of the mainstream crap and don't mind an indie picture and have some interested into this underground urban art form but you really have to watch it for yourself because this seems to be one with a more acquired taste for more recent indie films <UNK> on <UNK> artists check out <UNK>
<START> beautiful images propaganda and history as toy the ingredients of this film good interesting but with many shadows shadows <UNK> is more than the hero of a mythical america he is <UNK> of a vision about life and society an extraordinary <UNK> teacher of large part of north america in film is only superman the delicate <UNK> of ideas are crushed the subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten and <UNK> is basic <UNK> for create a good image of american realities the end and fake romance and heroic is gun suicide of a story who may be tall with more wisdom and the war against <UNK> is another gray <UNK> for one who heard nothing about <UNK> movie is a good beginning for the others <UNK> it is like the precious <UNK> of a <UNK> but the <UNK> is fascinating about <UNK> and the clothes are only ordinary cloth so a sad experience <UNK> of beauty and boring <UNK> patriotic lesson and the crush of expectation a film who must impressive and the ash of a story who could be magnificent
<START> i enjoyed this for a couple of reasons the emotional <UNK> was at times confusing and <UNK> resolved but the blend of <UNK> footage with the film's narrative was often compelling the other element that i appreciated was the depiction of the werewolves the <UNK> nazis who continued the fight after the <UNK> surrender i don't know of another film that deals with them they <UNK> of <UNK> on palm sunday 1945 for example and did create problems for the <UNK> the film then challenges the <UNK> version of victory and <UNK> with some gritty realities the human issues are presented not so much through the characters here but through the historical reality that was gripping those who had survived hitler both <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> a group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending h bomb blast not only do they fear the radiation but also mutants in the surrounding <UNK> one of the group is already <UNK> but strangely poses no real threat to the others just surviving the <UNK> of <UNK> personalities at close range is the sub plot richard plays the hero mike <UNK> is close to the edge playing a tough guy <UNK> nelson is the girl destined to start a brave new world not one of director roger <UNK> best this is predictable black and white sci fi
<START> mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment and fair play to him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know what you are going to get with rourke mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more and you don't want most of it br br first and foremost this whole thing just doesn't make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a bus load of <UNK> <UNK> ireland for london he is on the run from the cops and from his own army <UNK> he has also <UNK> to never kill again it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him br br however when he gets to london he is <UNK> down by a local mobster bates looking like his <UNK> and hair came straight off a <UNK> <UNK> to kill his main <UNK> in turn for <UNK> 000 and a boat trip to the us rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest <UNK> and <UNK> the crime to him in the <UNK> in order to keep the <UNK> mouth shut he figures it is better than killing him br br a wealth of things <UNK> here which just don't add up 1 why pick rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a scene <UNK> an employee is <UNK> to a wall by a couple of <UNK> with what look like these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing 2 not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes why didn't that guy simply kill the <UNK> and save all the <UNK> of dealing with rourke 3 <UNK> sees the murder take place and the police let him go off without protection i may add to take confession no way 4 rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession why aren't the cops checking the place out 5 rourke hangs around the church and blind niece in particular for days afterwards without anybody bothering him what he's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder stupid 6 the cops actually meet rourke in the church <UNK> the <UNK> and have no idea who he is do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing they don't even check up on him 7 why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat you'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other 8 why does <UNK> brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not <UNK> himself for a few days at least until rourke has been safely <UNK> to the states ridiculous 9 rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again utterly ludicrous and besides she falls in love with him in record time a few days 10 the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates point of view 11 things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say that in <UNK> along <UNK> houses rourke in a <UNK> until the boat is ready to <UNK> and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house but yet will bed a blind girl 12 rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is and the henchman practically <UNK> out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked 13 priest is an ex army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally <UNK> for and yet another cringe worthy scene br br i'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning <UNK> hair so <UNK> red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but <UNK> to a barely heard <UNK> at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing style br br i have just mentioned them br br overall a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in rourke on the cross preaching from a <UNK> which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director br br 4 10
<START> james cagney plays richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a former gangster now <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> as the new <UNK> of a state run <UNK> school tepid genre entry <UNK> <UNK> the whole show he <UNK> the picture but only because there's not much else of interest going on jimmy gives just what's expected from his hard boiled persona which can be satisfying if you're in for a quick fix the direction by <UNK> <UNK> though michael <UNK> was said to have helped is straightforward without being particularly gripping although the narrative slips in the second half <UNK> the film down to a messy conclusion with even <UNK> <UNK> getting lost in the <UNK> remade in 1938 as crime school and again in 1939 as <UNK> kitchen from
<START> <UNK> where do i start i usually ignore whatever rating imdb has when looking up a movie because i think i might like it anyway or whatever and i should at least give it a chance but this time i wish i'd paid attention br br i know some people liked it and i'm not trying to say that they shouldn't it was semi amusing at some parts but if you're like me and you don't like watching cats <UNK> around in the for 20 minutes random fast motion cloud scenes dogs <UNK> in <UNK> for another 20 minutes set to music and close ups of faces while people are speaking then you might want to avoid this movie the actors were either positively wooden or way over the top and the film quality was awful fuzzy and grainy and bland and not in an artistic way at all and i know that we were supposed to think that carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun shooting innocent people with this weird religious <UNK> going on but well she doesn't really convince me otherwise in fact i ended up really <UNK> her crazy character and what was up with the souls in space i understand this is a fantasy movie but come on br br i will say the angel at the end was freaking creepy it was the <UNK> thing in the whole movie way more creepy than the darth <UNK> <UNK> face demon i give them props for that scene it was good but not good enough to actually see the movie and the opening credits were great but don't be fooled i would've rather they used whatever money went into those credits to make the movie better br br <UNK> i wish i hadn't bought this for even the 2 that i paid for it i could have bought a candy bar instead
<START> the animation is still the slightly <UNK> style of the first episode simpsons <UNK> on an open fire but already with this first regular episode bart the genius the humor is beginning to be more layered <UNK> and greater depth of characterization is already appearing br br this episode firmly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> personality and more subtly <UNK> intellectual <UNK> to the whole family although that's the main theme of the whole episode there's also a nice secondary theme of bart and <UNK> father son relationship it's given to us first in a nutshell as the episode opens with the simpsons playing <UNK> lisa comes up with id for her word short but something you have to be well educated to know she has to read the definition to the rest of the family from the <UNK> which has been serving as a way to prop up the couch <UNK> can only come up with he homer has already sitting on his <UNK> in order but doesn't recognize that it's a word so he presents do instead bart comes up with which he insists is a word similarly in the main plot line of the episode bart <UNK> on his iq test which leads to his being put into a special school full of gifted kids we know that's not likely to last long br br the simpsons has always had a lot of fun playing with varying degrees of intellectual abilities among people through its characters and more importantly they way that people with <UNK> degrees of intellectual abilities fit into or not are accepted or not and are perceived in society aside from beginning to present bart lisa homer and <UNK> place in this context this episode already starts <UNK> <UNK> fun at <UNK> and <UNK> outside of the simpsons family via some of the dialogue from the students at the special school as well as some of the other references including purely visual ones this episode also shows that the simpsons isn't going to pull any punches by means of writing or talking down to its audience it may be just a cartoon but it's a cartoon that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are going to understand more than anyone else and that fact aside from it just being a very funny show is the key to the show's <UNK>
<START> peter o'toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to <UNK> in drunken <UNK> the lovely <UNK> york provides a good foil for <UNK> dramatic presence br br the film <UNK> to incest without a single explicit scene but it is able to entertain the viewer in its <UNK> social commentary though this is not major film by any <UNK> it will be remembered for its entertaining performances br br even york <UNK> the papers at the end is a treat to watch <UNK> tragedy <UNK> the possible weakness here is <UNK> laid back direction but the film <UNK> because of the actors and the script br br i saw the film twice over a period of 20 years on both occasions with the name <UNK> love country dance is a rather <UNK> and inappropriate title for this movie wherever it was released as such
<START> deep sea 3d is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to view first hand br br from the opening sequence when a wave rushes towards the audience <UNK> us in the ocean the filmmakers make full use of the <UNK> format a <UNK> fish field appears to fill the whole theatre a shark powers towards us <UNK> <UNK> from behind rocks and <UNK> their prey it is a beautifully captured under sea feast for the eyes br br our ears on the other hand are not given the same treatment the film is narrated by hollywood stars <UNK> <UNK> and kate <UNK> both sound so ridiculous it positively <UNK> the enjoyment of the visuals <UNK> sounds slightly bored whilst <UNK> sounds as if she is reading a <UNK> story to the village idiot i was shocked that an actress of her status could have pitched her performance so wrongly the script is fairly silly and contains very little depth the soundtrack is filled with strange unrealistic sound effects which i assume are meant to be funny but in fact detract attention from the material which should have been allowed to speak for itself br br danny <UNK> has provided an excellent score which gives plenty of impact to the ups and downs of life under the sea when it is allowed to play out without the silly bubble sounds or which pepper film br br the film is a technical marvel but with it's childish script annoying narration and misplaced sound effects it cannot be taken seriously
<START> the net is a movie i never saw upon release i remember giving it a pass upon the mediocre reviews and since then perhaps been <UNK> a <UNK> here and there when it's been on tv seeing it now <UNK> years after it's original release i'm a little <UNK> as to how time flies being in my mid <UNK> it made my childhood feel ancient i felt as if i should probably do some exercise before my body starts <UNK> up fat in all the wrong places cut down on fat and sugar too much coffee and <UNK> br br anyway that was the best part of this movie experience for me i'd say the first 30 minutes of this movie really kept me occupied with retro heaven look at those big <UNK> they call computers look they chat in chat rooms i remember those tank tops they look stupid and hey it even stars sandra <UNK> first billed would you look at that br br as a movie the net is just an unimaginative plain and totally routine cat and mouse thriller nothing <UNK> about that they made them then as much as they make them now <UNK> plays a <UNK> computer nerd who's job it is to fix <UNK> for people who don't get that whole computer <UNK> as it happens she stumbles upon some delicate information and after her vacation trip ends up with her nearly getting killed by a sexy lay who turns out to be a killer played by jeremy northam and she should have been suspicious by the fact that they are in an american movie and the guy both <UNK> and has a british accent she gets her identity wiped out her house is empty for sale and upon checking it out it turns out that she now has got a new identity a convicted prostitute and <UNK> no less br br now you might say that this is improbable how could they possibly do that to her even in 1995 it's impossible that's true but back in <UNK> a lot of people didn't even know what the internet was i can see how it's a plot hole you could have accepted back then what's far more disastrous though is the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology the movie obviously owes a lot to hitchcock movies it's one of those thrillers that feature a merry go round by night but hitchcock always made sure that his movies were plausible the characters didn't act like confused <UNK> when trying to prove their innocence and the plot didn't conveniently lay down for a structure where one <UNK> inevitable leads to the other the characters also tried a little before giving into the whole <UNK> chase has <UNK> character really no friends what so ever couldn't any old high school teacher confirm her identity or like her nearest pizza guy oh right she orders pizza from the internet never mind you figure the movie out pretty quickly there seems to be hope in an ex boyfriend you really think so you should always count on at least one surprise the net offers none br br the internet poses a lot of danger this movie seems to predict but had the movie been made today imagine the troubles the villains would have to go through to ensure the identity wipe not only do they have to do all those boring literal things she would still have her <UNK> <UNK> with at least like 100 friends or so and picture <UNK> not to mention she might be on youtube or linked in and what about her video <UNK> with like 150 daily hits or the in her house and recorded video of her in other people's cell phones web <UNK> her imdb <UNK>
<START> my opinions do not flow with the majority in most cases i tend to lean toward the artsy imaginative and different this movie was reminiscent of frances ford's the black <UNK> <UNK> a fantasy situation is created to showcase the beauty of a magnificent creature who's not readily available to view performing at its peak except on these <UNK> of documentaries ala natural unlike those nature films this offering <UNK> the finest movie making techniques the industry has to offer fit for a <UNK> creating one of the most sensual super stars the cat on the screen br br this fantasy depicting the love relationship that develops between a french soldier he is very nice too lost on the egyptian desert and a female <UNK> he encounters when he chances upon an abandoned egyptian temple is mesmerizing i bought into it <UNK> if you are the least bit open to fantasy and appreciate the grace beauty power and <UNK> of the <UNK> you should enjoy it br br the only flaw in my book was the ending it was a perfect set up for a romeo and juliet finale that would have taken me over the top br br

<START> this could have been a <UNK> role for <UNK> <UNK> but the film instead decided to shift its attention to another area the film is about a woman named <UNK> <UNK> who is married to a <UNK> and the mother of three she is a free spirit and prone to <UNK> so the rest of the village and her family decide she should be sent to <UNK> and see a doctor the story takes place on the island of off of <UNK> and it shows the everyday life there with the teenage boys in <UNK> gangs and just trying to find something to do on the sun baked rock oldest son <UNK> <UNK> her and is always trying to protect her during her <UNK> of depression the daughter <UNK> is a <UNK> young girl who becomes <UNK> with a local policeman and the youngest son is very sassy and <UNK> the <UNK> accent upon learning that she is to be sent to <UNK> <UNK> runs away and helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone <UNK> for her this film could have really made more of an impact if it could have concentrated its focus to <UNK> we do see some <UNK> and irrational behavior on her part but their is no follow up to these scenes nothing comes of it the film looks great and is beautifully photographed so give director <UNK> credit for that but the story needed to focus on something more substantial the film does a good job of showing us what life is like on this island and what is going on in the lives of the three children as they grow up their is some <UNK> that character gives a hint of being a mermaid like creature and that is why she is having difficulty existing on land i also sense that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain manner and if you don't then you can be subjected to the harsh realities of its rules all <UNK> but i do think the films attention could have stayed with the character of <UNK> after she hides in the cave she really has nothing to do in a sense the character becomes <UNK> i wish <UNK> had more to do because i've always liked her and whenever she is <UNK> you just can't take your eyes off her she's a <UNK> of fury passion and raw energy what a shame didn't write a more complete role for her to act in when the film ends your left feeling empty from an <UNK> story

<START> you know the saying curiosity killed the cat well i have heard so much about this film from a magazine that named this one of the most shocking movies of all time my <UNK> movies you must see before you die my sister who saw this at a film festival and the i love the 70's show on <UNK> i just had to see this movie since it was named the <UNK> movie of all time and well after viewing this film last night i have to say that it really did live up to it's title my god this movie was so weird i thought i really did see it all with some of the <UNK> movies and tv shows i've seen some things i guess will always still feel like a shock br br well <UNK> johnson aka divine has been named the <UNK> person alive and a jealous couple named the <UNK> are competing for that title they want to take divine out and be named the <UNK> couple alive by kidnapping women <UNK> them <UNK> them and selling their babies to lesbian couples but it seems like divine and her family of well i don't know seems to keep the title by having sex with <UNK> butt lip <UNK> eating dog <UNK> <UNK> meat up their <UNK> incest and it just gets <UNK> and <UNK> br br pink <UNK> is horribly acted horribly made and well just plain horrible the reason for the 10 rating i'm going to give it is due to the fact well how could you rate this film i always rate so i just figure what the heck through the <UNK> of this film you have got to give john waters some credit who the heck would ever think of this movie over 35 years later to the cast and crew who worked on this film you guys are just plain nasty br br 10 10
<START> count ralph <UNK> has just been transferred to a hospital in italy during world war ii he is <UNK> burned from an <UNK> his nurse <UNK> juliette <UNK> tends to him body and mind for she fears quite rightly that he may be a very troubled soul in the course of his care the count starts to tell <UNK> of his recent past it seems he worked in a government capacity in africa where he met a beautiful married lady named <UNK> <UNK> scott thomas although they tried to avoid each other they fell in love after a brief affair <UNK> called it <UNK> leaving the count desolate even so the two would meet again under heart wrenching circumstances meanwhile <UNK> herself falls for a man in the british bomb squad yet the war is raging relentlessly can love exist when the world is in turmoil this is a tremendous film based on an equally fine but complex novel the plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully each of them poignant beyond description the script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines <UNK> is magnificent both as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth scott thomas is also quite fine as the woman who fights against her passions as for <UNK> she richly deserved the oscar that she was presented as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation the scenery is utterly gorgeous as are the costumes the direction and the production if you have missed out on viewing this film <UNK> that soon very soon the english patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in film for centuries to come
<START> a man named jerry comes into possession of an ancient aztec doll however this creepy little figure is possessed by an evil spirit which takes over <UNK> body and pushes him to <UNK> the blood i have seen two other horror movies the <UNK> that <UNK> blood and the <UNK> made by stephen carpenter and jeffrey <UNK> and i must say that the power doesn't disappoint either the plot is slow moving but there are some effective human goo effects and a little bit of gore the scene of a female <UNK> reporter being attacked by arms that come ripping out of a <UNK> is a hoot i liked this low budget horror movie and you should too if you are into 80's horror genre 8 out of 10
<START> so pathetic its not even funny from the first scene in the movie i knew i was in for a bad time thank goodness i only saw this movie on tv the story line was terrible not to mention the acting it was horrid very unreal and unusual things happened in this move such as the lady sticks a whip under the door and <UNK> the guy a little and he just hands over the keys i'm like get real the creators lousy attempt to make a futuristic city even <UNK> my dislike for the film to tell you the truth the only good thing in this movie at all was the fighting which was in itself pretty lame all i could ask myself when watching this movie was when is it gonna go off
<START> this dvd is missing its calling as a coaster this is a great example of why no one should ever go see a sequel with a different director writer than the original two hours of this turkey left me begging for exorcist 2 reruns br br no legitimate laughs not one decent scare the script was just a mess and i felt bad for the actors who had to perform it they must have had sick relatives at home or monster coke <UNK> or something br br the original was a makeup effects landmark so naturally the producers of the sequel thought it would be a great idea to to <UNK> makeup fx and do cg werewolves instead these cg werewolves had me laughing a lot harder than any of the comedy it was just a total miss if ya want a <UNK> entertainment go rent the original again or go take a film class and make your own horror film you're bound to do better than these fools did
<START> the first bottom movie was an absolute laugh from the beginning excellently made and thought out i will definitely take my hat off to the production team and the actors the bottom actors attempt to run a hotel if you look closely this film was most probably shot in the <UNK> of <UNK> near my home
<START> this film was not all that bad as the story went but the camera work is what makes it difficult to watch i just don't like that so called realistic camera work that is being done nowadays you know the type jumping off center <UNK> around etc what got me particularly irritated about this film though was the new thing that they threw into the mix by shooting a few frames in black and white in each scene i believe that the film would have been much better if the camera work was shot in the much more conventional way because as it was i couldn't concentrate on it and found myself <UNK> the camera work instead maybe if more people express <UNK> with camera work like this the filmmakers will finally get the hint
<START> i saw this movie for a first time years ago when it was still new and i was satisfied it's a great hollywood make belief story for teenagers however it's not <UNK> as much as you would want to believe it these stories never happen that's why it is irritating to watch movies like that they play with <UNK> minds just imagine how many girls still in high schools believed in that magic and got disappointed i wouldn't recommend this movie to my little sister or my cousin the director should have spent some more time thinking about the plot instead of thinking about actors yes they actors were good but the idea isn't worth a 10 there are a lot of films about teenagers so why don't we make a better one
<START> to call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement br br the acting was unconvincing to say the least especially from actor craig <UNK> who couldn't have acted <UNK> as far as story goes well what story the film is <UNK> about harry lee a <UNK> of chinese descent who comes back to his home country after <UNK> out of every course he took and tries to start a band br br the film has ever cliche you can think of sex tension among band members and a little bit of racial tension thrown in br br the problem is that even with a subject that's been covered adequately by even the most amateurish directors this movie is all over the place and the whole thing just feels contrived with parts that would make even the most hardened <UNK> <UNK> stand on end br br
<START> if anyone thinks this is a great sports movie it is probably the only sports movie they have ever seen there are different aspects a sports movie can take whether it be professional or college or high school examples of sports movies i liked and i haven't seen many are jim all american all the right moves any given sunday eight men out and rocky among others all of those movies had a little more than just plain sports whether it was a mans <UNK> and then descent from greatness or a man losing out on a dream by the actions of a <UNK> coach or the effect of money on professional sports in <UNK> there is not much content it didn't even seem as though the movie had a beginning or an end there was no character development all of them were forced on us i could sum up this movie by <UNK> a very bad coach go out and try to score more points than the other guy
<START> it is the early morning of our <UNK> and some friends of mine and i have just gotten through watching the wind truly a disaster film not in the sense of forces of nature <UNK> havoc on an unsuspecting <UNK> but rather an awful movie <UNK> havoc on an unsuspecting audience to give you an indication of how frustrating it was to watch this particular bomb i'll give you an example <UNK> during my first <UNK> viewing if given the choice of watching this movie for a second time and say <UNK> myself i'm afraid to say the choice would not be an immediate one but rather than simply <UNK> ad with lousy one liners i'm going to get specific as to why exactly my friends and i <UNK> this particular film br br to start this off i like low budget horror flicks i even like artsy low budget horror flicks i liked cold hearts midnight mass <UNK> wine etc films that were ambitious and daring even if they were lacking in production value execution and even acting generally an interesting premise unusual camera technique or merely just a well done scene or two will save a movie that is running a little rough around the edges with these in mind i would like to say <UNK> that i hated the wind br br the movie was probably most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch from the actions of the main characters to the flow of the plot to the big <UNK> hinted at by the opening which ultimately <UNK> to dust and did not even <UNK> themselves <UNK> to what <UNK> in the remainder of the film and left the viewer expecting something more with a sense of much <UNK> about nothing the dialogue was <UNK> at best <UNK> delivered and completely unrealistic by this i mean no one in any of the situations that the characters were in would have <UNK> the way the characters did or said the things that they said in the way that they said them there was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would have <UNK> this problem br br character interaction and development was abysmal claire the sex <UNK> or so the <UNK> passive aggressive in the movie thought was so overt in her <UNK> she may as well have pulled a gun on the characters nevertheless she was the shining high point of the film the other main characters with the exception of <UNK> mom who was not terrible are so that they may as well have been portrayed by the same actor let's see if i missed anything borderline personality co <UNK> <UNK> with profound feelings of sexual confusion and <UNK> <UNK> to fits of <UNK> rage through the <UNK> <UNK> of a loose <UNK> suddenly and turned <UNK> no i think that about covers it br br lack of scope was also <UNK> how did those involved with the making of this film expect the casual viewer to <UNK> that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this amateurish unbelievable poorly portrayed lust <UNK> well what would you call it that occurred largely in the woods in the middle of nowhere there were no witnesses to the atrocities presented there were no witnesses anywhere in this film br br the believability problems <UNK> from this lack of attention to detail were <UNK> even from the point where the plot begins to <UNK> case in point if that guy bob took that route through the woods to come home from the gym and here's the key every day there's a jolly good chance that someone else would have been around to see something at some point afterwards while the <UNK> <UNK> about the crime scene one would think that with the murder of a young man in the woods said town would have been in an <UNK> the characters would have been <UNK> etc but instead there wasn't a witness in sight other than earl the closet psychopath with no inner monologue we suggest that there be no witnesses for this film either br br as for the quasi homosexual <UNK> present i don't have a problem with those either it's not as if they came as a surprise considering we had been shouting as to the closet case of most of the male characters since the second scene again not <UNK> in and of itself but thrown in for the wrong reasons it was utterly unnecessary thrown in for pure shock and or dangerous art value and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective what we had instead was an awkward attempt to redeem a boring clumsy movie with a boring clumsy plot the poorly hinted at sexual tension which was only hinted at heavy <UNK> in anticipation of this <UNK> <UNK> scene only pushed this film further down the <UNK> pole from mediocrity <UNK> criticism to film sucking so bad that it lacks the inherent grace to suck enough to properly mock and <UNK> br br so it is with most of the film a lot of artistic <UNK> very little meat and a lot of <UNK> it's not that we don't get it oh we got it alright we just don't want it look the very fact that we were cheering the <UNK> in the final scene as the only <UNK> that made sense on its face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this film rather than moving <UNK> along as its name implies this movie <UNK> <UNK> forward like the sweat trail working it's way down the side of your nose while your hands are full <UNK> that sensation pretty well sums up the gut wrenching frustration realized while watching this train wreck there is no breath of fresh air with regard to this movie only the stale <UNK> of bad ideas poorly realized before coming to <UNK>
<START> me and my friend read the <UNK> and watched the trailer and were very interested and excited to go rent this movie bad idea we thought a movie with actors that influential would have been a sure hit but our expectations fell extremely short first of all the trailer and <UNK> are misleading to the point of lies the movie started out slow for the first 1 1 2 hours reminder its about two hours long and when it finally started to gain momentum it sucked plus the plots were very hard to follow it confused us because it kept skipping from one story to another in random order the characters where not very realistic when it came to reality sure the mum and son could be actual people in reality but everyone else seemed to be one extreme or the other if your a person who likes sick twisted unusual movies then go for it but we advise not wasting two hours of you life you cant get back no one told us that
<START> a <UNK> directed film by martin <UNK> where a drifter and anti hero john <UNK> lands in n y to escape a tragic incident in his life where he killed his brother in an <UNK> accident as well as going <UNK> from the army br br cassavetes always an intense actor shows <UNK> in his portrayal of a film am surprised that <UNK> <UNK> didn't get this part br br ruth white is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes on the <UNK> br br once in new york he befriends sidney <UNK> as the two work on the <UNK> immediately jack warden a bully and villain in this film takes a dislike to him and tragedy ensues when <UNK> tries to defend his friend br br ruby dee plays <UNK> wife in this film and is brilliant in a scene where she <UNK> cassavetes to reveal the killer of her husband br br this is definitely an interesting film of moral values and the loner in society with the backdrop of <UNK> the right mood is depicted in the film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> a bunch of 5 mates are deeply bored in this town there's <UNK> who works in a clothes shop coop an easy going dj nina <UNK> from her best friend <UNK> and the week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing the week end at this time they got out to a nightclub and to the sound of tech no music they experience different drugs particularly ecstasy then they usually continue the party to a friend's at the end of this really good time on sunday the feelings are the following ones <UNK> melancholy just the memory of a crazy night br br surfing on the wave of the notorious success of <UNK> 1996 this debut movie written and directed by justin <UNK> brings and develops a new variation about the notion of <UNK> it means how to have fun as much as possible while knowing that you have a <UNK> <UNK> of time indeed as i have previously written for the 5 main characters of the movie the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without the single pressure besides <UNK> in one sequence talks about the positive aspects of shooting <UNK> you are <UNK> you don't feel any pressure you are like an astronaut in <UNK> above the earth <UNK> relentless directorial style expresses very well the spirit of <UNK> and care of the 5 protagonists they only live to take advantage as much as possible of an <UNK> week end furthermore to spice up a little more the <UNK> atmosphere in which his movie <UNK> <UNK> isn't afraid to include <UNK> sequences which represent his characters' fantasy or <UNK> then human traffic 1999 is also served by a particularly <UNK> sound track the amount a perfect <UNK> between the sound and the music at last this week end of <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> the usual drab image of the popular social classes british cinema has studied a lot br br notwithstanding when a movie or not exploits the fame of another famous one it rarely matches the brilliance of its predecessor human traffic is in this condition there's little <UNK> at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and one can note down a few useless <UNK> <UNK> who in the nightclub goes in the <UNK> office and tells him a <UNK> and bull story so as to <UNK> to enter the club but that's no use because the latter succeeds in coming without problems one can also blame <UNK> to overlook the dramatic sides that the story could have involved his movie can also be read as a transition from <UNK> to paranoia and the dramatic <UNK> of this second pole aren't virtually explored it's a shame it could have conveyed the following message even in the <UNK> moments there can be something terrible preparing which can flop them the same remark could also be said when coop has a fit of jealousy because nina <UNK> a guy br br it may not be the last great film of the nineties as it is billed on the dvd cover but human traffic is to be taken as a good and <UNK> little movie which conveys with the styles and the fashions of the end of the <UNK> century a will to have fun without <UNK> motives and trouble an ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club
<START> when i first saw this film on video in a department store it intrigued me considering the fact that i thought i was in love and i was the same age as the <UNK> in this film at the time although i realize they are now old enough to be my parents plus the soundtrack being written by <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> just before they made it big here in north america i figured i had nothing to lose in buying it i was not disappointed br br so far i have shown it to many guys i have dated since and to my current boyfriend obviously they didn't find it as lovely as i do <UNK> to call it a chick movie but i still laugh and cry this film was vastly overlooked it's good to see it's available to rent at one of the local video stores around here so that other people can share the magic br br so maybe it's a bit far fetched but it gives you a lighthearted sense of innocence and a <UNK> faith in love
<START> this is just about the worst piece of garbage i've ever had the <UNK> of sitting through the story was embarrassingly amateurish the graphics were horrible and the acting i've never seen worse acting in my entire life a <UNK> class could come up with a scarier better written and more entertaining concept than this i pity anyone who wastes their time on this film as well as the actors who agreed to doing the job it was obvious that they were not given appropriate direction the writers must have spent their time at film school in the back room playing a lot of <UNK> wasted a lot of time on these two i would be truly embarrassed to admit that i knew them
<START> after my 6 year old daughter began taking riding lessons i started looking for horse movies for her i had always heard of national <UNK> but had never seen it boy am i glad i bought it it's become a favorite of mine my 6 year old and my 2 year old it's a shame movies like this aren't made anymore
<START> a coach who used to be good but has had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did a team of no <UNK> the star player who has a row with the coach the assistant coach with an alcohol problem the little guy who gets kicked around <UNK> the winning basket the whole town against the coach all except for the leading lady it's the old story right out of the british comic books where a team of <UNK> and take on the <UNK> at soccer and win br br this film admittedly well put together is full of these clichés the only part i didn't predict was when at the town meeting the star player suddenly decided to side with the coach no reason was ever given it seemed like a very strange thing to do seeing that everything was going his way <UNK> maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy br br gene hackman plays a locker room doyle i am sure that an actor of dennis <UNK> <UNK> found nothing particularly challenging about his role the same can be said about barbara <UNK> br br all in all a film full of clichés that might have been done a lot better than it was
<START> as a veteran screen writing <UNK> at college in dallas and a former mgm screenwriter back in the days of decent films i am thrilled to have accidentally <UNK> on channel 33 in dallas tonight and watched this enchanting film in which betty white is gorgeous and makes one <UNK> for the good old days of truly good movies before hollywood started <UNK> out all this crap for the teenagers if a producer is listening i'd like to state that there are enough of us over 60's who will happily pay a buck to see a movie that has no guns no killing no special effects no sex and violence and just a good touching tale of human relationships that leaves you with a good warm feeling as this film did for me
<START> after kenneth rousing story of the <UNK> me back into the pleasure of reading during grade school i had high hopes for this series the story of an underdog bat across country to reunite with his colony captivated my imagination and <UNK> deeply with my <UNK> imagination upon hearing of this series i began <UNK> <UNK> site and liked what i saw the character design looked impressive and the fast paced plot seemed to have been stretched <UNK> across a thirteen episode arc much was my disappointment then when i decided to watch a <UNK> early one <UNK> br br the opening episode shows our hero <UNK> pursuing a tiger <UNK> in the deep hours of the night an song we see a nifty if crude cgi effect <UNK> the <UNK> and the chase takes on a frenetic turn as the tiny <UNK> creates numerous <UNK> copies of itself do <UNK> its <UNK> as a lover of <UNK> i had a decent understanding of the principles in place tiger <UNK> can sense the sounds their <UNK> use for and spin a <UNK> cover for themselves but without such exposition i would have surely been lost a minor <UNK> i thought surely they director will fill us in <UNK> i waited in vain br br once our protagonist down with some of his <UNK> we are treated to some of the <UNK> dialog i've ever seen on television childhood rival begin <UNK> the <UNK> hero with the stupidest lines i've ever seen on a show i can understand the writers not producing shakespeare but one would think they'd have had some social contact in their lives surely enough to make communication seem natural oh how wrong i was br br the voice acting while not horrendous hardly was a shining example of human achievement oh <UNK> you're broken the law mother <UNK> <UNK> you must come with me young one <UNK> the <UNK> elder of the colony the actors try but it hardly matters at this point as the story becomes less and less compelling with each pass minute br br while each episode deals with a problem of the week as is typical of with most television series <UNK> story <UNK> the saga for better and worse while the main point of the story is reunion with his family later episodes <UNK> on other story <UNK> involving <UNK> bats from the southern <UNK> and a <UNK> war between birds and <UNK> the writers try to do too much at once fighting to <UNK> as many promising ideas as possible in the hopes that it will grab audience interest enough to keep the bloody show going on unfortunately these attempts are <UNK> to all but the eight to ten year olds at whom this show is aimed br br while it's nice to see canadian media be <UNK> it would be all the <UNK> if the <UNK> of the series wasn't limited to the immediate family of the animators or <UNK> fans of kenneth books there are worse things out there your children could be watching than but far better programs are out there too pass on the mediocrity and read the books instead
<START> the museum of the moving image here in new york recently put on a <UNK> <UNK> of jacques <UNK> films having fallen in love with his paris <UNK> i decided this was not to be missed br br largely through extended shots and structured scenes the movie depicts two avant garde theater companies preparing their <UNK> of seven against and <UNK> additionally we are shown the <UNK> day to day lives of two individuals connected to the companies a working class woman named who finds creative ways of <UNK> men out of their money and a young man named colin who visits local <UNK> posing as a deaf mute and plays shrill <UNK> at the <UNK> until they pay him to go away the first four hours or so are devoted to establishing the characters and their <UNK> before a somewhat loose whimsical plot finally emerges involving a conspiracy and the <UNK> of <UNK> secret letters br br the film is largely about life on the <UNK> of society the theater companies are a <UNK> affair using their elaborate emotionally <UNK> <UNK> which are really something to watch to distract themselves from the fact that their acts are unlikely ever to be staged or even seen colin and both have very few friends who only briefly find any excitement or purpose after the conspiracy touches them as they are <UNK> to find out more about it the film <UNK> on the consequences of <UNK> normal society in several memorable sequences including a long shot of colin as he wanders the streets of france shouting poetry to himself as such the film has been referred to as an analysis of 1960's <UNK> br br there is not a frame of the film that is not <UNK> with energy and <UNK> the fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous much more immediate the camera also becomes an important character in this regard throughout the movie boom shadows are visible here and there or other similar errors yet they seem natural and fit with the flow of the action because the camera is so important a player <UNK> br br more than anything for me the film seems a great example of another way of making movies a <UNK> for film outside the usual pattern for me it was a mind opening experience even more than paris <UNK> though the latter bears many similarities of theme and structure a must see for anybody <UNK> the nature of art
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br david <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are a couple in <UNK> on business <UNK> and staying at a luxury hotel one night they meet an attractive woman at a nightclub and invite her back to their place where they end up in a <UNK> all is well until david receives some <UNK> in the mail and he and <UNK> end up being <UNK> but when some people involved in the deception are found murdered things get messy and they are forced to enter the seedy underground world of pornography and hardcore bondage to track down the woman who may hold the key to everything br br whereas the original film dealt with the concept of snuff films this straight to dvd sequel deals with the more wholesome theme of <UNK> and sleazy sex it plays like a porn film a cheap piece of <UNK> with plenty of hot t a action going on if this sounds like your idea of a good film you'll probably like it but you'd probably be more at home in a porn shop than a video store br br this tries to copy the original film's dark and <UNK> feel but while it does a pretty good job of this it still can't hold up to that of the <UNK> it has an <UNK> story with a dodgy narrative flow and compared to cage <UNK> comes across as <UNK> wooden br br better than i thought it'd be i suppose and better than your average one of these dvd direct sequels that seem to be coming out a lot these days but really haven't we seen enough
<START> maybe the subject was good but put down to a script it fails in pace maybe the author was trying to obtain something slow paced like alien but instead of being haunting this movie turned out just boring technically good anyway a pity for the lack of tension
<START> when a <UNK> blows up a controversial government research lab two experimental animals are <UNK> in a small community in washington state one is a dog with unusual intelligence the other is an outside experimental combat <UNK> or because of reasons <UNK> further into the film the hates the dog and so is trying to kill it <UNK> concerns the accidental involvement of travis <UNK> corey <UNK> his mom nora barbara williams and his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> with the dog and as two national security organization agents johnson michael <UNK> and cliff <UNK> track them down br br many comments are made about <UNK> being very different than the dean <UNK> book that serves as the <UNK> pad for the film this is true but it should not affect your rating if you want the book read the book judge the film on its own merits not how closely it matches the book bill freed and <UNK> lee who wrote the screenplay are just as much artists as <UNK> is that's not a quality comparison just a statement that they're all artists so is director jon <UNK> their job as filmmakers isn't to <UNK> follow the book as if it were a script they're adapting the book as artists to make a unique artwork it's based on the book not identical to it you have to <UNK> your <UNK> expectations when you watch the film because you're going to be experiencing an artwork that you are not already familiar with even if you've read novel br br so is <UNK> a good film it's pretty good not excellent good enough to earn a b or an 8 <UNK> begins things on the right foot with one of the most beautifully filmed explosions i've seen in awhile unfortunately he <UNK> a bit immediately afterward as we listen to some very thick exposition after that scene <UNK> threatens to become a clichéd 1980s film as we first meet travis and <UNK> br br <UNK> towards cliché is a tendency continually threatened but it is only a <UNK> more often than not <UNK> is able to <UNK> well <UNK> territory with a number of interesting twists both travis and <UNK> are from single parent homes with their <UNK> <UNK> both have unique mature relationships with their parents although this is a horror film a major focus is a cute intelligent <UNK> and it often feels as much like an adventure film as it does horror a thriller or sci fi which are all genres it touches upon <UNK> introduces a large cast of characters some not entering until late in the game yet the film is never confusing and no characters feel as if they are left in the dust all of the threads are nicely tied up in the end the structure is also complex in that there are two major villains the second becoming less obviously ill <UNK> as the film progresses until a twist accompanied by brutal violence makes one antagonist <UNK> soon after <UNK> gives us a nice moment of doubt with the other antagonist br br the biggest flaw in my eyes is a <UNK> common one with horror films since at least the 1980s the attack scenes are shot too darkly too close too out of focus and they're edited too <UNK> it makes it extremely difficult to tell what's going on which <UNK> most of the tension from scenes that should be a highlight surely part of motivation for the style and this is the typical justification for this problem was worry that the creature would come across as humorous and or fake rather than frightening and suspenseful in my view presenting the audience with a <UNK> <UNK> isn't a satisfactory solution we only get to see the creature costume makeup clearly towards the end of the film it was well done enough that better shot and edited attack scenes would have brought the film up to at least a 9 br br regardless of the degree of <UNK> between the novel and the film <UNK> presents a gripping story using smart <UNK> characters it is frequently a nail <UNK> and the horror scenes are more <UNK> than you might expect if not exactly gory although there is a fair amount of blood in a couple scenes <UNK> tends to be underrated because of <UNK> about the role of film when it comes to adapting literature don't pass it up or <UNK> dismiss it based on a <UNK>
<START> this movie is beautiful in all ways it is visually stunning and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper the acting is superb it is subtle passionate and intense ben daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor there is not one flaw not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere it is completely perfect but only if you understand what you're going to experience it isn't a movie for anyone who wants <UNK>
<START> eh <UNK> eh <UNK> hey dude look at these aliens they're like biting the humans and stuff eh <UNK> eh <UNK> eh <UNK> br br this must rank amongst the worst movies of all time it's utter drivel for anyone with a <UNK> of a brain sure you have the reviewers on the <UNK> who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell outs are their reviews are too good to give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some b movie <UNK> appeal would be a glowing review calling this a great movie <UNK> the hands of the corporate <UNK> br br but enough of that br br this movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being so bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at the old japanese 60's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked at least in those 60's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships how the models <UNK> on the strings and how the flames <UNK> <UNK> out of the back those movies made fun of how bad they were alien express aka dead <UNK> seems to actually think of itself as a good movie which makes it incredibly absurd br br the effects were awful by today's standards beyond awful however not quite as bad as the 60's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal the plot and dialogue were about as <UNK> as i've ever seen made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect i won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one it just wouldn't be fair to this <UNK> plot plus it would take to long to even get started most of the acting was awful lou diamond phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one br br scifi channel is rapidly becoming the cheap thrills channel producing movie after movie without an <UNK> of concept or intelligence in the lot i can only wonder why bother br br don't bother with this tripe it doesn't get any worse
<START> ok it's a piece of historical film making that caused an <UNK> shocked people and was banned i'll give it that which is why i gave it a 3 rather than a 1 it may have been ahead of the times but it's certainly way behind the times now i am a big fan of <UNK> <UNK> and i loved un <UNK> <UNK> that short was captivating with one creative scene after another <UNK> <UNK> was way too long and dull just a self indulgent piece of pompous film making created simply as a feeble attempt to try to out do un <UNK> <UNK> by creating a full length movie and shamelessly <UNK> name and fame even though he had little to do with it total junk except for a very few shots of shocking scenes separated by long stretches of boring non action a waste of time and money both of my thumbs are down way down it'll go onto my shelf never to be watched again
<START> sarah plain and winters end was the best movie i have ever seen the person in the story that i liked best had to be cassie played by emily <UNK> just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind for example when anna calls from town cassie wants to answer and she says hello anna guess what grand father was lost but hes back now and he is not a good man i loved all of the sarah plain and tall movies for my rating i think sarah plain and tall was 3 was 2 winters end was 1 if i could live in any family from the past it would have to be the family i think there are so many good parts in this movie i can't name all of them i think they picked the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past i would highly highly highly recommend sarah plain and winters end
<START> in a up and down career with all sorts of movies this is altman's one try at science fiction and it clearly shows that it's not his <UNK> br br the film is practically incomprehensible it seems a disastrous combination of experimental theater <UNK> and a major studio trying to jump on the post star wars <UNK> not that this film is at all <UNK> after that one but you can imagine that the studio signed on hoping for a much different paul newman sci fi film the story is nonexistent the characters remain strangers to us all the way through br br altman has packs of dogs feeding on dead bodies throughout the movie obviously <UNK> to make some sort of point but since the movie is so poorly thought out starting with the lack of plot on up it really isn't about anything at all br br the production designed is confused the photography is <UNK> by the <UNK> on the edges and the score is terrible however <UNK> does have one redeeming feature not only is the movie clearly filmed out in the snow and ice but the interiors are kept cold as well you see the actors' breath in every scene you really feel the cold
<START> if you are in search of a <UNK> thrill rent this movie and show it to a group of your friends sober this movie is just plane lame but there not completely without value the brief tits are nice and there is one <UNK> death that is funny as hell other than that this is straight garbage but it is still better than grim or
<START> hmm is it right to compare <UNK> <UNK> and mark paul post saved by the bell acting of course it's not right it's ridiculous and is right to give this movie a <UNK> rating that's funny this movie wasn't so horrible though better than i expected it to be made for tv movies are often so so so similar so many of them have the same feel to them this one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b in the end story before it started i had <UNK> ms <UNK> as a <UNK> type <UNK> <UNK> but here she was as innocent as kelly which was refreshing eric close surprised me by playing his part really well with some decent writing the director got a pretty good convincing performance out of him without being at all cheesy all in all it was somewhat interesting definitely better than most tv movies my grade b
<START> i've seen jimmy stewart in all the regular roles but the spirit of st louis was reported to be one of his favorites a poor box office performer when released this film has been largely forgotten today telling the well known story of <UNK> famous flight in <UNK> stewart seems to be badly miss cast at first and his well known voice never lets you forget who you're watching it feels like george <UNK> all over again but stewart obviously worked hard on the role and he does everything right so before long you don't care anymore that stewart was 20 years older than the man he's portraying stewart's <UNK> is so gosh darn all american apple pie likable that you get caught up in the story and you realize that stewart intended to portray <UNK> with all of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> know how he could <UNK> up <UNK> was an almost mythical hero in the u s and stewart seems determined to keep up appearances br br flash backs are cleverly used to keep what is really a rather dull story moving along and i was struck by the subtle references to faith that were scattered through the film <UNK> trying to teach a hopeless priest how to fly only to be confronted by the priest on his beliefs or <UNK> <UNK> to carry a <UNK> st christopher <UNK> to save weight on the plane only to find the <UNK> hidden in his lunch bag after he'd crossed the atlantic for me this is a film not about a man's epic journey into the unknown but his realization that this life is much bigger than the things we can see and feel
<START> peter <UNK> was the only name that i <UNK> from the cast list so i wasn't too keen on watching this film the only comment on imdb was positive so i watched it on late night t v i would recommend this movie as a good late night viewing it's better than a lot of this genre the plot is excellent the acting isn't brilliant but it's not bad i don't usually like flashbacks but in this film they work as i've stated i didn't <UNK> any of the cast by name but i <UNK> <UNK> lee who gave a decent hard working performance as the woman wanting to stand by her man who is lying to her was it <UNK> landing anyhow she's wearing really well note you may enjoy it more if you miss the first few seconds of the credits i did and it helped me when you see the end credits you'll get what i mean the wayne kennedy character who is really weird takes this to a 7 rather than a 6
<START> why does the poster artwork say <UNK> is one of the best uk indie films i have seen in a very long time screen international when it was a quote of the french <UNK> reported by screen international an influential film trade <UNK> see www com which reads br br pretty pictures has acquired all french speaking rights to neil <UNK> <UNK> james president of pretty pictures said <UNK> is one of the best uk indie films i have seen in a very long time br br isn't this rather misleading the <UNK> is bound to say it's good are the other quotes real
<START> physical evidence is one of those films that you want to like but really should be a lot better than it actually is developed as a sequel to <UNK> edge for glenn close and robert <UNK> it gives the impression that all involved only made it while they were waiting for something better to come along the premise is perfectly <UNK> it's mostly technically efficient if horribly uninspired with even henry <UNK> score surprisingly pleasant but you can't help feeling that things would have turned out better if one of the leads had turned out to be the killer as is <UNK> was originally the case as the opening scene of his little seen personally disastrous heat 1986 showed reynolds has all the <UNK> of a great screen villain as is there are few surprises and a feeling of half hearted filming by numbers as it builds up a head of as it <UNK> towards a less than grand will this do finale br br reynolds is fine <UNK> through on charisma in what is clearly a star vehicle unfortunately the same cannot be said of <UNK> russell an impressive and <UNK> actress in husband <UNK> <UNK> films which allow her to delve into the darker side of human nature she's trapped in a part that requires star quality rather than depth and she ain't got it in <UNK> she doesn't fluff her lines or <UNK> into the other actors but that's about all that can be said in favour of her astonishingly stilted and often amateurish performance that lets the film down badly aside from ned <UNK> <UNK> the supporting cast add only a slightly surreal presence in a boston where everyone seems to have a badly disguised canadian accent and the streets bear a startling resemblance to toronto and <UNK> br br likewise director michael <UNK> who in <UNK> coma and the first great train robbery showed that he knew how to lean an audience to the edge of their seats seems to handle the action in a purely <UNK> fashion indeed in one brief chase the shots don't even match and seem thrown together almost <UNK> the climax itself has no flair and is completely <UNK> of threat or danger and many scenes are played for far less than they are worth it's no great surprise that aside from uncredited <UNK> on the 13th warrior <UNK> hasn't directed since br br its watchable enough in an 80s tv movie sort of way even if it never lives up to the promise of its opening whether that's enough of a reason to see it is down to individual taste
<START> this is a really sad and touching movie it deals with the subject of child abuse it's really sad but mostly a true story because it happens everyday <UNK> wood and joseph play the two children or <UNK> <UNK> a single mother who just tries to make a home for them while living with her parents a man who likes to be called the king comes into their life he hits the youngest boy bobby but the two brothers <UNK> not to tell their mother but finally she finds out after the bobby is hurt badly the end kind of ruined it for me because it is so totally unbelievable but except for that i love the movie
<START> one more classic performance by and his team they can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals for it has got everything that needs to name it as an all time classic the war and its <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the movie all about but the scenes and circumstances will surely be not the one that you will expect no wonder he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity for the role he plays and it needs real to act as a father for three kids when he is considered as a dream boy with a glamorous personality in the industry music by <UNK> <UNK> makes the movie a special one for those who love <UNK> above all the story and the way it is told makes it as the best movie in the recent times
<START> one of the best silent dramas i've seen as dark and shadowy as anything the german produced but featuring performances that were quite understated and <UNK> for the day no camera <UNK> and no unintentional laughs due to wild eyed arm waving <UNK> gave a convincing performance as the drunken mean spirited and frightening david <UNK> br br set mostly at night in a <UNK> swedish <UNK> the film had a very claustrophobic set bound feel to it aided by the low key lighting and extensive use of br br there was a deep and typically <UNK> sense of despair and <UNK> to the narrative the film begins in a rather grim present and then we're told david <UNK> story in a series of flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks a pretty complex story structure for <UNK> where his character is offered numerous chances at redemption but he doesn't take them and we know he won't take them because we've seen him die drunk and wretched and mean as ever in the present the <UNK> scene is as dark as any i have seen in all of cinema br br the writing and directing is tight and intelligent even by today's standards in several instances <UNK> sets the audience up to suspect one thing and then pulls out a surprise the ending might not be such a surprise to some viewers but i didn't see it coming br br this movie deserves a full <UNK> and dvd release or even a crappy budget release it just needs to be out there so people can see and appreciate it br br 9 5 10 which rounds up to 10 10
<START> i just have to say that this was the third worst movie i have ever seen right after the attack of the murder 3 and starship troopers 2 it wasn't just dialogs or the paper walls or even the guns shots which just disappeared with no holes in the walls it was the horrible acting no wonder that i have never seen these actors before they all probably slept with the director s i think <UNK> being nice to this movie now but that is only because <UNK> to tired from screaming at the movie just saw it my advice is to buy as many dvd's of this movie as you possibly can and burn it so no one ever can see this horrible waste of time money and film ever again
<START> <UNK> cruelty has to be one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen still it's extremely grim and gory at times so fans of politically correct mainstream horror garbage shouldn't bother the film mixes many wonderful visuals with plenty of sleaze and gore it is extremely odd vicious and disturbing so fans of bizarre cinema won't be disappointed my favourite segment from <UNK> cruelty is human <UNK> which shows us a twisted relationship between a young man and his pregnant sister the <UNK> scene is particularly nasty and not easily forgotten the last segment right brain <UNK> has to be seen to be believed it's incredibly harsh and <UNK> with scenes of <UNK> <UNK> and grisly torture we see jesus christ captured by three naked females who <UNK> him ripping flesh from his chest <UNK> a wound on his <UNK> and <UNK> on him there is also a jesus statue with a projection of a <UNK> on it <UNK> cruelty is a truly memorable film that should be seen by fans of extreme cinema check it out
<START> i just watched <UNK> <UNK> return to <UNK> <UNK> streets of and dead man's walk all excellent this sorry hunk of junk is cheaply done and poorly acted br br in the previous series captain call and gus come off as tough respectable <UNK> despite the fact that <UNK> call is played by a different actor every time each one quickly won me over in dead man's walk the boys are believable as the younger versions of the experienced texas rangers in <UNK> moon they are just a couple of <UNK> <UNK> i had to stop watching br br i suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this <UNK> pile it's a sorry end to an otherwise great franchise
<START> i'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do i'm pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is i'm also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie because i'll be here for ages if i do the storyline is typical and the special effects are below today's standards this is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff as most of us here are little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience if your a casual movie watcher who likes to have a good time when they are watching a flick then this movie is perfect for you lots of fun it would also be a good movie to take a partner to just not for us movie <UNK> br br 5 out of 10
<START> i just saw it at an advance screening i haven't read the book but heard many good things about it br br the movie was absolutely fantastic very moving with a roller coaster of emotions you totally connect with the characters shaun was great it was a complete departure from his usual roles and his acting for those who understand <UNK> <UNK> was incredible br br one thing to notes it that actually loved the film which is unusual for book adaptation movies even after seeing the movie several times he was <UNK> br br also the animation from the intro was exquisite with names displayed as if it were <UNK> <UNK> very unique at times the translation was not clearly conveying the message <UNK> but all in all this was a great movie
<START> head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars the <UNK> and victor mature or its director co writer bob but also its other co writer and brief cameo jack nicholson as it stands most of them seem to <UNK> it and to <UNK> the movie is regarded at best as a <UNK> br br while the t v series was <UNK> based on the antics of the <UNK> ' this film is also judged by the same <UNK> yet far from the trite and painfully overrated beatles films and even the dated <UNK> t v series head has a <UNK> of depth an <UNK> of man's darker nature is at work here and while that may sound like a bizarre thing to say about a <UNK> pop band the use of certain themes and images hitting women laughing at <UNK> and real life footage of a <UNK> <UNK> shot dead at point blank range give the film an edge that many films would not dare to <UNK> to br br there are also the fun moments which range from james bond parodies to <UNK> and my personal favourite mickey <UNK> under by arab soldiers on <UNK> one of them turns to mickey and <UNK> ' only for the ' to appear in subtitles the group are aware of their <UNK> image in the film <UNK> the <UNK> i'm always the claims neatly <UNK> up his one dimensional foil role of the series meaning that their characters  they play acting and not acting here  are opened out more and consequently are less generic and irritating than they were in the series this level of parody and self awareness even takes on their <UNK> four origins with <UNK> takes on the <UNK> and out and out <UNK> with a waitress who asks <UNK> if it isn't god's gift to the eight year are you still paying tribute to <UNK> <UNK> ' also listen out for <UNK> fields <UNK> while in the bathroom br br then there are the songs of course six of them here slightly more psychedelic than usual which may have <UNK> their <UNK> and even a frank <UNK> cameo wouldn't have turned on an adult audience to their charms at this point probably the best is the charming <UNK> we go though the first a carol king penned <UNK> interestingly talks of the desire to live while time is <UNK> away and death gets ever <UNK> on a lighter note its <UNK> of 'the is seems to be a direct mickey take of 'i am the br br constantly inventive with direct references to silent film and drug culture perhaps <UNK> finest feature is its narrative structure not the only  but the most important  reason why it <UNK> with multiple viewings the story goes left right <UNK> backwards <UNK> and through several levels of reality in essence a series of sketches hung loosely together its <UNK> is <UNK> by the space time <UNK> plot which hangs its internal logic together by means of flashback dream sequence prison of the mind and remote control channel <UNK> br br with a perfect beginning and end this intelligently written knowing film was not what the pre teen audience was expecting and subsequently suffered a negative critical reception now those expectations have gone this one is in dire need of serious
<START> having just finished reading the book one of a kind a week ago i was thinking this would make a great movie especially now when people know a little about poker and poker players i was totally shocked to find it while <UNK> at the video store last night i had no idea someone had actually turned this into a film i grabbed it immediately and watched with much anticipation what a major letdown br br all of the intriguing things about <UNK> <UNK> were <UNK> over quickly and instead i was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody <UNK> may have been a burnt out jerk but he was also a brilliant <UNK> that could read people <UNK> that is what made him so fascinating why not focus on that br br and talk about <UNK> down the real truth this guy was excessive about absolutely everything drugs women gambling <UNK> sleep <UNK> he <UNK> on sporting events from <UNK> to dawn he would go missing for days while hanging out in crack <UNK> his body was <UNK> <UNK> and yet if he ever needed money he could always beat just about anyone at will playing cards now that's a story br br too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships although his ties with vincent and his daughter were hardly touched on and hardly anything about his drugs use which was <UNK> his insane gambling and his incredible card playing abilities br br probably too late now but i hope someone remakes this film properly i had no problem with <UNK> he is excellent the script just left him with nothing interesting to say
<START> hello hello and goodbye but before i go i want to talk to you i just want to quickly mention a few keys points about this film the first being <UNK> especially <UNK> <UNK> br br yes well let us begin when a man and a man love each other very much they <UNK> together in a spectacular not to mention tender explosion of cinema which we call <UNK> of <UNK> br br the <UNK> erotic love was sensual at worse and even more sensual at best it was hardcore and emotional it touched me <UNK> and i'm pretty sure i touched it back and when no one was looking i touched myself a little too br br i laughed because was denied she was second in line to our friend the <UNK> erotic love oh antonio <UNK> just toni i love you more than you loved that guy <UNK> name may or may not have contained an b he was well ugly br br <UNK> was very <UNK> he <UNK> his body in an of his own hair grease and sensual <UNK> and proceed to <UNK> the and present himself to the guy with the name i like the movie in conclusion go see the movie if not for the <UNK> erotic <UNK> for the love of a man such as <UNK> just toni
<START> i just saw this on cable i liked it it held my interest and the dramatic choices were good the old couple were very good and good at being subtly creepy the cinematography is not so great but the <UNK> video also adds to the sense of realism so its a trade off you know at times the girl would hit the new england accent to hard the accent would sort of come and go anyway i thought the film was well done overall though the storyline was strong and dramatic tension was held because you felt their was some subtle mystery going on even though things seemed mundane good job on a low budget another good <UNK> purchase filmmaker way to go
<START> this one kind of is like an earlier movie from 1987 masters of the universe based on the cartoon he man basically you have a great old world and they for some reason have to have nearly all the action of the movie take place on modern earth well i guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an ancient world now of <UNK> and a <UNK> of good times gone by well i guess i can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie to save money on costumes and sets it is a lot easier to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of in he man or an ancient world with <UNK> and strange <UNK> sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death this movie is forgettable and not very entertaining your first clue that it is not going to be the best movie in the world is that robert <UNK> is in it the only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last marc singer is back and it is sad to seem him in this state the guy was a fairly good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one and even if it did it came five years to late
<START> one of the best and most inspirational movies about a different culture i've seen in years tragic and touching worth the watch maybe a few times we all know how brutal children can be i know from my own and my brothers experiences as children and this movie hit the nail on the head perfectly the <UNK> running is amazing and i need to do research on the <UNK> of that event even though it is done in cgi it is still amazing and very interesting to <UNK> a <UNK> like that with a single string seems impossible but they make it believable anyway this movie has many twists and turns that are i'm sure to many probably easy to figure out but they hit me before i could which makes a great movie for me when you figure out the whole movie in the first 10 minutes it kind of ruins it but this one does it so smoothly that it's hard to guess it even when it happens i'm a guy and i don't mind saying that the tears were flowing at more than one point in this movie
<START> go get your camcorder your little brother and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws <UNK> water on <UNK> and you got yourself a film well that's what these guys thought anyway it was so bad i can't even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who <UNK> in <UNK> despite the really corny title the horrible quality the terrible actors and the cliché writing i think this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen i'm saving that <UNK> for everything with steven seagal chuck norris and jean claude van <UNK> anyhow if you are out of <UNK> when it comes to finding new horror films that you haven't seen 1 000 times already as i was and you are <UNK> this one i would still skip this it had absolutely no redeeming qualities this mock serial killer thriller was a weak <UNK> attempt at an even b film if they're really lucky it might make the wal mart 4 50 bin but i highly doubt it
<START> although unusually in colour for a second string <UNK> the vivid clothes of the lead females fails to bring any life to the <UNK> directed screenplay the plot revolves around the <UNK> newly released on <UNK> attempting to go straight but being pursued by a vengeful ex <UNK> man a scenery chewing fred clark and a femme fatale determined to involve them in her bank robbery schemes whether they want to or not as cole younger wayne morris is big and hunky enough but his cool <UNK> and wooden acting skills <UNK> things the standard of action is frankly no better than a gene <UNK> or roy rogers tv episode with <UNK> that never need <UNK> and uncanny shooting skills that allow a horse rider to shoot from the hip and wound a man from at least 50 feet oh dear
<START> i watched this film in the theater in along with 3 other americans and our friend from <UNK> and we all thought this was a waste of time we would have much rather spent an extra hour to watch vapid dialog of star wars iii that was playing down the hall than all of this br br opening with one of the worst jokes i've ever seen committed to celluloid on the big screen it did not take off with a bang throughout the movie we got the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard the writers thought about the setup so much that you could see the joke coming 2 minutes beforehand then when it came it was so lackluster that you couldn't even smile i <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a prime example br br the plot itself makes for some interesting thoughts in my mind which entertained me much more than what was going on on the screen i think a lot more could have been done with that angle the two different worlds the fish out of water experience of the characters the confusion and surprise as people try to comprehend and <UNK> the characters and writers from each other but too much time is wasted with pushing this painful plot to the end with as much and <UNK> as is <UNK> possible br br and to say the <UNK> century characters show any extra talent from the writers is an insult to intelligent writers and <UNK> who possibly could have made this film a worthy 40 minute <UNK> but no its a full length torture film of <UNK> br br as we were leaving the theater which had very little laughing inside it i <UNK> the young hip <UNK> clash british couple behind me saying that was rather good wasn't it you never really knew what was coming next and the girl <UNK> yeah quite surprising and that was it if this is what is meant to get out of british people from watching a comedy no laughing for 90 minutes but a <UNK> bit of communication between two lovers at the end then this film succeeded but i have more belief in british life than that br br i've not not laughed so hard at a comedy film since american pie ii
<START> when i was 10 currently 14 i <UNK> to never see a movie that i knew would not have a happy ending and until a few weeks ago i had done pretty well except for <UNK> for english class etc i was still only watching things that ended happy but then i saw <UNK> in nights which was cute not good but entertaining enough to watch after seeing this a few times over the two or so years since i first saw it i grew to like it especially the music so i did a search on her and found imdb i saw inside i'm dancing and assumed she had done another dancing movie and over looked it it was later on an image search of <UNK> looking for <UNK> girls poster for locker i picked up an image from this movie i then searched for a trailer i found the trailer and when i saw the hospital and heard <UNK> say you've got the future i remembered my <UNK> and realized this would not be a good movie for me but it just stayed in the back of my mind until we were at the video store and there it was for 5 used so i went ahead and bought it after seeing it i just wanted it out of my head because it was so sad i still wouldn't go near it until i had cerebral <UNK> as a word then i just had to see it again and this time all i did was laugh even at the saddest parts i no longer felt depressed because i realized that over all this movie was happy and uplifting i love it and it is now one of my favorites i m sure this is the worst comment you have ever read but watch the movie it's worth it
<START> i enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie the first time i saw it when i was 9 is kind of cute for <UNK> in a corny way it reminded me of on sat <UNK> its swedish backdrops make it easy on the eyes don't expect older kids to be interested as the live action animation is way behind the times and most older kids will get bored this is definitely an under 10 age set movie and a nice bit of memories for those of us who were little kids in 1974
<START> i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men <UNK> <UNK> from right out of the air the horror the horror br br as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday <UNK> i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end i didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots i love them now for the unintentional humor br br but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was <UNK> off early in the film i sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well worn formula there are no rules
<START> first of all i do not look down on americans i know lots of people that are intelligent people from the usa but this movie is so utterly bad that i just had to comment on it br br first of all movies are mostly far from the truth this movie is no exception lots of <UNK> are so incredibly false for example the departure of the 2 space ships you see them drop off the full tanks in space just a small distance from each other remember what caused the space <UNK> to explode in the past just a part that came off in here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship what idiot would let 2 <UNK> lift up and do that at the same time second of it is that the russian station is a piece of s crap i hate to bring this up to you but <UNK> nowadays go to russia since their equipment is much more reliable then the space <UNK> is retired and <UNK> uses it just to pay off the bills and there is no better alternative for it and the list of <UNK> goes on and on this is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious and i know half as much as these guys do but the most annoying part read the whole movie is the propaganda and <UNK> crap that u get <UNK> with my god i thought i was looking at a <UNK> business commercial for like an hour the actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with start up fights ignore the police etc etc but when it comes to their love for their country and <UNK> their lives suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it bomb <UNK> maybe i lack the feeling of being a true <UNK> that can sing the national <UNK> backwards in <UNK> whilst riding with george bush behind the <UNK> wheel of a golf <UNK> driving in circles until the <UNK> is empty but this movie was too much for me too handle and when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the american flag out of my i realised that i was glad this movie was finally done i do not know why so much good actors <UNK> in this narrow minded stereotyping propaganda movie but i pity them this represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power as long as uncle sam thinks you are a good <UNK> where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been <UNK> no one cares
<START> sister helen is a superb documentary about a rigid <UNK> foul mouthed bitter <UNK> nun who runs a shelter for <UNK> and in a very <UNK> neighborhood in the south <UNK> all but one of the 21 residents are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> robert the only middle class representative  he had a real job house and even a <UNK>  regrets she died before he could tell her off why br br robert like six of the residents was on <UNK> he complained that helen <UNK> a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didn't cow <UNK> to her in an extras interview he said helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life  her husband and her two boys br br the husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at <UNK> one boy died of a heroin <UNK> and the other was stabbed to death at 15 helen was left with one daughter who she abandoned to run the center the daughter was not pleased she wanted her mom br br what's fascinating is how little helen changed <UNK> it seems she made a huge sea change but after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times once with the directors <UNK> it became clear that helen <UNK> 21 male <UNK> to boss around to replace her three dead males br br helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars but her <UNK> and sharp tongue didn't emerge at age <UNK> living with her must have been extremely difficult even robert says he stayed clean in spite of helen br br the film opens with helen <UNK> <UNK> a man who wants to live at the shelter supposedly she is showing off her street <UNK> another time she <UNK> <UNK> mel her assistant for not bathing for a year then she waves his filthy in the air the film is <UNK> with helen threatening and <UNK> people her signature song is my way her favorite phrase is i'm going to be totally honest with you often people who use such phrases turn out o be the opposite br br the residents are really down and out only robert has any <UNK> skills beyond pushing a <UNK> they all desperately need a roof over their heads and helen since she runs the place on her own has the power to admit or <UNK> whoever she <UNK> she has no <UNK> board to answer to and gets no public funding it is her show br br helen believes in the cookie approach to <UNK> she stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too she blames substance abuse on the drug or booze and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug she's no <UNK> just a <UNK> who <UNK> her hair wears a habit and <UNK> complete power over her <UNK> and stopped drinking br br helen also <UNK> it over her inmates by demanding <UNK> she calls it <UNK> on <UNK> twice major a very solid and respected long term older resident who she trusted failed his <UNK> helen was furious and <UNK> him major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin helen didn't <UNK> and failed to consider a mistake could have been made this was especially <UNK> since she knew major for a long time yet she <UNK> her relationship with him assumed he was a liar and relied completely on the results major eventually discovered the <UNK> in his <UNK> <UNK> showed up as an <UNK> helen never <UNK> <UNK> but supposedly made up with major <UNK> br br helen also had a very <UNK> reputation in her old neighborhood she <UNK> admitted to robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someone's <UNK> the person <UNK> her and certainly deserved to have his her <UNK> <UNK> she was not a nice woman so eventually she decided the only way to keep the travis name her last name alive  since the three male died  was to start the travis center br br for some of the residents it was a great deal they <UNK> with helen and in exchange received a cheap safe sober and structured place to live one however said he preferred jail <UNK> and <UNK> don't all need to be treated like children helen employed old school techniques which have been <UNK> however no one was forced to remain at the center and for some it was definitely a positive experience the travis center is not a treatment center it is a <UNK> for <UNK> and who what to <UNK> out their lives br br to receive the full sister helen experience see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with sister helen and her guests
<START> i only heard about driving lessons through the <UNK> <UNK> and to be honest i didn't know how much i would like it i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised driving lessons is a modest simple film which draws you in right from the start rupert plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly he's definitely one to look out for in the future dame eve <UNK> is played by the fabulous julie <UNK> i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity the highlight of the film for me was rather colourful poem it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely <UNK> in my opinion watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours the scenery was also striking especially the countryside anyone who can call this <UNK> comedy forgettable i strongly disagree with
<START> famous as the british film so bad it had to be given away for free with a newspaper the quality of this sub children's film foundation thriller can be guessed from the <UNK> number of 10 10 votes it gets and the large number of rave reviews from posters with no <UNK> history and no other reviews to their name the <UNK> know what this mean the <UNK> might be <UNK> if they do <UNK> into the waters of this one they won't last long before it drags them under technically inept with the boom mike getting into shot or the <UNK> of the crew visible it just goes on forever in a <UNK> sub <UNK> code on 5 a day way the end is just insulting but don't worry it's not as if you'll get that far
<START> being a bills fan i originally found it annoying that they made a movie about the bills and the losing of four but once i began to watch i felt really connected it was actually nice to see the bills win the <UNK> and i must say that for a tv movie it was actually very well done <UNK> <UNK> as the and jon voight as the old school coach did a very fine job 8 out of 10
<START> this entry doesn't contain a spoiler it doesn't have to the movie is as predictable as the sunrise the element in the first alien movies was the suspense that something could happen this was so in the first two predator movies though less prevalent <UNK> has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore you know people are going to die well duh it is a movie but you know who is going to die and when they are going to die and where they are going to die before it happens the directors should take a lesson from hitchcock who said suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table suspense is a bomb not going off under the table what's the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when if you really really want to watch this movie wait until it comes out on video and then rent it but by no means would i ever buy it
<START> a bad movie but with one reel that is worth <UNK> for most of the film the jokes are bad the songs are bad even w c fields is bad then there is one sequence with bob hope and his movie ex the dialogue is witty and the song a version of thanks for the memories light cynical and delightful who in for this one bit yet it makes the whole thing worth the original 25 cents admission
<START> quite a lot has been said about this film and its landmark importance in <UNK> the language of film if you are interested in film history to truly understand the <UNK> <UNK> brings to the medium you might try viewing <UNK> along side most any film made before it those of d w griffith offer a good contrast it should be allowed that <UNK> was not the only montage <UNK> and the principles of montage editing would likely have been discovered by another given time however even today few directors have approached the skill with which <UNK> created meaning through the combination of images at such an early point in the evolution of the medium br br if you are not interested in that sort of thing <UNK> is still one of the most beautiful and moving films ever made you should see it buy it and it to your chest
<START> maybe i'm alone here but this is a crap show i'm sorry but i was <UNK> in when i found out about <UNK> bill <UNK> which i had no idea came from this show until months later and has honestly since lost its appeal but i gave the show a fair shot spike tries to hard to make himself into something he's not which is to say he tries to be human fox didn't even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the box he came in his sketches try to hard he himself isn't funny and the writers are struggling to write material for a no talent host there is too much good tv out there to waste your time with this show and fox fox we had some good times but you need to get your f ing act together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another me too network
<START> when i saw this movie for the first time i didn't believe my own eyes in front of me there was a great and well done parody of <UNK> see stan laurel <UNK> that way is like to see an excellent <UNK> in action it's a very good parody rich of ideas with a clever and charming stan old and good like <UNK> or the booze up after that
<START> when i first viewed this movie i didn't know the title of it i realized it had chevy chase in it with the same name he had in <UNK> so i had an idea this was <UNK> 2 at the end of the movie when i did find out it was <UNK> 2 i was disappointed they could have done better dan <UNK> i thought was bad the whole story was bad call this movie by another title but don't call it <UNK> 2 you give that great movie a bad name jackie <UNK> daughter when i first saw her looked like his wife how old is this girl <UNK> how about making this movie a little believable i thought chevy chase was good
<START> the best years of our life is often compared to it's a wonderful life they never should be their only <UNK> is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives it is hard to know what value individual life may have how many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century what a <UNK> we have to live with also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years we have <UNK> moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just especially the ones that have been fought recently br br i have been a life long <UNK> i <UNK> all war not long ago i had that position tested it occurred while i was on the <UNK> <UNK> which is <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> texas the ship required a crew that is 3 or the community in which i live it is a powerful experience moving around on her <UNK> she had seen a great deal of action someone granted me the right to be a <UNK> and it was not cheaply bought br br i cannot watch the best years of our life without thinking about things like the <UNK> br br each of the three veterans paid their <UNK> and they paid mine as well br br no one of them got off any easier than any other the navy air force and army paid equally although in different ways each had problems directly related to the war and each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties it took more courage to face their <UNK> surroundings than it did to deal with war because each had to do it on his own each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others ultimately no one could help br br the moving part of the film this could be the beginning part of the spoiler is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice the obvious case is when <UNK> told <UNK> to marry the girl don't hesitate do it tomorrow it is hard for harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war but to his credit harold <UNK> br br the other is when al tells <UNK> to stay away from his daughter the meaning was clear <UNK> your relationship with your wife  standard fair for 30's 40's films <UNK> did not debate the point he felt he was not fit for <UNK> daughter so he agreed the truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about <UNK> real emotions from real people i think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor i sometimes think we believe these values do not exist that's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems br br al is not free of advice he does not totally want any time his boss talks to him al gets tied in <UNK> and rightly so there are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of <UNK> they must be judged by huge general and only someone tested by the <UNK> of life would understand what those are br br all of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so <UNK> are stripped <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and soon to be recycled their function worth and pride as <UNK> as <UNK> himself he can overcome that which he does making him fit in his mind for the woman he loves br br i gave the best years of our lives a 10 and there are few films i feel that way about this is not a film for popcorn it deserves our attention we are very <UNK> to <UNK> drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people we ought to be careful that we don't abuse that <UNK>
<START> my wife invited my son and i to watch this on cable tv on a lazy saturday evening thinking that it might show an unusual role for juliette lewis on this promise at least the movie delivers her character is <UNK> <UNK> to nearly every slasher type horror movie cliche as does the movie a <UNK> of its studied <UNK> to them would be an exercise in recall of something i hope to quickly forget so i won't make one basically this is a <UNK> heavy on the red herrings everybody appears guilty rather than just the two one suspects from the beginning the rule out the logical and obvious and what's left is it rule of bad horror movies works well on this one the only surprise to have any impact on me was its final of the <UNK> ending cliche will jane keep her <UNK> with her attempted <UNK> who will tell her the obvious to the audience identity of the 2nd <UNK> <UNK> her into another round of hysterical victim play mercifully i will never know
<START> another direct to video movie from disney that is essentially perfect for the kids the problem with new groove i find is that everything that made the first movie a fun great ride is replaced with a more sad and <UNK> film in this movie learns a great deal of lessons at many <UNK> <UNK> it takes away much time that could be spent at creating a more enjoyable film br br new groove deals with two stories returns for <UNK> and one ms hopes to defeat camp <UNK> championship this all leads up to confronting his father and his <UNK> over his son's direction in life br br from lord of the rings to michael jackson's thriller new groove <UNK> every bit of time that it allows to entertain its viewers if you loved the original or are looking forward to the upcoming tv series about i recommend to his loyal fans
<START> i was just looking up who will love my children to buy when i came across this web site and an entry made by a fellow <UNK> i am a great fan of this movie and would and have recommended it to all what i found <UNK> is to find someone else who also finds comfort in the good will of others i also have a son with amongst other things and it is also a fear of mine to think if anything ever happened to me and my husband that someone would not only want to take on just my beautiful <UNK> daughter but my special and gifted son also missing home and being able to relate to people raised with the same values as myself has more meaning than you know living here in the us i have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie so to all of you reading this if you have not seen it make an effort to do so it is a very moving experience especially for anyone who is a parent or even if you just have a sympathetic bone in your body you will cry and beg after that you will count your <UNK> and to anyone who has ever been through an experience like or close to this one my heart goes out to you it makes me realize no matter how hard or <UNK> thing get just remind yourself that there is always someone worse off than you an amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story do not be put off by how sad it is at the same time this movie is heart warming and makes you feel encouraged about the strength and goodness of mankind
<START> an odd <UNK> of light <UNK> the bedroom of dr craig burton arnold <UNK> and his wife <UNK> <UNK> as they are making love about two hours are <UNK> for as they embrace seemingly <UNK> under <UNK> during a session with psychiatrist dr susan <UNK> lindsay <UNK> craig discovers that his wife was <UNK> by aliens <UNK> <UNK> this notion as absurd and is quite happy to <UNK> news to her husband that she is indeed pregnant <UNK> after their trying for ages to get pregnant <UNK> is frightened at <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> not being his this <UNK> from a check on his low <UNK> count with odds especially high that he could in no way have <UNK> his wife awkward <UNK> experiences with the <UNK> inside her leads <UNK> to some scary <UNK> her doctor david <UNK> <UNK> finds that the ultra sound gives some unusual results of the developing <UNK> appearance but it's craig who notices that it resembles an alien sparks <UNK> cutting out the <UNK> equipment even <UNK> off through <UNK> <UNK> reveals the experience of her <UNK> but <UNK> believes her problem is psychological not <UNK> with no one believing his wife's alien <UNK> theory craig turns to dr bert brad <UNK> whose work is in the studies of alien life and <UNK> but bert is reluctant to help craig who will go to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible harm tragic results occur as <UNK> and others try to keep craig from his goals of cutting the thing out believing he is mad craig will still pursue his task trying to drag bert down this path with him br br grim absorbing horror tale about one man's struggle to save his wife from the harm of beings no one else believes exist thankfully <UNK> character isn't some <UNK> <UNK> but an intelligent doctor who wishes to learn more but his pursuit of the truth of aliens isn't hostile he does hope to learn from <UNK> but isn't incredibly demanding in this goal the story is told realistically it's easy to understand why others might <UNK> craig off his rocker <UNK> doesn't take the character too far but expresses the distress of his current situation how can he save his wife from this <UNK> and prove to others that he's not nuts deserves credit for the demands of the difficult <UNK> scenes where her unfortunate character is naked on this table being and <UNK> by these things <UNK> is fine in her limited but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where her <UNK> seem out of control psychologically the monster effects are <UNK> and effective i think the film works quite well and director <UNK> deserves credit for <UNK> himself for this film at least the final twenty minutes as craig tries to perform his <UNK> surgery with a scared bert watching the crazy situation <UNK> is nail biting br br you know fans of fire in the sky might dig this flick
<START> the <UNK> sexy <UNK> plays charlotte <UNK> a new nurse at one of those movie type <UNK> where the doctor in charge has his own <UNK> ways of treating the inmates reluctantly bringing her on board is the <UNK> dr masters anne <UNK> a k a <UNK> the inmates don't take too kindly to charlotte either br br part mystery part horror this initial effort from b movie director s f has an oppressive feel to it these colorful <UNK> including a <UNK> with no self <UNK> a gentle giant who's already had a <UNK> and a supposed judge who speaks in <UNK> dominate the screen with their unnerving presence br br it's a picture that works fairly well establishing the gritty grim atmosphere right from the get go some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality br br it builds in intensity as the heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity offering one surreal encounter after another particularly effective is the poetry <UNK> <UNK> old mrs br br for cheap 1970's era cheese it's pretty effective with a particularly nasty climax i had a pretty good time watching it br br 7 10
<START> <UNK> morgana is by far one of the <UNK> and most <UNK> art films i have ever seen i hesitate to call it a documentary because while is does have elements of <UNK> of it's images the images themselves are so unusual so <UNK> so unclear that i wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist the film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an <UNK> be it alien or something otherwise <UNK> all taking place in the <UNK> desert the title of the picture relates to the illusion or reflection of images both real and that people in the desert often witness these are also known as <UNK> br br the film opens with a plane landing followed by the plane landing again and then again and again and again and again and again and again with each plane landing shot the actual architecture of both the location it is landing at and the plane itself begin to slowly <UNK> into one another and grow less and less real and more and more <UNK> imagery the imagery in this film only grows more intense and more unusual as the picture continues the narration of the film tells of the creation of the universe as <UNK> sexual images of sand and landscape move past the camera the shots go further and further into the desert and <UNK> films whatever he sees and finds the strangest <UNK> of the world are on display in the distance while <UNK> meets some of the most pure and <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> that you are ever likely to see when the leonard cohen soundtrack kicks in you can be sure that you are in the world of a mad man who is in love with the universe br br i cannot say too much more about this film without ruining anything but i will say that it is a <UNK> experience and there's really nothing like it i love seeing films that are just in classes of their own this film certainly is a good example of how <UNK> loves to <UNK> narrative storytelling and documentary film making into an <UNK> form <UNK> morgana unfortunately does <UNK> it's welcome just a bit but by the time it <UNK> it's end the images will most likely be burned into your mind forever definitely a must see for those who are obsessed with the nature and the origin of the universe
<START> this movie has everything typical horror movies lack although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man <UNK> the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for dare i say oscar winner this is a perfect date movie i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person
<START> a more detailed review can be <UNK> anywhere else in the web this one is a good portrayal although i do not agree with it entirely is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only br br ram <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seems like a political party has created a marvel in <UNK> so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts i'm not even going to compare <UNK> and both are good the former has better acting talent although the latter is catching up nicely br br anyways i like character she is true to her art not touched by any unnecessary emotion and definitely not too practical she is a dance scientist actually she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would offend her hey donald <UNK> maybe you gotta <UNK> <UNK> here is and you've already built a <UNK> <UNK> ain't this easy <UNK> on the other hand is a practical fellow who wants money power fame etc hence these two albeit were struggling to get a break into the film industry cannot get along given their different styles and approach to life this is very typical but what i like about the movie is that it says what an <UNK> would say in its total runtime in one scene what's new this movie takes a different angle to the film industry and how different people get into it there is always something different about <UNK> movies this one is different too it is way too slow for his standards in parts it drags one almost to sleep br br noticeable it is tough to notice anything other than in the first half of the movie i think this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved also looks like is a pro in <UNK> she is way too <UNK> almost like a <UNK> <UNK> baby is <UNK> as an actor with every movie i am sure his blood is paying off rich <UNK> the title song was really good the music overall was above average
<START> an stunning look at the ocean and the life in it br br the good br br the camera work was absolutely phenomenal every shot is done beautifully br br it was interesting seeing all the different animals that i could have never even imagined br br david attenborough has the perfect <UNK> voice no one could have done any better br br the bad br br there were one or two different times where there was a reference to the earth being 1 million years old i hold a different belief br br overall a tv series anyone can enjoy i highly recommend buying it 10 10 stars
<START> oh boy where do i begin on this piece of <UNK> this is one of the few real high budget films on my list that i've actually seen fit to give a 1 rating and that's not for the production values which are pretty high this movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the bible and treats the whole story as laughable fantasy i could not recommend it to anyone except to see how low as a society we have become br br for the first thing <UNK> was absolutely not friends with lot anyone who actually read <UNK> could tell you that was who they were thinking of the writers were just trying to pad out the story with the whole subplot and it seems out of place because it is <UNK> is treated as a <UNK> <UNK> you were kissing you were kissing but at least it's a step up from <UNK> hilarious overacting in <UNK> br br however these <UNK> pale in comparison to the <UNK> treatment of god in this movie god is portrayed as a petty being who changes his mind at the slightest <UNK> i'm one eternal perfect but i can be wrong what where are they getting this from this kind of god no one should ever pay any attention to much less worship praise or love what the director's saying in this i do not claim to know i just know that a responsible treatment of <UNK> <UNK> should not take such an easy way out shame on these people
<START> this movie was poorly conceived poorly written and poorly acted all of the characters were two dimensional it was a real amateur attempt the movie was <UNK> christian propaganda the christian characters are <UNK> than <UNK> and they are without a shred of compassion for the <UNK> or the <UNK> characters the movie was a real <UNK> for both the <UNK> character and myself as a viewer putting us in a very uncomfortable situation i complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie i remember another movie on a similar subject the rapture starring <UNK> rogers that was much better and <UNK> done i think i'll watch the rapture again if you attend <UNK> and don't like it don't say i haven't warned you
<START> this is one of the best czech movies i have ever seen the director did excellent work there is great camera and the actors are really great i like war movies so i really liked this one i would recommend it to anyone who wants to know something about czech pilots during 2nd world war and their life after the war in communism
<START> paul <UNK> did a great role as the tortured father whose favorite little girl dies <UNK> of disease for that he deserves all the credit however the movie was mostly about exactly that keeping the adventures of <UNK> as he gathered data for his theories as <UNK> stories told to children and skipping completely the <UNK> regarding his ideas br br two things bothered me terribly the soundtrack with its whiny sound practically <UNK> sadness down the throat of the viewer and the movie trailer showing some beautiful <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle against blind faith thus the movie completely br br to put it <UNK> if one were to remove the scenes of the movie trailer from the movie the result would be a non <UNK> family drama about a little child dying and the <UNK> of her parents as a result clearly not what i expected from a movie about <UNK> albeit the movie was beautifully interpreted
<START> the sound is terrible the picture is worse than worse the acting is awful the female leading actress is <UNK> and the story is wait a minute there is no story the plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading if you expect to to see <UNK> you might be disappointed this movie has nothing to do with the <UNK> movies from 1978 and 1981 actually i can only think of one scene involving <UNK> br br the only thing that i liked about this movie besides the fact that it runs for only about 85 minutes is the song at the end it's written and sung by jim <UNK> and it's called love all things that love the sun br br i don't recommend this movie it is so bad it's not even funny to watch i fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and i am the kind of person who watches anything
<START> i've never seen a bollywood film before but i caught the first ten minutes of this laughed myself silly and hit the r button on sky i'm glad i did i hope i don't insult anybody because basically the <UNK> and i loved it but we couldn't take it half as seriously as the actors did especially the obsessed one who i understand is a huge bollywood star because we've seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in the <UNK> keeps on about this bloke i am beginning to think he's obsessed he keeps saying that it's strange for the <UNK> good looking one to be the anti hero of a film but then we do like films that aren't your stock predictable hollywood fare br br it was completely over the top but really good fun if all bollywood films are like this then we're watching more i have had that <UNK> song in my head all week and i can't speak a word of hindi ps any <UNK> would be appreciated
<START> it's always interesting to view a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans experience has taught me that you should never <UNK> fan taste within a genre my expectations of this movie were a great deal higher than my viewed opinion br br children shouldn't play with dead things is a movie with a good intended plot that <UNK> up too many times to carry it out the whole idea of a band of actors staging a of dead corpses had me intrigued however everything <UNK> into cinematic chaos the actors who for the most part were competent and amazingly <UNK> were offered roles that fail to maintain consistent characterization some of these characters go from <UNK> about the whole act of <UNK> a cemetery to <UNK> criticism back to <UNK> it's one thing for characters to have a change heart in the course of the film it's another to produce an overly dynamic <UNK> attitude that <UNK> every ten minutes br br another inconsistent element of this film is the premise does the main protagonist intend for the ceremony to be theatrical prank or does he actually <UNK> with dark spiritual forces to raise the dead even with the aforementioned flaws i would recommend this movie to other horror fans since i believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric <UNK> and be able to ignore the <UNK> <UNK> the scene where the dead rise out of the grave is made extremely haunting even to a veteran zombie <UNK> by the excellent combined use of scenery and sound and the great choice of skilled actors chosen to play the <UNK> dead current filmmakers should learn from about using the proper video and audio techniques in mood development br br all in all if you are zombie movie like me you should take time to locate and view this movie it's a fun watch
<START> during the war for southern independence general <UNK> his forces to defend the local women children against a <UNK> invasion br br in 1936 hal roach decided it was time for his popular our gang kids to branch out into occasional feature length films with the big success of shirley temple in two civil war period movies in <UNK> the little colonel the <UNK> rebel it was only natural that roach would look in that same direction for his gang although given a rather lavish production and distributed by mgm general <UNK> was not a critical or box office success the little gangsters would <UNK> stick to short subjects br br although he's given top billing the title role george <UNK> is <UNK> throughout the film's first half by little <UNK> thomas here were two of the finest young actors to ever appear in american movies with all the experience of old seasoned pros these two <UNK> could steal scenes hearts with equal <UNK> a constant joy without a false note between them they provide the essential reason for watching the film today br br phillips holmes gives a quiet <UNK> performance as <UNK> adult <UNK> nearly forgotten now holmes was a fine actor who died much too soon during world war two <UNK> ralph morgan is especially good as a sympathetic union general his scenes with <UNK> are quite amusing br br other our appear <UNK> into the movie most notably carl <UNK> he gets to <UNK> before the battle mother ' even pretty <UNK> lawrence the <UNK> shows up to play <UNK> beloved br br irving is particularly slimy as a cowardly turned <UNK> <UNK> captain bumbling willie best <UNK> louise <UNK> play miss <UNK> slaves br br it should be noted that there is racism in the film not unusual for hollywood of that era but almost completely missing in the original series of our gang shorts br br fans of 19th century music will enjoy paying attention to the soundtrack which is a long succession of ancient tunes
<START> five fingers of death is a classic of 70's kung fu cinema as the film that broke out hk cinema to the west this is a must see for any serious fan of the genre it's also a damn entertaining film with hard hitting non stop action solid and mostly believable fight choreography and great over the top 70's era dubbing oh i see so you want it the hard way br br five fingers is an eye for an eye revenge tale and i mean literally eye for an eye it's great to see lo <UNK> portraying a hero he played so many great villains later in his career including <UNK> <UNK> in the classic fist of the white <UNK> which was one of the characters tarantino used in creating the <UNK> <UNK> of kill bill br br my only complaint is that i wish there was a better quality dvd mine looks like it was a vhs transfer overall this is a great film don't miss it br br bart film club hollywood <UNK>
<START> when the spirits within was released all you heard from final fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't seem like final fantasy this is a different story for better or worse the familiar settings characters music story and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game the problem is that it just isn't a good movie in its own right br br the direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic but only serving to make the scenes look <UNK> and confusing br br the cg itself is exceptional but i can't say it's the best i've ever seen since spirits within had much more detail on the characters although i must admit that <UNK> children's characters moved much more naturally br br the plot is virtually a black hole it's a giant <UNK> ex <UNK> designed solely to bring back for one last fight old characters <UNK> but serve no real purpose other than to please fans character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the <UNK> end but it's packed with neat looking fight scenes with magic <UNK> and limit breaks which is probably what fans wanted anyway br br in the end <UNK> children is a very flashy but totally brainless action flick that serves more as a side story for final fantasy <UNK> than a real sequel br br by the way don't think you're hurting my feelings by voting not useful it just makes me feel superior knowing that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> my <UNK> so greatly
<START> this is a profound and moving work about the creation of art that which is uniquely human and cannot be produced by nature the cost of genius and the search for <UNK> and what in the end <UNK> family i e all of us i was very much moved by the family discussion that <UNK> had with his sisters about the shortcomings of their father as it was set in a beautiful home that seemed to <UNK> warmth that lou had created and although esther seems so cold in her discussion about <UNK> inability to make money you can appreciate how she at many points in his life must have been a counter weight to his <UNK> <UNK> did a great job of showing how all of the people in <UNK> life fit in and completed it and became as much a part of his work as his own genius yes even or maybe especially our failures make us who we are and of course there are the buildings i had only known lou <UNK> by name and did not really connect his name to his work they are evidence of grace perhaps someday there will be a building where we will all fit and it will certainly resemble a lou <UNK> building perhaps the temple in <UNK> perhaps there is salvation
<START> 2 <UNK> unfunny girls stays a their <UNK> unfunny uncle <UNK> beach house uncle doesn't like party but guess what the <UNK> unfunny girls have a <UNK> you guessed it a <UNK> unfunny beach party if you didn't catch the not so <UNK> message that i'm trying to convey first off you're a moron i would rather watch a nude <UNK> tag team watching match between <UNK> and vs <UNK> <UNK> and jessica <UNK> this movie and i lose the term loosely is just that bad br br my grade f br br eye candy <UNK> novak and charity go topless singer shows breasts and <UNK>
<START> although i saw this movie in korea in korean and therefore did not understand the language images sure say more than enough from what i can make of it this is the story two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king's guard one of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts <UNK> important men the other has to hunt him down this movie is visually great the is great and the movie has a gripping end i just hope this movie will be <UNK> for the western cinema goers and be released on dvd of course
<START> <UNK> is a pretty odd movie albeit slightly watchable richard <UNK> plays an <UNK> who gets suck into a parallel earth <UNK> by mutant <UNK> or something like that the film itself was made with a modest budget which explains the limited locales and the somewhat tedious screenplay that manages to do very little with quite an interesting premise basically a 90 minute episode of the tv show <UNK> and nothing more br br 4 out of 10 br br go to www <UNK> com for a more detailed review and reviews of other films in the genre
<START> this film is so copy cat cliché ridden clumsy and <UNK> i find it astounding that anyone could not feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it br br here is the range of idiotic clichés ridiculous and simply storytelling in this hard hitting representation of high school the tough guy jock is really a homosexual the a student is unhappy because his father pushes him and somehow this causes him to commit incest a teacher is mean to a student who <UNK> his pants in class a girl who is going out with the above mentioned jock is really in love with him and just wants a family br br maybe the only saving grace is the student <UNK> scenes which are vaguely interesting but most of the devices in this film are so <UNK> that it <UNK> belief br br this film shows me no insight into teenagers and i will not be surprised when it bombs especially with teenagers the people who like this film seem to be parents worried about their teenagers and boy are they <UNK> up the wrong tree if they think this film will help with understanding teen issues i mean what is the moral of this film hey guys let's all look out for each other and hug each other give me a break anyone who thinks you can get through to a 14 year old with that kind of message needs to think back in the 1980s we were watching kentucky fried movie <UNK> <UNK> evil dead terminator etc this film will fall on deaf ears br br 2 <UNK> is right up there with another australian film <UNK> perfect day ' which was as bad as this utter turkey of a film thank god no money was spent on this br br avoid
<START> i really love this movie it has a very real feel to it i believe it was never popular because of the subject matter however because of the subject matter it makes the movie all that much more important br br this is an a movie and i recommend it highly if you liked 1984 book or movie i think you will like this one as well br br this is harsh to say the least including mental and physical acts of torture some pretty vile not for the week at heart or stomach no gore but his movie is so great at <UNK> the mental anticipation it doesn't need blood and guts br br if you are not a <UNK> or a person i don't think you will enjoy it it leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans what they're capable of and the very real possibility that our government s does not necessarily have our personal best interest in it's heart
<START> the first half of this film held some promise as it seemed like the film was going to be a low key character <UNK> like the minus man but then the whole thing <UNK> into cliche and the viewer slowly loses all interest there's a decent cast here but the film is lifeless and the talent completely wasted
<START> a proof that it's not necessary for a movie to have a deep many layered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie even if the story could be expanded in many directions especially in more <UNK> way people lust for money it seems that it's perfect just the way it is through many sudden changes it takes the <UNK> to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the <UNK> taking the eyes of the screen br br but the acting for me isn't so good with the exception of lindsey the others were average or even worst in some scenes they just empty <UNK> in front of themselves for exception of lindsey which was more convincing it's a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying br br 7 10
<START> forget some the whiny and pointless comments left here by some this series is well acted well shot and makes a refreshing change to most of the <UNK> on tv br br any fool can <UNK> anything however in this show the characters are believable the story lines intriguing and compelling but do require some intelligence on the part of the viewer overall it's enjoyable and it's british we do occasionally come up with some gems and this is one of them br br the shows are an hour long each and i think there are four of them all together at least i've only seen four of them the show clearly impressed some u s tv station director who made a longer series which was nowhere near as compelling in spite of the bigger budget br br if like <UNK> and reality shows you won't like or understand <UNK> hour
<START> the mtv sci fi animated series <UNK> is brought to life with <UNK> <UNK> playing the title character a freedom fighter who fights <UNK> in the <UNK> city of 400 hundred years into the future for her latest mission she has been sent to kill the city's leader <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but she <UNK> secrets along the way br br <UNK> <UNK> falls under the category of good premise mediocre execution interesting story yet the film was a little dull a lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all it may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best i have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so i can't compare the two it's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more the film is not that confusing but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material the acting was alright nothing special <UNK> <UNK> gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film the rest of the cast also give decent performances including <UNK> lee miller frances and <UNK> <UNK> there are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including friend br br the problem with <UNK> <UNK> is that it takes itself too seriously it carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little <UNK> there's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times this is the same problem that <UNK> had because the film is so serious the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced the action scenes are pretty good but that's not what the film is really about so don't go in expecting just an action movie the twist at the end isn't mind blowing but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year hide and seek the costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting the visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice so the movie may be a case of style over substance interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time in the end it's not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental rating 4 10
<START> if you can watch a bond film from 1983 that isn't as good as <UNK> and still enjoy it br br if you can accept production values which aren't that much above the level of a tv movie br br if you can look at sean connery with <UNK> on his <UNK> beneath an obvious and still see james bond br br if you can get past an inexperienced basinger a weaker <UNK> and a jolly q br br if you can learn to love an <UNK> score not up there with barry on his worst day br br if you don't believe the <UNK> reviews that it was <UNK> with on release br br if you can meet a poker battle and a video game face off and enjoy them both the same br br yours is never say never again and everything that's in it br br and what is more you'll probably enjoy it my son
<START> eddie murphy and richard <UNK> team up in this would be comedy about nightclub owners being <UNK> by organized crime eddie murphy wrote and directed this obnoxious ego trip and therefore has no one to blame but himself for its failure this is a genuinely bad film so completely devoid of energy and humor that it serves only as a example of murphy's contempt for his audience it would be remarkably easy to continue beating up on this movie but i will show it more mercy than it showed its audience and stop now
<START> franco <UNK> stars as cole a ninja who comes to the rescue of his war buddy frank <UNK> alex <UNK> and his <UNK> wife susan george to protect them from a mobster christopher george who wants the land things get even more complicated when the mobster hires <UNK> old nemesis sho <UNK> who is also a ninja inept martial arts <UNK> while having better production values then most ninja movies fails to <UNK> any life into the surroundings or for that matter <UNK> a poor effort all around
<START> in my opinion the directing editing lighting and acting minus franco were very good i must admit i was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film i wasn't expecting much in way of camera angles sound etc but in these areas the film wasn't bad at all br br after seeing the film i personally felt frustrated with both characters because i wanted so badly for these two characters to reach out to one another and i felt like the travis franco character wasn't really affected or changed in the end after <UNK> commits suicide although this is probably due to the lack or inability of james franco to express emotion of any kind very well in this movie i've seen a few of <UNK> other films and to me he just can't pull it off when a scene calls for real emotion or facial expressions the only positive he brings to the film is the possibility of more people watching this movie br br on the other hand rachel <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> was well done and she looks to have a bright future ahead i could really see and feel the sadness and <UNK> in her character and it made me feel for her i only wish i could have seen more into <UNK> life before the film ended br br for a short film this movie was good but it leaves you wanting more in the end i only wish it could have been just a bit longer to see the characters develop a little more in spite of that i hope to see more films from the director and crew in the future
<START> this is at least very close to a perfect video <UNK> <UNK> metal group dinosaurs of rock <UNK> roll biggest and most influential heavy band in the world plays their hit songs and <UNK> <UNK> past what more do we need br br video starts from war pigs and ends to paranoid and in the middle all the greatest and most significant classics of the original line up are included electric funeral sweet <UNK> after forever iron man children of the grave and of course my personal favourite into the void i'm glad they didn't leave it out well how could they br br still this video is more than just the music <UNK> <UNK> tony <UNK> butler and bill ward goes over the <UNK> colorful history only thing that slightly bothers me is when a live song is being interrupted with bits of interview for example is it that necessary to inform how the song n i b got it's name right in the middle of it one on top of the other i doubt it's still a small flaw so it's not too big deal br br band members also around in <UNK> and chat together pleasant material for a <UNK> fan i admit i have difficulties of following what <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> but it's just amusing i had a <UNK> to participate when the last <UNK> tour entered <UNK> and for me personally this video is an ideal way to recall that magnificent show
<START> an arab american man is kidnapped from an american airport and <UNK> to somewhere in north africa where he is tortured the reason his cell phone received a call from a known terrorist the cia decides to avoid legal means to determine whether the phone call is <UNK> of guilt or just a mistake after watching this movie we can only but pray some terrorist doesn't accidentally punch in a wrong number br br in addition to the rendition there are several related side stories one involves the daughter of the chief of <UNK> secret police who is torturing the suspect and her involvement with her lover who happens to be in night school for suicide <UNK> this story is way too contrived but nevertheless intriguing especially when we see it's outcome the director uses a neat time line <UNK> to hook the audience br br the second side story is the attempt by the suspects wife to find out what happened to her missing husband she gets an old lover to help he a muted <UNK> is <UNK> de camp to a senator <UNK> and soon gets cold feet when he realizes that his job isn't worth <UNK> the truth <UNK> is wasted in this role all she gets to do is look <UNK> and pregnant with one brief rage attack streep is good and cold and stereotypical as the <UNK> cia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> official who seems to be a <UNK> clone br br also is wasted as a minor <UNK> pushed into in area he's over his head in although he gets to do the right thing in the end br br i found the movie engrossing if somewhat <UNK> but thought it added little to the subject it is certainly not to be viewed as definitive and it certainly has an axe to <UNK> like the kingdom it <UNK> the surface of a very complicated subject br br the movie tries hard to give us an idea about rendition but can only end up by being a <UNK> tale about one <UNK> one the whole point of rendition is not to torture but to get terror suspects to give <UNK> by avoiding legal therefore <UNK> <UNK> torture for sure may be employed especially if the rendition is out of our hands although we are obviously not in this matter but <UNK> that can save lives is vital in this shadow war
<START> <UNK> is a reporter from a newspaper is set a task to go back to high school as she is going to be 17 again br br as she is there she remembers some really awful stuff thats happened to her the first time she was in <UNK> as we see in flashback scenes br br in the flashback they show that little spoiler <UNK> was kind of a nerd in high school and was picked on a lot and one day the cool guy tells her that he is taking her to the prom only on the prom night as she leaves her house she gets <UNK> by the ass hole and his bitch what a horrible thing to do some will find this hard to watch as it so nasty and it will make you feel <UNK> to <UNK> br br i did not find this movie that funny but there was some really funny stuff in the office scenes a lot more funnier then anything that happened in the school br br this movie did have the perfect happy ending as it did bring tears to my mum and sister eyes the acting in this movie was not outstanding it was good for the most part of the movie there is some poor acting in some parts of the movie br br i going to give this movie 7 out 10
<START> this movie is a great film the movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film driving lessons centers around ben rupert a shy 17 year old who is coming of age the movie goes on about how ben is sick of his <UNK> mother and how he just wants to be himself ben then meets who he makes a very special bond with the two take a journey and in the process ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and share this is the movie that you watch by yourself or with someone else no matter what you will all feel what ben goes through in the movie it is a very heart warming film that just makes you think whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional or as much of a journey as ben's lessons
<START> if you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won't bore you then this is the place it is fast paced and funny with some decent acting from the characters it is always hard for me to see mark as anything except <UNK> mark that image is burned in my mind forever as an actor though he is pretty good this movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns i will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it
<START> i know <UNK> he <UNK> lives in the u s this film is based on events in the lives of both <UNK> and <UNK> it's a remarkable story it inspired me to read cry beloved country the film is well produced the music is beautiful br br the story is told in flashbacks you learn the stories of a white racist south african <UNK> and a black south african <UNK> their lives <UNK> violently the ending is not typical hollywood it's unusually realistic and ends on a note that encourages you to think about the characters and the themes br br be sure to watch through the credits you'll get to see footage of <UNK> in real life

<START> this is probably the best movie filmed in at least the last five years i've always believed that making people cry is far more difficult than making them laugh if you want to see 400 adults crying out loud in the same room go see this movie it's breathtaking <UNK> <UNK> performs the role of his life you will cry you will laugh you will smile the most deserving fact is that in spain everybody knows about <UNK> personally i knew the full story and even the end of it so the excellence of the movie is in the way that the story is told and in this field <UNK> is a the master br br this movie is a must
<START> wallace <UNK> have been around for some time but this was their first <UNK> onto the silver screen fans of the british tv series like myself were eager to see them and the film did quite well in the theaters much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original in a world of cg movies like shrek and toy story this stop motion film is a nice alternative to the trend in children's movies as well as being totally unlike a cartoon plus compared to much earlier stop motion films such as king kong and the ray <UNK> films such as <UNK> the quality and movement of the characters are light years better looking very fluid natural and more alive br br apart from the quality of the animation this movie also deserves kudos on every other level first the voice actors do a great job second the script is very simple but also very cute and enjoyable with a few double <UNK> that should probably go way over the kids' heads third they manage to make this not only a movie for kids but people of all ages as the film is neither <UNK> nor aimed solely at the younger crowd in particular i was captivated by incredibly cute the film was and especially the adorable <UNK> i especially liked them in the closing credits which made me very happy i stayed to watch the entire film br br the bottom line is that unless you are a real stick in the mud you will enjoy this film it's fresh funny and amazingly clever i hope we see a sequel and this is saying something as i usually hate sequels
<START> i just discovered this film and love it just the right mix of fast moving story entertaining characters hilarious moments but not <UNK> with stupid jokes and fun performances by <UNK> <UNK> harry dean <UNK> ron schneider rip torn and more is especially good and i really enjoyed watching the guy who played br br i also find it interesting that they used a real submarine the for the running on top scenes and <UNK> it almost exactly for their sets the set decoration is really impressive if you do a digital tour of the online and then compare it to scenes in the movie they did an excellent job on this film br br what a light entertaining and truly enjoyable movie
<START> this movie just happened to be on hbo yesterday so i watched it this was a mistake i guess i got sucked in and kept watching although it was a lot like a train wreck terrible horrible but somehow you just can't look away i guess br br this is the story of a <UNK> for models on some island in the <UNK> one by one they are all murdered one drinks cleaning fluid one gets blown up on a one goes over a cliff so these are not <UNK> but for some inane reason the police are never called and no one thinks that perhaps they should wrap the shoot and go home not just in respect for the dead but perhaps out of fear for their own lives no they just continue with their shoot because that is what's most important forget about the dead models we have a magazine to produce br br one of the subplots is the evil magazine owner played by lee <UNK> rex is his name he is the most obvious suspect and every time a model gets killed he <UNK> his mustache and says well i can't say this won't be good for sales <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ha ha ha ha so absurd another subplot is when it's revealed that rex is one of the models baby only when he learned of the baby he tried to convince the girl to <UNK> she didn't but always <UNK> him for even suggesting this br br they try to give you false clues and point toward some guy named seemingly because he's the only one with an accent and looks creepy br br at the very end sorry to spoil but this movie came out years ago so if you haven't seen it by now one of the women was found face down dead in the pool this was the last straw vanessa angel forget her characters name comes at rex with a gun they struggle the gun fires and now she's dead too while she's laying on the floor his business associate tells him that with all this bad press the magazine will be worthless and it's all his fault he gets him to sign over the magazine to him once he does <UNK> all the dead models come back to life and you find the entire thing was an elaborate <UNK> to get back at rex br br <UNK> what a ridiculous movie as someone else said if you want to see something like this april fools day is far better
<START> oz is one of the most mind blowing and <UNK> tv experiences ever br br having caught pieces of this on <UNK> i was at first skeptical however having finished now the 4th season i sadly know that that this brilliant show is approaching its end 6 seasons and yet i still can't get enough of oz br br want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit oz fits the bill hands down br br this isn't kid's stuff folks its violent brutal and not pretty why its a experimental unit inside a maximum security prison br br tom <UNK> oz is brilliant in all the right <UNK> the actors the writing and directing br br <UNK> oz site is also highly recommended for <UNK> for info about this series this was the first one hour show produced by hbo and it proves what a master work it is and that others would follow br br thank you hbo
<START> this film is an <UNK> but interesting film i will tell you why it is <UNK> later in this review br br the film is interesting because it was the first film to ever contain sound no it may not be a one hour and forty two minute film no it may not contain great action scenes but it is still a wonderful film to me it <UNK> a whole knew revolution if you will of sound movies this can be a little <UNK> to watch knowing that everyone in that film are now dead i can hear the voice of a man in the beginning who no longer walks the earth visible and that the sound is and broken br br i recommend this video for everyone to watch this created movies as we know it today
<START> an ex <UNK> of the east germany finishes in mexico like spy of a student group in 1971 in where she falls in love with one of the <UNK> this is the first co production of mexico with germany and although it is a good picture of the ideals that marked and continue <UNK> at least to the youth as much finishes being something insipid since to the internal <UNK> that it faces dark brown like the passion by his ideals that <UNK> feels as soon as they glimpse in the case of him i want to suppose by the <UNK> of the language and in the case of her by its lack of experience reason why in the end a <UNK> <UNK> with any of them does not exist which causes that what could have been films that even served as document like red dawn finished being one more a film although i want to <UNK> that in the room many of the <UNK> were excited in the conversation with the director which says to me that no longer they are so young or my ideals have changed
<START> significant spoilers br br this is a sick disturbing movie just like the sick twisted director jennifer <UNK> lynch who also wrote it i don't even know why i gave this movie a rating of 2 it is not the fault of the actors for sure the cast certainly portrayed their roles well it is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the <UNK> of a truly sick mind br br i do know that i will never ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by jennifer <UNK> lynch she is a sick twisted foul mouthed foul thinking <UNK> she looks speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs who spent 20 years doing hard time you can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the dvd special features section of <UNK> the watched are watching you can see and hear her for yourself she was every bit as bad as i had <UNK> from the writing of this movie br br i'm not shocked by bad language although this director certainly talks like a sailor this goes far beyond simple bad language worse than any film the level of implied <UNK> violence and <UNK> she <UNK> into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by standards this perverse disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says another reviewer found the description i was seeking this is a snuff film br br be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending this director writer is truly a sick person i can't believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie much less pay her for it you can be assured that i will never ever watch another movie she has been <UNK> with in the thousands of movies i have watched and <UNK> there are only a couple directors and writers which have <UNK> this kind of <UNK> she is offensive beyond anyone i have ever seen connected with filming a movie before there have been some bad directors and writers but none could compare to her sick twisted mind br br when i saw this movie which was just one murder rampage after another once it got past the hotel murder then the sick cops shooting at and <UNK> drivers for kicks the vacation family with the bad parents who had no business being in the presence of children followed by the drug <UNK> the movie then <UNK> to the even more twisted <UNK> serial killers br br as i saw the serial killers reveal themselves i began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie those were my actual thoughts as i watched this movie i fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long term psychiatric treatment to my surprise it turned out to be the director when i saw and heard what she had to say on the dvd i realized my <UNK> of the writer was right on the nose on the dvd she was indeed the sick twisted person i had <UNK> writing such a disturbing film br br while the little girl stephanie ryan truly stole the show i can't believe that her real life parents would have <UNK> this sick foul mouthed director to be anywhere near their daughter br br this movie is disturbing sick offensive twisted and the director writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility br br as far as the ending of the movie goes the alternate ending should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal there was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character i'm stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie the trailer was completely misleading the only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever and creative depiction on the trailer that trailer is not representative of the movie you will see br br other than the child every character in this movie was a sick murderous twisted perverse violent sex freak and their characters are <UNK> the mind of the writer director who created them but if you watch it carefully even the parents of the <UNK> family the sick cops taking pot shots the serial killers posing in alternate roles cops in the station and even the station <UNK> every single one of these character roles <UNK> a sexually twisted violent <UNK> i'm not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the canadian town in the special features section of the dvd br br this writer director has such a personal mental <UNK> that no matter what she writes every character role contains those same <UNK> copy <UNK> the only character which did not have these <UNK> <UNK> was the child watch closely and you will see this in every character then listen to the director writer talk on the dvd special features section and you will understand what i'm telling you about her mental state and psychological issues she wouldn't be <UNK> in too many decent homes if she were not from a hollywood film making family br br fortunately jennifer <UNK> lynch does not have much of a filmography less than a handful of things since she <UNK> copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles i don't think we'll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad director david lynch helps her out i'd recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with and i'm not too sure her <UNK> films would be any better br br do yourself a favor avoid anything written or directed by jennifer <UNK> lynch
<START> this movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life from the opening 10 minutes i was ready to leave the cliches there <UNK> you in the face and the plot was not only predictably stupid but full of more holes than swiss cheese i am considering <UNK> for that lost 2 hours and 6 25 along with the fact that i am now <UNK> for watching this waste of film the t <UNK> must be flipping in their graves so to speak
<START> this movie is allegedly a comedy so where did all the laughs go did the forget to put them in on the version i watched as a football movie it is mildly entertaining i guess just a stick in the mud with no discernible sense of humour or maybe this movie just isn't funny it is also annoying with that way over the top you're a winner musical score and the odd thing is the team sucked through most of the season only winning the last two games and the last game meant nothing since they were not in the <UNK> so what is the point are they celebrating mediocrity i don't see it if anybody knows please let me know anyway this movie isn't great or even very good i'm giving it a low 3
<START> one of my favorite hartley movies as if there could be a bad one although this may be a bit more on the religious side of things than we would normally expect nonetheless it still maintains that hartley <UNK> to which we've all become <UNK> br br first picture jesus and satan discussing their ideas opinions hopes and regrets about the impending end of civilization now imagine the entire conversation taking place over a few drinks in your neighborhood bar and as an added <UNK> not to mention visual distraction let's toss in <UNK> harvey as the <UNK> companion aka to mr then just for <UNK> in the background an ever present salvation army band played by <UNK> la to serve as an added <UNK> the road to moral justification has never been such a pleasure br br quite possibly more questions than answers but <UNK> lies the fun and mr <UNK> is subdued brilliance as always
<START> there are many many older movies that deserve to be transferred to the dvd format this is surely one of them an anthony quinn triumph scores of movies portray the victims of nazi atrocities before and during the war but i don't think any of them have <UNK> into the psyche of the victim and predator as well as this this one has anthony quinn was truly a man for all seasons he had the ability to portray the <UNK> of creatures devoid of any human to a creature of extreme and pull it off as believable to the audiences who watched with no <UNK> of what they had just witnessed truly one of our greatest artists he is missed
<START> ben marshall a teen <UNK> from a religious background is made aware about the financial situation at home by his <UNK> mother laura she suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household in fact the family has taken a widower to board with them robert marshall the father is a <UNK> at the local church he'd much rather be in the country watching birds than <UNK> to the souls <UNK> to his church br br the job ben applies is with an older actress <UNK> who wants him to do things for her around the house dame as she calls herself is a woman of a certain age whose career has died maybe because she was not that great in fact the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera which was popular but she'd rather forget about it who is a <UNK> liar tells ben she's dying only to forget it conveniently later on when she comes clean to the boy br br ben is obviously in awe of the larger than life personality of his <UNK> he has been taking driving lessons asks him to take a camping trip which he does against his better judgment he knows that it will <UNK> his mother's fury not content with that decides to go on to <UNK> where she has been invited to read at an arts festival it is this trip that <UNK> their bond ben gets to meet and taste the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic br br when ben gets back everything <UNK> at home his mother who has been having an affair with a decides to leave the family in favor of the young man she has been having an affair with ben and relationship survives the test of time he also begins to see his own father in a different light br br jeremy <UNK> the writer of driving lessons and other memorable english films takes his first directorial job with this engaging comedy the mixture of show business and religion loyalty and friendship are explored in his screen treatment making it a fun time at the movies we have seen the similar situation before as in billy elliott where julie <UNK> plays a <UNK> role with a younger man we had read the film was based on mr <UNK> own experience while working dame peggy <UNK> when he was young br br julie <UNK> who plays <UNK> is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie she always delivers ms <UNK> is a welcome presence in any film she appears and she does wonders with her fake dame laura <UNK> a <UNK> player herself doesn't quite get our sympathy with her icy mother rupert famous for his harry <UNK> movies plays ben the young man who sees in a kind soul nicholas farrell is the betrayed father michelle <UNK> has a small role in which she shines

<START> i saw this movie back in 1954 on a double bill with valley of the kings these movies helped inspire a <UNK> interest in <UNK> in 1975 i visited egypt seen today the egyptian suffers from flat dialog and a few <UNK> touches but it's a glorious movie to look at the sort of thing hollywood alas just doesn't do anymore and it has a great story not just the usual boy meets girl or vengeance is mine affair too bad 20th won't re issue restored <UNK> of this to be seen on the big screen
<START> if the following sounds <UNK> then by all means rush down to your local blockbuster and rent this movie post <UNK> br br 1 awful 60's <UNK> from pathetic <UNK> to dodgy br br 2 the worst child actor in the world ever who does nothing but cry and say daddy in the most annoying voice imaginable br br 3 lots of stock footage of <UNK> and monkeys that doesn't <UNK> with the film at all br br 4 stereotypical indians who use and talk oh and it goes without saying they <UNK> around a <UNK> br br 5 hilariously fake plane crash <UNK> where the cast actually throw themselves into the <UNK> of the cardboard set br br 6 the exterior shots of 5 which look <UNK> like a toy jet on a string being led around a studio lit with blue light br br 7 terrible special effects which make the ones used in the first star trek series look cutting edge by comparison special mention the little boy's blond hair glowing oh dear br br 8 laughable editing and continuity where background items move between scenes the soundtrack changes completely without any warning etc br br 9 not got enough money to hire a professional dancer get any lady from off the street to <UNK> about like an idiot no one will notice the difference er br br 10 a climax involving <UNK> snakes more stuff from the <UNK> and a ton of fake blood don't forget to put in a stupid sounding song either br br the more sensible among you however will wait for it's inevitable appearance on mst3k when this classic tv show is <UNK> and then you can watch it in the spirit it was intended any other kind of enjoyment to be derived from this crap is <UNK> not to mention <UNK> so don't even try it 0 10
<START> alfred hitchcock's <UNK> is not one of his best regarded films made between two vastly more popular and <UNK> praised pictures suspicion and shadow of a doubt it's generally regarded as a lesser effort i agree that the later film is groundbreaking drawing hitchcock wholly into the american mainstream for the first time but <UNK> is in its way at least as lively as suspicion its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players bob <UNK> and <UNK> lane br br in <UNK> we find hitchcock feeling his way around america literally as its lead character travels from california to new york in search of an <UNK> for whose crime he was accused <UNK> is very youthful here and quite engaging his but not <UNK> perfectly suits the character he is portraying and seems appropriate as the director though middle aged was in the process of <UNK> himself and an older more established star might have thrown things off <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> heroine which not a typical type for the director was very much a common type in american films at the time and she and <UNK> provide an <UNK> and a youth the director needed both in his life and work at this time i cannot imagine older more solid types cooper and stanwyck for instance doing any better as they would have between them carried well too much <UNK> br br as is the norm in hitchcock's films nothing is as it appears where <UNK> <UNK> from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early though <UNK> is an accused <UNK> we know that he is innocent the villains become apparent fairly soon and the movie <UNK> more on its plot than its <UNK> what pleasures there are are incidental and here the master does not disappoint there is an interesting <UNK> <UNK> with some circus freaks who help <UNK> <UNK> capture in another scene reminiscent of james <UNK> bride of frankenstein <UNK> spends some time in the <UNK> of a blind man who as it turns out is <UNK> uncle was the director perhaps studying key american films of the previous decade whatever the case these and other offbeat and <UNK> aspects of the movie give it a <UNK> and variety which when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man still learning his craft br br the film's later scenes in new york are more suspenseful and typical of the director as the picture gradually becomes more as it moves along in the end i find it a satisfying work and as neither <UNK> nor lane has a dark side as an actor neither does the movie have one it is deliberately lightweight and i suspect semi experimental an attempt by hitchcock to see if he could pull off in an american setting the sort of story he had done so well in england he succeeded admirably the next logical step shadow of a doubt a film in which the main character travels east to west and with a wholly different set of values and plans br br
<START> informs us that 14 year olds can be pretty obnoxious and vicious to those who don't know that the film performs a public service otherwise it's a lot of flashy with little or no reason for being i will allow that the camera work is sometimes striking but also that it can be <UNK> self indulgent at other times the actors <UNK> screen space and screen time but do not <UNK> as compelling human beings i suppose the e mail that flashes across the screen throughout means that you have to figure out which character has which <UNK> but i simply couldn't tell enough differences to do so and really didn't care anyway
<START> all i could think while watching this movie was will it ever end it was <UNK> boring to watch i was wishing i could just turn it off but i wanted to do this review justice so i fought the good fight and <UNK> the torture of watching this movie all the way through so that you the good reader need not bear that pain also br br this movie sounds like it has a great premise if you read the premise on paper however the actual movie does not deliver on this premise at all br br the opening scene features a <UNK> in the early <UNK> where they are forcing kids to carry dynamite into the <UNK> that aren't big enough for the adults to fit into this seems to be setting up the premise for an interesting movie but after 4 minutes it becomes clear that is not the case the adults who committed these crimes are never <UNK> there is no consequences shown in the movie for their actions the opening scene is way better than and completely irrelevant to the rest of the movie the last time an opening scene <UNK> a movie so <UNK> was the opening scene of 28 days later which was the only good scene in that whole movie wicked little things zombies a movie so crappy they changed the title to try to disguise it's <UNK> and sell it again is exactly the same in this regard the opening scene is the only watchable scene in the whole movie br br instead the movie flashes forward to present day a single mother and her two <UNK> foul mouthed kids right here is when it would have been wise to press the stop button and never go near the movie again br br in the first hour the zombie kids are barely even seen they get maybe 3 minutes of screen time total all they do is kill a pig that's it the rest of the hour is spent showing the dumb mother and her dumb kids buy things at the local store wander around the forest and have inane conversations with each other the dumb teenage daughter goes and hangs out with some other idiot teenagers and <UNK> <UNK> with them br br there would be no reason to care at all if the zombie kids <UNK> anyone in this movie every single character is both dumb annoying with no redeeming qualities at all not to mention one dimensional and clichéd br br this movie would have been vastly improved if the mother and her dumb kids were <UNK> in the first 10 minutes by the zombie kids as they were driving up to their new house then the end credits rolled that right there would instantly change the score from 1 10 to 10 10 honestly when the dumb mother takes her eyes off the road and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the road her daughter <UNK> her you almost killed us mom of course anyone with common sense knows that if the mom had hit the pedestrian it would be the pedestrian who would be dead not the people safely <UNK> inside the car i guess this line was put into the movie to show <UNK> that the utter stupidity of the main characters knows no <UNK> and runs in the family br br wicked little things zombies runs for 1 hour and <UNK> minutes but it definitely felt like 5 hours or more to me trying to not fall asleep was a tremendous challenge it's not until over an hour has passed into the 1 hour and <UNK> minutes that the zombie children actually bother to kill any person then the scene shows the dumb teenagers drinking beer and making out in a car and saying lines like if you ever wanna get in my pants again you better start the car and get my ass out of here right now seriously that's <UNK> from the movie the teenagers are so clichéd one dimensional badly acted dumb annoying that when the zombie kids finally get around to <UNK> 3 of them up 1 hour and 5 minutes into the movie it feels like a cause for celebration of course the princess dumb <UNK> smoking foul mouthed beer drinking loser daughter of the main mother character gets away scott free what a <UNK> that was she was on the screen longer than the others and hence the most annoying of the 4 of them and most deserving of a to the head all the more reason why she should have been <UNK> within the first 10 minutes as aforementioned to still keep her around past 1 hour and 5 minutes though is totally <UNK> br br the reason for this of course is that feature length movies need to be padded to at least 1 hour and 30 minutes so by keeping her alive long past when she should be they have an extra 27 minutes to pad the movie with her and her mother running through the woods by 1 hour and 22 minutes in it's the second time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine won't start whilst the zombie kids are coming to get her br br the zombie kids are completely generic never say anything no character development at all for any of them br br in the end all 3 of the annoying idiotic main characters live which in my opinion is the <UNK> way of giving a final flipping the bird gesture to the viewing audience in my opinion the filmmakers surely know that they have <UNK> anyone who has had the great misfortune to watch the whole movie why not rub their faces in it by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters who should have been <UNK> within the first 10 minutes die br br avoid wicked little things zombies like the <UNK> plague
<START> if one <UNK> the technical problems of this early 1930 sound movie such as the sound quality and the occasional <UNK> of john wayne one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since beginning at the <UNK> a large <UNK> of <UNK> people and animals head west the <UNK> are pulled down huge <UNK> and cross a <UNK> river with considerable risk to the riders in the <UNK> indians meet with wayne and allow the train to pass through their land later indians gather west of the train to combat them the <UNK> form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle and fire their <UNK> creating with the <UNK> indians a <UNK> of smoke br br when the battle ends the dead are buried on the spot and the people and <UNK> <UNK> this scene is remarkable as the camera stays with the dead as the living <UNK> it is unique in the way it <UNK> the viewer with the dead and <UNK> the viewer from the living the <UNK> encounter a major <UNK> with <UNK> and mud everywhere they finally arrive at their destination near a <UNK> or <UNK> forest in <UNK> the film is done in 70 <UNK> widescreen at about a 2 0 1 ratio in 1930 br br i haven't mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the <UNK> <UNK> and the enormous amount of work involved in making this film <UNK> will never work this hard again to make such a movie or any movie given the technical limitations of the sound the music is at times moving such as when wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friend's killers and at the end br br while all the critics rave about the <UNK> and wayne's psychology racism short temper and complex characters the big trail gives us a story of simple people <UNK> extraordinary <UNK> one of the best westerns i have seen
<START> now i am going to do this without putting spoilers if i can my cousin and i were renting movies the other weekend and we stumbled across this with the big <UNK> scarecrow on the cover it looked cool so we rented it alongside <UNK> <UNK> br br wow just wow br br to start off the movie was horrible now the box art opening scenes and music was decent to well done but the movie itself is horrendous the acting is sub par sean the lead shows hardly any emotion and or effort in his character the scarecrows look nothing like the one on the cover false advertising perhaps and the camera shots and angles were that of a bad wrestling event br br and trust me i'm a wrestling fan i know bad camera angles and honestly this is right up there with <UNK> and <UNK> it's done so bad that it <UNK> me it makes me laugh so somehow this movie takes its place as a good comedy to me br br but to be fair it does serve as a what to do and what not to do in movies especially of the slasher genre i recommend that people do watch this just to get a good grasp of what to avoid
<START> like one of the other reviewers might have been amazon i was first introduced to tourist trap by the beloved <UNK> old 9 in ny around january 1983 devil dog the <UNK> of hell which i'd been waiting to see since it <UNK> on halloween 1978 had just ended and i thought i'd had my horror fill for the day quit laughing that three eyed <UNK> monster <UNK> <UNK> draws up in his room is scary br br for as much as i still enjoy richard crenna wearing his made for tv horror hat it was the first 10 minutes of tourist trap following devil dog that day that really left a mark and months later it ended up being the first movie i ever taped off tv used to play this fairly frequently often as the saturday afternoon million dollar movie as others have observed it's one of those offerings that delivers a powerful horror punch up front a <UNK> left hook and then practically starts over with the rest of the cast dances and <UNK> putting the opening scene a larger context along the way then moves on to the real climax see night of the living dead re animator br br two <UNK> and i haven't mentioned a single <UNK> face it the damn things are scary enough without the music and the script i too can remember some scary dress <UNK> and the like in various <UNK> and <UNK> and say what you like about how relatively straightforward <UNK> and <UNK> approach is no one before or since has played it this well in real life a good <UNK> will make you do a double take and here that's about the last thing you're likely to see if you happen to be stuck at <UNK> wax museum and <UNK> stand yes there is a point i loved her very much where chuck <UNK> is trying to pass for vincent price yes the plot might have taken up all of a paragraph in the early stages i can't see the script being all that thick it doesn't matter from direction to competent acting meryl <UNK> <UNK> not in <UNK> and here that helps instead of <UNK> to another useful and effective <UNK> score see carrie and various other de palma movies to various lighting film stock use of varying sound levels i could go on every element of this low budget production comes together and you get a work very much greater than the sum of its parts br br did i mention it's scary as hell stephen king talked this movie up in <UNK> macabre a year or so after its release and with good reason like much of his work it may not be great art but it sure does tell a scary story and does it well the rest of the cast may be relatively unknown wasn't <UNK> jones in that texas car chase movie as well but chuck <UNK> and <UNK> roberts were and are just familiar enough to audiences to make you think stephen king style that this could happen to you or people you know br br comparisons to psycho plot and the texas chainsaw massacre overall look and feel even if they aren't the first <UNK> in my mind are valid i only wish i could comment on the dvd which i look forward to buying as tourist trap has become <UNK> hard to find on video since the near complete <UNK> of independent video rental <UNK> where it had a home aside from and cable in the 1980s though <UNK> showtime appear to have picked it up and play it regularly now no no spoilers here i'm afraid no plot breakdown go see it yourself all right there may be a tiny little one below so <UNK> away if you like better safe than sorry the <UNK> are damn scary and i'd rather show than tell br br for the record tourist trap is also chock full of great lines from we are going to have a party how do i look huh how do i look to you're so pretty you can't hurt me i shouldn't have to hide it it feels good listen for that vincent price <UNK> again there the inevitable you're crazy delivered at the right moment and in the right tone and try just try to keep the hair on your arms down when you hear the head screaming molly especially once you realize whose head it used to be br br p s charles band was the producer on this i believe and likely owned the rights to music band from what i understand was the brains behind full moon entertainment which might explain both the <UNK> subsequent use in puppet master and well the 40 commercial approach has <UNK> full moon throughout from the enjoyable puppet master and <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> and bad channels sorry
<START> go up to any film fan and ask them the title of the film which was directed by robert wise with second unit direction by <UNK> <UNK> and sergio <UNK> was designed by ken adam and scored by max <UNK> starred sir stanley baker sir cedric <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> was filmed in colour scope and <UNK> at <UNK> in 1955 with a thousand extras and they'll tell you to go away and stop being silly br br they'll tell you that no such film exists that the names you've <UNK> never worked together they weren't even <UNK> and that you've just picked the names out of a movie <UNK> at random and are attempting to them br br at which point you can direct them to imdb and show them the cast and crew of helen of <UNK> they'll be amazed this lesser known sword and <UNK> epic has all these names and more <UNK> <UNK> scott and good old harry andrews br br and it is certainly an <UNK> after the war 1 000 italian extras cost about 25 a day and <UNK> dramas were a <UNK> of italian cinema the orgy scenes were shot twice one with tops the other without you can guess which version britain and america got i believe even la sophia is an extra in this one br br either way the names <UNK> the mind but it's really just a coincidence all of said names were either just reaching the ends of their careers <UNK> <UNK> or beginning them everybody else br br only robert wise and <UNK> were in the middle of their careers br br for the record <UNK> was uncredited and learning his trade adam still had to <UNK> the <UNK> circle in the ceiling of sets a trademark he'd go on to put into all the early bonds baker had yet to star in and help produce the likes of <UNK> and robbery and go on to direct a <UNK> tv company called then die <UNK> young br br while harry andrews would go on to become one of <UNK> favourite character actors <UNK> scott daughter would never make the really big time but who can forget her in day of the <UNK> even though her bit was added later for padding and a happy ending or crack in the world br br sir cedric was theatre but knew how to <UNK> on film and <UNK> was <UNK> for br br but what were these stellar people doing in this camp old nonsense don't ask me the two main stars were no name italians helen had a <UNK> and paris was pretty while the brits were only there for support br br to <UNK> i think you can just mark this one up as a major <UNK> in <UNK> to be honest if i hadn't seen it i wouldn't believe it either
<START> sometimes changes to novels when they're made into films are not only necessary but a good thing however in the case of <UNK> <UNK> it's a very very bad thing not only is the story itself ripped to <UNK> but the satire is almost completely absent from the film and it's mixture of romance and intrigue doesn't even touch upon the biting commentary that austen put into her work it fails to be amusing or satirical at all and instead turns the character's fascination with her fantasy world into mostly a drama br br this affects the romance as well it's meandering and <UNK> chemistry and interest are never established the reasons is attracted to catherine are completely absent from the film leaving the audience to wonder what it is he sees in her at all br br hopefully some day soon we'll get a more faithful version if <UNK> satire
<START> the movie starts out with its most intelligent joke and goes downhill from there pun intended after that there's lots of <UNK> humor and sexual situations the beautiful women were the best part of the movie swear word <UNK> are not meant to be central idea jokes but they try it here the battle between the two groups in the local town and is an old tried and true setup so how could it go wrong well there is no reason to envy the nor any reason to feel sorry for the so we can forget the central plot the <UNK> humor is all toilet or sexual aimed at teenagers but only <UNK> <UNK> no true belly laughs br br the only thing that <UNK> the comedy for this movie is the character humor with the blind man providing some <UNK> but seldom used <UNK> and the black bar owner providing the formulaic street or hood humor br br ok forget the jokes there has to be some killer shots since this was a commercial enterprise unfortunately there was only 4 seconds of backdrop action that might be inspiring the rest was all b grade tricks or worse the big moment where the main character rides the goat a man killer <UNK> run did provide one shot where a small <UNK> eats the <UNK> this was the best of the <UNK> in this movie any serious fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie br br as for the technical aspects of the movie the soundtrack was average which surprises as those documentaries are regularly filled with quality tunes you can catch a lot of editing mistakes and even though it was shot on a <UNK> mountain the majority of scenery shots failed to convey any sense of true size br br overall it might be worth watching if you have managed to turn your brain completely off and you like <UNK> breasts even then you wont remember a thing from this one two days later br br is still waiting for it's definitive comedy you'd do better to watch a documentary for sure
<START> <UNK> <UNK> fire is groundbreaking bold and artistic a masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative upper middle class indian <UNK> this is a film no one should miss <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> give stellar performances by <UNK> their characters as much as possible a r music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film <UNK> uses score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around <UNK> and <UNK> whenever they look to each other for support this film is not about <UNK> as many have <UNK> it <UNK> is just a part of the film it is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning
<START> this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time the director did a wonderful job showing the <UNK> between social classes a situation that is very <UNK> in france today all the characters are lovable especially juliette and her family the development of the romance is while not entirely realistic at least plausible and does a wonderful job showing how much people will change for love i found this to be a heart warming cinderella story but one in which cinderella is a powerful woman in and of herself i laughed through this entire film and absolutely loved it i recommend et juliette to anyone who enjoys unique characters comedy and romance
<START> following the collapse of <UNK> answer to hollywood in the mid <UNK> few but the most <UNK> of <UNK> could have <UNK> such a recent <UNK> in the turkish film industry arguably built upon the work of ex photographer <UNK> br br is the director's third feature and forms something of a trilogy with his two earlier pictures and clouds of may following similar themes and techniques the film finds <UNK> a commercial photographer living alone in a small <UNK> apartment only visited occasionally by his <UNK> married lover his nephew has left his village home after the closure of a factory and the loss of his job the younger man stays with <UNK> while <UNK> looking for work in the city drinking in <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> young women he never approaches br br the film's title is translated as distant and the film beautifully illustrates every possible <UNK> of the word physical distance from his home emotional distance from the world around him and the <UNK> distance between the two men br br films rarely contain <UNK> <UNK> instead allowing full and rich characters to develop from within the tightly framed static shots he acts as director producer writer cinematographer and co editor and casts friends and family in many of the roles such a confined <UNK> approach to film making might be expected to lead to films hard to <UNK> and connect with for most viewers making <UNK> humanity all the more impressive br br is however a better cinematic <UNK> than <UNK> taking the <UNK> from such past masters of cinematic language as <UNK> and <UNK> after viewing i can think of few better suited to the task
<START> great comedy from charlie chaplin i've seen <UNK> 4 major films gold rush city lights modern times and the great dictator and i think it is easily the funniest of the four this movie had me laughing more than almost any other i've ever seen from the very opening <UNK> any similarity between the great dictator and the <UNK> shop owner is purely <UNK> the movie is a laugh a minute with a blend of wonderful slapstick and verbal humor and at the same time chaplin manages to portray the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> maybe a little short on the ending and the lasting <UNK> of the subject matter but easily a 9 out of 10 for me
<START> i'm at a loss this entire movie made absolutely no sense it was like watching a film for football the camera cutting the pace all so copied i thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was yes we all know <UNK> like football and beauty must we be <UNK> with it as an audience i watched because of lee and jay i was expecting young talent assembled in the style of dead <UNK> society or similar to remember the <UNK> i was completely put off by the film you didn't get the characters it was character driven but you didn't understand anyone's motivations or their actions for the most part the one kid who's mom is obsessed with him being a football player why is he so silent what's his deal did we really need the scene with him proving his <UNK> why should we care the movie gave us insights into these kids lives and offered no pay off for caring it just made no sense br br and why show a movie about a team that lost i know it's real life but who makes movies about losers give us some pay off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their <UNK> problems <UNK> we got nothing we got a little <UNK> at the end of the film telling us that <UNK> won the next year with the 3rd <UNK> lee why didn't you follow that story what were we to get out of this one the movie led you along but didn't lead you anywhere i just felt like something was missing it felt like a bad genetic cross between <UNK> blues and remember the <UNK> at least those two movies led you somewhere friday night lights was about a loser team that lost their star player early in the movie the actor who played him was great you were completely annoyed by him which was the point but at least you understood why they made sure you understood him but he couldn't play so why make sure we get his issues br br and the other team in the play offs are we to believe those are high school teens those men looked like college <UNK> or professional player in their 30s who were they trying to kid i know the other team was to look <UNK> but that was crossing the line a little i liked the gritty element of them <UNK> with the black team but again how did this fit into the overall theme of the film nothing <UNK> together the characters knew more about each other than we did and that <UNK> weird with me <UNK> characters had absolutely nothing to add but he was <UNK> it was all just a mess not worth a movie ticket or a rental <UNK>
<START> ken russell directed this weird not very erotic thriller and if i hadn't known that i would have <UNK> my life that the director was brian <UNK> absolutely everything about crimes of passion screams <UNK> from the <UNK> cinematography that is lit a little too <UNK> to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot to even the title this screams <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br unfortunately since brian <UNK> is increasingly seen as a poor mans hitchcock over the years russell should have tried <UNK> a style of his own sure an erotic thriller in the style of tommy or billion dollar brain would have been bizarre with a capital b but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being stalked by a religious maniac were an all too common sight in the 1980s video market oh and anthony <UNK> plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s yawn br br the only thing of any real note to crimes of passion is the controversy it caused i guess the studio were the <UNK> people to hear this since no publicity is bad publicity but as for the controversial sex scenes what controversial sex scenes there aren't any and the only controversy i can think of is of china blue <UNK> an on duty policeman with a needless to say he didn't come quietly ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
<START> i walked into a book store in <UNK> <UNK> i am not going to say the name because i am a dedicated <UNK> i have been satisfied with every item i purchased there before this one on display in the front of the store was the bell witch haunting might i mention this is the only store i have seen it for sale in i had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real i was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it i had great expectations for it i couldn't believe what i seen when i viewed it it didn't look like a real movie it looked like a home video i was under the impression it was suppose to be a horror movie i mean the movie was suppose to be about a witch haunting you know this is no horror movie you will not jump out of your seat watching this movie i gave the movie all the chances in the world to get better as it went along i swear i did it never did get any better there were several scenes of this little kid getting <UNK> and pee thrown on him i didn't find that entertaining at all i watched the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell this to me i guess that is how bad this economy has got i have this to say to the cast and crew do not show this film as material to get other film jobs don't do it i mean that sincerely i <UNK> you for trying for people who have bought this i say this don't sell your copy to someone they could get very upset have a nice day everyone
<START> i figure the company that made this movie wanted people to think of the conan movies but unfortunately for the ones who made this one it does just that you will be thinking man the conan movies were pretty cool this one is totally boring and sucks the story who cares it isn't going to help you like this movie more or less as it just seems like a really cheap film arnold doesn't look like he belongs in this one why he agreed to play the role is beyond me well probably for the money i just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine lame this movie is just plain and simply terrible
<START> this movie was crap the script is so full of holes i can't see how the producers agreed to <UNK> it br br we are never given an explanation of anything the acting is horrible the plot sucks this movie was obviously written for those 8 and under br br i have to say this why are the high school classes only 2 minutes long teacher walks in finds a frog in the desk or drawing on the <UNK> and 30 seconds later the bell rings class is over the kids haven't even opened their books can we have at least a little continuity br br oh the dialogue milo <UNK> is the re <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> zombie thing do we really need the line this is dr <UNK> office dr <UNK> <UNK> father thanks for the tip i could never put that together myself it never gets any better br br why does milo talk the way he does even in the beginning was milo ever <UNK> or was he never real just always what he currently is and if it was always that way why the unexplained milo had br br besides what is milo what are all the <UNK> items for we see all these <UNK> in his father's medical office and are never given an explanation of what they are for or what they have to do with the story what are the <UNK> for what about the <UNK> <UNK> they obviously aren't needed see the movie it'll make sense and what does this <UNK> do to anyone apparently nothing since it has no effect on the lead actress br br this movie is a very very bad rip off of all the other slasher movies it's a really awful friday the 13th halloween <UNK> together by a 10 year old writer it's not cheesy enough to laugh at it's just an incredibly frustrating bore
<START> jacques <UNK> directorial debut see how they fall aka les is our old friend the film with two different stories that gradually <UNK> and turn out to be the same story after all simply told from different sides it's a shaggy dog story with <UNK> <UNK> following unlucky in cards drifter jean louis <UNK> with <UNK> like devotion that even stretches to killing for him when he's asked to <UNK> his gambling <UNK> in kind meanwhile in a slightly different <UNK> jean over the hill travelling salesman becomes increasingly obsessed with finding the hit man who put his cop friend into a brain dead coma his life <UNK> and relationships gradually stripped away as he gets closer to his prey yet while it may offer the perfect setup for a modern day neo noir the film is often more surprisingly playful more interested in quirks of character and a slightly <UNK> sense of humor <UNK> served by the occasional ironic <UNK> and alexandre <UNK> half <UNK> half <UNK> score than the traditional thriller set pieces and plot <UNK> br br unfortunately the film is ill served by one of the worst region 1 dvds released in recent years the picture quality on disc is so poor at times you keep on expecting to see the audience's heads in front of the picture like a pirate disc
<START> what a waste of time to watch this movie poor picture quality poor sound poor acting and definitely not based on actual facts the <UNK> girlfriend did so much overacting as did the sheriff that it was more comedy than horror the deputy tries to make an <UNK> phone call by <UNK> <UNK> problem in 1957 that <UNK> number was not in existence that is just one example of glaring inconsistencies br br the scary aspect was way <UNK> just did not come across as horrific br br i did think that the actor playing <UNK> did the most admirable acting job in the whole movie i could well see mental <UNK> in his character portrayal br br sorry this one just does not get it
<START> the four signs on the road say if you're looking for fun you don't need a reason all you need is a gun it's rabbit season br br in the woods we see hundreds of rabbit season signs posted on every tree we see more and more signs pointing exactly to bugs <UNK> hole who's putting up all these signs <UNK> duck br br <UNK> puts the last sign up away and says to us the audience awfully of me i know but what the hey i gotta have some fun besides it's really duck season br br from that point we now see elmer <UNK> shotgun in hand and a war of <UNK> between bugs and <UNK> with bugs winning every time only in cartoons thankfully can we see someone getting shotgun <UNK> in the head five times and keep going
<START> read this br br <UNK> <UNK> the hood is a scene by scene complete rip off of this movie br br two friends in the hood one's focused on intellectual <UNK> and the other is an <UNK> the friend who's an <UNK> gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed the <UNK> just happens to be washington from <UNK> back br br it makes me mad that people don't know this it blows my mind <UNK> i go into a video store and <UNK> <UNK> the hood is in the <UNK> section while <UNK> high is in <UNK> it's an embarrassing disgrace this movie is both funnier and more dramatic than john <UNK> rip off at least <UNK> could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to <UNK> high but no he never said a word boys 2 men however named their hit record after this film
<START> id just like to say that the film was good and touching the film explains to you the real meaning of being saved or born again and is very well set out the acting was quite good but could do with some <UNK> the story board is catchy and when my church had youth service and we watched it 8 people gave there life to christ id just like to say too anyone who is reading this give your life to christ and <UNK> from your sin please visit www com thank you andrew br br the word of god will not turn void so get saved and <UNK> from your sin
<START> this was not a good movie why do you people keep saying that there is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then <UNK> vampires why why are there vampires where did they come from also what the hell there are all of these super human vampires but george clooney and three other random guys dominate all of them quickly too it's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle there was just three <UNK> from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills <UNK> the next thing you know clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by cheech and leaves the family less homeless in the middle of mexico end of story literally oh and the strip club was an aztec temple which is funny because that would have to be southern mexico not the border why are you people lying and telling people this is a good movie do not rent buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house you will wish you had that time of your life back
<START> although i am very familiar with poet dylan thomas i know nothing of his life whatever his life and specifically his marriage involved i would imagine that the edge of love based on the novel <UNK> things a bit but unless you are a <UNK> or a poet who cares br br the movie is less about thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life one is his wife and the other is vera who was his first love one romantic night on the beach as <UNK> is something that both have tried to put behind them but cannot now grown up they are good friends i forgot to mention that this is set during the war vera becomes engaged to captain will killing who he gets her pregnant and leaves for war while he is away vera starts to fall for thomas again and has fallen out of love with him she is also carrying another man's child things get even more emotionally complex when capt returns br br as you can see it is a very soap operatic plot and it takes shape in a fairy drab slow manner with perhaps one too many sequences of sappy dialogue but all is not lost yet for a non hollywood production i think that the edge of love is about as stylish a picture as one can get it is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90 of contemporary romances hollywood production or not some of it has to do with being set during the war which sets up emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial a bit like <UNK> this one features acting and cinematography of equal talent to joe <UNK> oscar <UNK> but it is in far greater need for stable pacing and progression things are okay at the start and finish but the middle section is where your attention span may be tested unless you are deeply and profoundly <UNK> in the story br br i doubt if the edge of love will have that kind of an effect on the viewer but is a good film to check it might even make a good date night movie considering it is so much smarter than the chick flicks that boyfriends are forced to endure today
<START> wow i thought <UNK> was the most awful and embarrassing first sex movie ever but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete in this case the well known german film producer was successful in producing even worse crap is stupid not believable and predictable and above all not funny it's almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany and i'm afraid also <UNK> br br <UNK> 19 looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too <UNK> to be 15 and his character is too dumb to be true tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn't know anything about sex but that doesn't help seems to be made by someone who watched al <UNK> and took him too seriously br br the best actors in the movie are <UNK> and <UNK> who play semi liberal parents and are stand up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting still their performances are the <UNK> and in comparison br br a complete failure
<START> seven <UNK> kids <UNK> <UNK> across many miles of indian territory and harsh weather to reach <UNK> br br according to history who traveled by themselves through long <UNK> of land such as with the were manipulated and exploited by being abused and sold into slavery but these kids are pretty tough and they try their best to <UNK> in <UNK> their goal of making a <UNK> out west film is a little too <UNK> at times but ok for fans of 'the and <UNK> house on the br br dean smith gives a cool performance as
<START> the stark cold landscape of big sky country with its <UNK> snow <UNK> mountains <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> is put to poetic use here in this <UNK> fable slide picture show about death and melancholy from the young and talented polish brothers who previously treated indie movie fans to the bizarre and fascinating twin falls <UNK> a film about a young woman falling in love with two brothers who happen to be <UNK> twins a little orphan boy is dying and a town is about to <UNK> in the name of progress in the form a damn and power plant with its <UNK> pleasing music score <UNK> dialogue and character development and uncanny fantasy sequences involving some very unique angels the polish brothers put their focus on what every good film artist knows a film should be about the moving pictures the images the scenes paintings of deep beauty captured on celluloid this is best to be viewed late at night so that the haunting imagery can <UNK> in your mind and wash over you as you drift off into sleep the fact that all of this was done on a shoe string budget of less than two million dollars puts hollywood with their <UNK> film costs and hollow movies to shame and <UNK> something grand to come from the polish brothers in the future
<START> only one word can describe mr <UNK> slapstick unfortunately this isn't no airplane looks can <UNK> and that's exactly what mr <UNK> does based on the old cartoon leslie <UNK> plays <UNK> a bumbling near blind man stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves now he must hunt them down using <UNK> basically and that's all this film plays off the <UNK> of mr <UNK> now maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this but pretty much it's just one of those <UNK> dumb grin on your face because you're too ashamed to admit you <UNK> to see this films br br but mr <UNK> isn't as bad as it's <UNK> up to be it's at least got some funny jokes and it's good wholesome fun for the whole family <UNK> tried to make a naked gun for families in <UNK> but it's no where near as good as that so see it once you might hate it you might love it whatever i personally didn't hate it but i sure didn't like it or even rate it okay 2 5 stars for mr <UNK> br br john <UNK>
<START> watching this movie you just have to ask what were they thinking there are so many <UNK> bad parts of this movie you might get the feel that its intentionally poor as some sort of joke br br i think the worst part about the film is the directing there are so many bad uses of camera angles and other cinematic elements in this movie that are laughably bad the funniest example of this would be in the beginning where the party guests are receiving their <UNK> by email the same camera angle is used for each shot which last an awkward 2 seconds a piece and the same computer screen with the same <UNK> window program etc appear it even looks like the thing is shot on the same set each time the whole sequence was also completely silent with no music or sound effects overall it was a poor way to convey the idea that an email was being sent all over town br br if you listen closely you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie sound tracks this is no surprise most songs including the one that opens the movie are in fact slight <UNK> of scores from other movies see if you can guess which ones also i noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra it sounds like its been written and played through a low end <UNK> keyboard if you are familiar with the <UNK> adventure games the <UNK> of each <UNK> sounds like something from the engine br br everything else about the movie just plain sucks the acting is terrible the script is derivative <UNK> there is no joke in the movie remotely funny unless you see the whole film as one big joke being played on a paying audience don't rent this don't even watch it when it's <UNK> on comedy central just forget this it's terrible
<START> return to me is a movie you will want to own it is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages the story though seemingly impossible <UNK> to divine <UNK> when a man <UNK> his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart david duchovny and <UNK> driver give warm hearted performances as the <UNK> to be lovers who meet by chance but the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial carol <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> grandfather is authentic in every scene bonnie hunt as the friend whose wit and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a is funny yet warm in the scenes especially with james belushi as her husband classic scenes and writing makes this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close <UNK> caring people who love each other through difficult times
<START> we don't know why this extraordinary film was never made available officially on dvd anthony <UNK> performance alone makes this a must see there are relatively few films in which an actor <UNK> so profoundly with his character a phenomenon always unique for us <UNK> br br but <UNK> powerful portrayal of an innocent romanian literally dragged out of his house and everyday life by forces he cannot comprehend is only part of what makes this film great the script is based on a book published in paris by a romanian priest who <UNK> the communist take over of his country and the film succeeds to go deep into a little known area of east european history told as a succession of <UNK> esquire twists of fate the <UNK> of <UNK> told openly and honestly without any of the political correctness currently so precious in hollywood are in fact a <UNK> for the lost innocence of the romanian people it is <UNK> ironic that this <UNK> is signed by a french director working with the american money of an italian producer and <UNK> a <UNK> cast <UNK> by an extraordinary mexican born <UNK> br br i've seen mentions of of this film in various asian internet stores and i was fortunate to take possession of a digital recording of this film broadcast on the british version of tcm but it's a shame that the <UNK> hour isn't anywhere on the future dvd release map of mgm studios
<START> alfred hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers and many of them have gone on to be <UNK> as some of the greatest films of all time one film that tends to get somewhat lost under the <UNK> and the <UNK> is this film strangers on a train the most compelling film that hitchcock ever made the story follows guy haines a <UNK> player and a man soon to be <UNK> to the <UNK> daughter if he can get a divorce from his current wife one day on the way to see his wife he meets the mentally unstable bruno anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor <UNK> and one that could ultimately cost him his life br br the conversation aboard the train between bruno and guy is one of the <UNK> most intriguing and thought provoking of all time what if two people <UNK> murders thus <UNK> themselves of all suspicion of the crime and rendering their motive irrelevant could this truly be the perfect murder what makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that guy is lead into could happen to any normal everyday person everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his the chances of it happening are unlikely but it's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of strangers on a train and in this situation anyone could br br is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of bruno anthony any better than robert walker the man was simply born for the part he manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely <UNK> every scene he is in the character of bruno is a madman but he's not a lunatic he's a <UNK> conniving human being and robert walker makes the character believable his performance is extremely <UNK> and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the <UNK> of reality unfortunately robert walker died just one year after the release of strangers on a train and i believe that is a great loss to cinema nobody in the cast shines as much as walker does but worth mentioning is his co star <UNK> granger granger never really <UNK> that much but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against walker also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person and that is how it should be ruth roman is guy's wife to be she isn't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression but she makes the best of what she has alfred hitchcock's daughter patricia takes the final role of the four central roles as barbara the sister of guy's fiancé she is suitably lovely in this role and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in br br alfred hitchcock's direction is always sublime and it is very much so in this film there is one shot in particular that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of <UNK> this is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene hitchcock's direction is moody throughout and very much with the film noir style the climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting and i don't think that anyone but hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film it's truly overblown and out of turn from the rest of the movie but it works there is a reason that hitchcock is often <UNK> as the greatest director of all time and the reason for that is that he doesn't only use the script to tell the film's story but he also uses to camera to do so as well strangers on a train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made its story is both intriguing and thought provoking and is sure to delight any fan of cinema a masterpiece
<START> this is the ultimate kung fu movie this is the only kung fu movie this is the only kung fu movie i have ever seen i am giving this movie way too much credit my best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone else's martial arts abilities but realized that you can't just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it so he put a story behind the fighting and people still didn't watch it br br this movie's story line was <UNK> skin thin that acting was goofy and stereotypical of any kung fu movie the dubbing was literally the worst i have ever heard it seemed if you played a small role in this movie like the fat guy or the two guys trying to catch the main character with a net it didn't matter who over did your voice it could have been a <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> and nobody would have said anything but beside all of this the movie makes up for itself with the somewhat awesome fight scenes br br the fight scenes were definitely what this movie was all about but the of the fights were totally absurd on most all instances a guy either pops out of the tall grass or <UNK> at the main character from a distance and then attacks him but once the fighting started things sort of balanced out there were only two things that really <UNK> the fighting though those constant sound effects that were added to every swing of a fist or foot or sword and the poor editing that made 25 percent of the fighting very <UNK> and choppy someone would be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly be on the ground being kicked and then instantly be back on their feet <UNK> a punch but while the cut and <UNK> editing was more of a <UNK> than anything else it didn't really affect the overall movie br br in the end this was not a great movie but i wasn't expecting a great movie a great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movie's all i saw this movie as was a way to pass an hour and a half of boredom i rarely say that but this was just one of those movies you have no practical use for so you watch it whenever you have some free time enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it good day gentlemen br br scott
<START> i just watched this movie with a few friends they said i had to see it but from the beginning i knew it was going to go from bad to worse so i can only give this movie a 1 because the effects that were used were so poorly used and thought out that anyone can see that there were no real ghosts i feel the worst part was this so called old haunted house contained a whole bunch of new items and a few placed items i could have thought up effects that would have looked much better than a chair being <UNK> over by an unseen ghost or should i say wire then later when they review the tape of the chair flipping it <UNK> in a different way uh oh thats a big continuity error if this was a truly good movie then they would have caught that and all of the other old house items this movie is like a rip off of house on haunted hill and the blair witch project all rolled into one poorly thought out and assembled movie i would be ashamed to put out something with that bad of acting effects and cheap video shots of the girls <UNK> and how convenient the camera falls when something <UNK> happens this movie is an insult to people who are out there actually looking for ghosts and getting real ghost footage on tape
<START> reading through the comments there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional <UNK> of la <UNK> i find this hard to comprehend given the outstanding performance by isabelle <UNK> <UNK> is gripping she manages to convey perfectly the woman on the edge full of self hate and <UNK> br br the film is wonderfully paced and judged it would be so easy to portray the lead as a ridiculous figure consider the scene in the porn store for instance somehow <UNK> is able to carry it off partly because of her brilliant performance but also because the director makes her surreal life real and <UNK> br br don't ignore this film it is one of the most startling and engaging films and performances i have seen br br trust boris
<START> well this movie shows us that mark <UNK> and producers think we all are idiots if not how should we understand this br br american pilots take off on suddenly all <UNK> turn to f <UNK> ha a magic after an action <UNK> land the magic again br br oh did i mention that f <UNK> had israel <UNK> br br another magic obviously <UNK> l <UNK> <UNK> are bombing enemies br br and more magic while all movie is <UNK> in europe we can see a desert in almost any flying scene br br maybe the director wasted all his magic on things above because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look awfully as if pilots <UNK> with br br ok ok this is a movie i should write about its story wait a story yes there is some story in this film and its horrible as well
<START> four things intrigued me as to this film firstly it stars <UNK> <UNK> of popular fame who is always a pleasure to watch it features brilliant new zealand actress owen <UNK> it is filmed in association with the new zealand film <UNK> <UNK> a friend recommended it to me however i was utterly disappointed the whole storyline is absurd and complicated with very little resolution acting is fine but owen is unfortunately under used the other actors and actresses are all okay but i am unfamiliar with them all aside from the nice <UNK> which are <UNK> throughout the movie and <UNK> and owen this film isn't very good so the moral of the story is don't watch it unless you really want to
<START> <UNK> television crew are assigned to cover a small town high school hockey team running into a serial killer wearing a black mask and lots of interviews where the members of the crew and some of the locals who live in the town of white <UNK> where most of this film is set talk into the camera about each other those they encounter in the town of white <UNK> their current situations and the <UNK> side of their lives the screenplay is often <UNK> cynical and <UNK> and killer movie essentially <UNK> fun at <UNK> television shows featuring a cast of characters one might find on the real world if this plot is attractive to you knock yourself out i found the characters tiresome and the satire is old hat out of the cast paul wesley the director needing a big break <UNK> more than he could possibly bargain for jake <UNK> is a nice guy coming off very likable and <UNK> of the crap he must <UNK> with considering the <UNK> <UNK> and immature people in his <UNK> who often cause nothing but <UNK> particularly <UNK> is his producer lee a <UNK> constantly <UNK> orders to everyone her <UNK> attitude creating much tension she's the type of producer who wishes to capitalize on a small town <UNK> regarding the killer using the hockey team cover story as a front to exploit the tragedy occurring in white <UNK> those familiar with <UNK> <UNK> know that by now she has <UNK> the <UNK> princess got it down pat because it's the only role we ever see her in most of the time as <UNK> she's <UNK> the way she demands attention <UNK> what little <UNK> status she has to the <UNK> <UNK> much <UNK> as she becomes a source of frustration and has quite the <UNK> mouth <UNK> <UNK> taken the part just so she could escape her usual television sitcom roles allowed to <UNK> profanity without <UNK> <UNK> along with the entire cast services killer movie as eye candy but it's hard to find any character you wouldn't want to see <UNK> to pieces with a meat <UNK> jason london is the sound equipment guy a real creep with a sour attitude often <UNK> the others with his foul comments that are <UNK> for we witness lots of personality <UNK> watching how these self absorbed hollywood types in the cast <UNK> at each other the killer's identity shouldn't surprise anyone it's quite blatantly obvious some minor gore but most of the violence is shot off screen despite some tame <UNK> not even this is satisfying <UNK> pops up in the film as a cute victim director writer jeff fisher <UNK> quite an attractive cast but i wouldn't be able to <UNK> this from the <UNK> slashers that have <UNK> the horror shelves over the last ten or so years since scream while i've never liked any of characters i never tire of looking at her but eventually she needs to come up with a role that doesn't consist of her <UNK> with smug arrogance always whining and complaining
<START> <UNK> is a movie adaptation of a novel of the same name written by stephen king br br i've never read the novel but just <UNK> the comments page has given me some insight i noticed a reference to the change in the ending br br the plot of the movie is as follows a st bernard dog gets bitten by a <UNK> bat and goes on a killing spree br br the plot sounds quite worn now having been done in various movies however it might have been something new when king wrote the novel or perhaps king's novel put a twist on the story that was never shown in the movie br br anyway the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing at all worth mentioning other than the dog being bitten nothing else happens nothing scary nothing funny nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect i found this section difficult to sit through and was constantly shouting at the tv come on get started the events that i was seeing on the screen were reminiscent of a tv movie of the drama genre or an extended episode of a tv soap opera unfortunately there was only one family in the movie given any focus so it couldn't even work on a soap opera level the dog was the best character in the movie but it didn't get enough screen time in this section there was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a killing spree later br br after the 40 minute mark point something finally happened the dog suddenly transformed from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine it began attacking some people there was also an interesting cat and mouse chase when two characters became trapped in a car unable to leave because the dog would attack them even in this overly long second half the suspense would build up well before dying again it was just a stop go situation repeated over and over again until the movie reached its conclusion br br without giving the ending away i can tell you it was very formulaic and <UNK> of a stephen king story br br the suspense scenes when they are on the screen are exciting to watch some great camera angles add menace to the <UNK> vicious nature when he attacks people this is particularly important because as others have mentioned a st bernard dog is nowhere near as scary as say a <UNK> unfortunately the movie fails to <UNK> suspenseful music to support the images on the screen the music is far too melodramatic rather than suspenseful this may fit a tv movie but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark toned movie presenting a living nightmare to the viewer br br this brings me on to a wider problem with this movie the photography the camera work and especially the choice of colours make this seem like a very cheap tv movie one would expect to see as the daytime movie on channel 5 here in the uk where i am writing this comment from br br the top two actors deliver good acting performances that help to breathe life into the movie's dull segments dee wallace and danny should be given credit for doing a great job with the poor material they are given i could forgive a few brief moments of overacting by paying closer attention to the dialogue which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion i won't pass judgement on the other actors because they are given virtually nothing to do br br as someone who is a fan of <UNK> lot and stephen king's it both movie adaptations of famous stephen king novels i had high expectations for this movie but it turned out to be a massive disappointment br br overall i do not recommend fans of stephen king or horror movies in general to watch <UNK> this is one of those moments where i have to recommend the book rather than the movie hopefully it brings the story to life in a way that the movie failed to do
<START> all you could ever hope for if your a jackass fan as always <UNK> his crew risk life <UNK> just for our viewing entertainment if you are fan of the series of the first movie you won't be let down like most sequel often do the jokes they pull on each other as twice as funny cruel crude as ever before the stunts <UNK> are twice as rough as any jackass episode you have ever seen if your a fan don't waste time go check it out for yourself because on standards this movie is an easy 10 out of 10 just for the opening credits alone i can't go into detail without spoilers but you've got to see it to believe it
<START> i have always liked the carry on films with their double meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy but i can see why the critics give this one two stars basically many british people are gathering on a coach to go on a spanish holiday to an island called to the palace hotel what they didn't know is that it is not completely built plus they have to share <UNK> with their <UNK> they have crap draws and many other complications and complaints that the owner <UNK> peter <UNK> putting on quite an amusing accent e g peace sounding like the bad p word starring sid james as <UNK> kenneth williams as stuart <UNK> charles <UNK> as <UNK> joan <UNK> as <UNK> barbara <UNK> as <UNK> kenneth connor as stanley blunt an apparently crap i personally can't remember who he is jimmy logan as bert <UNK> june <UNK> as evelyn blunt <UNK> jacques as a ridiculous <UNK> character not as memorable as her usual <UNK> bernard <UNK> as brother bernard sally <UNK> as lily carol <UNK> as <UNK> jack douglas as harry and <UNK> rowlands as miss <UNK> i admit it is not great but there are just enough dialogue gags and of course <UNK> in the shower and going to to her bum with that iconic <UNK> and later a rapid rip off of her <UNK> okay
<START> can't believe that cup isn't available on a proper video or dvd yet i've only seen it once on a dodgy copy taken off the tv and despite not being a fan at all thought it was one of the funniest things i've ever seen br br the famous pitch of wherever it was the clueless coach driver this that i'll take the next exit the pointless plot it all added up to <UNK> sides br br being stuck in the us i'm desperate for some good british humour but not quite enough to spend the amount that the production company are asking for c'mon get it out on <UNK> dvd <UNK>
<START> two years after leaving the small town of <UNK> bend due to <UNK> the brad brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for <UNK> meanwhile the eggs begin to <UNK> as they cause trouble in the town brown the <UNK> as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the <UNK> <UNK> before they wipe out the town br br the original <UNK> was a minor attempt to rip off the family horror flick <UNK> it became a cult favourite on the video shelves was successful enough to warrant a sequel this sequel plays down the horror makes its entire focus comedy instead unfortunately the comedy part is extremely clumsy as well as childish the acting is on par with the rest of the film it is just that the film suffers from a weak script the visual effects are fairly well done br br grade d review by m k <UNK>
<START> it is the first time i can recall where an adaptation did exactly like the book in fact only jokes were added to the story rather than content <UNK> or removed br br such as the egyptian slave who had difficulty <UNK> um <UNK> lol or when was played like a quasi <UNK> lord and got annoyed when the roman empire endured a blow the general ordered for the empire to ah watch the movie folks br br i can easily believe that this picture was one of the most expensive in french cinema history and for my part it was worth it was excellent as the roman bashing and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> playing the little <UNK> was perfect and a far cry from his days as the bumbling <UNK> of jean reno in just visiting br br the fight scene between and was hilarious and was nice to see the matrix theme was not borrowed to an otherwise perfect battle br br the pirate and his crew almost stole the picture from <UNK> their own ship to being the engine for <UNK> assistant invention used at the very end br br i understand there's <UNK> and the <UNK> with many of the same team back by i plan to view that too
<START> there have been approximately 60 different films television plays besides the classic opera of this tale of a sex mad girl and her hapless soldier lover this story has been done so many times in various ways br br <UNK> directs <UNK> screenplay adaptation of <UNK> classic novel play br br this is the story only of <UNK> opera carmen br br <UNK> vega is an exciting carmen full of passion the ability to drive simple men to do terrible tragic things <UNK> is the hapless soldier who is <UNK> into <UNK> web led to doing bad things br br jay <UNK> is the author <UNK> who tells this tale br br there is not much action but there are some very hot sex scenes br br in fact this is almost an <UNK> 17 film br br since i have seen this tale so often in so many <UNK> i was not overly impressed br br it is a very well made film will be of interest to those that may not know of it br br my not overly enthusiastic review also could be that i miss the fantastic opera score by <UNK> br br see this as you may like it more than i did br br ratings out of 4 <UNK> points out of 100 imdb 7 out of 10
<START> take a young liberal <UNK> christopher <UNK> timothy <UNK> put in a top secret <UNK> in a government front company because of his father's position team him up with a drug dealer lee sean penn who is wanted by the police and needs a new source of <UNK> and you have a recipe for espionage sean penn played the part of the punk drug dealer with a certain sang <UNK> probably out of particular <UNK> with such raunchy types the <UNK> penn carries with him in every situation is unique he even suggests the <UNK> run drugs for him br br i've seen the movie over and over again and each time i see something new it seems to me that a major problem with us spy <UNK> is its <UNK> which leads to the hiring of an obviously <UNK> candidate by reason of <UNK> and <UNK> for a government front company br br i do recall when the escaped from prison and led the authorities on a wild <UNK> chase i see that despite the escape he is now released a pity the <UNK> are no longer around to accept the <UNK> a <UNK>
<START> send them to the <UNK> this is the solution two <UNK> find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh an incredible story with humor and possible <UNK> that make it much more than a horror film the complex characters defy superficial <UNK> and make the story intriguing and worthwhile if you can stand it definitely a dark film but also a bit <UNK>
<START> i really loved the <UNK> series starred by lance <UNK> which is why i bought the film obviously at some level it was a mistake mutant monster films are usually very bad and this film is no exception br br the basic idea itself is not totally judged to fail well nevertheless this film would never have been a success even with a good director actors but the way it turns out this is just a b class movie the scenes that are supposed to be scary seem more funny to me and the <UNK> is not credible at all br br however watching this film with group of friends in restless mood makes this film shine as it is so unintentionally hilarious
<START> i do not see what is the whole deal about this movie patricia sings yes and that makes the film charming but singing is not enough i mean if you want to get all benefits of this one go buy <UNK> cd and enjoy the plot is simple if to <UNK> the dreams the main characters seem to love each other instantly and as well instantly forget their other <UNK> relationships appear almost mandatory and the little detective story thrown in just makes things worse what at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream i measure movies by how well i would remember them and for this one i already started to forget the details
<START> insane really even if you haven't seen the original george <UNK> movie with norma <UNK> joan crawford <UNK> russell <UNK> joan fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars you may dismiss this forced politically correct depressing comedy depressing for many different reasons meg ryan for one what has she done to herself her face can hardly move that alone puts her miles away from norma <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> should be <UNK> the <UNK> and debra messing what the hell was she doing here actresses with no connection in the <UNK> <UNK> trying to pass for friends totally <UNK> eva <UNK> in the joan crawford part is an outrageous piece of <UNK> what a terrible idea her character is like a <UNK> gender performer without any taste or subtlety bizarre to think that a woman adapted and directed this women the only positive things i can mention are a short but very funny appearance by bette midler and <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK>
<START> this was a really interesting halloween film i <UNK> to thrilled with the whole thorn theory but it still makes for a good film i liked getting to see tommy doyle back but sadly donald <UNK> died right after shooting the film had a really really bad director who didnt give a flip about the series from what i heard treated donald bad and <UNK> let <UNK> harris come back as jamie its like he was just trying to bring down the film but i still liked it there were alot of cuts and music changes and if you're lucky you can get the producers cut which features over 40 min of never before scenes with those scenes it turns into a whole new movie check it out if you have the chance
<START> first they came for the <UNK> and i didn't speak up because i wasn't a communist then they came for the jews and i didn't speak up because i wasn't a jew then they came for the <UNK> and i didn't speak up because i was a <UNK> then they came for me and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me br br attributed to <UNK> martin 1945 br br when faced with <UNK> or injustice the <UNK> thing to do is nothing speak up and you risk becoming an object of <UNK> but when does enough become too much global anti <UNK> sentiments allowed hitler's <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> and equal doses of fear <UNK> and ignorance made it possible for the anti communist of <UNK> to destroy thousands of <UNK> lives <UNK> makes one no less <UNK> br br lawrence newman is a <UNK> of a man quiet and <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> with his surroundings lawrence doesn't like to get involved when he witnesses an attack on a young woman he tells no one and goes about his business his world <UNK> into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses and is mistaken for one of them <UNK> view of the world and its view of him is forever altered br br while the subject matter of this film is not new its presentation is definitely unique it is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice when placed within a certain context lawrence is more concerned with the <UNK> that he is jewish than he is with the views of his <UNK> he believes that if he <UNK> this <UNK> that everything will be all right not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand br br whether playing a <UNK> the only thing i liked about <UNK> or a down home nice guy sheriff william h <UNK> roles are linked by a common thread his characters share a subtle deliberate <UNK> that gives them substance macy nails lawrence down to the smallest detail and says more with a <UNK> glance or <UNK> in his voice than a page of dialogue by showing rather than telling lawrence is able to share his fear and <UNK> with the viewer the supporting cast brings the story together br br laura dern is compelling as <UNK> <UNK> wife with a past trailer park rough yet other <UNK> wise she has also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of a mistake and <UNK> <UNK> situation michael lee aka <UNK> is frightening as fred the <UNK> redneck next door equal parts ignorance and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to his <UNK> cause in the midst of the chaos is david <UNK> the focus of the <UNK> and the voice of reason that raises the important questions even handed portrayal keeps from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to <UNK> sympathy making his one of the strongest performances in the film br br the tight editing and close <UNK> cinematography make for a clean picture with few <UNK> and mixes an air of <UNK> in with the small town usa feel it is simultaneously <UNK> and disturbing the deliberate use of harsh two tone lighting to <UNK> the <UNK> aspects of the piece and the carefully scored soundtrack are powerful without being overwhelming finally the set and costume designs recreate the feel of the era an essential <UNK> in the film's message br br <UNK> unconventional approach in dealing with prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added <UNK>
<START> this film is one of those that can't be regarded by its indeed at a first sight it seems that the story simply focus the desire of have more money but let's take a look on the other side what do you see you see that the money is only a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings the human being have should i do the right thing or <UNK> i and what's the right thing make a deeper <UNK> what does it mean a little town in the border it means that sometimes we can go too close to the border of doing something we thought we couldn't what does it mean the <UNK> <UNK> shown in this picture it means the that sometimes take possession our hearts what does it mean the phrase of the character <UNK> now i belong to him it means the loss of our free will due to our <UNK> deeds in my opinion that's the writer of the story and the director tried to tell us by the way do you remember what another character jack barnes said nothing is so simple
<START> this movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of <UNK> and friendship not one review described this movie as a gay romance film and that's the weight of the plot i don't know if this was to trick people that would otherwise be <UNK> to sit through it expecting the film to be as it was <UNK> the film is out of touch with <UNK> culture <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> culture and the acting is abysmal oh yeah the <UNK> sucks too this movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys getting gay just look at the rest of the movies the director's been involved with all contain the same subject matter boring as hell not what i expected
<START> this movie has got to be the biggest disappointment i've ever experienced with a film the acting is horrific the suspense build up minimal and the plot overall is ridiculous i found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery anyone with <UNK> knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps we're asked to make in logic and the so called suspenseful <UNK> would be lucky to get a 3 year old to be mildly worried i'm <UNK> that a sequel is planned because it means they'll be asking us to once again swallow a sub par plot line if this is an example of raw work i think i'll be avoiding any and all future films by them
<START> this review contains spoilers br br i was searching through horror movie dvds on amazon when i came across flight of the living dead i already knew from the name that it was going to be <UNK> <UNK> and most probably a rip off of snakes on a plane but it was selling brand new for so i figured i didn't really have much to lose br br the music played over the opening credits didn't fit at all although i did like the song itself a pop rock song isn't really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie it started off surprisingly well the opening scenes weren't too bad some of the acting was a little cringe worthy but not as bad as i initially thought it would be br br it all goes well until laura rocket from kill bill <UNK> 2 enters the picture she is supposed to be playing a scientist if she is she's not a very bright one luckily she's polished off pretty quickly br br i actually physically laughed out loud when the camera <UNK> over the passengers of the plane during some <UNK> there was a nun have you ever been on a plane with a nun i was surprised she wasn't <UNK> a <UNK> br br finally after 35 minutes we get to some zombie action and use the word <UNK> loosely the special effects are pretty below standard but that's to be expected from a movie with this budget being covered in blood and having yellow contact <UNK> does not make you look like a zombie though it makes you look pretty amusing using slow motion doesn't work particularly well either i think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much story trying to pass off the problem as a <UNK> of the <UNK> virus wasn't an especially good move either considering <UNK> isn't a virus br br the rest of the movie pretty much plays out like any other zombie movie most of the characters are killed off and it eventually ends up with a handful of people fighting to stay alive possibly the worst part of flight of the living dead is the utterly <UNK> ending i know it's a movie about people who come back to life and feast on the living but the ending was just ridiculous rating
<START> when you make a film with a killer kids premise there are two effective ways to approach it you can either make it as realistic as possible creating believable characters and situations or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs something which the makers of silent night deadly night did for example on an equally controversial subject a killer santa the people who made bloody birthday however do neither of those things they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun or a knife or a <UNK> or an arrow in his her hand the result is both offensive and stupid the whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production and then kept from release for several years it's redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids but it's very <UNK> made 1 2
<START> i've just watched and i'm stunned to see the 8 10 average rating for the show br br not only was the plot was difficult to follow but it seems character development was randomly applied br br the actors were adequate but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional once this happens the story really falls flat and becomes tedious br br and just in case anyone didn't see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way this is <UNK> home in the most banal terms at the end of the film br br the end scene is disappointing and <UNK> in and anyone who sat back and went <UNK> so they were carpet <UNK> all along must have been out for the evening br br two stars for the hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy none for the rest of it
<START> i have just written a comment to <UNK> high 1976 and that remind me of this film which i watched as kid when it was released since then i have watched it only once and that was more than enough as kevin well says it is a complete waste of time apart from the dog fights which are nicely done the rest is a sequence of badly <UNK> scenes with actors struggling with a lousy script and equally lousy direction i do not remember the silly german accents mentioned by kevin in his comment but that is another pathetic mistake if corman tried to make more convincing the characterization of the german pilots why didn't he use german actors or have those parts dubbed on the other hand is good example of the appalling hollywood style of film making with their villains so clearly <UNK> not only by their cruel actions but also by their grotesque accents br br talking about cruel actions the ridiculous scene were lieutenant <UNK> <UNK> murders english <UNK> during an attack on an is an absolutely disgusting piece of propaganda done with historical <UNK> if you want to a see a factual moving very well acted and directed film about the air war during wwi watch <UNK> high 1976 or that wonderful classic the dawn <UNK> 1938 you shall not be disappointed
<START> this really is an okay series everyone in it is pretty good but i just can't take <UNK> she's trying to be funny but she just isn't and then she got a stupid accent if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day br br i have been watching the show in 10 min now and as i said before <UNK> is destroying the show however the 20 year old guy dont know his name but he's <UNK> funny and he's really saving it all br br so here's the recipe to get a great show kick <UNK> of it and then put the 20 year old guy into the lead role br br i really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks like me that they should kick <UNK> of the show and put someone else in the lead role
<START> after a man turns up dead a soldier becomes the prime suspect undoubtedly the best film to feature three roberts and all of them are in fine form young is the cool headed <UNK> smoking cop investigating the murder mitchum is the murder concerned friend and ryan is a hot headed soldier with something to hide <UNK> has a brief but effective role as a femme fatale future tarzan barker has a bit part as a soldier this film touches on anti <UNK> a subject also covered in best picture oscar winner <UNK> <UNK> which was released the same year it is <UNK> directed by who creates an effective film noir atmosphere
<START> i thought i had seen this film before as the plot summary sounded familiar however when i watched it one afternoon in need of some mindless but amusing entertainment i didn't <UNK> anything if i had seen it before i must have <UNK> the horror of it from my memory br br this film is dreadful and it shows its age in fact it looks older than it is more like a mid 80s moronic comedy whilst i am a fan of toilet humour and can see the funny side of many things this is comedy at its most <UNK> and <UNK> the plot is as thin as a <UNK> which wouldn't bother me if only the film were funny br br there is only one amusing line in the whole film spoken by the character louis looks like somebody threw away a perfectly good white boy in fact louis is the only likable character and that's not saying much james and carl are the type of irritating immature men that a sensible woman would run a mile from their practical jokes about as humorous as the war in iraq the character of susan <UNK> is <UNK> looks like julia roberts but lacks her charisma and there is zero chemistry between her and carl though it may be unfair to blame the actress as i don't know what she could have done with such a poorly written part and the villain is neither funny nor scary nor memorable br br there is good trash and bad trash this is trash that definitely should not be recycled
<START> i saw teen in 1993 in <UNK> on a friday night and could <UNK> believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in bollywood it was mind blowing  a film with a modern storyline superb music three lovely ladies and my <UNK> superstar <UNK> <UNK> in this unusual storyline <UNK> falls in love with three women  the simple the ravishing and the sophisticated <UNK> they too are <UNK> with him and want to marry him this puts <UNK> in a dilemma which is the <UNK> of the storyline whom to marry he <UNK> a <UNK> who asks <UNK> to <UNK> into a crystal ball <UNK> finds the answer and marries beautifully directed most probably by <UNK> himself not by the official director the b w classic has <UNK> music  some of <UNK> helped <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> best compositions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ruth is the probably the most <UNK> song ever composed in hindi films credit should also be given to for <UNK> the memorable lyrics teen is a <UNK> musical which completely suited the style of <UNK> <UNK> and he did full justice to the role unfortunately teen has never received the recognition popularity it richly deserves br br a must see for any hindi film buff i will rate the eternal favourite 9 5 out of 10
<START> it's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but <UNK> surely must hold this title i'm not sure what is more horrendous the violence the sexual <UNK> the acting or the plot or severe lack thereof br br the two and a half hours basically follows the <UNK> of the infamous roman <UNK> <UNK> to to throne in and shows the atrocities and <UNK> he supposedly committed whilst in power the acting is lifeless and dull but that's just the tip of the iceberg obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything <UNK> interesting the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was <UNK> possible but don't be fooled these scenes don't ease or take focus away from the <UNK> of this film the camera work is shoddy dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to <UNK> malcolm mcdowell playing <UNK> for keeping a straight face through such <UNK> lines and then there's the violence br br if you are about to see the film be prepared some atrocities are committed in the film not just through the writing but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to <UNK> the viewer this is only objective this movie achieved one must wonder how the makers of this film thought that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> just to name a few would be appealing to anyone when it <UNK> ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film ever br br you've been warned
<START> meryl streep may be the greatest actor working today her portrayals never fail to <UNK> she seems actually to be the characters she brings to the screen in one true thing she gives life to a <UNK> straightforward profoundly complex woman doing her best to play the hand life has dealt to her surviving with cancer is no easy task and not just surviving but actually continuing to live one's life is even harder and this is precisely what kate streep means to do <UNK> <UNK> jerry maguire not only holds her own in this <UNK> company but shines as <UNK> daughter who learns to see in a new light her parents' lives as well as her own streep is a <UNK> and deservedly received an oscar nomination for her work here her i'm only going to say this once dialogue with <UNK> will leave you <UNK> <UNK> though is the real revelation her face conveys every emotion every conflict as she begins to learn the many truths about her parents' strengths and weaknesses director carl franklin devil in a blue dress handles the extremely difficult story material with and <UNK>
<START> chan <UNK> park you have to hand it to the guy in my eyes he's not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying br br <UNK> is essentially a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the rules of the <UNK> <UNK> ho song plays father sang a man who <UNK> gives himself over to a research program and then <UNK> kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure dies and comes back all thanks to the blood he was <UNK> with being the only one out of five hundred to survive he becomes quite the celebrity to those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal normal however now involves being able to leap great <UNK> without injury wanting to drink blood and getting severely hot under the collar when <UNK> of sun get on his skin it's not long before he's living with a rather dysfunctional family unit who knew him in his childhood and while he hides his new strange lifestyle he finds himself drawn into a complex love triangle becoming more acceptable of darker thoughts and <UNK> down a <UNK> <UNK> that could lead him from man to beast to monster br br <UNK> <UNK> a number of genres <UNK> movie felt much <UNK> and more original to me than let the right one in to use a recent example and genuinely impressed me with it's approach to material that could easily have felt as well worn and <UNK> as any number of other vampire movies we've seen over the years it's a mixture of horror melodrama and comedy while also <UNK> ideas such as strength of faith the power over life and death the downside of <UNK> etc etc br br some people have complained that this genre <UNK> approach <UNK> the movie but i personally found that it was a lively entertaining and always enjoyable movie helped by a great central performance from song as the tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supporting cast with no weak <UNK> many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability especially the young woman played by ok <UNK> kim who becomes the object of the <UNK> love lust and affection br br fans of asian cinema and park in particular and also fans of <UNK> the tell tale heart watch and learn should lap this up it's yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in his <UNK> and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainment br br see this if you like near dark aka cemetery man
<START> and i still don't know where the hell this movie is going i mean really what is this movie about is it about <UNK> sean <UNK> complete lack of <UNK> is it about showing that if he could play the role of a <UNK> <UNK> then he was a natural to play the role of <UNK> in <UNK> why was teddy <UNK> even in this movie why was there so much sand that was put to so little use where was there so much table <UNK> why did teddy ignore the japanese guy who he was shooting <UNK> with did he realize the man was japanese why was no no credible excuse given for <UNK> accent at least jean claude van damme has an excuse for his french accent whether it be being raised by french nuns in hong kong double impact being raised on the <UNK> in <UNK> universal soldier or having a french mother and being raised in <UNK> i cannot even remember the name of that movie can anyone explain this
<START> an absorbing exploration of virtual reality although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended this film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality leaving only subtle clues about which <UNK> of virtual reality you are in an confusion for the viewer to <UNK> br br also can be seen as a satire of video games the whole movie though may fall into the <UNK> of form here it seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it <UNK> thus the satire becomes <UNK> br br a number of interesting ideas throughout though the <UNK> mutant is one the <UNK> of technology and <UNK> the cyborg urge to <UNK> reality and philosophical <UNK> such as the <UNK> to along with existential questions i e the game characters are partly scripted or determined and yet partly free to alter their fate and they wonder at how strange that feels in the game one character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life thereby <UNK> again the distinction between the virtual and the real likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble around in a world where you don't know what will happen next and you're not sure how to play since you have to stumble around just to find out the goal and the unknown rules a virtual game within the game is titled also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence even the heroes at every level of existence find themselves confused about violence they don't like it but it is thrilling and part of the game which then they fear is real br br the game creator the god of the system is <UNK> in the end yet that very scenario is played out in direct parallel to a video game we've just witnessed and the <UNK> believe that it is still just part of the virtual reality in the end the film does not resolve the doubt about whether or not this is real but the point is clear to me anyway means da you are there you are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level virtual reality <UNK> reality and its common game <UNK> express like a royal road to the unconscious our own fascination with violence br br nevertheless while <UNK> <UNK> these philosophical <UNK> in an interview about the film he claims that he is very much against the reality underground name of terrorist group portrayed in the film both in the game and in the <UNK> level seems that <UNK> himself did not put that much thought into the film though his impressive education comes through the interview in <UNK> gives the impression of a middle brow intellectual who's trying to be avant garde by <UNK> <UNK> is simply on the side of free imagination the clichéd <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> despite the acknowledged <UNK> there my impression here might be due to one limited interview still seems to miss the point that his film betrays the <UNK> of form here imitating computer games while doing a satirical critique of them but a critique that is unable to <UNK> the same form probably because he actually thinks that it is imaginative and radical yet the film's imaginative world is less bearable and more <UNK> than our own all too real world it remains trapped in the computer game <UNK>
<START> this film was my first <UNK> with the talents of chris cooper i was deeply impressed with the character he played i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor he plays a union captain who along with a couple of <UNK> men are <UNK> in eastern kentucky they happen upon the farm of a woman whose husband has chosen to go off to the <UNK> br br the portrayal of eastern kentucky and its seriously divided sentiments during the war is so very accurate if you are looking for a war film with a lot of blood and guts this would not be it if you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of peoples at war actually and <UNK> then this is the best study of how divided <UNK> affected the interaction of peoples in the border states during america's civil war
<START> i just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence of br br high brow nyc or any big city of mid century america the colors the br br cars the clothes and the coming of the <UNK> movement it reflects the br br <UNK> attitudes of relationships between men and women in the br br corporate world in some ways things gave changed and in others they br br haven't changed at all women still want what men have today but they br br now have all sorts of laws and <UNK> <UNK> to get it for them in br br my opinion beautiful women will still throw themselves at men in br br pursuit of <UNK> goals the laws we have now against and br br all were passed by unattractive women who wanted an equal chance to br br compete with <UNK> women who might be getting the positions br br based on <UNK> looks and out the real competition isn't between br br men and women but women and women i liked the look and feel of the movie but the world hasn't changed as br br far as what real
<START> i originally saw this several years ago while i was sitting on the couch and got stuck watching it on hbo with the remote out of my reach i decided to go with it and was awaiting a miserable movie that i had been avoiding for a year so it started off and i wasn't very optimistic about it but after about ten minutes i found myself laughing the complete opposite as i was expecting the comedy was smart the acting pretty good considering the cast worked very well together and the story though slightly awkward and fake was actually quite entertaining br br three convict brothers manage to escape their sentence and eventually go in search of their fortune the movie is set in the 1930's so along the way they encounter a number of funny and interesting all have a different story or achievement they are <UNK> for really the majority of the movie may seem random some may say it was pointless and boring but if you look for the smart comedy and occasionally stupid that is integrated into the movie i'm sure you'll enjoy this one br br i liked the performances given by george clooney john <UNK> and tim blake nelson all of them did very well in their roles an they worked great together but to finish this off o brother where art <UNK> is a smart funny and a movie adventure that i wouldn't let pass up
<START> turkish culture is complete with lots of different cultures different cultures have different styles of music <UNK> is like the mixture of turkey it has mostly the same language but different <UNK> this documentary shows us these different kinds of music with different <UNK> and different <UNK> you can watch with singers and groups their performances their daily life and learn their thoughts of music the movie includes not only the music of <UNK> but the life in <UNK> how people communicate and what they eat and drink the surprising part is although i live in <UNK> i learned lots of things from this movie
<START> asia <UNK> has never done a film so far as i know and this includes ones directed by her own father <UNK> where she fails to show all of her <UNK> at some point sure enough in the most boring opening dialogue scene ever poor madsen has her coming into his office and right there reminding us that even though her hair is up she can still stick her fingers in her <UNK> at any given second which she does but in such a random what am i really seeing that kind of way the dvd box <UNK> makes this look like a femme fatale film so you keep waiting to see her turn into a <UNK> and <UNK> killer no such luck she's <UNK> hung up on some aging has been and even worse has no credible skills in physical <UNK> other than surprise taking off all the clothes when any scene allows it her <UNK> english would be cool if only she didn't try to make it sound so affected and try to talk like a 12 year old how about this plot weak minded but simultaneously <UNK> woman is suddenly driven to kill while she already has another affair on the go and is running some cheap drug deal huh what does anyone have motivation in this movie to do anything other than buy a <UNK> the screenplay seems to be oriented by letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over i was expecting to see the worst acting on this appear as a producer who dumped money in it just to have some screen time there is nothing going on sub the obvious flaws of <UNK> character that at any point in the movie delivers what the dvd cover promises she's weak but she knows how to kill she a lot she naked she half dressed she even in a dead woman's clothing she is very <UNK> and <UNK> in fact <UNK> would have been a great name for this movie and a shot of asia passed out looking angry on the cover would have been a better representation there are actually shots of her eating airplane food what's that about br br the ending makes 0 sense everyone is just annoyingly <UNK> <UNK> in their intent and their execution of all <UNK> the wife of lester doesn't deliver any real vengeance taking someone to bad is life threatening but not really valid and lester just <UNK> around without really making much of anything totally misleading key art yeah we know asia lost the baby fat of her first born but really a whole movie trying to pretend like that's interesting enough to drive a film about a passive aggressive chick is not worth your while see point of no return instead
<START> so it has come to this in the top rated comment on this flick somebody says is an honorable man really this is a guy who mainly kills and <UNK> people in the movie he takes a short break to rob a bank honorable how would you like your kids to go to school with the kids of someone who calls that honorable wait there's more the person also says we can tell he's constantly thinking how can we do that well do you know that joke how can you tell when a <UNK> politician lawyer is lying his her lips move well lips never move so i guess that means he is thinking br br of course this is <UNK> to warm the hearts of the cult of <UNK> supposedly <UNK> that an individual take responsibility for the consequences of one's acts not borrow money from the <UNK> what they want it back kill them the cops find out kill yourself and your wife br br really honorable
<START> i have seen this movie twice and it's theme is an <UNK> one i have been into computers for many years now and this movie inspired me in a <UNK> sense as does a fresh love which <UNK> the <UNK> of my poetic passion in the heat of <UNK> very original idea great <UNK> in the way it holds you as it tells it's story to minds that need a release from the every day realities of this life
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the lesser private <UNK> shorts a warning of the importance of studying your field <UNK> makes it point rather clumsily the story in which technical fairy first class makes <UNK> into a <UNK> in order to help him see the error of his ways is predictable and unfunny <UNK> earlier <UNK> short <UNK> had been <UNK> with ideas and laughs but here the director is <UNK> with a rather boring topic and he struggles to make an entertaining short from it even at around three minutes long seems to drag and unlike the best cartoons in the series it feels like an <UNK> film first and entertainment second though they were knocked out more quickly than the usual warner cartoons the <UNK> shorts largely <UNK> a surprisingly high standard is a reflection of the sort of quality you'd more reasonably expect from a less talent bunch of creative minds
<START> just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good br br thought it was a lame ass movie but not at all many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying br br this movie has enough blood gore and some sexy make out scenes of course to keep any horror buff like me 100 satisfied the cast was also pretty good imo br br even though its not a high budget movie the effects wore definitely kinda creepy sometimes br br worth watching if u like a kick ass horror movie thats for sure br br tom
<START> the grudge 2 let's see don't get me wrong i'm not a japanese horror film or horror or grudge <UNK> i loved the first one and the original <UNK> on i feel that much more justice could have been done for this one <UNK> only existed to fill in what needed to be in the ending which if you've already seen <UNK> on before this you already know the whole movie all it was really was a complete remake of <UNK> on just more closely followed than the grudge though everyone may have thought that it's coming to america was a bit interesting it was expected as the house burning in the end of the grudge left the 2nd <UNK> for a new plot br br save your 6 50 and wait for this to come out on dvd rent it watch it then decide if you want to buy it this movie is good for a fall asleep at 2 in the morning film but overall i'd say a 4 out of 10 sorry grudge fans it's just they just failed at this one
<START> five teens set out to do some camping in the <UNK> wilderness and despite being warned by the park ranger they soon realize that something is lurking around in the backwoods waiting to strike br br when it comes to old horror movies the only one that keeps popping up in every conversation is friday the 13th so i took it upon myself to find those good old horror movies that fell short for simply being compared to friday the 13th just before dawn just so happened to be among the ones i found and was really very impressive it wasn't as bland as some of the stuff you find today it was very sharp in terms of character development as it had quite a few likable ones and it has this very casual pace its not in a hurry to get to the hack and slash bits it takes its time to set the proper mood and tone and is very atmospheric and builds some killer suspense by letting you always have that sense of dread like somethings out there but you don't know where it is or when it will strike br br where i live its definitely an overlooked gem simply because people never heard of it or won't give it a chance but i'll state that it is not a friday the 13th rip off the two concepts don't even go near each other but in my mind it is overall one of the more impressive slashers i've seen in a while
<START> the third film i got to watch at the <UNK> film fest was this outstanding drama from japan after breaking out of prison nine escaped <UNK> plan to find the key to the universe that a <UNK> convict who didn't break out told them about along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well each has their own dreams for much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy all of the actors give great performances i can't say much more without spoiling the film but suffice it to say that you end up feeling for some of these individuals at 2 hours this film is a tad to long but good none the less i have no <UNK> <UNK> it with the warning that it does have a bit unsettling violence for the tender hearted hit a home run this time out and it makes me want to search out his prior films as well as look forward eagerly to his future ones br br my grade a
<START> this movie as my chinese girlfriend informed me features two well known hong kong pop stars while this may make the movie a mere marketing stunt i found the acting acceptable and they're both cute br br the story is pretty poor overall the <UNK> traits and weaknesses are however used in humorous ways and created some uniquely entertaining bits the <UNK> between the two girls made me chuckle and this gave a fine balance together with the well executed action scenes to create an entertaining movie
<START> there was a time when michael jackson was <UNK> as the king of pop then came a time when he attracted negative publicity as much as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> finally it is now the time that we feel truly sorry for this man br br this <UNK> is another reason to i promised a <UNK> michael jackson fan to watch it with her you know the type of fan someone who tells him or herself to like everything the object of affection ever did while watching this movie which she had seen twice already i realized how far this <UNK> goes probably far enough to rate this movie above a 1 10 as some people miraculously did br br the movie attempts to be a parody of many other movies and series most notably cast away lost and jurassic park unfortunately it fails miserably at any level the acting does not save the absolutely horrible story the filming has the quality of a too often played video tape the special effects were better executed in be kind <UNK> for those who do not now this movie with <UNK> foil all this would be funny if the movie managed to be well funny unfortunately it is not it hurts to watch this br br and then there is michael <UNK> appearance in this garbage he appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message and manages to come across as mobile as <UNK> the <UNK> and as serious as a 4 year old just when i thought who is the terrible person that <UNK> this poor man into <UNK> in this movie and yet again making a total fool of himself i finally reached the ending credits and discovered that the movie was actually partially shot at jackson's <UNK> ranch in other words he likes it br br this movie and jackson's involvement in it is truly disturbing do not watch it even for the haha a movie in the imdb bottom 100 effect or be warned
<START> i enjoyed this film which i thought was well written and acted br br there was plenty of humour and a thought provoking storyline a warm and enjoyable experience with an emotional ending good fun
<START> i saw this at a drive in when i was 9 all i remember are a few scenes the ones where the main character <UNK> is being chased by a guy in a mask and being scared seeing it now my opinions have changed it's a pathetic horror film about an run by gloria <UNK> sad and dealing with a young talentless girl <UNK> who is sent there after her mother the town tramp was beaten to death with a hammer <UNK> shown the film has <UNK> actually actors in their <UNK> being beaten tortured killed <UNK> attacked with meat <UNK> raped etc etc the brutal hammer murder is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse there is nothing to recommend about this crap the plot is stupid all the dialogue is bad and the acting the less said the better how did this <UNK> get by with a <UNK> now pg rating it would get an r now worthless one last thing a truly repulsive twist ending suggests incest
<START> i saw this film at the film <UNK> the year it won best short film i have to say that i thought the direction was fantastic and the performances from the key cast members were very memorable both of the main cast are definitely names to watch out for br br the final shot over the cliff was mesmerizing and i for one would like to find myself there if i was waiting for the end of the world to happen the kiss was definitely a great payoff done with great br br i can only assume that the film was shot on film and i have heard that the <UNK> won an award at the <UNK> film festival for his work on this film and i must say well deserved br br i would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s it brought back some great memories and some scary ones
<START> spoilers br br this movie is not action packed it's slow and boring it's not funny or exciting it's predictable and plays on cheap sentimentality and vague <UNK> the special effects are not imaginative or impressive they are <UNK> and uninspired br br the acting talent is wasted on hopelessly stupid one liners and clichés these are <UNK> by characters they ought to just be called gentle giant black man ' eccentric genius who is about to crack ' square <UNK> hero coming of age ' by the book coward ' <UNK> <UNK> who lives by a code of honor ' <UNK> and so on br br and the writing how many <UNK> <UNK> did they think they could fit in this thing does a scene where people have to <UNK> a bomb by cutting one or another wire even count as fiction anymore the drama of the last 15 minutes of the movie depends on the audience caring if some jerk can put aside his personal differences with ben affleck and say bye bye to <UNK> tyler in time to save the earth all the work is done we just have to wait a couple more seconds for harry <UNK> the jerk to toss off a few <UNK> candy lines i know bruce willis is a generally charismatic guy but his harry <UNK> character is an obnoxious bore i thought he earned the golden he was awarded for this role br br since the movie is so long the plot so obvious and the dialogue so <UNK> one can't help but notice the lame inaccuracies inconsistencies and plot holes <UNK> feet into something the size of <UNK> is less than a try walking <UNK> feet into <UNK> and see how close to the center you are after all the discussion about the artificial gravity on the russian station it appears to be <UNK> once inside actually gravity comes and goes throughout the movie does it make any sense that anyone besides michael bay would give these morons a couple <UNK> and send them to blow up an <UNK> threatening the earth br br the sentimental phone insurance <UNK> commercial style montages were revolting br br i do like action movies really this one is boring stupid and really stuck on itself it deserves hatred and <UNK> because it's everything hollywood's most expensive efforts have become a bunch of cheap cliches running from one expensive explosion to another oh yes the whole thing is <UNK> by a <UNK> conservative <UNK> on sex politics and so on
<START> i got this movie with my bbc jane austen collection 5 dvds of old bbc adaptations and didn't like it at first it's completely different from the others and it lacks or so i thought one of the qualities that i enjoy in all other austen movies cheerful common sense the nightmare scene in which mrs richards apparently <UNK> her fingers together was especially <UNK> br br i still don't like to watch the finger <UNK> scene but i do love hearing mrs r saying <UNK> while she <UNK> my only <UNK> <UNK> my <UNK> this movie is now my current austen favorite i've watched it 7 or 8 times so far the acting to my mind is incredible the way i notice good acting is when i find myself looking up from whatever i'm doing <UNK> though not my fingers together hopefully or or whatever in order to watch the character deliver his lines it's the turn of expression the cast of <UNK> that make the words come alive that's what makes good acting as far as i'm concerned br br well i watch almost every part of <UNK> <UNK> because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma peter <UNK> is amazing as mr the perfect blend of <UNK> and real <UNK> hero you're not sure until the end whether he's after <UNK> money or not i love his touch of <UNK> accent mr and mrs richards are charming the combination of their <UNK> especially mr <UNK> high voice <UNK> <UNK> to his wit and wisdom makes them so real general as the hard hearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating too and captain the <UNK> <UNK> who is so clearly enjoying himself and the sister and brother whose names i can't currently remember the two of them are so perfectly at once smart and smarmy br br the other reason i love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the jane austen adaptations i know this was one of <UNK> weak points well it is as far as i am concerned even though all her novels are love stories it's hard to feel that her heroes and <UNK> are really in love at the end and if they're aren't really in love then what's the point all the other adaptations i've seen other than the early olivier <UNK> one have pretty cold fish kisses at the end if they kiss at all i don't at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end and the ending kiss in <UNK> is a <UNK> br br the over the top approach to costumes music and lighting work very well as far as i'm concerned and the script is extremely clever the way we are educated about gothic romance in bath <UNK> normal country upbringing etc is very well done as they usually are in bbc productions also i like the part when the little black page does the <UNK> and the i think was an entirely appropriate and very clever <UNK> device br br some people have <UNK> that this version is the opposite of what jane austen intended to do in <UNK> <UNK> she meant to make fun of gothic romance not promote it but i don't think she meant to put mysteries of etc down she was just making the point that you need to <UNK> between reality and fiction and this point is made when mr <UNK> catherine in his mother's room besides general was a villain albeit a <UNK> one that point was meant to be made surely
<START> i will repeat what a stupid scenario br br is there anything new inside i don't know who have wrote this but i believe this guy have watch all hollywood children family teens movies ever made all scenes and u can see in everywhere why do u people making this movies children's like an adults they like money gold cars and they are <UNK> they have lucky and emotions of course without it can be done o the young actors wow i do like when is camera concentrated on their nice faces what a crap there is 90 better children movies that this one this is not creative or funny movie this is simply nothing br br d
<START> this has got to be one of the weakest plots in a movie i have ever seen br br however that is not all that this movie is lacking this movie has the worst acting writing directing special effects you name it it's the worst ever br br i highly advise you to spend your time on worthwhile movies and not waste your time on this garbage br br i do agree with an earlier post that the women were definitely men dressed up in drag and that did give me a laugh i keep trying to figure out if they were being obvious about it or if they were actually trying to be sexy women br br anyway there is not much else in this movie that is worth watching br br to sum it up horrible acting horrible script horrible idea for a movie an hour and a half of my life i want back right now
<START> the photography is accomplished the acting is quite good but in virtually every other department the greek <UNK> is a dreary bore taking its inspiration from the real life love affair of jackie kennedy and <UNK> <UNK> the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on tv all day long viewers who embrace the whole celebrity magazine culture <UNK> photographs and <UNK> stories about the rich and famous will undoubtedly find much to <UNK> their <UNK> here but those who prefer films with a bit more substance and craft and <UNK> will find the <UNK> minute running time a butt numbing <UNK> br br american president james cassidy james <UNK> and his beautiful wife liz <UNK> <UNK> are in <UNK> on official business a ridiculously wealthy greek <UNK> <UNK> theo anthony quinn catches sight of liz at a party at his elegant <UNK> despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else there is an immediate attraction between them later at a private party aboard his <UNK> makes his desires known to liz some while later president cassidy is <UNK> whilst out <UNK> on a beach liz is shocked and <UNK> by his death but it isn't long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her greek lover eventually the two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favourite talking point for the world's <UNK> magazines <UNK> and <UNK> br br it is somewhat amusing to note the <UNK> with which the producers of this film denied that it was a <UNK> of the kennedy <UNK> story they wanted the film to be seen as an original story <UNK> in fiction but anyone with a brain can see from where the movie is drawing its inspiration even <UNK> <UNK> himself knew the greek <UNK> <UNK> to his love life getting the hollywood treatment if <UNK> are to be believed he actually had a hand in <UNK> anthony quinn for the role j lee thompson isn't really the right sort of director for this type of movie  he's better suited to action fodder like the guns of and ice cold in alex  but he the proceedings with an uninspired professional quinn is very watchable as <UNK> looks lovely as the object of his desires <UNK> uses his <UNK> smile and a <UNK> of integrity to make for a believable politician their performances are good on the surface but there's little for the actors to do on any deeper level similarly tony photography gives the film an elegant surface sheen as it moves from one exotic locale to the next but the <UNK> of <UNK> proves that there's nothing behind the film's glossy exterior
<START> this is a well directed columbo episode with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a columbo movie this also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle it's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light at least when compared to different columbo movies br br for instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief mostly coming from the columbo character himself it makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of <UNK> it times also mostly since it doesn't <UNK> with most other columbo movies br br the characters are good and it helps that it features martin <UNK> in a double role it's always funny to see how much different he still looked as a young man while for instance a person such as peter falk hardly changed any over the years he only got the movie also features julie <UNK> among others who is best know for playing <UNK> in the <UNK> batman life action series it's funny how she still moves like <UNK> in this movie intentional or is this just her way of acting br br it's an enjoyable and good to watch columbo movie but it also gives you the feeling that it all could had been a lot better with a better thought out script br br 7 10
<START> what a great little film lots of good roles from some random stars basically there are these pot <UNK> that get caught up in a comical adventure at points the film makes you believe everyone is going to end up dead which adds to the comedy when the character of john <UNK> 3rd rock re appears its impossible not to imagine the trip this may have caused like a total <UNK> the film is full of twists and turns that keep you guessing all the way to the end billy bob <UNK> astronaut farmer is brilliant in fact looking back the character is fairly similar in the fact he holds the family of pot <UNK> together everyone involved in this film should get a big thumbs up br br as i the final scene is a dream however a nightmare at the same time i love it when hank <UNK> carter says at the end do you think we should do this every year i felt my self wishing they would br br i'm not going to say this film is good for everyone but as a lover of <UNK> movies i give it 10 10 my advice have a joint ready kick back and enjoy
<START> see three colors blue and three colors white they are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale three colors red red is a fantastic film it can be enjoyed in a single viewing and indeed the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing but watch it again once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie you will see new things with each viewing with the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind with each additional viewing you find yourself discovering that it is in fact a work of genius red is meant to <UNK> <UNK> in the french flag the story turns the theme of <UNK> around to be viewed at angles one would never suspect the <UNK> of <UNK> shared by the different characters is as deep as you care to <UNK> if you are used to the blatant symbolism in most mass films you may find red a bit slow you may find yourself looking at a screen filled with intensity that you do not <UNK> and <UNK> wonder what all the excitement is about this is not a mindless <UNK> experience everything is not explained to you you must think as you watch you must see not simply look wonderful movie one meant to be enjoyed by a wonderful <UNK>
<START> there is no real story the film seems more like a fly on the wall drama documentary than a proper film so this piece may in itself be a spoiler teen drama about 3 young <UNK> kids very similar to uk who play <UNK> from school run with gangs get into fights insult people on the street get <UNK> hang about doing nothing etc etc they generally imagine themselves to be hard and every so often shout challenging rap <UNK> into the camera filmed in mtv style fast cuts crazy camera angles tight close ups and animation <UNK> the dialogue might have been <UNK> in the original languages of <UNK> and than in the subtitles and i have no doubt that some of the contemporary <UNK> references will slip over western heads as well as the cultural and political context unless of course you are familiar with <UNK> this kind of teen film may be a first for <UNK> but it has been done before and done better in other western countries la <UNK> 1995 for example
<START> angels demons br br the movie is directed by ron howard he has had also made famous movies like the da <UNK> code cinderella men he directed also the famous tv series 24 the most famous actors are tom hanks the da <UNK> code the green mile forrest <UNK>  ewan <UNK> <UNK> dream <UNK> <UNK> star wars the phantom menace  br br in the begin i was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big because they changed the father of in someone else <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> another change is that robert <UNK> tom hanks never goes to the it was nice that they could film on location in the br br then movie goes on they are spectacular car races in rome an i also like the part in <UNK> very much when they destroy the work of <UNK> it was funny it was also funny that they where locked in the <UNK> the second time they get in robert <UNK> destroyed half of the <UNK> and when they bust out the electricity get br br i found it very stupid that robert <UNK> not went in the helicopter but that the ewan <UNK> gets in alone another detail is that in the movie the is an adopted son from the <UNK> in the book he is the real son of the <UNK> br br when i should give the best acting performance then i should say who plays inspector the worst acting was from the assassin who was played by <UNK> lie i think he was <UNK> because in adams <UNK> he played br br i think the whole movie is <UNK> because director ron howard made some many stupid changes i would rate the movie by 4 10
<START> no matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original if it existed on it's own it would be a 2 3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4 5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards if the film was a re working or as in planet of the apes a re imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right only <UNK> the original imagine it this way if someone took the model in the <UNK> her in a different way and painted her you could only compare the framing concept etc to the original but if someone just <UNK> her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally br br that said this film doesn't just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made the shower scene will never be forgotten the remake was meant to be a celebration of hitchcock but ended up actually <UNK> him and his master work br br the <UNK> aspects of this picture were vince vaughn and anne <UNK> it's nothing to do with <UNK> they acted better or not it's that the relationship between norman and marion in the original was really quite innocent norman didn't really understand sex he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he doesn't really understand sex and his attraction to her this makes norman sympathetic and almost an anti hero you are on his side because he doesn't fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his <UNK> in the remake that whole dynamic is gone i must admit to janet leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that anne <UNK> is really unattractive and so norman finding <UNK> marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to vince <UNK> norman <UNK> whilst looking at her and you get a norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like who you feel absolutely no sympathy for they further destroy <UNK> innocent nature by putting the porno <UNK> in his room it destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for it's like re making <UNK> a wonderful <UNK> and having the main character a <UNK> totally <UNK> br br the only other character that i had problems with was rita wilson as caroline <UNK> <UNK> in the original when pat hitchcock says the line <UNK> must have noticed my wedding it <UNK> a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself when rita says it it just seems plausible as there really isn't any other reason why any man would <UNK> with anne <UNK> over her br br i'll admit that i am very biased the original <UNK> is my favorite film of all time had the film been a <UNK> with a different angle then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable br br <UNK> <UNK> the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to <UNK> it this also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it's own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are de the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour n b before people think <UNK> can't remember i'm from england and we spell it colour br br a remake should be just that re made this is a <UNK> a complete copy and a very bad one at that i could go on comparing but there is no point almost everything is superior in the original the only one thing that is better is the performance of viggo <UNK> as sam <UNK> john <UNK> was very flat in the original <UNK> called him 'the behind his back and <UNK> gives a more believable if less likeable performance william h macy and <UNK> moore are the only other actors that hold up to the originals br br overall a movie that should be labeled embarrassing failed experiment only view if comparing to original or if original is unknown to you but view original <UNK> the movie would have got a 3 out of 5 if it were original or a <UNK> but as it is 0 5 out of 5 for macy moore and <UNK>
<START> in the beginning with the careful remote location and metal sound i thought of the opening scene in once upon a time in the west when it gets to the city then it begins to feels like kitchen stories or <UNK> clouds even possibly <UNK> br br then it turns out that this is more similar to joe versus the <UNK> in theme not style and the movie <UNK> from beginning to end the same understated style letting you observe take in the steel blue <UNK> tone of the <UNK> dresses wall color furniture <UNK> mirrors cars music background sounds and even people's expression then near the end there is one shot of a completely different tone warm yellow with soft music and ocean <UNK> children and laughter br br but maybe the observation is too long for me i would much rather to see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the ending shot still beautifully done
<START> i thought this was a really cute movie inspiring makes me want to try acting i love kelly <UNK> and it's nice that i can watch this in addition to all my children i've already watched it 3 times of course i also loved seeing joe barbara especially since another world went off the air
<START> martino a young teacher in the island of <UNK> has been formed by <UNK> an excellent <UNK> to be his own man and to say whatever he thinks something that gets him in trouble at the school where we first meet him because he is teaching revolutionary ideals the island is in a frenzy because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in european history of the 19th century <UNK> is coming to his <UNK> not exactly a high point in his life br br with surprise martino is chosen to <UNK> <UNK> who is writing his <UNK> and is in need of help for his own project the young man comes from a sea <UNK> family his brother and sister want him to go on an commercial expedition but martino has decided his place belongs in <UNK> because he will try to <UNK> <UNK> little <UNK> him after his mentor is tried for <UNK> and condemned to be shot by a firing squad br br martino finds his <UNK> with the much older <UNK> <UNK> a beautiful woman in his own interaction with the <UNK> emperor a different kind of man emerges <UNK> is seen as a more human person who really enjoys the company of martino not <UNK> with the plans the young man's own plans for him unfortunately martino is not able to put his design into action because <UNK> has other plans in mind br br <UNK> the director of <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> shows why his early promise is still there mr also <UNK> with the screenplay which is based on a novel by <UNK> the director shows he is as good in intimate drama as well as with this type of spectacle <UNK> <UNK> the cinematographer does an excellent job with the images he was able to get br br <UNK> a young italian actor is the best thing in the movie he is playing against more experienced players yet he manages to convince us he is the <UNK> youth trying to get justice to what he <UNK> is a noble cause the great daniel <UNK> is a more subdued <UNK> than one would expect from anyone's interpretation of this larger than life man monica is the love interest of martino but she has little to do plays
<START> imagine if you will an alternative universe where someone has made seven where instead of a talented cast and crew they've cast a politically conscious <UNK> and a stand up comedian as the leads if your imagination can't stretch that far just watch the <UNK> man as it's the next worse thing br br mild spoilers br br jack cole is a cop with a hidden past and it's very ironic that he's played by steven seagal since he's also someone a hidden past but don't tell anyone because it's top secret perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like seagal became a movie star in the first place since the <UNK> man continues in the vein of all of <UNK> other movies in that it's utter utter crap look at the way he's introduced as his partner walks into his office love <UNK> man in you're in the wrong office steven replies with something that is side <UNK> witty or he would if anyone was able to understand a bloody word he said because for much of the movie he just <UNK> away in fact the only time i could make out his dialogue was the scene at the school where he bursts in on the <UNK> holding the class hostage br br don't make me kill you br br is this what a cop would say to a <UNK> <UNK> i'm just thinking that in another movie where steven isn't the hero ie a good movie the cop would say something along the lines of don't kill me i've got a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home so anyway <UNK> <UNK> goes to blow his head off but steven saves his life by <UNK> them both through two sets of windows it goes without saying that you shouldn't try this at home br br as the story progresses steven i've given up on calling him jack though credit to the screen writer for giving steven a sensible name becomes involved in a case a <UNK> where someone has been stealing bits out of other superior movies featuring serial killers as steven finds more victims you can see him thinking what was that movie that starred morgan freeman as a cop as he <UNK> the bodies oh and the action keeps switching back to the hero's domestic life just so we know that this guy's good as a family man this guy's very good as a family man such a pity he's so bad as a movie star
<START> i should have realized that any two video set being sold for only 6 would be bad i even read the reviews before watching this film and that still didn't <UNK> me i loved the book and i knew it couldn't be as bad as people said br br yeah it is br br a <UNK> of film video and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three hour tour of one chapter of james a <UNK> epic novel well the time period covered was one chapter but i don't remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book the <UNK> on my copy of the movie gives maria <UNK> <UNK> top billing though it turns out that she is only in one speaking scene on the second tape br br the actors are to be <UNK> for playing their roles well despite a smarmy overwrought script they are to be insulted though for accepting the roles in the first place
<START> this certainly isn't a comedy i don't know what it was <UNK> that way as a serious movie it lacks any sort of substance unless you're fresh out of sunday school or needing your <UNK> fix you'll find yourself bored to tears br br the supporting cast took away from what little of the movie was left lauren graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth his children don't really add anything to the movie they seem to be around solely to <UNK> about their absent father at the beginning <UNK> hill plays a creepy internet addict that doesn't come off as humorous br br i found the original to be a decent movie disappointed that this one didn't really go anywhere
<START> it's really good to see van <UNK> film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to c grade <UNK> <UNK> and second in command which were both tragic and not in a good way the <UNK> border <UNK> is a good action flick with some really great action fight sequences it's good to know that van damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film until death had no martial arts in it at all br br that being said this film is significantly inferior to until death which was a really good turn for van damme until death lacked the over the top action of most van damme films but was dark and gritty and van <UNK> performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film still the shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for van damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you're looking for a film with a bit more story line you may want to skip this one br br i do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on the only real problem i have with this film is the title the shepherd i don't get it i suppose border <UNK> just doesn't have the same ring to it without the word shepherd in front of it br br my rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that's by van damme movie standards not in any other film category br br i e it's good for a van damme film
<START> with a title like that you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter <UNK> then after half an hour you decide it is more about the roman catholic <UNK> with even more <UNK> perhaps it is just a <UNK> of the period with lurid characterisation too many <UNK> to <UNK> and a <UNK> regard for fact <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up a colourful but <UNK> rambling <UNK> mash that fails on all three accounts br br <UNK> <UNK> who lost his jewish father to nazi concentration camps is the great director who painted the artist <UNK> as a <UNK> and got away with it won awards for it in fact his life in <UNK> gave him a taste of diverse <UNK> <UNK> especially communism he also made the equally over the top but rather impressive one flew over the <UNK> nest so at the age of <UNK> how does he come to offer us this mess in ghosts <UNK> is one step removed from <UNK> the main character is brother <UNK> <UNK> acted by <UNK> <UNK> natalie portman is equally vibrant as model and later in the film her own daughter the <UNK> connection with <UNK> is that he happens to paint both of them br br <UNK> <UNK> and then rapes who he suspects of being a jew her father <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in to <UNK> spain briefly gets out of the <UNK> the church has left her in and <UNK> for her child <UNK> is still painting but has gone deaf his main <UNK> seems to be helping and so on br br historically <UNK> was also a <UNK> as <UNK> had sadly the idea of a biopic of <UNK> the painter this one fact could have been used to pull the whole film together  a large slice of history as seen by <UNK> but the painter is too <UNK> to receive any weight similarly a document of the <UNK> of the <UNK> should be done  compared to other <UNK> orders throughout time the holy see has been forgiven with barely a confession though one might ask if <UNK> is competent enough to be trusted with a factual account of anything br br i thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story he says in the production notes there were a great many parallels between the communist society we lived under and the spanish <UNK> but the story is too <UNK> to hold our attention against our expectations and with a background of something major the life of a great painter the horrors of the <UNK> and even the french revolution we are instead asked to feel involved in a <UNK> if kind <UNK> of the result is that we feel cheated br br background detail is <UNK> handled <UNK> went deaf in when the film starts not 15 years later <UNK> is as believable as a cut out from a <UNK> <UNK> we see the church passing out a death sentence when the normal <UNK> was for the church to insist that the <UNK> arm did that dirty work battles look overly choreographed and <UNK> a <UNK> of gratuitous naked <UNK> hardly makes up for it br br on the positive side the production values are mostly good the colours are vivid the pacing excellent at least until we give up on finding any worthwhile storyline <UNK> is excellent and portman is a joy until she goes into <UNK> as a mad woman while it doesn't say very much about <UNK> what it does say is nice even if superficial and pretty irrelevant br br i once had a late night drunken conversation where my friends and i asked each other if you could choose a director to depict your life who would it be on his record <UNK> would sadly have to be at the bottom of my list
<START> i love movies in this genre beautiful girls toilet humor gratuitous nudity so why didn't i like this movie no movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot who's who where is the money it's not <UNK> just make me laugh maybe it's me but i never felt this frustrated watching american pie movies or any other more modern national <UNK> movies this movie has no flow that keeps me smiling waiting for what's next instead i find myself stopping to think why did they keep that scene i do not recommend this movie if you are expecting van wilder think again the only fun i had watching this movie was guessing what movies the actors were in when they were kids 2 10 <UNK>
<START> if you're a fan of jackass <UNK> la <UNK> or the videos then you already know what you're in for but this is one of those rare happenings when a sequel is better than the original and man does this movie pack a mean low blow but i mean that in a good way it's the same type of death <UNK> gut wrenching insanity that we have all come to know and love and expect from <UNK> <UNK> and co but this time with even more laughs than ever before with johnny insane tolerance for pain <UNK> love for <UNK> his friends family and steve gross out factor you have one hell of a funny film the bar for the stunts skits and general mayhem of the jackass crew has been raised jackass 3 <UNK> because it's nearly impossible to improve on perfection
<START> the aftermath of world war two almost resulted in the death of soviet cinema in the early years of the 1950s film production came close to a complete <UNK> a mere nine feature films were released in 1951 and the work of all filmmakers was closely <UNK> and often <UNK> by the government following the death of joseph <UNK> in 1953 filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic optimistic and <UNK> stance towards <UNK> that had been prevalent in previous years it wasn't until 1957 that director <UNK> and writer <UNK> became bold enough to produce what is widely considered the first post <UNK> soviet masterpiece the <UNK> are flying ' one of the finest depictions of war i've seen from any country or time period not only was the film <UNK> for its artistic brilliance in the soviet union but international recognition was soon to follow and film was <UNK> with the palm <UNK> at the 1958 cannes film festival br br 'the <UNK> are is both an <UNK> visual feast and an <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of war unlike many soviet war themed films of the time it was less <UNK> by the <UNK> figure of the traditional war time hero and more concerned with the <UNK> brutality and indeed the <UNK> of conflict love as a cinematic concept is too often <UNK> as a notion that somehow <UNK> all and <UNK> endless <UNK> and yet the reality is <UNK> less romantic in the film two lovers <UNK> and boris separated by the <UNK> of the wwii widely known in the soviet union as the great patriotic war 1941 1945 <UNK> to marry after the war but tragedy <UNK> the couple their wish driven to betrayal by the <UNK> torment and <UNK> of waiting <UNK> agrees to <UNK> <UNK> cousin mark <UNK> a handsome but <UNK> youth the film may conclude with the proud victory of the <UNK> and a patriotic flag waving parade but the optimism of this sequence is <UNK> <UNK> by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist who wanders through the celebrating crowds br br perhaps the most remarkable feature of 'the <UNK> are is <UNK> inspired and dynamic hand held cinematography which realistically and captures the chaos and confusion of war not necessarily in the <UNK> of <UNK> and the cries of dying <UNK> in fact only one of the film's sequences joins boris on the eastern front but from the perspective of the family and friends who are left behind in one particularly impressive <UNK> <UNK> long shot the camera follows <UNK> as she <UNK> <UNK> for boris in a crowd of <UNK> <UNK> and their families the hand held camera smoothly follows the girl off a bus <UNK> through the crowd alongside her capturing <UNK> snippets of loved ones saying farewell to their sons and husbands before unexpectedly above the crowd as <UNK> disappears into the dust of a passing <UNK> of army tanks a breathtaking movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode first acquired his filming experience as a military cameraman during the war and obviously fell in love with the storytelling possibilities of hand held photography the camera he once <UNK> can express what the actor is unable to portray his inner <UNK> the cameraman must act with the actors
<START> thank god i didn't buy this movie myself i borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be <UNK> this has got to be one of the worse movies i've ever seen i do realize they couldn't have had much of a budget but i swear i could make a better movie than this staring my pets the acting was horrible so was the editing the dialogue everything it was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as i watched it i'm looking forward to the real movie about this story coming out soon so that people curious about it don't have to <UNK> to watch this joke
<START> when i first saw a glimpse of this movie i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of lucille ball rachel <UNK> portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent to think about a legend like lucille ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous i cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better lucy the producers decided to get rachel york she might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of lucille ball is tough it is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble lucille ball but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent if you noticed <UNK> portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory or <UNK> nothing is similar in any way her expression voice or movement br br to top it all off danny <UNK> playing <UNK> <UNK> is horrible <UNK> does not qualify to play as ricky he's small and skinny his accent is unreal and once again his acting is unbelievable although fred and <UNK> were not similar either they were not as bad as the characters of lucy and ricky br br overall extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told if people want to understand the real life situation of lucille ball i suggest watching a e biography of lucy and <UNK> read the book from lucille ball herself or <UNK> american masters finding lucy if you want to see a <UNK> before the laughter would be a better choice the casting of lucille ball and <UNK> <UNK> in before the laughter is much better compared to this at least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing
<START> when i read the reviews of <UNK> <UNK> ho i thought huh it was that confusing to be sure i went to watch the film and what do you know it's a remake of the wedding singer several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 hollywood hit bollywood is no stranger to remakes but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it i <UNK> so much watching this and i realized i wasn't the only one doing so one guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back salman khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles he <UNK> and <UNK> too much why can't he just take it easy he doesn't do justice to the role originally acted out by adam sandler he doesn't have <UNK> sense of comic timing <UNK> is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites but she's no drew barrymore either the scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new <UNK> hi i'm mrs doesn't match up to <UNK> version hi i'm mrs julia i felt embarrassed watching that scene even though i had loved the original the music is not too bad it's probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film avoid this at all cost
<START> i own the miniseries on dvd because i love this story so much this is one of the best period pieces on the civil war that i have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war the costumes are great the story lines are great i love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives there is a great balance of good and evil some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch every time something more despicable than the last happens i curse the tv as if they can hear me i love how this miniseries makes me feel engaged in it's drama i would advise however not to watch the third movie in the dvd series it's a let down compared to the first two movies and most of the original characters do not return i don't wish to remember how the third movie ended i prefer to live with the thoughts of the ending in the second movie it makes me happy
<START> a wonderful little production br br the filming technique is very <UNK> very old time bbc fashion and gives a <UNK> and sometimes <UNK> sense of realism to the entire piece br br the actors are extremely well chosen michael sheen not only has got all the but he has all the voices down pat too you can truly see the <UNK> editing guided by the references to <UNK> diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a <UNK> written and performed piece a masterful production about one of the great <UNK> of comedy and his life br br the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional <UNK> techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning <UNK> and <UNK> and the sets particularly of their flat with <UNK> <UNK> every surface are terribly well done
<START> let me say first off i didn't go in expecting much and watching it at prime time on opening night should have helped i believe it would have had there been more than 20 people in the theater br br it sucked so hard the acting was robotic at best and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie i guess that was their way of <UNK> the plot keep everyone in the dark on crucial info to understand the movies direction until the end and then explain things and hope it feels like a twist of plot br br <UNK> until the end of the movie what the <UNK> is a dark <UNK> the cg was cool but i want to understand why cant powers be <UNK> especially if mass murder is the ultimatum why is willing away powers so bad your just normal after right who <UNK> br br roughly 50 of the minutes with just men on screen were shots of them in wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and then a gut wrenching pool scene of all teenage men in the low riding <UNK> knowing to ever have been <UNK> i swear you could see the start of the one guys well it was close to soft core and of course there was a shower scene and to mix it up it was of the <UNK> butt cracks were <UNK> a <UNK> fest in progress but there was a single girl shower scene in which nothing was seen and she <UNK> around the best looking <UNK> bathroom for around 12 minutes then there was a girl talk <UNK> party the other thing i couldn't get over was the amount of driving that <UNK> did in his super cool ford <UNK> <UNK> it was a ford commercial for around 1 4th of the movie br br don't see it or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies then it could be worth it but don't expect anything breathtaking
<START> a very weird psychedelic <UNK> and did i say weird experience br br but on at least on one level it did exactly what it was supposed to do it <UNK> the gap between the silly <UNK> hollywood look at teen pop <UNK> that was the <UNK> tv program and the adult <UNK> growing and <UNK> and yet still a little silly <UNK> of the '70s and beyond br br the most important line in the film is mike <UNK> if they think we are plastic now wait till they see how we do it that the <UNK> were tired of all of the negative comments about their image and their work is a matter of record they said it over and over in interviews they needed to re make themselves and what better way that to de <UNK> and hilariously lampoon the very machine that created them and at the same time they commented on our whole society news movies art everything and said hey why pick on us isn't all of this stuff <UNK> on one point or another these are the <UNK> the <UNK> represented the <UNK> <UNK> even at their <UNK> in the tv series pulling down big brother's pants and kicking him in his very deserving butt br br loved the ideas loved the music loved the effects loved the movie but then as peter says in the movie but then why should i speak since i know nothing
<START> i thought this would be funny i did i don't know what happened but i think a lot of the problem unfortunately falls with the casting i don't know who this kid is he could be a very nice person but he wasn't right for this movie and the supporting cast was great which only makes it more obvious for example there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind just starts to wander off but then keith david starts speaking or leslie <UNK> or marion ross and it's like someone turned a light on and suddenly you can pay attention again and you think it might not be that bad but when they get back to the main characters the lights go out again br br the <UNK> material available in the superhero genre is <UNK> so the fact that most of the jokes were basically a fart makes you wonder who wrote this thing i mean it had a couple of funny bits as i do remember laughing a couple of times but right now i don't remember why and it was only a few days ago br br really i'm giving it a take it or leave it rating but i think most people should just leave it
<START> ed <UNK> one of the most famous serial killers of all time he was the inspiration for famous movie killers like norman bates <UNK> and buffalo bill he is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time i watched a documentary on him so i know his story pretty well when i saw this i was curious because i thought it was supposed to be like a documentary re <UNK> but i have to say that this was just a pathetic waste of time first off the facts are completely wrong with a few minor exceptions and secondly this was just a stupid hollywood story when these horrific murders really happened and they just made it into a cheap buck not to mention that if they were going to make it into a horror movie this was poorly acted br br ed <UNK> he lives in a small town in <UNK> called but he has a little secret that the whole town is being <UNK> by he <UNK> up dead bodies as well as brutally murdering people bobby a deputy is on the case to get ed <UNK> only no one knows who the killer is at first just finding crime scene after crime scene but things get personal when ed starts messing with the <UNK> family and friends br br of course this movie was just <UNK> and completely insulting to the true story i always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool to a horror flick but for this story it should have been a better acted film not to mention it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid <UNK> horror film please stay away from this film it's completely pathetic and untrue to the story of ed <UNK> br br 1 10
<START> can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i don't want to pay money to see the whole film again i got to just where they are in the train <UNK> and she says <UNK> about that drink now ' and smiles what happens after that is there anymore dialogue or action surely it doesn't just end there i was a bit bored in the film and kept hoping it would get better i love <UNK> scott thomas does anyone remember the uk tv series she was in about some nuns i am wanting to know the name sean penn was brilliant madonna eat your heart out everybody else in fact the film a bit predictable it was a <UNK> a star <UNK> the ending took me by surprise i really thought she had burnt her <UNK> if you are a fan of any of the stars its worth watching
<START> <UNK> cannot find the perfect mate to make her first time the perfect one with geek friend in <UNK> she enters a virtual machine to improve her appearance when she sees the opportunity to create her perfect man an explosion occurs and the results are left to your imagination problem is how many obvious sex jokes are left anymore how predictable can these kind of movies get a few funny moments here and there but nothing too outrageous or different from jokes in other movies or even normal life if you liked weird science or jokes about the <UNK> out of <UNK> combined with identity <UNK> then by all means these 90 min you could enjoy
<START> if your expecting jackass look somewhere else this an actual movie and for the budget well done the acting <UNK> top <UNK> neither is the writing but the directing was there and so was the story <UNK> worth the rent and possibly the buy if you really enjoy it like i did but for the person who just likes jackass rent it first
<START> altman and scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest american films of the past 20 years boogie nights didn't make a huge initial <UNK> and i still don't think it's received the credit it deserves the immediate <UNK> surrounding the film some porn movie with <UNK> mark was wholly without merit what paul thomas anderson has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the american dream if such a thing still exists br br for those of you who have been living in a box or a <UNK> for the past 8 years boogie nights tells the literal rise and fall tale of young eddie adams <UNK> eddie is just a dopey kid from <UNK> california who wants something more out of life his room is <UNK> in muscle bound naive <UNK> his dreams are far bigger than his potential but not quite as large as his special gift his bald headed southern <UNK> quickly raises the attention and <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> present adult film industry jack <UNK> burt reynolds as the film's <UNK> eyed <UNK> bear gets wind of <UNK> hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie br br before you can say deep throat eddie has changed his name to <UNK> <UNK> and exposed his massive member to a wide eyed public fame and fortune make <UNK> as do a <UNK> of local porn <UNK> his friends and co workers become his <UNK> family but it soon proves to be a sunday <UNK> like no other as the feel good 70s give way to the coke <UNK> video friendly 80s <UNK> co begin a dangerous br br anderson put everything he had into this glorious moving epic it <UNK> and never <UNK> <UNK> a frame of this monumental picture is wasted and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after fades from the soundtrack see this one immediately and then watch it again br br and again
<START> i am right now watching the big chill on dvd one of its actors is meg <UNK> i looked it up on imdb which led me to reading <UNK> bio which mentioned and reminded me of <UNK> sister jennifer <UNK> whose filmography included key west which was one of my wife's and my favorite shows i then read this entire thread of reviews br br wow i really loved that show also and agree with all of the sentiments about the <UNK> and <UNK> of the characters and situations br br as most everyone else i wish it was on dvd or otherwise available br br the last reviewer says he watches it on reruns so i wish i knew what network channel day times it is on br br so if anyone knows how we can watch episodes of key west please let us know
<START> i saw this film many years ago and absolutely hated it i could not wait for it to end and would have walked out but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder you know what i have never forgotten this film and more i would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years how many movies have i <UNK> over and laughed over in the then forgotten as soon as i hit the street like you see i can't even think of one <UNK> are films like death in <UNK> that enter your consciousness and work sea changes the french like to say film is an art and movies like this one prove they are right i give it 10 stars up from the 3 i gave it the night i saw it
<START> what's up with this movie does mr <UNK> and his writers think that a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> between two screwed up <UNK> can carry a feature length movie maybe if it had some comedic elements which is doesn't at least intentionally or there were some additional dramatic elements which there are not or maybe if it was hardcore no it's simply the history of the affair a <UNK> of a bunch of r rated <UNK> ho hum who cares nine <UNK> weeks deserves every <UNK> nomination it got it's a loser br br and by the way what's up with roger ebert and his rave review where was his head back in 1986
<START> the elegant universe brings to light many ideas of the universe and existence after watching this documentary one can't help but take a step back and <UNK> their view on the existence of everything there is a large cast of scientists <UNK> and others on both sides of string theory it is continually brought into question as <UNK> and possibly dead wrong the closest to <UNK> that anyone does is to explain that quantum physics the set of <UNK> ideas that give extremely good <UNK> of what happens to sub atomic <UNK> has never made an incorrect <UNK> not so with string theory no one is willing to say on camera that string theory is the truth and in so doing the piece <UNK> a certain <UNK> distance from the subject
<START> back when i was working person i remember having a really obnoxious client to deal with who insisted on making everything on a personal basis i was telling him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed i was personally out to do him out of what was rightfully his i swear but i was thinking of this guy as i watched john <UNK> and clint eastwood in their battle of wits br br in the line of fire casts clint eastwood as a veteran secret service agent who was on the job in dallas as a young man when john f kennedy was <UNK> he's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real <UNK> he's gotten back on the white house detail now and when a potential <UNK> <UNK> rats on her tenant to the secret service it's eastwood and partner dylan mcdermott who draw the case br br but the assassin is no ordinary <UNK> case he's a professional at his job trained by and used by the central intelligence agency john <UNK> earned a deserved academy award nomination for best supporting actor he lost that year to tommy lee jones for the fugitive and i'm not sure but that i thought <UNK> was better br br oddly enough <UNK> might have been better off but he saw eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal he calls eastwood throughout the film and <UNK> him and after a while what <UNK> says and does causes clint to get real personal br br the presidential <UNK> we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the <UNK> a guy like <UNK> a professional with a real or imagined grudge is the most dangerous kind of <UNK> br br others to note in the cast are fred dalton thompson as the white house chief of staff and would be president in real life <UNK> russo as another agent who falls for the eastwood <UNK> charm john <UNK> as the secret service head gary cole as the white house head secret service guy gregory alan williams as another agent and jim <UNK> and sally hughes as the president and first lady br br but when <UNK> is on he owns in the line of fire the climax with him and eastwood is unforgettable
<START> i saw this movie in santa monica on <UNK> 23 and it has stayed with me i want to thank the filmmakers for digging into the details of harry's enigmatic eccentric life and also for showing the flaws and <UNK> of <UNK> the man thanks for showing the good and bad the ups and downs and for <UNK> that amazing bbc footage the film is also a great showcase of a vast amount of music really well placed throughout the film i recommend this movie to anyone who likes good documentaries especially if you are interested in harry <UNK> or the music scene of the early 70's some reviewer at the ain't it cool website wrote that this was the best movie movie they saw at the santa barbara film festival and i believe it the film is informative funny sad touching and full of awesome music it succeeds on all levels really really good
<START> after seeing the tv commercials for this film i <UNK> to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs in the end it was one of the longest <UNK> i have ever spent the boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn't fill this void br br a scene where the two <UNK> dominate the of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all the only character that was worth watching was played by the <UNK> stephen <UNK> his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs br br a word for this <UNK> is boring save yourself the time and just watch the tv commercial as the only laughs are shown on it
<START> this film was one of the worst films i have ever seen this movie drags on and on and i almost turned it off but i gave it a shot i <UNK> expecting anything great but i was expecting more than this good thing i work at a video store and saw this for free because i <UNK> spend one dime on this movie i gave this movie a 2 only because i have seen worse if i were you i would stay away from this very far away
<START> this film had me <UNK> this evening thanks to fox movie classics for showing it <UNK> john voight this cast of little known black actresses and most of all the children made this a worthy way to spend a sunday evening how wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor as well as paul excellent portrayal of mad billy i can't see why anyone would say that <UNK> <UNK> is miscast in the role as <UNK> who would they have chosen the shrill character actor charles lane although his career is <UNK> an actor such as lane would have <UNK> the role <UNK> was an excellent choice for the part i will count this film as a true treasure to hold in memory
<START> this film simply has no redeeming features the story is incomprehensible and the script is gross sadistic and stupid the sex scenes are a joke as is the inevitable car chase the music is awful the acting is limited largely to <UNK> and <UNK> a half star dud shame on <UNK> for putting it on pay per view in a theater people might well have thrown <UNK> at the screen
<START> before stan laurel became the smaller half of the all time greatest comedy team he <UNK> under contract to <UNK> billy anderson in a series of <UNK> many of which were parodies of major hollywood features most of <UNK> films are only mildly funny and even less funny for modern audiences who haven't seen the original movie which laurel is <UNK> fortunately and <UNK> a movie which is still well known <UNK> and starring <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and was released only nine weeks before this parody giving you some idea of how quickly <UNK> <UNK> movies were ground out edited and distributed br br various sources including imdb state that stan <UNK> character in this film is named with a final <UNK> i've screened a print of and with the original titles in <UNK> type <UNK> so i report that <UNK> role is actually cried <UNK> with an <UNK> but i agree that is funnier laurel copies the elaborate <UNK> which <UNK> wore in <UNK> and he should've made them longer and there's a parody of dressing scene from that movie which made female movie goers <UNK> in <UNK> a named carmen in the original film is <UNK> here as <UNK> a girl i'd like to sink my teeth into br br this movie like the original apparently takes place in spain yet there's a <UNK> gag laurel uses a distinctive hat <UNK> gesture here which could have become a trademark for him like <UNK> distinctive <UNK> but i've never spotted it in any other laurel film there's some amusing dialogue <UNK> tells the other to a bull for me ' when <UNK> becomes a successful a <UNK> tells him 'the bull is without <UNK> which is funny but i was disappointed that laurel didn't <UNK> what ' br br there's one funny moment here which almost certainly wasn't planned when <UNK> shows up for the <UNK> <UNK> laurel into the and before you can say he <UNK> a bull over the fence where it lands with a <UNK> near the other the bull is obviously a fake but the gag is funny anyway and <UNK> there's a title card with a joke about <UNK> the the <UNK> moment occurs when laurel repeats the gag and <UNK> <UNK> a second bull over the fence this one lands on its butt and <UNK> <UNK> for just an instant before <UNK> very funny if somebody planned that gag in this <UNK> comedy i <UNK> the unknown and the tech man who <UNK> the bull to land in that position more likely it happened by luck and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it in br br during the silent era whenever hollywood made a big budget feature film which was set <UNK> where the people don't speak english it was a common cinematic device to show a piece of text or an <UNK> in the local <UNK> then <UNK> to a shot of the same text in english i was surprised that this low budget comedy spent the money to copy that device here we see a notice board outside the with a message in spanish then it <UNK> to the same text in english unfortunately the photography in this <UNK> movie is so dark that the effect is wasted br br the actresses in this movie are attractive including <UNK> <UNK> wife <UNK> anderson and stan <UNK> common law wife mae the latter briefly does a pretty dance mae had <UNK> in <UNK> vaudeville act i was surprised to spot charlie <UNK> half brother <UNK> in a brief role since chaplin had nothing to do with this movie in and laurel gives a funny performance that's quite unlike his later familiar stanley character but this film is much less funny than his brilliant work with oliver hardy my rating just 3 out of 10 trivia note twenty three years later in stan <UNK> very last american film 'the 1945 he again played a spanish <UNK> with his spanish voice post dubbed <UNK> that film used stock footage from <UNK> and not movie but the <UNK> power remake and is funnier than 'the but not much
<START> imaginative quick paced satirical americans do but the brits do and they love to poke fun at themselves <UNK> unattractive teeth large lips nose common or <UNK> obsession with the inside jokes for the older folk in the audience lots of action for the <UNK> subtle use of devices from other classic films watch for <UNK> to the <UNK> jones ' and more also a nifty film <UNK> is a quiet but <UNK> sidekick add brilliant voice work by bonham carter and <UNK> is it true the best acting these days is being done in animation enjoy i saw it with the <UNK> fun time for all
<START> i wish there was a category to place this in other than horror it simply isn't granted it has it's horrific moments however i don't feel that makes it a horror film i will give that this movie could have been better a million little things could have been changed to make it better br br that having been said i love this movie i'm often sad that people <UNK> the whole point of it it has always been clear to me that the point of this movie was to say things aren't always what they seem sometimes <UNK> isn't br br barker was at a con i went to and he did a little talk then watch the movie thing it was very interesting many things he wished to put in the movie couldn't be and a <UNK> was cut out of the movie that he believed to be long lost this was a <UNK> that helped shed light on <UNK> and his girlfriend as well as some other details br br i know some people are bothered by not having more information about all of the in the background however i always felt that gave the movie a more <UNK> fleshed out feel i have read the <UNK> this was based off of as well as many of the comics because of this the movie just always seemed like a staging ground for the whole story a much more involved story that sadly has never has a chance to live br br despite all of the flaws this movie might have i believe it has a lot to offer the <UNK> are wonderful very imaginative while the acting is sometimes a bit stiff there are some very <UNK> lines whenever i watch it i find something new keep and eye on chest toward the end at one point <UNK> stabs him and shortly after <UNK> falls on a card table he ends up with a card stuck to his chest this card stays there for a while even after <UNK> pulls the knife out it stays there until <UNK> casually <UNK> it i love that that was a lovely little detail i thought br br basically what i want to say is that if you are looking for a horror movie don't watch this if you believe that at times men can be more evil than anything we have ever <UNK> up this is the movie for you this is a movie about how men destroy what they don't understand or fear
<START> the film starts well enough it is a truly terrifying scene as a couple of <UNK> on the run from the law tear apart an innocent family living in a secluded country <UNK> by killing the mother and father the young daughter only manages to escape with the aid of a mysterious <UNK> who kills the two <UNK> while she covers in a <UNK> <UNK> then we catch up with her 15 years later as a drug <UNK> student <UNK> the supernatural living with her <UNK> aunt and being looked after by a mysterious <UNK> she has no real friends was almost raped at a party and keeps having bizarre visions which no one else can see so yep life is grand things get a lot more pleasant when she has a falling out with her <UNK> sister who is later found dead in a <UNK> under suspicious circumstances with 11 <UNK> into her <UNK> hmm i wonder who the <UNK> main suspect will be this is quickly followed by more deaths all linked by their relation to our heroine having been on bad terms with them before their passing could she be the <UNK> or perhaps the explanation could be something of a more <UNK> nature clue if you think the former you've picked up the wrong movie from blockbuster go back and get the correct one short <UNK> <UNK> br br as i said i was all ready to fast forward to the good parts safe in the knowledge that i wasn't missing out on anything but a mediocre suspense <UNK> but the first ten minutes grabbed me and i decided to give it a chance i was quite pleasantly surprised it certainly wasn't a masterpiece but the acting was good enough and the script kept throwing up intriguing situations of which i looked forward to finding the solution to alas 45 minutes in i realised my attention start to wander during a long sequence where the main character is walking round a library doing nothing we then get a cheap scare followed by quarter of an hour of about the <UNK> between her and her new hunk of a boyfriend things only got worse from there as the promising beginning is thrown out the window as we get one unconvincing plot twist after another followed by an ending so anti climatic it's like being promised the moon and ending up with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> instead pathetic br br if it was bad all the way through it would have been far easier to swallow the fact that it starts at a and barely ends with a <UNK> is not just disappointing it is heartbreaking how can something which began so <UNK> end up being so formulaic i don't know and i don't particularly care i'll just give the writer and director a bit of advice for next time don't spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your screenplay then 5 minutes finishing the rest you tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as <UNK> as you have here 3 10
<START> i have to ask myself do movies like this get their support by people associated with the movie itself coming here and <UNK> it how can something so awful score this high my parents went to see a lot of the more adult themed movies when we were kids anything with an r in it until we were old enough i only remember two films that had them saying <UNK> when they got home this one and catch 22 br br the movie is comprised of bumbling <UNK> and staff in a filthy hospital rambling <UNK> and a pack of inner city people who look like rejects from a 1970s norman <UNK> sitcom staging a protest the worst part is the murder mystery a crazy old guy doing god's work by killing doctors and others when he <UNK> scott and his girlfriend show little emotion they only care about him getting out of there where he will be safe and happy a doctor that drops dead of a heart attack is <UNK> as the man so he can get away oh my what a fun movie br br this movie didn't make me think chuckle or have any other feeling other than it must get better but it never does people wonder why it was a failure no wonder here i wonder how imdb has enough members that think this movie is good <UNK>
<START> what a terrible movie this was i made it about 50 minutes into it and started skipping chapters until the end the plot is nothing special and the dialog from the movie <UNK> from the main story so much that your head will explode out of rage many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters <UNK> on about something irrelevant to the plot and or something that could said in a shorter amount of time the camera work is shaky and grainy it seemed mr <UNK> needed to take his finger off of the zoom button i noticed also that at some points during this movie it seemed that andy was having <UNK> and would <UNK> shake the camera the <UNK> between scenes were <UNK> and didn't flow the murder scenes were nothing special incredibly and laughably fake barely any gore as the title suggests this movie runs about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute total of the whole movie if that what a wretched piece of garbage this movie was andy <UNK> is in fact probably one of the worst directors to plague mankind with his talentless directing and camera work usually i can make it through really bad horror movies and laugh about it later <UNK> <UNK> however i can't i am just angry i wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this what i wouldn't do to gain it back take my suggestion and do not see this movie unless you plan on falling asleep terrible
<START> my wife and i loved this film smart dialogue great characters clever plot construction the pacing in this film is non stop couldn't even get to the kitchen for some <UNK> we have never seen corey <UNK> this funny taylor <UNK> plays a good fed my wife loves him on that married man hbo show the ensemble cast were all strong the twist at the end had us cheering that is why we give this film a standing o
<START> the imdb plot summary <UNK> makes it sound like it is <UNK> <UNK> movie when <UNK> <UNK> is the central character it is unbelievable how such a cast of established actors could have been in such an amateurish pointless non movie <UNK> breaks up with boyfriend taylor sleeps with the devil i guess played by <UNK> and accidentally kills taylor who follows her about for the rest of the movie as a ghost may be the worst movie i have ever seen
<START> this <UNK> series is beautiful i strongly recommend watching the movie it has got everything it should remarkable script strong characters beautiful scenery and exceptional atmosphere add some <UNK> score from and you receive unforgettable picture i love every adventure movie from <UNK> i saw return to treasure island <UNK> <UNK> but robin of <UNK> beats them all i would like to thank the whole <UNK> production team and richard carpenter in particular for giving me plenty of adventures and excitement i have got the dvd release in my little movie collection i regret very much movies like these are not made anymore
<START> there are spoilers but trust me i'm doing you a favor br br my friends and i like to watch crappy movies every so often inspired by mystery science theater and our knack for on the spot jokes we set out to find movies worth watching that are in fact not worth watching however trouble comes into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them and i am a firm believer in not giving one <UNK> to such a group of talentless <UNK> so as another reviewer has said films like this are a reason why <UNK> movies for free should be <UNK> i prefer the idea of instead of straight to video you have straight to internet that way the ass <UNK> who made this travesty won't ever turn a profit which unfortunately you know they do they hire a bunch of actors who can't act special effects from a high school <UNK> rubber snakes you can get at the dollar store constant <UNK> of green <UNK> o and the two main characters who seem to switch between being border jumping <UNK> who only speak spanish to <UNK> to being 100 <UNK> in english random nudity a guy being shot like 10 times including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in the history of film book cave drawings and hustler magazine the fact that i actually predicted that the <UNK> o <UNK> snake girl would actually <UNK> into a snake about half way through <UNK> me br br anyways the movie is great to make fun of but you have to make sure there's at least 4 of you and you're all spitting out jokes in rapid fire because if there's even 1 second of watching this movie where you're not laughing your ass off you will feel physically ill i kid you not my friends and i were eating chicken wings and now i can't even look at such a thing anymore without being reminded of this piece of sh t br br this film is one above alien vs hunter which is by far the second worst movie ever made and i've seen lots of bad movies incidentally it's the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both as well just thought you might like to know that little fun fact 100 out <UNK> 10
<START> i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high <UNK> cop shows such as <UNK> <UNK> miami and so forth i'm not saying all these shows are bad but they aren't good either i like the karate chop action that walker <UNK> on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the <UNK> series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypes that's right stereotypes unfortunately this is a show for the of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of <UNK> especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers <UNK> into dallas where he encounters group of kids in <UNK> punk clothing and they start <UNK> him now this is exactly what middle america <UNK> the <UNK> punk culture i mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just <UNK> there own business whenever there are blacks and <UNK> in the plot it's always about gangs in some <UNK> neighborhood okay not everyone who's a minority is a desperate <UNK> of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what middle red state america sees of these people finally why is the the bumbling sidekick can't you make the sidekick an equal ass <UNK>
<START> the movie is not bad in itself till you see the original movie <UNK> 2005 starring will smith the movie is a straight copy with even the dialogs for most part of the movie simply translated from english to hindi the plot in the original is tightly executed the hindi version fails to keep the viewers interested the over the top kind of comedy of david <UNK> seems to have gone overboard with govinda hysterically shouting at all times sometimes more time is spent in understanding the reason for that than the plot br br if you know english which i assume you know given that you are reading this see the hollywood original at least watch <UNK> if you have watched partner to be able to compare this is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work i am sad to say is shamelessly lifted by inspired people like david <UNK>
<START> i have been watching this movie repeatedly since it came out even though it is 8 years old now it still cracks me up the jokes are still hilarious and the way the characters are portrayed will make anybody of any age laugh like they've never laughed before enjoy it
<START> long trailer whoever said that has got to be joking this has got to be one of the most in depth behind the scenes or making of documentary ever made how can it be a trailer when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was <UNK> and then brought to the studios this documentary also spends lots and lots of time <UNK> how stunts were done and the new <UNK> created to achieve them then it shows us how woo team came up with the fight scenes along with <UNK> tapes that pretty much put to shame the actual scenes with the actors there is stuff mentioned about matrix <UNK> but there's hardly anything really if you are a real fan of the matrix you have to see this documentary the original documentary in the dvd is good but <UNK> compared to this one for instance it never explained why keanu wore a neck <UNK> in the original documentary but that is explained in <UNK> the <UNK> dvd also shows carrie ann moss <UNK> her <UNK> during the <UNK> scene and being really <UNK> because she feels like she's letting the crew down and that's just the tip of the iceberg so ignore that just a long trailer review and go check it out for yourself you won't regret it casual matrix fans need not apply
<START> first of all let me <UNK> that im not a great fan of political correctness in fact i like satire or dark humor even if it makes jokes out of <UNK> the reason why im pretty sure that this racist piece of work is not worth a look is that it doesn't make fun of <UNK> to demonstrate their condition of living their social circumstances or the way they are treated by society moreover it uses every stupid stereotype and prejudice to <UNK> <UNK> feelings and <UNK> its really a pity but not a surprise that the other comments didn't get that point cause we all had a cheap laugh <UNK>
<START> after the <UNK> of <UNK> it was never <UNK> that and would be able to create anything half as good as <UNK> yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show on the good episodes as <UNK> i cant argue that 2 of the episodes really that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it if i had to pick 2 great episodes id go for driver steve <UNK> <UNK> and the great <UNK> to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as dean <UNK> makes many inside jokes but even if you <UNK> seen much dean id recommend this as some of the <UNK> he <UNK> into are genius ie his argument with <UNK> over their name all in all a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes
