<START> i was one chosen to see this movie in a sneak preview br br first you should know that this film is based on the video game far cry a for its time really good game 2004 second you should know that the of this flick is the great uwe boll this is a man who takes video games <UNK> siege <UNK> <UNK> etc and makes movies out of them very horrible ones br br i still remember when i saw <UNK> the king's swords a <UNK> siege tail there were so horrible mistakes in this film like 3 scenes playing at the same time 2 at day time and one somehow at night br br so lets come to far cry if you expect cool action forget it really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far away from real action if you expect a cool story forget it by the not so bad story of the game this movie is a laugh the actors' playing makes the movie in a lot of moments funny but in a no good way br br i had the chance to see this movie for free so do not do the mistake and pay for this trash its one of my flicks for the bottom 100
<START> when this movie was on br br what a bore an attempt at humor but really not pulling it off too well some good ideas were cast and the actors makeup and wardrobe were ok br br i expected a lot more unfortunately i couldn't sit through any more of it i switched off halfway through the video and <UNK> the tape went to the rental store to get my money back
<START> in a future where an <UNK> travel agency uses time travel technology to send wealthy <UNK> back in time for <UNK> to the age of dinosaurs the future is inexplicably changed when one of their <UNK> breaks the <UNK> rule not to stray off the path in an attempt to fix the damage done a seasoned time <UNK> edward burns teams with the <UNK> of the technology catherine <UNK> br br the premise is pretty good and engaging it may have a few flaws in it but it could still make for an interesting movie unfortunately a sound of thunder fails to really hook the audience in it suffers from a number of problems and it takes itself way too seriously so it's hard to actually have any fun while watching the movie personally i thought the script was the film's biggest problem the were more plot holes than expected and the movie was kind of lazy in explaining things i was hoping for a more in depth look into the <UNK> effect but the film was more <UNK> fun than anything else that's okay with me since 90 minutes of mindless fun is still a nice way to spend an evening however all the fun this film offered was unintentional and lame there were a few scenes that kept me entertained but i was pretty bored br br the acting isn't much better since most of them seem more interested in a paycheck than anything else the only person that gave a good performance was ben kingsley he kept the first half of the film enjoyable and he seemed to be having the most fun as well <UNK> burns was pretty pale and bland i don't think he has what it takes to be a leading man however he could make for a decent supporting actor catherine <UNK> was just really annoying and not very believable i haven't really seen her in anything else but she could have potential the rest of the actors also give bad performances though most of them are relatively unknown so it shouldn't effect their careers too much br br looking at the message boards most people are complaining about the special effects there's no way to them and they are terrible all the dinosaurs look really bad the <UNK> part monkey part <UNK> while a creative idea become stale after awhile and they are most likely to encourage laughter rather than fear the green screen work just looks awful and <UNK> i was really wondering what director peter was trying to accomplish here he fails to deliver the suspense action and thrills and makes this movie a long sit for the most part though the film is pretty harmless and it's far from the worst movie of 2005 hopefully they will remake this film in the future there is potential in this project but for now this is the best we got in the end unless curiosity gets the better of you there is no reason to see a sound of thunder rating 4 10
<START> this is a really obnoxious show it is in fact an example of how low television has fallen since <UNK> got in style <UNK> is pretty but she is also extremely rude and has awful taste is a house show the place for sex appeal apparently some males like the show because they find <UNK> attractive the other boss is not pretty but he's fully as rude and also has awful taste it is unfortunate that so many houses have to be shown while someone is still living in them most of the people who are allegedly viewing these houses before changes are made should be moving into brand new houses or completely empty ones so they will not be insulting anyone most of them like the <UNK> need to be taught manners i can imagine how awful the british show is since the british reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to manners and taste br br what happened to the arts and entertainment channel when it started out and for some years afterward it was filled with treats now it's one big trash machine
<START> this movie was a sweet <UNK> romantic comedy just the kind of movie i usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested it was really funny in one moment probably why i liked it and then just as serious in the next plus it had ellen in it and i've always had a soft spot for her br br basically the owner of a book store helen kate <UNK> finds a love letter in one of the old <UNK> in her store she thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it she has kind of shut herself off from the world so it really throws her for a loop eventually almost everyone connected with her finds this letter and they are all getting mixed <UNK> which creates some really funny moments br br like i said i am usually not one for this type of movie but i really wound up enjoying it and recommend it highly
<START> most films are crappy with high production values this one is crappy without high production values which sets it aside from the large pool of horrible movies as bad as this film was i need to give due respect to kathryn who i believe if given the proper script could probably turn in a pretty good performance she plays emily the girlfriend to <UNK> <UNK> josh who often refers to her as dude or man in a non <UNK> tone br br but <UNK> the thing emily is a semi believable character which means <UNK> will soon need to be added to the cast to <UNK> this almost believable character with a guy even more preposterous than josh when we first meet <UNK> we learn that he is deep because he is <UNK> a lizard which is proof that he sees the world uniquely <UNK> then shows the tape to emily and in one of <UNK> few unbelievable moments she acts impressed by this amateur tape of a lizard wow i believe is how she responds once again with no irony of sarcasm even mildly implied br br from the opening scene you are given warning that the camera work will be crappy we open on a shaky close up of josh as he attempts to win over the viewers by acting goofy oh how care free this main protagonist is that he will act goofy haha this film could almost be a case study in just how bad films can be and for that matter just how far bad films can get in the festival circuit i mean by comparison of most circuit crap this film probably did appear pretty awesome br br i believe <UNK> gave this film some minor award oh south by <UNK> why do you encourage them its only cruel but here is where i hand this film a compliment it is the best of the <UNK> movement mind you all other <UNK> movies sucked beyond belief and generally included grotesque nudity and <UNK> bad acting but still its good to be the best of something br br i haven't seen yet but it looks like maybe they have made a few <UNK> forward the preview at least made it appear tolerable where as even the <UNK> chair preview couldn't really hide the fact that it was going to suck i've gotten off topic here anyways <UNK> is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor at all much like josh most likely isn't an actual actor but rather the director or brother of director there's some mixed messages there i think <UNK> was buddy and they said hey why don't you play this guy named <UNK> in the movie the fact that <UNK> is the name of the actor and character probably means the actor and character are the same unless i am mistaken which i am not br br if <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> off of his face you would probably say he was attractive so anyways <UNK> emily and josh team up to bring the <UNK> chair to <UNK> and <UNK> dad some stuff happens along the way more bad acting bad supporting actors crappy camera work an attempt at significance this film wouldn't have been bad if it <UNK> been so shamelessly pursuing profound self importance br br the whole thing is amateurish if you can view this movie without paying for it like if its on tv or for rent at the library then consider looking at it just to see if you like this super cheap style of film making i like what the are doing the whole make a movie with nothing concept but i wish they would make a movie that someone would want to see
<START> i have never read sarah <UNK> book although i have not read the book the 3 hour movie is very interesting it begins with an interesting storyline with a twisted ending i have to say these 2 actresses are amazing sally <UNK> is stunning successfully portrayed the character in love with her mistress and betrayed by her love their romance slowly <UNK> as they spend more and more time together the love making scene is very tender and emotional well acted the end is quite intriguing and these 2 ended up together after all they have been thru which is a bless overall it is a great movie to see a very interesting plot with excellent performances
<START> i must say that this movie had a great cast locations music and camera work cameron diaz was great she had a very exciting roll very while <UNK> <UNK> had a serious roll yet still capturing one for me very nostalgic she reminds of a female <UNK> of mine what <UNK> got me in this movie were the very <UNK> planned camera work and the choosing of the locations the story is very written it is a must see one the one's who are into mystery movies should watch this one i guarantee you all that it'll keep you in your seats till the end
<START> this is a treat for fans of z grade movies here you will find writing and acting bad enough to rival anything ed wood ever produced veteran bad movie actor cameron mitchell is a former makeup man from <UNK> studios who after a nasty acid in the face incident at a social gathering becomes an <UNK> mad scientist <UNK> with a rubber <UNK> on his face who takes revenge by kidnapping <UNK> actors and turning them into living <UNK> in his secret laboratory <UNK> <UNK> located in the local wax museum or are they zombies who do his <UNK> he's not sure br br happily many of your favourite movie clichés are here check out the <UNK> lab are those mysterious steaming <UNK> of <UNK> test <UNK> of <UNK> water with no explained purpose <UNK> and what ho do we see spare arms and legs arranged kinda casual like on a wooden rack you <UNK> marvel at the bumbling detectives acting with straight out of plan nine now enjoy a <UNK> tame car chase and hear more <UNK> bimbo screaming than you could possibly want raise an <UNK> at the <UNK> plot line made even more <UNK> by the totally meaningless ending that seems to have no connection to the rest of the movie br br cheesy trash and much fun for the bad movie <UNK>
<START> people with an <UNK> to gore may find some scenes hard going but the thing is far from being simply a horror classic the fact that the extraordinary special effects stand up against most modern day cgi is only a small part of why this movie is finally rightfully regarded as a masterpiece technically brilliant in its camera work and editing superbly scripted and acted one of the best <UNK> one of the best endings tension and paranoia <UNK> throughout with countless viewings an excellent soundtrack and open to multiple <UNK> and <UNK> there simply aren't enough <UNK> to do this film justice absolutely essential viewing
<START> mild spoilers dear kind words are hard to find for me to describe the movie i have just been subjected to that stars you the problems are far and wide and painful for me to <UNK> yet i feel i must if only to prevent others from suffering the same anguish as i did this is not a film for anyone under 50 it's <UNK> and when the big reunion of <UNK> and happens the biggest and most important scene in the film nothing happens it is a epic letdown now like the director should have done i will keep my words short and end with this warning your film is disjointed boring has no flow and jude law is <UNK> <UNK> cast he showed more emotion as a robot in a i be warned the film should be <UNK> bored mountain love <UNK>
<START> is set in los angeles sometime in the near future where bodyguard eric phillips co producer don 'the <UNK> wilson saves senator robert <UNK> john from an assassination attempt by a group known as the the union of human rights who are angry at <UNK> for <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> system in which robots called are sent out to determine <UNK> justice on the guilty anyway eric saves <UNK> who is very impressed decides to see if he can trust eric in his shady activities like the cold blooded murder of a <UNK> being the fine <UNK> guy that he is eric isn't impressed when <UNK> kills a woman he is asked to keep it quiet eric escapes sets out to bring <UNK> down however <UNK> has lots of powerful friends he uses his influence to frame eric have his sent out in pursuit of him br br co produced directed by richard <UNK> i think films like give films a bad name i didn't like it that much at all the script by hart is pretty predictable it doesn't <UNK> it steals most of it's ideas theme from other better sci fi films the <UNK> mix of martial arts action sci fi don't <UNK> that well there a few fights some car chases a couple of shoot outs but it's all rather bland forgettable the film lacks imagination considering the film is set in the future it deals with robots technology the way society is run it's <UNK> system in particular speaking of which the fantastic <UNK> 1987 mixed it's violent action clever social commentary brilliantly but doesn't even try to make any relevant social statement or try to portray any meaningful moral message about law <UNK> the script basically uses the concept to have robots shoot outs which <UNK> did as well but also managed to include a good story there is very little in that i can say was entertaining that's what films are about right br br director <UNK> does ok but nothing stands out it's all rather forgettable it's not particularly exciting the sci fi elements are nothing more than the robot side of things as a whole the film doesn't look that futuristic the action scenes are alright there's some exploding cars some shoot outs but nothing spectacular br br technically is average for a film supposedly set in the future it already looks dated the special effects are poor the acting was bad i wonder if don 'the <UNK> wilson signs <UNK> with that name br br was a waste of my time there is nothing here original or exciting the action is instantly forgettable poor that's all that needs to be said not recommended
<START> this film is a completely inaccurate depiction of the real story of <UNK> <UNK> the producers probably did not even read the bible this is the worst movie i have ever seen <UNK> wife was never mentioned by name in the bible but the writers of the film gave her the name this movie depicts the destruction of a good 1000 years before it happened and what about it too was destroyed at the same time was maybe the producers thought that not including in the story and showing the city of as in you know what would raise more <UNK> this film is utter filth and <UNK> god and the bible it is a wonder that any true christian would want to participate in the production of this abysmal hideous mockery of the bible
<START> it's unfortunate that many of the other <UNK> of this film seem influenced by prior <UNK> i e anger at the gay characters thinking french thrillers are bad etc i will admit that i'm unfamiliar with the novel but as a film after about 45 minutes i was rolling my eyes hopefully i can explain in writing my complaints <UNK> enough before i get sick of spending anymore time on this film over the 2 hours of its running length 2 hours that felt like 3 don't get me wrong i can sit through hour and a half silent films 3 hour epics i don't have a short attention span nor am i so jaded by the mtv generation that i cant appreciate a subtle and slowly building film here goes my <UNK> list of complaints first off the ending yes it had a scooby doo esquire character explains everything at the end now i actually think for this movie this was necessary the film had so many plot twists emotional revelations new facts <UNK> and being discovered one reviewer said it well yes it is a very logical story but without the very essential back story their childhood stories the relationship amongst the 3 parents the relationship amongst the two <UNK> and the son of the big man it just doesn't feel right i felt cheated i won't throw in too many spoilers here i could name specific revelations that i thought were unnecessary but according to the reviews on here there's a lot of people who seem to really love this so i don't want to give anything away i personally can't stand soap operas the complexity and twists and turns for me <UNK> out any impact the final revelations could possibly deliver by the end i seriously didn't care there weren't any <UNK> plot holes necessarily this seems like it could make a great book in writing it is perfectly logical but if i'm supposed to believe this is reality something doesn't sit right with the pieces that have been <UNK> inserted too often i felt crucial characters we were never able to get to know were thrown in to further <UNK> the plot increase the emotion and develop the mystery the acting i had no complaints about the directing eh not bad but the plot and especially its development severely lacking sorry to those that felt this was a perfect thriller but i couldn't get into it i gave this a 3 simply because i don't want to seem completely unfair and it did have moments of slight intrigue and excitement br br major spoiler and i have to mention it but when the father is making his revelation to alexandre and just when you think the plot couldn't fit in another twist your father didn't die in a hunting accident i almost died when was the father at all developed or even really mentioned much in the back story are you serious like the already complex plot involving characters from all the families and their relationship to one another wasn't enough does the protagonist need another emotional more than he has already been fed sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler but that just bothered me as much as i've ever been bothered in any film
<START> a woman as rich as she is insecure has a history of alcoholism and nervous <UNK> helped no doubt by a smooth talking <UNK> husband who openly <UNK> on her naturally nobody believes her when she claims to have been <UNK> by a giant man who stepped out of a giant satellite much to the delight of her husband this could be the incident which finally puts her away for good br br from the very opening scenes with it's ludicrous news broadcast and ridiculous satellite encounter you'll probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it is so bad that it is funny although not too far off the mark this is most definitely not true br br unlike most movies of this genre this is not really a sci fi or a horror film but actually a serious drama which intelligently <UNK> a sci fi scenario into the plot it's not a good or even mediocre drama but it will <UNK> your expectations if you weren't expecting any legitimate drama at all the acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort and most importantly it is well edited and excellently paced it is never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest in seeing what will come next nevertheless this is still a movie strictly for those who can't pass up the chance to see a 1950s film with a title like attack of the 50 foot woman
<START> this film was actually shot and made in 1987 but it didn't hit the theaters until 1990 as i watched this film i could see the good intentions that it had but i'm afraid there wasn't much talent or experience behind the camera to make it work story takes place in california in the <UNK> and some italian immigrants who own are told they have to leave their land so a <UNK> can come through dennis hopper plays william who has offered money for the land but has been turned down <UNK> <UNK> is sebastian and he is to proud to leave and asks the other <UNK> to stand up and fight to keep their land grows <UNK> and hires a bunch of thugs to force everyone to <UNK> these thugs are headed by a man named andrews burt young and he doesn't hesitate to kill anyone who gives him problems andrews and his men kill one night and his son <UNK> eric roberts <UNK> to seek revenge and get the land back for everyone <UNK> blows up the bridge that the <UNK> was going to need and they also destroy a tunnel and this sets back the project for several months and now starts to get heat from other <UNK> this film was directed by peter masterson and besides the trip to <UNK> he has at best a <UNK> career in directing he's a fine actor but here he seems to be in over his head this was a film that desperately needed more attention to detail and its easy to see that it didn't occur roberts <UNK> is perfect for the 1980's but this is suppose to be <UNK> the cinematographer is <UNK> <UNK> who ended up being a good cameraman but this was only his fourth film and he certainly had not learned everything at that time its not a sharp looking film at all and i noticed in several shots during the day that the sun would be glaring off of something and the scenes just don't have the that would have helped the overall look the script is just a revenge story and no surprises take place during the course of the film we know <UNK> is going to get it and it seemed just a matter of time the cast is top notch and they do their best but the whole film comes across as uninspired this was promoted as julia roberts film debut but i'm not sure that is correct she might have appeared in a film called <UNK> before this
<START> ok look this show is the worst show on nick night i love so many shows on nick night and i love them when this show came on to nick night i was so annoyed it's such a boring show and it is corny out of all the times i've watched i found one episode slightly funny this show has some of the most unfunny and stupid jokes ever this show sums up to terrible give props to fresh prince of <UNK> air and george lopez this show is boring and not the least bit clever this show should have been canceled much earlier i don't think it deserves to be played on nick night alongside some great classic shows this show is lacking <UNK> good jokes and style
<START> it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it so this is about a gay man falling for a straight women first of all this is a true story so you cant say its not believable second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid personally i think this was the best love story i've ever seen and i am very pro gay i think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex and it has nothing against anyone who is gay straight or <UNK> unlike so many other shows maybe we in europe take to it more <UNK> most tv here are a bit deeper and make you think more then american tv plus we don't fear when it comes to showing certain things br br if you want something funny with one of <UNK> best <UNK> sharp and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much <UNK> this is for you i know i love it
<START> looking backwards to that year 2002 when <UNK> was made one can easily recognize the <UNK> sings of today's new generation in romania br br the main qualities of <UNK> stand in a very solid script with a substantial dramatic core and a really professional developing plus a cast of excellent actors all four leading roles are admirably performed both with depth and <UNK> and andy confirmed since then being two of our best performers today follows them closely and adrian a non professional in real life a graveyard manager cast as was a genuine revelation br br further directing is skilled and <UNK> creating in a very compelling style that feeling of a <UNK> night and <UNK> destiny one can easily pass over the few awkward and even failed moments since time proved them to be only the <UNK> inherent to a debut never repeated in his subsequent movies <UNK> fi and boogie
<START> like a few people i know i came in late on not until 2000 three years later there is no way i'd miss an episode the show really is that good and has for a better word <UNK> its integrity unlike <UNK> for example the crime is the thing personal lives are there but only <UNK> out when affecting an investigation when gary sweet was brought in some fans seemed worried but he's really <UNK> in well which didn't surprise me gary could measure up to any british or us actor in a similar series the cast changes occasionally but each change brings something new and fresh with arguably <UNK> finest crew behind the scenes will continue to remain a cutting edge drama series
<START> i love this movie i think i've seen it 5 times already it was quite a success in france and they often play it on tv ok it's a thriller and there is great tension but mostly and specifically in the second part it is absolutely hilarious and very original the directing and photography are just splendid
<START> george hilton never really grabs me like franco <UNK> or clint eastwood but this is a great outing for him basically off the <UNK> man with no name and doing a damn good job the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch fans of the genre will be in heaven
<START> i watched it because my friend said we could try it when my father asked if we'd watch it i didn't want to because it was such an old film how could that be good i finally did watch with that friend and my father my friend and i loved the film the songs are great the actors were cool and we were crazy about it i guess this shows even though it's from <UNK> time that doesn't mean it can't be a good film i bought the film not so long after seeing it on tv i put it on a lot and sang along with the songs i even watched it with my classmates on my birthday party it's a nice good and sometimes funny film br br if you don't try you can't say it's bad even if you think no i'm not going to watch a film from <UNK> time try the first part of the film you can always stop watching if you don't like it i really recommend it it's great
<START> the creative team of jim <UNK> david <UNK> and jerry <UNK> had their roots in <UNK> theatre in madison <UNK> i believe it was they had a group called fried or something similar they put a bunch of their set pieces onto celluloid fried <UNK> 1977 which was long <UNK> <UNK> and really funny br br they followed up with the very popular airplane 1980 which really put them on the map in it they took some rather well known veteran actors in robert stack and especially leslie <UNK> and putting them in prominent roles <UNK> to parody every cliché of every <UNK> film since the days of john wayne's production of the high and the mighty 1954 <UNK> stuffed with cash and now having been noticed the trio worked out a deal with television and the american <UNK> company tv network to do a half hour comedy spoof of the nearly countless police crime drama show that have come and gone on our television screens over the years remembering the fine job that mr leslie <UNK> had turned in on airplane he was cast in the lead br br as sgt lt captain frank the rank <UNK> switch being one of their comic bits he <UNK> over a great series of <UNK> <UNK> sight gags non and overblown police crime clichés all of these strung together by some seemingly standard scripts added to this is overly dramatic opening narration voiced over information <UNK> the visual <UNK> info they always used this in giving the title of the episode titles where voice and <UNK> titles never matched br br they had a great musical score which even though being somewhat exaggerated would have passed as theme and incidental music in a straight drama the musical score the opening titles and format of having the episodes divided into act i act ii <UNK> etc were all part of obvious but <UNK> <UNK> of q m quinn martin productions they even had the same <UNK> as did the real q m 's br br one thing that this all too short of a series did not have was a technically <UNK> audience laughter and boy they sure didn't need any phony <UNK> the nature of the spoof was such that it <UNK> the viewer's close almost <UNK> attention and that proved to be the ultimate reason behind police downfall br br in regards to the series <UNK> an abc executive explained that the episodes called for too much attention on the part of the viewer so isn't that what one would want br br so after only 6 wonderfully wacky hilarious episodes off to the <UNK> of series <UNK> went police squad only to be <UNK> in the naked gun trilogy made for the big screen in movie houses once again they did quite well at the box office oh well tv's loss is <UNK> gain thanks to you mr idiot tv <UNK> br br the high and mighty was produced by the <UNK> own productions and released by warner brothers it was <UNK> for quite a number of years and finally mr wayne's family made <UNK> to release it to television and to video
<START> when the word presents finds its way into a title <UNK> by a famous name the work is usually immediately for some reason people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others however i've always been willing to give the second installment of the demons trilogy a try for one thing the <UNK> are absolutely to die for most american directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of demons 2 for another well two words asia <UNK> of course she was eleven when this film was made and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early helen <UNK> steamy looks and little clothing as well <UNK> <UNK> comes from one of <UNK> finest <UNK> in that odd horror sub genre known as giallo he's the son of mario <UNK> who may well have invented the genre in the sixties and the original demons is an absolute must see for fans of eighties b horror films so how bad can this be right well bad the demons continue their assault on italian media as the movie opens in a modern italian high rise where many people going about their lives have their <UNK> on in the background they're all watching a kind of combination news report <UNK> video of some <UNK> reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film which would seem to put the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first film through the usual horror film extra inability to concentrate the <UNK> manage to bring a demon back to life and he comes through the tv screen to start the plague <UNK> br br yeah it's that bad about the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack when you're not being <UNK> about by the likes of the <UNK> the cult gene loves <UNK> etc is stunning it comes from the keyboard of simon <UNK> who got his start as a part of the <UNK> <UNK> and has since gone on to score such films as lord of <UNK> and <UNK> br br makes a half decent free rental if you're planning on drinking heavily but it's certainly nowhere near the fun the original was <UNK> wonderfully funny high rise nasty creature romp <UNK> aka they came from within is a whole lot better
<START> the quick and the undead is finally the first movie to actually render its own storyline <UNK> and void it is essentially one gigantic plot hole br br aside from that the acting was quite bad character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth hanging our hat on the most interesting cast member who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist got <UNK> halfway through the proceedings br br what the quick and the undead does serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color timing it looked excellent when you take into account budget <UNK> br br unfortunately it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns most notably the good the bad and the ugly and then just threw a bunch of elements <UNK> into a movie you know they have movies where characters do this does it fit here no but who cares they do it in other movies so i should do it here br br maybe a good view for <UNK> <UNK> and first year film <UNK> otherwise a must miss
<START> now i know that a lot of black humor <UNK> fun at typical black things like for example gold teeth but that doesn't mean that they always are funny don't be a menace is an example of this the urban movie certainly lends itself for satire the problem is that wayans and not only try <UNK> the typical culture they also <UNK> valid statements that are made in urban movies such as <UNK> <UNK> the hood or menace ii society personally i think that the makers of this movie should get their heads away from the <UNK> movements of their white masters besides this the movie in itself is terrible it's absolutely not funny the jokes are racist instead of <UNK> the urban movie genre the <UNK> show their views of the urban ghetto blacks now there are some other jokes in this movie but i believe this to be the main fare br br in conclusion this movie is crap and the makers should use their talents to make a <UNK> comedy satire movie they have examples in men with black hats which was made before this movie and friday
<START> this movie i would like to say was completely great i can see how many people would think that it's just a shocker film this isn't completely untrue but it's as much of shocker fiction as chuck books are one of my favorite movies of all time no is a certain type of <UNK> made movie that you can have just about any reaction to it's scary funny silly gross full of off the top material and to some people <UNK> the fist time i saw this it was with my friend and his mother had brought it home for him to see it he said it was just some screwed up japanese movie but i saw so much more of it it's badly made yes but it has a certain type of <UNK> as to be beautiful too as the director says himself this is a shocker movie made for a certain reason its like <UNK> if you leave audiences soft then the entire human race is going to be soft i think this is a good philosophy and i agree with it one hundred percent no is the type of movie that gang rapes the hell out of <UNK> <UNK> and all of this new wave stuff
<START> whether one views him as a <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> or a glory hunting <UNK> <UNK> about the life and military career of george armstrong <UNK> continue down to the present day they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the <UNK> story and has taken liberty with others br br he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to <UNK> general his record leading the <UNK> <UNK> under his command was one of brilliance br br it was also true that his marriage to <UNK> bacon was one of the great love matches of the 19th century <UNK> and george were married for 12 years until the little big horn what's not known to today's audience is that <UNK> survived until 1933 during that time she was the <UNK> of the <UNK> legend by <UNK> of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way br br i think <UNK> walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the <UNK> career told in flashback olivia <UNK> should have been made up the way <UNK> macdonald was in <UNK> and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and <UNK> even then the cracks in the <UNK> legend were appearing but if done from <UNK> point of view they could be understood and forgiven br br sydney <UNK> gave a fine performance as general <UNK> scott the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with <UNK> he was retired and replaced by george b in late <UNK> while <UNK> was still at west point i'm not sure they ever met but <UNK> does a good characterization of the <UNK> and powerful <UNK> scott a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave <UNK> instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and <UNK> br br the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema errol flynn and olivia <UNK> this was the last of eight films they did together the last scene they ever did for the cameras was <UNK> farewell to george as he leaves to join his <UNK> for what will prove to be his last campaign both their performances <UNK> especially was a high point in their careers at warner brothers we know through history that <UNK> is riding to his doom that and the fact that this was their last screen <UNK> give this scene such a special <UNK> if your eyes don't you are made of <UNK> br br as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action you can't beat this film at all
<START> crash is supposed to be a film about racism in los angeles but in fact it's just a bunch of <UNK> between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world who the hell is going to believe that there are unrealistic situations one after the other on the other hand this film pretends to show racism between <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> blacks and whites but the big error relies on a pre establish racism coming from the writer mainly because the white characters in this movie are usually portrait as people with a better social <UNK> status than the rest of the other races <UNK> are poor just like the <UNK> and <UNK> as always are portrait as <UNK> police officers or with a very low profile job like a jesus don't you guys think it's about time to change these stereotypes same with blacks portrait as gang members with the exception of a black tv director who was the only fresh character for me this movie sucks so hard that makes me so disappointed about the kind of cinema coming out from hollywood these days always with stereotype characters no realism whatsoever nothing to identify with it's simply a big waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and blacks from a different perspective
<START> heather graham married carl luke wilson and about five hundred and some days later carl is very depressed and leaves her expecting to clean the <UNK> in their lives faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life and decides to look for carl in texas she is very supported by her brother jay <UNK> affleck who meets her in the border of mexico there meets the confused carl and realizes that she can not change his decision while jay knows carmen patricia and starts dating her and in the end life goes <UNK> this movie is very unpredictable having a very different story i believe it is an independent production in some parts it is a little slow and boring but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile i liked it and my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> o rebels until the <UNK> br br
<START> i have watched grand champion all the way through at least twice now i enjoyed the movie's story the characters and the actors were not bad it is refreshing to see a g rated movie this is a feel good movie the story is mostly from the view of the children the interactions between the kids and the adults makes the story interesting i recommend this movie if you are looking for a family film if you liked the little <UNK> you will probably enjoy this i viewed this movie on cable either on <UNK> or showtime family this is not a movie that i would have gone to see at the theatre but i only go to the theatre for the effects of the big screen so most comedies romantic films or dramas i do not go for big screen i wait for tv cable edition get your kids together pop some popcorn and enjoy
<START> only light spoilers in here br br stealing sinatra is a half slapstick comedy about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> victims and a few other side stories thrown in to eat up some time br br you will see some poor performances all around in this movie the drama is forced and the humor makes no sense whether you're watching the <UNK> <UNK> the victim who won't shut up or a <UNK> father <UNK> to the <UNK> death threat with care for some tea none of it is believable this quite <UNK> fits into the wannabe movie category br br you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie it's quite <UNK> and adds nothing it's really just a sad attempt at making an <UNK> unfunny movie seem somewhat witty br br however if you're able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief you might be entertained by the adequate storyline br br i voted 4 10
<START> linda <UNK> as <UNK> and harry as frank are enjoying a romantic <UNK> when in walks her father charles <UNK> furious he chases mr out of the house he goes to her balcony and begs her to <UNK> ms <UNK> is <UNK> and goes to pack then <UNK> george arrives to rob the place though he doesn't get much in the way of <UNK> <UNK> manages to use <UNK> to escape from the br br a contrived comedy note during the balcony scene goes off camera so <UNK> can enter the house <UNK> and <UNK> travels very light since there appears to be nothing in her heavy <UNK> perhaps she just wanted to buff up beau director d w griffith robert harron and <UNK> lawrence are <UNK> extras br br a <UNK> <UNK> 8 7 <UNK> d w griffith george linda <UNK> harry
<START> this representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch i know it is one of the earliest efforts at <UNK> but this 15 minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot the great train robbery <UNK> which i also commented on is much more creative and exciting to watch br br we see little long haired jack trade a cow 2 men in a cow suit for a of <UNK> from a <UNK> and later a grows from where his mom throws them in the yard i guess poor jack <UNK> the wrong kind jack dreams of a <UNK> actually it seems to be a chicken and golden egg and the next day climbs the stalk into heaven br br there is no effort made to be creative in this film the stalk looks like a rope with leaves on it the giant is just a tall <UNK> guy in a home with nothing <UNK> large in comparison to jack and the climax to the film where jack makes his escape with the <UNK> chicken and its golden egg is miserable as a stuffed <UNK> falls from out of in place of the giant and then the actor takes its place rising up on his feet in a exaggerated death dance like in most early films the <UNK> covered rope comes <UNK> down from above and <UNK> neatly on the giants <UNK> br br watch something else
<START> where the hell did <UNK> find the scriptwriter for this movie out of high school this movie tries so hard to be sympathetic to michael jackson but instead turns him into a horrible tacky caricature all the lines are filled with clichés but surprisingly the acting wasn't bad as usual this is a bad movie with pretty good actors the actor that plays michael jackson <UNK> i feel sorry for him i think he did the best he could with the weak script i didn't mind that <UNK> did not look like michael jackson i thought he did the best he could but later on when he had all that white make up on oh man did he look <UNK> the other actors that played debbie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and elizabeth taylor were pretty good except that the actress that plays liz taylor looked too young and healthy to be playing liz the actress that plays diana ross didn't look at all like her and i couldn't figure out who this woman was until much later on in the movie br br this movie does a <UNK> to everyone who is on the side of michael jackson or against michael jackson it doesn't do anything to change anyone's opinion as a matter of fact the only opinion anyone will have after watching this movie is oh god this movie really really sucks and where the hell is michael jackson's wonderful music and songs there are none to be found in this movie i love the soundtrack to this movie anyway and i'll probably purchase it if i could br br on the lighter side though this is a very funny campy movie it's a great time <UNK> if you want to watch something light that won't trouble your brain too much i'll probably watch it again because it just is so <UNK> bad
<START> the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination for one the villains look almost normal not what you would expect deranged <UNK> to look like for another the pacing is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves by that i mean there is a lot of filler in the movie with a lot of running around <UNK> the film didn't have a clear direction the plot of the movie is hardly original even for its time the texas chainsaw massacre came out a few year earlier and is a much more effective film as far as horror goes the film has little in the way of scares and the <UNK> soundtrack just served to be both grating and distracting all at once i suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much happens through much of the movie though it failed in its intended purpose i basically kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping something would happen or it would end when something finally did happen any promise the film had was ruined by mere chaos and loud noise i sat through it because i like to give a film the benefit of the doubt yes there is some loud screaming and yes people die but who cares much too slow getting to any sort of pay off if you can call it that my buddy enjoyed it so at least one of us got something out of it the hills have eyes isn't the worst film we could have watched but i doubt i will watch it again this film was remade in 2006 and i will also have review of that version anyway this movie was painfully slow at times while other times was chaotic and repetitive unless you like watching paint dry occasionally interspersed with someone running around your block screaming their head off stay away from this movie a better bet would be the original texas chainsaw massacre 1973 1 5 out of 10 which is being generous
<START> emily watson and tom <UNK> together what a treat with rupert everett and linda <UNK> <UNK> off the supporting roles to the <UNK> of lies and intrigue yet at the heart of it all each character maintains a streak of decency moral conscience held up in spite of obvious <UNK> <UNK> are the source of all movement and of all life how true these words are <UNK> anne <UNK> is at the core of this intrigue she's the central conscience that the other three <UNK> on she is the decency <UNK> br br the circumstances of lies are to each its own one to defend one's professional name one to hold back due to family partner pressure one simply don't want to face the consequence one ironically can't believe the truth and lies to save friendship these are all <UNK> situations there lies the intrigue fascinating to watch how each <UNK> truth and lies <UNK> indeed in spite of the seeming <UNK> decency and heart remain strong br br the treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity it's not sensational or complex as another film where the truth lies 2005 credits due to <UNK> writing and the nuanced performances of both watson and <UNK> there is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly or <UNK> hidden lies beneath it all human <UNK> not <UNK> they meant well and following along with the story the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two seem to have grown and <UNK> in their relationship br br you might say there's no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in separate lies yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention the deserving production efforts include cinematography by tony pierce roberts a veteran to the <UNK> <UNK> films and music by with mood and tone reminiscent of composer of filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> especially <UNK> 1993 this is a british film you just might not want to miss br br emily watson anne the wife breaking the waves 1996 debut <UNK> and jackie 1998 the luzhin <UNK> 2000 <UNK> park 2001 punch drunk love red dragon <UNK> in 2002 br br tom <UNK> james the husband the full monty 1997 the <UNK> rush hour as villain in 1998 in the bedroom 2001 normal hbo cable movie 2003 eternal sunshine of the <UNK> mind 2004 recently as father moore in the <UNK> of emily rose 2005 opposite laura <UNK> br br rupert everett bill he is simply delightful in my best friend's wedding 1997 opposite julia roberts and marvelous in an ideal husband 1999 d oliver parker an oscar <UNK> play recently as sherlock holmes with ian hart as dr watson in <UNK> mystery sherlock holmes and the case of the <UNK> <UNK> 2004 tv br br linda <UNK> maggie she was very effective as ella khan opposite <UNK> <UNK> in east is east 1999
<START> there is an endless supply of trashy horror movies it seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and thrill alas very seldom these attempts succeed this unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value the story is highly predictable most of the actors very uninspired or just <UNK> miscast special effects of very low quality it took a lot of effort not to switch off the dvd and go to bed with such a limited number of foreign movies <UNK> in the usa why in the world would anybody want to <UNK> this drivel to top it all apparently there is an <UNK> 2 for those who have nothing better to do i'd rather watch the paint dry
<START> this movie is a disgrace how can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into some kind of half <UNK> love story the entire beginning of the movie was not in the h g wells story and didn't need to be also the were done completely wrong they did build houses or form any kind of real society they didn't care about each other at all that was an important part of the story the way they had formed a world that was without <UNK> or complex emotions they were barely even aware of the i don't know why this movie was made the way it was but some stories should be told as they are or left alone
<START> the title of the film seems quite appropriate given the persona of the lead character he's an older man living in the late <UNK> of his life yet <UNK> about as a <UNK> school boy who's just entered a spring <UNK> the <UNK> of old age and the warning signs of death are all <UNK> to him his wife supports this idea when she <UNK> laughs at <UNK> and death in other words death is not something takes too seriously he has more important things to do than worry about what already is inevitable life however and the pursuit of living life to its <UNK> is the philosophy that <UNK> existence he is not one to merely exist but must live for each day and each passing moment for tomorrow is not guaranteed br br the film seems to make a strong commentary about living as though there is no tomorrow let alone death too many people take life much too seriously and consequently miss out on the actual living part of life wife for example she's so worried about preparing for death not in some <UNK> way but in a far too practical even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile laugh and just have a good time her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie auto pilot mode to the contrary is perhaps too <UNK> and absent minded for his own good he needs a person like his wife <UNK> to help balance him br br it's as though possesses the <UNK> spirit of a child like a kid trapped in an older man's body he is introduced as the adventurous type he pretends to be people he's not in order to get gain <UNK> money lies and is always up for a good laugh deep down though he is a kind hearted and gentle old man who wishes to be <UNK> to his overly <UNK> wife the two off set each other quite nicely though neither one of them truly <UNK> the quality of their relationship until they <UNK> chance upon death meaning their divorce it is during this courtroom scene that realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love his wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws yet is <UNK> drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior in this moment of her <UNK> him realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife <UNK> and makes an internal commitment to make her happy br br ironically though after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls a living corpse the life blood within him <UNK> away as he becomes more like zombie going through day to day motions he doesn't seem to live anymore but exist for example he gives up his zany pranks doesn't <UNK> money <UNK> smoking on account of his wife not his health and overall just to whatever she wants of him <UNK> put he changes on account of wanting to make her happy thus the quality of their relationship begins to slowly <UNK> realizing that her husband is not who he used to be there is a part of <UNK> that misses the old she misses her husband's <UNK> and the fights they used to have because it was in those moments that they were truly living not just simply existing br br i believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient but often times will take sacrifice and <UNK> to <UNK> through the seemingly bad times the possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment life is often taken for granted but when threatened with it literal or awake from their <UNK> and are <UNK> to start living life to its <UNK> it's as though they are scared that they'll never live again so they better make the most of it while they have it and <UNK> had been married <UNK> years with fights along the way but it wasn't till they were both threatened with the possibility of death like <UNK> that they began to show their true colors as the old <UNK> goes love knows not its own depth until the hour of <UNK> they both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way more importantly the intimate relationships they make with their significant others
<START> a satire about greed and money what there is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they <UNK> try to make fun of jim <UNK> reign was certainly short lived he is an unbearable presence on the screen the <UNK> of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy he produced this this masterpiece as well so he can't blame anyone here the number one comedy in america shout the desperate tv adds of course jim carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over if i sound angry is because i am i spent a sunny afternoon in california plus between tickets parking flat <UNK> etc almost 45 bucks on this thing starring and produced by mr carry not anymore do you hear not anymore
<START> maybe i'm reading into this too much but i wonder how much of a hand had in developing the film i mean when a story is told casting the main character as himself i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing <UNK> etc and that would make it a little biased br br but his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about life i think the best view would have been told from family and <UNK> perspectives they saw his transformation and weren't so messed up on drugs that they remember everything br br as for being full of himself the of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a <UNK> who sacrificed his life <UNK> of course he's obviously still alive as he was cast as himself for his family's happiness huh br br the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a <UNK> complex he lies on the grass coming down from during a high by himself and with his father he <UNK> life and has visions of dragons at his window he <UNK> his freedom on a <UNK> all while his arms his head <UNK> to the side br br it's fabulous that he's off of drugs now but he's no hero he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle br br this same device is used in ted <UNK> blow where the audience with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero br br however <UNK> is a film that is recommended mostly for its haunting soundtrack superb acting and landscapes but the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of <UNK> is actually a stage setting for a play it makes the viewer feel as if life was merely a play told in many difficult parts
<START> the <UNK> children is perhaps my favorite film of all time simply for the brilliant acting of the cast the warm <UNK> interaction of the 3 children and the people they encounter living near the <UNK> in the beautiful english countryside jenny is especially believable in her role as the older sibling of her sister <UNK> and brother peter the adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinating the scenery is lovely the trains a part of <UNK> vast history and the soundtrack is very moving this heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyes each and every time as well as makes me <UNK> i often wonder if i should have been born in that era as i think i would have <UNK> in just fine as people treated each other with such <UNK> and decency br br in short i consider this film somewhat of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a <UNK> or caring <UNK> edith wrote this story around the beginning of the <UNK> and what a wonderful story it is more kids today need to read this or see the film instead of playing violent video games if we had more films of this nature the world would become a better place
<START> a jane <UNK> novel loosely based on shakespeare's king <UNK> about the cook family and its dark secrets director seems <UNK> in her approach allowing the characters to step forward and take a bow and how could you go wrong with the talents of pfeiffer lange leigh <UNK> carradine and <UNK>
<START> the french people are not known to be great movie producers br br though their <UNK> scores high points at the oscars <UNK> et is a very different film of what i am used to from the french it is a great movie especially for kids the only thing that me was that it was spoken in french and normally with the english spoken movies here in the <UNK> i don't have to read the subtitles but with the french language you just have to read to understand the story it self is just great with who doesn't recall him self of fat but there also nice details mainly in names like and you all know the story from the comic books and this movie shows all most slide by slide the book every thing is in it from the nose <UNK> till pirate red <UNK> lose of three more ships i would say a great movie for the weekend with the children
<START> this is what used to be called a women's picture and later a <UNK> flick when times and movies got more juvenile the plot is just soap opera for women and will only appeal to those types the only appeal for most guys is if they wanna see a too <UNK> thin mary tyler moore in <UNK> if you're of a certain age like me that might still be enough to give it a look otherwise <UNK> gives another of her typical by the numbers performances that she's been giving since the early 70s when she took it to heart that she was america's sweetheart christine gives another of those <UNK> and unpleasant performances that seem a real part of her as a person and probably only appeal to those of that type sorry but it seems true ted <UNK> is too young as husband and usually gives off a slightly creepy appeal unless he has an acting partner who can <UNK> it and it doesn't happen here allan burns wrote directed and probably got it all through because he worked with mary before wrote it as a project for her and she had the juice at this point to get it made there seems no other purpose to it
<START> murder over new york is one of the better chan mysteries and i've just seen this for the first time br br in this one charlie chan is visiting new york to attend a police convention at the same time people who are involved with aircraft plants are being murdered and he decides to help with the investigation along with his number 2 son these murders turn out to be the results of <UNK> at the aircraft plants and chan helps to identify the murderer br br charlie chan is played well by sidney <UNK> and the rest of the cast includes <UNK> <UNK> as his number 2 son and <UNK> weaver br br i rather liked this mystery and is worth having if you like this sort of thing br br rating 3 and a half stars out of 5
<START> i actually <UNK> to lifetime channel by mistake just as this movie was beginning and ended up watching it br br it certainly deals with a serious issue probably more prevalent than we realize in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by an ego <UNK> fellow student who feels he's above the system and unfortunately often is br br the cast here was believable and the performances credible a lot of these canadian lifetime flicks are decidedly over the top however this is one i might label as under the top br br while <UNK> the fact that it wasn't presented in an overblown fashion this film somehow seemed like a record being played at a slower speed than proper the <UNK> minutes seemed like many more and it had the effect of looking like a shorter film <UNK> over and over seemingly going on and on and on and on before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion br br yet the engaging characters and performances made it better than the average film of this type despite these criticisms br br and while these pictures often milk the climax this one could have given it a bit more detail and length
<START> this movie is about pathetic spoiled ego driven who think they have something interesting to say performed by pathetic spoiled ego driven who think they are interesting straight from the coke filled <UNK> of new <UNK> arty incestuous drama scene br br how so many viewers get tricked into making them think this carries any substance remains a mystery to me maybe they secretly long to belong too to this <UNK> and <UNK> or maybe they have never seen a decent movie br br get out put your hands in the dirty earth and get a real job otherwise kill your self with a real gun
<START> i don't know if i hate this movie as much as i did when i watched it two weeks ago but if you're expecting the events described on the box forget it that would have been a good movie the great descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent into utter that i took viewing this movie if you've seen <UNK> taxi cab <UNK> this is the same thing only fictional and not even remotely as interesting if you really want to see something interesting about a cab driver check out the 20 minute short they run on <UNK> from time to time it is actually worth watching i have never ever asked for my money back for a movie until i saw this thing boring boring boring it does offer one unique <UNK> which is this it leaves you to decide what happens to each of the passengers letting your imagination fill in the gaps which would be great if you actually cared about any of these people instead i found myself yelling at the screen <UNK> like a child praying for either the end of the movie or my own death the cab driver himself though well played considering runs through emotions seemingly at random from sarcastic to sympathetic to raging lunatic to <UNK> sometimes it is appropriate most of the time it's just a display for it's own sake <UNK> i learned all these emotions in acting class and i'm gonna use them now that i've been thinking about it again i do hate this movie as much as i did
<START> i chose this movie because i was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl two boys as i lived this situation and get lost in it i hope a similar story would inspire me br br my major concerns are why a how b the triangle forms why c how d the triangle <UNK> br br a the movie offers a plain answer because it's better br br b here it's an open triangle the three share things together mine was a closed one every ones knows the others but never the three are together or speak about the missing one br br c the movie doesn't offer spoken explanations but rather prefer visual emotional <UNK> the end comes with <UNK> sexuality coming up in the triangle or more accurately when for one member deep feelings are tied with <UNK> and as for the latter and the former they can be divided i agree with that br br d in the movie in my story silence is the proof that something isn't well and in a ironic and painful way the tool for this sad times is always the phone i lived this dreadful planned phone call call me back i wait you  and when time comes the phone is a variation is also shown when the line is connected but one refuses to all those scenes were very very hard to see for me br br if the movie was a great help in that way he got also a lot of flaws br br i <UNK> on the boy's family problems br br why the shower scene on the dvd cover is cut on the movie br br how gets finally into the hotel br br is <UNK> always seeing <UNK> he says no but has her address and who is the girl with him in the bar his girlfriend how can she knows about the address br br what finally happens to vanessa the ring at the final shoot is a proof of engagement with whom
<START> this movie deserves a 20 10 if i could give one the hollow is a great <UNK> <UNK> novel and the twist at the end fools most people i am <UNK> that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel there was no major difference that i could spot the only difference was that <UNK> was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel the acting was superb and the music as usual was amazing quality david <UNK> is perfect in his role and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either in no other movie that i've seen so far has <UNK> been portrayed so brilliantly hats off to the producers they have made a movie that i along with many others will <UNK> for a long time to come
<START> as with <UNK> 1975 i became aware of this one purely by accident it was mentioned in a review of the <UNK> 1969 which i <UNK> when that film turned up on late night italian tv as being in a similar vein incidentally i missed out on that screening of the <UNK> though i acquired it via the same channel later on but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the english dubbed <UNK> dvd during my <UNK> in hollywood in late 2005 early 2006 actually in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it i was let down by the <UNK> â being too light hearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme the <UNK> <UNK> relationship between a young couple to be honest for much of the time i was afraid that the frightened woman would go the exact same was subsequently <UNK> redeemed by a wicked if not exactly unpredictable final twist br br the film concerns the social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> invites a female journalist <UNK> <UNK> at his <UNK> home for the week end however it <UNK> that <UNK> a <UNK> who all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate or even kill them therefore for the first half of the narrative we see the heroine enduring pain and <UNK> at hands including being forced to make love to a <UNK> in his own image the tables are subtly but <UNK> turned she not only herself from his control but teaches him that man and woman can co exist <UNK> â except that following her own personal agenda as well br br the leads are perfectly cast and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood furthermore <UNK> greatly <UNK> by a typically <UNK> score from the ever reliable <UNK> and the imaginative â even <UNK> â look the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form with a steel trap where its sexual <UNK> should be seems to from <UNK> incidentally this prop figured <UNK> in stills <UNK> seen previously from the frightened it barely <UNK> in the film proper other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program <UNK> and the and an <UNK> at a castle <UNK> to family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a <UNK> one of the highlights then is easily erotic dance virtually in the nude â an episode which actually <UNK> the of <UNK> eventually the two characters have a in the <UNK> pool â <UNK> set to a spaghetti western type theme br br in the long run for all its <UNK> the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme <UNK> japanese masterpiece by <UNK> <UNK> blind beast 1969 finally <UNK> worth noting that the frightened woman was distributed in the u s by film maker <UNK> company films he would even employ its production designer <UNK> for his own <UNK> 2000 1969 to get to the edition i watched apart from the usual shortcomings in the english dubbing department the presentation here was further marred by a rather washed out appearance and brief instances of distracting <UNK> noise on the soundtrack by the way there seems to be some confusion with respect to the <UNK> running time its length given on various sources <UNK> anywhere from <UNK> to <UNK> minutes â all i can say however is that the copy i own ran for <UNK> minutes
<START> you got any <UNK> <UNK> is good you just eat them and you go i couldn't help but laugh at that bit of dialog <UNK> are the musical fruit you know the more you eat them the more you go <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> ok i can understand why the actors were in this because they needed <UNK> to pay their bills with but i'm not really too sure what the intentions of the director and the writer were even after watching the making of documentary in the dvd extras br br mike <UNK> gave this a performance it really didn't deserve i've seen him in other movies much better than this one what would have vastly improved this movie was to throw everything out keep <UNK> and instead made another entry into the substitute franchise <UNK> would have made for a terrific substitute teacher who <UNK> naughty and morally <UNK> youth regarding the error of their ways and how they can become more useful and <UNK> members of society br br casper you really shouldn't be just pushing through the like that as you could get poison <UNK> <UNK> never mind i guess poison <UNK> is the least of your <UNK> now well at least this time your <UNK> wasn't done by the tail of giant python there are few things more embarrassing than being <UNK> through the chest by a giant snake at least the death scene in this movie had a bit more dignity to it as well as a more liberal <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and red food <UNK> nothing says sad and tragic death like the liberal use of <UNK> and red <UNK> br br first time i've seen a monster wear a shiny cape with a fur collar <UNK> first time for everything i guess just to be <UNK> though if this was an indian ghost how come it looked exactly like a monster out of european culture and <UNK> wouldn't the monster have been more sort of more br br while i did watch this all the way to the end credits i don't realistically believe that i could in good faith recommend it to others
<START> this is one of my all time favorite movies it's great to watch in groups i find it's also great for any alan <UNK> fan he does such a wonderful job it's engrossing entertaining very surprising you have to watch it twice at least i haven't watched it with anyone who didn't like it or at least find it worthwhile
<START> when i was growing up voyage into space was my most favorite movie i remember the time when <UNK> channel 5 ran the movie for the whole week and me and my sisters watched it every single day i still remember every part of that movie the ending was so sad when giant robot got blown up along with <UNK> and then watching johnny with all the tears running down his face calling for giant robot there should have been a sequel to the movie in which giant robot somehow survived the explosion i can't believe that there are so many other voyage into space fans still out there i really want to buy the movie when it comes out on dvd but my sister said that the ones out there now are <UNK> and probably bad quality copies of the movie i don't know why they haven't released it yet since it's been over 40 years now i think voyage into space was made back in 1968 only now my second favorite japanese monster movie of all time the war of the is finally coming to dvd and being released on <UNK> <UNK> and i can't wait now if only they would do the same with voyage into space giant robot johnny and voyage into space will never be forgotten in my eyes and probably many others too it will always be a childhood classic to me
<START> after many many years i saw again this beautiful love story thinking about how would i half a century after react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time when i was just an male adolescent trying to understand women's <UNK> in a small city in brazil br br this time however what caught my attention in the film was something very different namely the <UNK> with which the <UNK> dr han jennifer jones makes clear to the journalist mark elliott william <UNK> her special <UNK> condition as an <UNK> in fact she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a <UNK> way provided that by doing so she is not <UNK> her chinese side its seems to the <UNK> that is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them br br therefore attitudes always leave poor elliott  a determined brave and extremely practical man  anxious and <UNK> without knowing how much importance to give to her words for him whose love for her is plain and simple the situation is totally clear if we love each other let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together not so fast is what she seems <UNK> and non <UNK> to answer him all the time br br in fact chinese portion would never allow her such a level of <UNK> and as she goes on and on <UNK> this much aimed <UNK> between those two worlds inside herself she also frequently <UNK> to him that also a very peculiar <UNK> of chinese culture is deeply <UNK> in her mind namely the constant <UNK> on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or non physical world for is always <UNK> elliott about how dangerous is life not because of any objective and <UNK> threat as would be the <UNK> of the english <UNK> or the of a japanese invasion but due to the <UNK> of plenty of cruel and <UNK> gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor <UNK> and vulnerable human beings br br in fact it looks like a whole bunch of chinese <UNK> are <UNK> on the watch to make people's life totally miserable because of that mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes so that they are not taken away by jealous gods everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon <UNK> are advised that they should shout <UNK> the rice is bad the rice is bad to protect their <UNK> from being stolen by <UNK> and in a funeral it is recommended that the <UNK> family be isolated from the other people by <UNK> so that the gods don't take advantage of their sorrow and <UNK> br br in other words introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence as if a rather disturbing <UNK> of <UNK> and sadistic gods are always on the verge of <UNK> <UNK> with the most banal acts in anyone's daily life br br as the story takes place in hong kong in 1949 it should be clear that china really was at that time almost a semi <UNK> society while the country from which elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that launched by the usa after the first oil shock in 1973 took charge of the whole world therefore at least in one aspect both sides of <UNK> personality were still much more innocent than they would be today br br a lot of history came into being since those old days as to china the main fact is that after several <UNK> of a communist regime the country finally reached in the last two decades the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as state capitalism and what happened to that old <UNK> that so much enthralled in hong kong in 1949 and with which she used to impress so much an <UNK> elliott under that tree on the hill behind the hospital it is gone completely gone in brief if that story took place today elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to <UNK> to in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family in fact both men would now be <UNK> closer to one another in their huge <UNK> talking business as usual
<START> saw the film at it's lawrence kansas premiere this <UNK> story about a group of disgruntled <UNK> killing off the competition for prom queen was just awful it fails for many reasons bad acting bad script no clear point but mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves hey i have some money so let's make a movie without really thinking it out <UNK> most indie films that don't make it suffer from just that mentality they just don't seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie or in this case even a watchable one with this film i do not feel ashamed to say that if i didn't know some of the crew i would have walked out simple as that
<START> <UNK> is a very apt title for this as you watch it you will feel your life being <UNK> from you the cliché in horrors is about people doing exactly what they shouldn't going down into the basement or going up into the attic then the trouble ensues take <UNK> then don't watch this film show the brains that victims in horror movies never do stay clear do not enter and if you need anymore <UNK> this film is as bad as the worst uwe boll film i mean the house of the dead bad i have often thought about entering a review of a film on i m d b and after watching some based on the comments <UNK> i discovered i guess everyone's to his her opinion please trust me on mine
<START> a rare exception to the rule that great literature makes disappointing films john <UNK> beautiful farewell to life and the movies is almost entirely true to the narrative and the spirit of james <UNK> short story a tender <UNK> on love death and time expressed in the events of a <UNK> night party in middle class <UNK> circa <UNK> <UNK> as the material might appear the film succeeds by its <UNK> to tell the story on its own quiet apparently <UNK> terms rather than force a conventional cinematic shape of plot points and dramatic incidents upon it only once is the wrong note struck when old miss julia a trained singer and music teacher whose voice is supposed to have been <UNK> by age not <UNK> sings so badly that the audience burst out laughing when i saw this at the cinema fortunately the mood of <UNK> and gentle melancholy is re established in plenty of time for the moment of revelation between the married couple gabriel and <UNK> <UNK> in a hotel bedroom as snow begins to fall outside it's a sad story i suppose but the kind that leaves you feeling better not blue especially recommended as a date movie for people in love who aren't frightened of confronting the <UNK> and sadness of life
<START> contains spoilers i had it recorded a while ago when it was on <UNK> but never got a chance to watch it probably due to prejudice about having to sit through 5 6 <UNK> of masterpiece theater with its bbc made for tv production style no music settings all in one room no <UNK> scenes flat tv look but after watching the movie traffic which i thought was pretty good at that time i couldn't help digging up the tape to see what else could they have <UNK> into with the extra 2 1 2 <UNK> br br boy was my <UNK> wrong about this tv series it is so much more involving than traffic the characters are fleshed out better so that their actions are more believable and the whole subplot involving <UNK> <UNK> the whole point of view of everyone in the whole supply chain from the farmer to the end user in traffic the <UNK> story was <UNK> and reduced down to a good cop vs bad cop plot br br there was alot more meaningful discussion and debate about alcohol and other forms of drug whereas in traffic they mostly became passing references of no significance same with social issues which in were conveyed realistically w o sounding preachy whereas in traffic the characters <UNK> t <UNK> it out as a statement like the way they do it in those made for tv issue of the week movies br br there was no bad guy vs good guy in even the dealer is portrayed as a <UNK> that sells to support his habit instead of the nobody <UNK> with me type of person in traffic br br the only down part is that since i watched traffic not much before watching this it was hard not to compare scene by scene and even though the scenes were not the same i knew what the outcome was going to be already thank god for the <UNK> story which is different enough that it allowed me to enjoy it completely w o thinking which scene it <UNK> to although i was thrown off thinking the drugs were <UNK> into the <UNK> of the <UNK> in which helen brought back to germany as in the storyline of traffic thank god was not that hokey and far fetched
<START> norma had spent most of the <UNK> playing beautiful <UNK> but her first <UNK> cast her as a <UNK> <UNK> in the trial of mary <UNK> and she came through with flying colours from then on her sweet and lovely <UNK> were cast aside and she in parts that cast her as sophisticated women of the world or society girls out for thrills let us be gay was made before but released after the <UNK> and was an unusual twist on the upper <UNK> dramas that <UNK> made her own br br norma first appears without make up as <UNK> kitty brown who's main purpose in life is to <UNK> to her very <UNK> husband bob rod la <UNK> she is <UNK> to get him off to his golf game but in reality he is going to see his mistress when helen the mistress comes to the house for a showdown kitty faces the situation with <UNK> but behind closed doors she is a mass of emotions and bob leaves for good br br three years later mrs <UNK> brown kitty comes to stay as a house guest of the eccentric mrs marie <UNK> kitty is now a <UNK> and has a job for her she wants kitty to romance a house guest who in his turn is <UNK> her grand daughter diane beautiful sally shock horror the man is none other than bob her ex husband kitty carries off the meeting with sophistication and witty <UNK> there seems to be something strangely familiar about that man and no one is the <UNK> br br the film then <UNK> down into one of those early very <UNK> boring drawing room comedies kitty casts a spell over all the men and bob is desperate to start again the women have all the strong roles in this film men are just puppets raymond <UNK> seems to be in the film as an extra butler pass me a <UNK> get me a drink move this chair instead of <UNK> <UNK> fiancé norma <UNK> is of course the whole show marie <UNK> adds to her list of eccentric portrayals and sally is a real <UNK> as the gorgeous diane
<START> the comic strip featured actors from 'the young a student based sitcom from the 80's comic strip features included parodies of westerns 'the famous <UNK> and the professionals all a lot funnier than this having said that <UNK> puts in a good turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack features great music from the era 5 10
<START> i love ernest goes to jail it's one of my top 3 favorite ernest movies the others being ernest scared stupid and ernest goes to camp in this movie ernest jim <UNK> works as a janitor for a bank but he wants to be a bank clerk soon he is assigned jury duty but soon winds up in trouble when the evil murderer felix <UNK> <UNK> also knocks him out and switches places with him soon ernest is in jail and is forced to act like <UNK> or else <UNK> will kill charlotte <UNK> love interest when they take ernest to the electric chair thinking he's <UNK> he gets so <UNK> he winds up breaking out and goes off and saves charlotte from the evil <UNK> filled with hilarious scenes and comics ernest goes to jail is a movie that'll make you laugh so hard it still does to me jim <UNK> was such a fantastic actor he did a good job playing both good guy and bad guy <UNK> was like his toy story co star tom hanks no matter what role they played their roles were <UNK> and that's one of the things that gonna be remembered forever for r i p jim <UNK> 1949 2000 thank you for bringing ernest and other fantastic characters to life 10 out of 10
<START> this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face i'm a christian and liked the film in one way it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see it can be a bit long <UNK> but the film has some quite nice cars that <UNK> it from a lower rating from me as a christian film it was quite good but maybe a bit right on in the message the film works best on a big screen spoilers the fighting scene with the two brothers can remind you of the fighting scene between the two brothers in the christian thriller mercy streets starring eric roberts end of spoiler i give it a 7 10
<START> it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and busy but <UNK> background score that <UNK> this 1933 release although sound came into general use in <UNK> there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman <UNK> married who <UNK> her husband for a younger man after a romantic <UNK> in the woods br br the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town <UNK> to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover in a frenzy of jealousy he drives at top speed toward a <UNK> crossing but changes his mind at the last moment losing his nerve it's probably the most tension filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow moving and obviously contrived story br br hedy <UNK> is given the sort of close up treatment <UNK> on marlene <UNK> by her <UNK> but her beauty had not yet been <UNK> by the <UNK> as they were when she was transported to hollywood her performance consists mostly of looking sad and <UNK> while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love <UNK> <UNK> the handsome young stud who <UNK> her clothes after a nude swim br br the swimming scene is very brief <UNK> photographed and not worth all the heat it apparently generated the love making scene later on is also <UNK> photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film <UNK> so more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism and this is the sort of thing that has others <UNK> the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece br br not so it's disappointing <UNK> crude in its sound portions including the <UNK> <UNK> music in the background and certainly miss <UNK> is fortunate that louis b <UNK> saw the film and on the basis of it gave her a career in hollywood he must have seen something in her work that i didn't br br it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work the jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring <UNK> where none is needed it fails to end the film on the proper note
<START> the episode begins with scenes of a dead woman washed up on the shore a <UNK> jim <UNK> along the beach lost in <UNK> and a night ride home that ends in murder and mystery yep this is an atmospheric little number with a super twist at the end jim does well to unravel what is a <UNK> an inexplicable case of a woman going missing 20 seconds after she enters her home to be sure the eventual explanation is a little far fetched why for example go to the <UNK> of <UNK> a woman <UNK> thru a car journey when simply <UNK> her and her companions out would've been as easy and left less of a trail however these <UNK> aside it's a memorable episode full of invention even if yet again jim gets put in the frame by an ever suspicious police <UNK> i mean to say have the <UNK> so and <UNK> ever sat down and counted just how many of their files have been solved by dear ol' <UNK>
<START> wow this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who's idea this was and what soup kitchen are they eating at now to say this was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love br br when i saw name in the tv guide i figured it would be a spoof maybe it should have been could have made for a better movie br br look for the scene where they are in an airplane in mid flight with the door open and there is no wind what so ever they could have <UNK> for a fan at least br br look for several canadian c list actors in the movie this is the kind of movie that <UNK> the b rate cable stations you never watch except on a rainy sunday
<START> ok if i was in the rental store and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three bucks for the rental i'd have to say no the plot was implausible i've come to the conclusion that keanu reeves can not act he can at times be painful to watch though my wife thinks he's cute dan <UNK> who is usually great was even a little disappointing as the crooked cop on the plus side the plot because it is far fetched is unpredictable cameron diaz was good
<START> i have seen this movie about 50 times already and it doesn't look like i am ever going to get bored of it i always watch it with my best friend and it has become sort of a tradition for us now to watch it almost every month every single time we see this movie we both get really emotional and we laugh and cry in front of the tv together and sing all the songs in a loud voice and in the end we always dance by now we practically know even the whole dialog by heart and watching the film feels like seeing our own old friends on tv br br this film is perfect even though i have to admit that the story itself is a bit cheesy but the characters the dance the music and even the place where it all takes place make you forget all about it and you start believing that things like that really do happen and that the song all you need is love actually has some kind of a meaning br br i am really a normal person and not too serious about this comment of mine but i just cant wait until the next time we'll be able to see dirty dancing
<START> one cannot help but be impressed with the intelligence and scale of this film and simultaneously disappointed by the lost opportunities br br i found the script to be excellent and the vocal talent of edmund <UNK> quite impressive however as an <UNK> of its time the film suffers from too many hollywood <UNK> especially poor casting too much <UNK> of the sets and too much <UNK> edmund <UNK> who plays the title character is so obviously awkward with physical acting i suspect he had primarily been in shakespearean theater before this br br so if movie people are reading this i <UNK> this as an excellent candidate for a remake especially if you cast real <UNK> as <UNK>
<START> closet land was <UNK> by <UNK> international and does have a lot of political overtones but there's so much more to this richly stirring story than that br br this is not just about the political tension of the late 80s it's about the personal <UNK> that a woman puts herself through as a child who was <UNK> by a family friend we see the subtle <UNK> to the parallels of a <UNK> government society structure and the culture of sexual <UNK> where one in four young children are <UNK> and one in three women has experienced some form of rape br br for me it brings up a chilling chicken and egg question does the attitude of our sexual <UNK> leading to <UNK> create the political environment of fear and <UNK> or does the <UNK> political <UNK> fuel a culture of sexual <UNK> the psychological <UNK> of even asking this question force us to a place where we are brought to develop our own answers br br in the end our young lady writer <UNK> has a similar moment to the one at the end of <UNK> she realizes in one shining brilliant moment that the idea of having her power stolen from her by the secret police <UNK> is an illusion no one can steal your power they can only trick you into giving it up and then you have the right to take it back at any time br br this is not a movie to be entered into lightly and you most certainly do enter it the <UNK> aspects coupled with the child like animation <UNK> the deepest parts of the psyche and leaves no viewer <UNK>
<START> it's very easy to figure out why the new professionals was a dud at least in new zealand it didn't just follow in the footsteps of the original it followed <UNK> which out the show considerably with its boss and two agents formula <UNK> <UNK> was a latter day george <UNK> tough on his team but one who would defend them to the death against others the shadow the show cast was huge br br well not as huge as it should have been in the uk here it was <UNK> in prime time it was even <UNK> in the <UNK> as <UNK> are the professionals ' someone else obviously noticed the difference we were fortunate enough not to have this show released in different <UNK> at different time <UNK> br br it was the high production values that sealed the deal for me as other reviewers have noted it followed the great british tradition of the one hour <UNK> but <UNK> in personal elements at the same time there's a slight <UNK> of something developing between liz and ian though that never distracted one from the real plot most episodes were based around <UNK> <UNK> incidents the sort of thing that helps <UNK> along from time to time br br unlike many <UNK> shows the plot was not sacrificed at the expense of fancy pants photography or over stylish direction directors like christopher young kept the pace up and did their job they made use of good locations making <UNK> <UNK> than if it had been shot on back roads and <UNK> it was contemporary it would still stand up beautifully today and it was one of the better examples of the british <UNK> in the 1990s showing that the uk can still do them better than anyone else br br maybe except for the germans and their <UNK> 11
<START> <UNK> tourist trap is a clever unique b thriller that stands out as one of the best of it's kind br br <UNK> stop at a lonely wax museum where the <UNK> <UNK> are a little too life like for comfort br br while the film has hints of the texas chainsaw massacre tourist trap is mainly a creepy psychological thriller worthy of the twilight zone director david <UNK> gives this movie an atmosphere of darkness and mystery that reaches nightmarish proportions also adds the occasional touch of comic relief to the bizarre happenings br br actor chuck <UNK> is the best of the film's decent cast <UNK> music score is excellent having both lyrical and <UNK> themes that are perfect to the movie a number of the film's sequences are quite memorable br br for horror and thriller fans alike tourist trap is an unforgettable must see film br br 1 2 out of
<START> the <UNK> and the snowman is a superb example of an anti 80s film while many other films of the decade in general lacked substance this film is pure substance there's nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it it boasts two superb performances timothy <UNK> and sean penn as <UNK> friends christopher <UNK> and lee respectively <UNK> penn and tom cruise were a of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things all 3 starred in <UNK> while penn and <UNK> popularity <UNK> <UNK> has been largely forgotten about and that's a shame actually <UNK> is the first of the 3 to win an oscar for supporting role in ordinary people in 1980 but i think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding br br <UNK> really captures the post vietnam war <UNK> in his character chris <UNK> a failed <UNK> school student chris has a love hate relationship with his father well played by the great character actor pat <UNK> the scene where chris quotes the poem his father thought he'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one br br chris gets job at <UNK> of defense and uses his hatred of u s <UNK> and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the <UNK> he gets his buddy a hyper drug dealing self <UNK> in on it to be the <UNK> of the project plans on <UNK> while chris is doing it based on his beliefs is doing it strictly for the money the soviet <UNK> is excellently played by david <UNK> penn and <UNK> have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of funny set of <UNK> between them but make no mistake this film is anything but that it is a serious character study about <UNK> <UNK> paranoia and <UNK> br br again the leads make this film <UNK> delivers a brilliantly understated performance as chris a rather smart young man who had so much potential penn as usual does a tremendous characterization as a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks and most of the time doesn't think at all the ending of this fact based film is very <UNK> on several levels a truly powerful character study
<START> i'm usually a fan of art and foreign films but when i saw this one my reaction was it must be called experimental because it makes no sense the action is static while at the same time it <UNK> from one location to another there aren't enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder adultery and generally weird and <UNK> behavior the cure offered by the powers that be is to <UNK> a totally innocent black man
<START> this very loose retelling of carmen begins on a high note with a <UNK> sexually frank dance between prisoner and her female prison warden but the vibrant opening minutes never <UNK> into any coherent film one minute is all sexual predator the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government and then suddenly she is a <UNK> on the high <UNK> although the film deserves kudos for the first <UNK> the broad <UNK> it paints are so <UNK> like and <UNK> by any narrative <UNK> that the film comes off as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of basic instinct meets bound meets an african version of a bollywood musical
<START> <UNK> long dreary cinematic <UNK> i couldn't believe how bad this film was i watched it merely because of the numerous people who <UNK> about it on this site was i watching the same film the entire episode is one dimensional nothing that happened in past affected his or anyone else's future and no one was affected by their past i think it was <UNK> who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect then it shouldn't be there obviously the director didn't know this rule and so stuffed his <UNK> with one dire scene after another even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected it wasn't a surprise but it was unexpected br br it is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this 1st <UNK> 2002 even though many people say it is one of their favourite films no one has bothered to add a memorable quote the reason being that there simply aren't any br br don't waste your time watching this watch a <UNK> <UNK> instead
<START> what a <UNK> pile of <UNK> gods where to even begin with this <UNK> br br well mix crap acting including one bloody <UNK> woman who speaks as though she's either a chewing painfully on some ice <UNK> or b has just <UNK> up after having <UNK> some extensive root <UNK> surgery editing that would appear to <UNK> that the celluloid was cut and spliced via the of an angle <UNK> some truly hopelessly choreographed martial arts <UNK> a script that has ostensibly been written by a two year old and some of the most hideous and <UNK> loud background music ever committed to any film and hey <UNK> you have death machines aka the ninja murders although note that surprise surprise  there are in fact no actual ninja anywhere to be found in this <UNK> travesty br br in a nutshell if ever there was a cinematic equivalent of a particularly <UNK> bout of then this must surely be it avoid at all costs
<START> the original isn't by any means a must see movie in the genre in fact if it weren't for it's chilling first 25 minutes there wouldn't be any logical reason for watching it the remake takes those 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85 minute teen horror flick br br now i don't have anything against pg 13 horror movies but the tendency surrounding them is getting lame when you see the pg 13 rating you expect a movie filled with false scares teen t v or music stars and a plot that has been used for several times don't even ask for gore or violence br br i know that it's not correct to compare both the original and the remake but i think that it's necessary to do it because the whole idea of the new one is based on the beginning of the original the tension that is felt through the first movie is not present by any means in the remake not even with the amazing settings or great use of lightning no tension suspense thrills nothing the movie goes too slow before it gets a little interesting and that's when the stranger appears the chasing sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least there's a feeling of what will happen next but that's it the situations that set up for the climax are predictable boring and lack of suspense the original has merits for having suspense in the most important scenes and also for a chilling climax for the most important scene of the movie br br now i understand that this is a pg 13 horror movie but if you pay respect to the original why change it's most important situation the children are not supposed to survive after the ending i felt like this movie was pointless so the baby <UNK> was playing cat and mouse with a <UNK> that's it then the sequence at the hospital was plain stupid and worst of all it means that a sequel may be on the way br br <UNK> belle is the best thing about the movie she delivers a cute believable performance she needs to pick better projects although this role will gain for her thousands of teenager fans br br please don't watch this movie some people say that in order to support the horror genre we are supposed to support any movie that comes out i don't necessary agree if we ignore movies like then the producers of horror movies will understand that we won't accept crap we want good horror movies not lame flicks filled with false scares br br watch the original when a stranger calls instead because it's first 25 minutes are way better than the whole pointless remake
<START> everywhere i hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched well maybe a do good cab driver in <UNK> is pushing it a little at least the cab drivers <UNK> met but that's what makes the show great br br the fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun its highly watchable and even though u know mike wins out in the end he never wins in life david morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role his supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great br br all in all i watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action i watch this show because its got great acting a good premise and a great story line every week it's also a plus when i can pick out the <UNK> he drives by or know what <UNK> he's at i love this show and i love <UNK> give this show a shot
<START> when a movie called hell ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché with character names like <UNK> and the <UNK> i <UNK> myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that the dialogue soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies dusty desert <UNK> from the heat as <UNK> coming <UNK> down the road while <UNK> rider plays and they talk about sex and violence yawn the three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable seeing old men like bishop and madsen in a freaking <UNK> shirt riding down a dusty strip of desert highway reminded me of two men trying desperately to <UNK> their youth poor eric <UNK> tried his best but with such poor material it got lost even an appearance by dennis hopper in full easy rider swing couldn't save it and let's talk about the store bought <UNK> shall we many have compared this to <UNK> work it is not even close what makes <UNK> work so brilliant is he knows it's over the top so he just goes balls out and takes it as far over the top as possible bishop took this film so seriously that it became nothing more than a poor copy of the exploitation genre
<START> project a ii is a classic jackie chan movie with all the kung fu crazy stunts and slapstick humor you expect not as good as the prequel but still it is a great movie if you just want something fun to watch the story is simple jackie chan versus the evil men so if you want a movie that you don't have to be a to understand i would suggest this one
<START> there is something about this show that keeps me watching and hoping for the future of it in the writing the jokes are few and far between and the story lines are a bore so i figure it must be the physical comedy and the visuals br br i do enjoy the camera movement set dressing and wardrobe it's <UNK> highly <UNK> against the <UNK> that <UNK> and i'm pretty sure every time i have laughed it was because of john or <UNK> physical comedy the two of them make a <UNK> cute couple that make me laugh and want to <UNK> at the same time br br so here i go ready to sit down to kim one more time tonight to see what path this production will go down or up as the case may be looking forward positively
<START> tell you what that was excellent dylan <UNK> is simply the funniest actor on screen and on stage and with micheal caine as your partner ain't to bad either both are great to watch in a really funny film true not all the gags come off but its worth sticking around for the ones that do but come on its got micheal caine in a dress in it the whole admission <UNK> worth that and every time dylan <UNK> on screen its more like bernard blacks movie the story is two actors <UNK> and caine who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by acting out different <UNK> to fool them all but getting away with it's a different matter basically the actors is a great british comedy that was somehow missed by many seriously if your a <UNK> fan or want to see micheal caine in a dress definitely see this
<START> <UNK> is not a <UNK> works because it is so true in what it is trying to say if you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus in on the message you will see a little bit of yourself in the main character michael whether male or female all of us have come to a point in our lives where we want to look back and a situation or a relationship did it really occur like we remembered what went wrong michael's desire to find grace is completely selfish more than anything he wants to make himself feel better about how things turned out but even so he is a sympathetic character because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships we would not be in them otherwise as the film ends i am not sure if michael has learned anything new about himself or not our best <UNK> on the relationship is through his friend <UNK> she is the soul of the movie and reminds us of how there are always two sides to every story i found michael to be pompous arrogant and just plain clueless which is exactly why i liked him he is a real character if you've ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship then this is a film for you in closing it is a film for everyone
<START> boyle heights los angeles legendary south american goat sucking vampire el is on the loose feeding on anyone unlucky enough to cross its path animal control officer eric <UNK> and expert author <UNK> <UNK> madison attempt to track down the creature but find their progress <UNK> by a pair of dumb cops money hungry locals keen to capture the beast for a fat reward and a couple of <UNK> scientists who want the monster for their experiments br br <UNK> higher than a two week old <UNK> el is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies might struggle to sit through with its dreadful script awful direction by not one but two talentless jones and paul laughable dialogue and some of the worst acting this side of a porn flick i recommend this film about as much as i do drinking the tap water in mexico br br as and proceed with their <UNK> viewers are treated to some incredibly weak gore the worst designed book jacket in history the most unconvincing dead person i've seen since the <UNK> corpse in dr butcher <UNK> and a high tech <UNK> security system <UNK> of a keyboard nailed to a post br br to be fair for a guy in a rubber suit the monster itself is fairly creepy hairy with big <UNK> and a face like a particularly ugly bat but its appearances are few and far between with more screen time spent on the tedious trials and <UNK> of <UNK> officer than on the killer antics of the titular creature just how many times is it necessary to see <UNK> in <UNK> to his bitchy boss br br if like me you make the mistake of wasting your hard earned cash on this dreadful latino <UNK> in my case it was a whole consider using the disc as a coaster for your <UNK> rather than actually watching it
<START> black <UNK> is a fun flick about a <UNK> female super heroine who wears leather <UNK> and drives a car that can <UNK> into her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mobile she battles the evil and all of this is an excellent recipe for a good time imho i loved the bit about her having to say <UNK> to get the <UNK> computer to take orders is so evil he wants to give the entire city <UNK> it's all so over the top and that's the beauty of it the scene where black <UNK> attacks her partner steals the show you'll know it when you see it this dvd also has a fun interview with joan she's a doll black <UNK> is a fun dvd loved it
<START> i have some of the older videos and dvds of dr who i've played them over and over i adore each of the doctors for different reasons but due to a man in the bbc <UNK> dr who was canceled even though it was still one of the <UNK> of the bbc line up with the departure of <UNK> mccoy the doctor stayed alive through the fans bbc <UNK> allowed fans to write books and cartoons the momentum of dr who has been steady even after 1989 then they took a chance with paul <UNK> the movie was flawed but it gave the bbc an idea of what we wanted in 1999 the man was gone and the <UNK> at the bbc felt it was time to bring the doctor back it was a complete success here in america the sci fi channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well although the writers were having to start over and explain the dr who mythology for new viewers it is incredible to me that they have done it in season 1 staring christopher <UNK> with russell t davis as lead writer and phil <UNK> as producer the doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is the doctor who universe has always been about choice love and sacrifice this is what they provided it makes me want more and it <UNK> me that mr <UNK> has chosen to leave the show my first doctor was doctor no 3 jon <UNK> doctor mr <UNK> <UNK> worry about his position in the dr who universe it is as solid as the rest he is the <UNK> doctor i didn't know of mr <UNK> prior to his performance in dr who but i do now i wish there was some way he could know there is push out in the dr who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it we have already seen that he is a great actor
<START> when i went to see this documentary on communist <UNK> musicals i was expecting something totally demented along the lines of a communist cop rock some scenes did deliver including a rousing clip from a soviet film called <UNK> drivers br br you'd think that <UNK> given the task of making <UNK> correct musicals that sing dance and <UNK> the party line face <UNK> odds and yet one of the surprises of east side story is that some of the films presented actually looked promising one was a mid 1950s east german effort called my wife wants to sing in which as the title implies an unhappy seeks to launch a singing career over the <UNK> of her <UNK> minded husband br br another genuinely interesting looking movie also from east germany was called midnight <UNK> in this film within a film the producers spoof their own creative plight with the story of a group of filmmakers under party orders to make a musical the on screen filmmakers themselves get to do a musical number about avoiding too hot subjects very reminiscent in tone of the 1957 movie <UNK> <UNK> br br the documentary is marred by somewhat insipid narration but it's still a lot of fun to watch look for the closing dedication to the person who made it all possible
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a very talented and beautiful actress she manages to be the rock steady centre of calling but that's not enough to rescue her tv series from mediocrity it's a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as <UNK> should go from a <UNK> supporting role in buffy the vampire <UNK> to this <UNK> br br unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip calling fails to <UNK> on any level above <UNK> the eponymous heroine spends a lot of her time running <UNK> and <UNK> across what must be a very small city in order to <UNK> the deaths of good looking corpses to be that she's already met in the <UNK> where she works despite all the running she does she always arrives looking like she's just stepped out of a <UNK> air <UNK> dressing room br br in every episode <UNK> <UNK> and the rest of the cast struggle to breath life into the bland <UNK> screenplays but it's a pointless exercise calling just lies on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the ceiling
<START> audrey i know you truly <UNK> your husband ted's memory but please do his legacy justice and <UNK> his wishes dr seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason we beg of you to please stop <UNK> in on his stories images fantasies and characters they are getting <UNK> by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these <UNK> and grotesque interpretations that will forever <UNK> the loving warmth and innocence of his books br br it is indeed your property to do with as you wish i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while save what is left of dr seuss thank you
<START> i have to say that there is one redeeming <UNK> in regards to this film it firmly <UNK> the bottom of the barrel now filmmakers know what to aim above when making a movie other than that i regret watching this <UNK> what shameless abandon the making of this film was what a waste of 100 000 that's right folks one hundred thousand dollars this film reminds me of that adult video awards show in which of group of industrial prostitutes stand up a praise themselves believing that they are real actors actresses and filmmakers ironic then how i've watched blue movies with better acting directing and writing i also found it funny that the executive producer justin just had to be in the movie he plays deputy jake barker i'm sure his acting career has taken off ted the writer has a part he no doubt was <UNK> in the clichéd glory he created it should be noted that carrie has a lead role in the movie you might remember her from gus van <UNK> <UNK> though i'm not too sure that she'll want to write this film on her resume and i'm not sure which is a more depressing point money was spent to make this film or people are going to watch it along with and <UNK> captain and the world of <UNK> one of the worst films if not the worst film of 2004
<START> in hong kong <UNK> the editor <UNK> mo wan tony <UNK> <UNK> and his wife and the secretary <UNK> li <UNK> chan maggie cheung and her husband simultaneously move to an old building each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home and <UNK> and li <UNK> have the same <UNK> they like kung fu stories and <UNK> and soap from a restaurant nearby the building their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of <UNK> and repressed love later they realize that their mates are having an affair <UNK> falls in love with li <UNK> but her <UNK> and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a <UNK> level <UNK> the mood for <UNK> is a very slow beautiful <UNK> and romantic love story with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition the film had not had a screenplay and the actors were never sure about what they would be shooting later the director edited his story based on the <UNK> when <UNK> moves to <UNK> there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966 when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined leaving questions such as who is the boy with li <UNK> my vote is eight br br title brazil <UNK> da <UNK> on the surface of the
<START> i really liked this movie it totally reminds me of my high school days the soundtrack is awesome i am a huge <UNK> cage fan and this is my favorite movie that he is in i love the storyline it is a total love story against the odds kind of thing i think anyone who <UNK> in the early eighties 1980 1984 should see the movie it totally brought back memories of high school for me
<START> i want to start my review by <UNK> the makers of this documentary it is obviously a labor of love and i think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him it definitely has a fan worship feel about it which is a good thing br br i had heard of bruce <UNK> but didn't know much about him and i found the start of this documentary frustrating because i could hear other musicians talk about him but bruce <UNK> himself was kept way too far off in the distance i wanted to see this bruce <UNK> guy i felt as though the makers assumed i already knew him as well as these musicians on the screen which i didn't so i felt a bit left in the dark br br when bruce was finally shown in action it was great and gave me a taste of who bruce <UNK> was but it was only a taste we got treated to more musicians and i felt as though i was being told look all these cool musicians are into him so he must be cool i didn't really care much for the <UNK> commentary on bruce br br i wanted to see bruce as a person you know the important stuff more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him more about his life and yes his use of drugs and other issues i would of liked to know so much more about his project i wanted to get inside his mind even if they did this via some voice of god commentary and photos it would of been ok br br the animations were good but again i felt these were used as filler they didn't really do anything other than allow me to hear his music and see some imagery based on the dimension 5 records i did think it was clever and creative but again i wanted to learn more about bruce br br maybe bruce <UNK> was this <UNK> in real life br br anyway in the end i enjoyed this documentary and felt a sort of sadness that such amazing <UNK> and geniuses such as mr <UNK> get forgotten as the march of time <UNK> ever <UNK> i am glad that this film is around to <UNK> people about bruce <UNK> even with its flaws
<START> sometimes when a film is <UNK> by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim well in this case it was i believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny i think i <UNK> once when johnny vegas failed to vault a <UNK> fence and that was it br br the film follows the lives of four men who deliver <UNK> for a living each of them has a problem with their sex lives dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a <UNK> a few years before <UNK> is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object has an obsession for involving <UNK> jam in his encounters and jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman br br the tone of the jokes <UNK> from tasteless to i don't believe that anybody could write that an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma the blame for this all lands <UNK> at the feet of the writers the actors obviously made a poor choice <UNK> to be in this film but i didn't think their acting was all that bad not that it was all that good either surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic br br i certainly wouldn't recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or <UNK> it film i suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates
<START> <UNK> i thought i was off to a bad start bringing home the wrong dvd in the case of the intruder rental staff so i did not want to see this film but i am glad i did in all my chosen movie would not have been as superb a slice film as this <UNK> and delicate taste of what in both us and europe can do together seven years apart two heroine sisters <UNK> on fantastic <UNK> through early 1970's post student <UNK> europe <UNK> shot in the <UNK> and in berlin paris and <UNK> reminiscent of the feel of the exterior shots in paul verhoeven's early masterpiece the fourth man it's <UNK> acted by <UNK> diaz and especially christopher <UNK> the story <UNK> itself along an <UNK> plot capturing the <UNK> emotions of these characters as they confront their relationships and see <UNK> images of each other and themselves <UNK> a movie with great <UNK> and taste not for arnie <UNK> fans which is probably why the reviewer upstairs is so wide of the mark in <UNK> claims that this is a <UNK> film <UNK> <UNK> wrong too well worth <UNK> with
<START> i saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it since then i've searched for a video but never found it until now 33 years later when i ordered it from sorry to say it doesn't hold up this version just can't rise up to the <UNK> production level i love burt musical score that is if to by itself and i even bought a cd of it but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story just doesn't fit michael york is lost here sally <UNK> <UNK> off a fine performance but olivia <UNK> is just ridiculous and not worth <UNK> through the <UNK> the best performance is charles boyer as the head <UNK>
<START> this is one of those <UNK> and mildly entertaining little movies that <UNK> to make you to like them more but like so many others it's material isn't strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hours br br the pitch is promising three drag queens drive a bus through the <UNK> from sydney to alice springs they run into lots of trouble with <UNK> locals with the engine with their <UNK> br br the real trouble is with the dialogue the leads are fine though <UNK> becomes tiresome but the one liners and <UNK> feel forced where they should be casually thrown away characters shouldn't laugh at their own gags br br writer director elliott also feels the need to pile on the <UNK> <UNK> shots of flamboyant drag costumes against stark desert backgrounds like so much cheap make up for a movie about self confidence and just being yourself it all seems very insecure with itself
<START> this movie takes the voice of terror and makes it better holmes is protecting an <UNK> in switzerland and is on the trail of professor <UNK> who has become a nazi this is a better version of holmes in a wwii world <UNK> does a great job with holmes as a spy and a detective see this if you liked the voice of terror
<START> mr bug goes to town was the last major achievement the <UNK> studios produced the quality of the superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film br br the music and lyrics by frank <UNK> and <UNK> with assistance by veteran sammy are quite good but not as much as the <UNK> of the picture by leigh <UNK> who also scored snow white for disney atmospheric music is superb and a treat for the ears br br the <UNK> and staging of the picture was years ahead of it's time and once again the <UNK> background artists <UNK> themselves the beauty of the film cannot be denied and while the <UNK> is the star the characters of <UNK> the fly and <UNK> the <UNK> steal the picture <UNK> by jack <UNK> of <UNK> fame is priceless kenny <UNK> brother in law of guy <UNK> and a featured <UNK> in his band does his usual pleasant job in the role of dick br br the movie has been criticized for all the wrong reasons the <UNK> studios were animation experts par excellence and this shows very clearly in the finished product the movie is <UNK> the story great for all ages and the final scenes of the bugs <UNK> for their lives upon a rising <UNK> is some of the best staging and animation of any animated film past and present br br do not miss this wonderfully hand drawn film also don't fail to appreciate the title sequence with the most elaborate example of max <UNK> remarkable 3 d process which took four months to <UNK> and employed 16 000 tiny <UNK> of glass in the <UNK> buildings of manhattan br br do not miss mr bug goes to town aka goes to town i'll <UNK> you'll be bug eyed at the results
<START> it was praised to be a fast paced screwball comedy and the best german movie of the year so i gave it a try even though i've already seen some films by dani levy or at least parts of them br br i got what i had expected no comedy at all unless you think that heart attacks are funny it's a fine example of sloppy screen writing with an implausible plot and characters loaded with clichés that might be true but surely are not funny either br br the most annoying character is that of wife played by she has to behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving for example she doesn't know a single thing about <UNK> but by reasons most likely unknown to even herself she gets the idea to play the <UNK> that she and her family are jewish laws <UNK> jews for her husband's family who really are and of the very <UNK> and self righteous variety to make it a bit more complicated she invites the four of them to stay at her city flat because they arrive from <UNK> in berlin without having <UNK> their <UNK> in advance something no 60 years old business man actually no grown up german would ever do this gives the viewer a lot to swallow but still fails to produce any jokes br br <UNK> and his brother samuel haven't seen each other for forty years but it turns out that his daughter now a lesbian and son now a <UNK> <UNK> were once lovers and he's her daughter's father daughter a <UNK> goes after gay son is this supposed to be a somehow humorous parody of jewish incestuous <UNK> probably it's just a <UNK> way to add some love action <UNK> every screwball comedy needs and of course is also fails to produce any jokes br br the praise for this movie is purely political therefore only people who enjoy watching movies that are supposed to be politically important will enjoy this one even though <UNK> <UNK> quite clearly has no importance of any kind br br for all the rest don't watch it without a fast forward option i really missed it
<START> and it got it in france why not in the rest of the world while the studios keep <UNK> out expensive post <UNK> trash will anyone remember him as a fine writer and not the most betrayed by the screen author this side of stephen king this one has it all okay the situations are not always original has minor plot holes and it has a tendency to be too clever some brief times for its own sake but it actually delivers and is obviously a work of love i'd be curious to know what the budget was and for once this is not a cheap tarantino copy well film noir didn't started with tarantino you know will it once again be saved by europe like john <UNK> movies were so mr can make another one like this if you ever read this mr thank you and se
<START> this is definitely a movie that will make you think about the everyday struggles a person can go through every day great acting by the two leading roles <UNK> this further and you will not regret seeing this movie in any way br br it's a heartwarming tale of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life seen from the seat of a wheelchair their friendship is tested as well as their spirits when they get their own flat outside the <UNK> home br br i recommend this film to everyone who likes buddy pictures or just wants to see a wonderful and heartwarming film that <UNK> clear of all the clichés and <UNK> and not once gets <UNK>
<START> this movie was a rather odd viewing experience the movie is obviously based on a play now i'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn't feel terribly interesting enough to watch the movie is way too <UNK> and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie instead what is presented now is an almost literally re filming of a stage play with over the top characters and staged dialog because of all this the storyline really doesn't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore and <UNK> viewing experience br br it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching at first you think its a drama you're watching with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a <UNK> that <UNK> really more toward the comedy genre rather than the drama genre br br the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over the top one that at times really become unwatchable sure the actors are great peter o'toole and <UNK> york amongst others but they don't really <UNK> the movie to a level of <UNK> <UNK> br br the story feels totally <UNK> <UNK> the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother sister characters played by peter o'toole and <UNK> york but what exactly is the story even about the movie feels like a pointless and <UNK> one that has very little to offer like i said before i'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn't fitting and simply doesn't work out br br the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences br br more was to expect from director j lee thompson who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed stage play translated to screen project br br really not worth your time br br 4 10
<START> the of this picture was best <UNK> on the intended target audience namely teens my 14 year old son became so <UNK> in this film that i rate it considerably higher than its <UNK> mad city it <UNK> debate in our household on issues such as <UNK> pressure and loyalty vs doing the right thing for that alone i rate this film a 10 parents should watch it with their teens and discuss it afterwards br br i very much liked the smart dialogue and consistent acting i thought that james <UNK> was adequate in his role but the teenage cast really carried this picture other imdb users have praised corey performance which truly is inspired all in all i give this picture my highest recommendation go get this one
<START> when i first saw this movie back in the middle of january 2005 i didn't like it i thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star <UNK> light acted were so unlike her which of course is true and then i watched bits of it the next day when it re aired and i felt pretty much the same then i watched it again two <UNK> ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing i even cried the first 2 times but mainly because the actress was actually crying and i am a big fan of hers br br it is a very well acted and done tv movie <UNK> light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film i keep watching it over and over it's a sad movie but very good br br if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it it's not usually my type of movie but i did enjoy this one a
<START> no holds <UNK> is that movie that when you were nine or ten was the coolest movie this side of arnold <UNK> but then when you grow up and watch it you feel embarrassed that you were so <UNK> to have liked it you feel cheated embarrassed and stupid if you have a little brother and you show him this and he tells you it's gay give him a high five and take him to the strip bar for his <UNK> birthday
<START> not having heard of this film it came as a surprise when it was shown on cable recently gary <UNK> the gifted director of tough luck does wonders with the screen play written by bill and todd king the film involves the viewer from the start br br <UNK> the young hustler at the center of this story has been involved in all kinds of petty crime in fact we witness a confrontation right at the beginning which makes him get out of new orleans as fast as he can he ends up in the carnival that is run by the mysterious <UNK> <UNK> falls for the woman he should have been wise to stay away from the result proves a fatal judgment for <UNK> who then becomes the object of double crossing all around br br the director should be <UNK> by the casting of norman <UNK> who obviously is loved by the camera in spite of his nature one feels for him because we know his heart is in the right place the beautiful is perfect as the exotic dancer who in spite of being lover <UNK> <UNK> into falling heads over heels with her <UNK> <UNK> is barely understandable with the thick accent he speaks during the first half of the film br br tough luck shows a new director gary <UNK> showing he will go to do bigger and better things because he knows what he is doing
<START> i love <UNK> distinctive <UNK> narration and the photography is quiet nice we put the film on for our 3 5 year old who sort of <UNK> in and out of the room so for our first viewing we only saw about 1 3 of the movie and were quite <UNK> when we re watched sitting down for family time we were all <UNK> at the violence and life threatening situations the poor <UNK> got into about halfway through the movie there's a rack of dead bloody <UNK> animals lots of blood not just a little then at the end there's a wild struggle with a dog then blood clouds the water you'd think given the g rating that's all you'll see that they will imply one of the animals died nope they drag the <UNK> out of the water and show it <UNK> for several <UNK> seconds personally as an adult i love horror movies and am fine with violent movies ala scorsese <UNK> tarantino heck i love the ultra violent battle <UNK> but those aren't kid movies and don't <UNK> themselves as such if you are deliberately raising your young ones to see the harsh realities of life for cute animals then this is the movie for you if you are like me and my wife though you might want to spare your child nightmares and avoid this one
<START> francis ford <UNK> first film completed and released in 1969 was the last movie he made as a mostly unknown up and coming director before the godfather and is in stark contrast to both that film and the rest of his uneven career it's ostensibly a road movie involving a <UNK> young woman bored with domestic life and pregnant with a child she isn't sure she wants fleeing the <UNK> her dull marriage and hitting the open road in search of freedom along the way she befriends a nice man an ex <UNK> player that suffered brain damage from a traumatic head injury played in unexpectedly subtle fashion by a young james <UNK> and decides to him despite becoming frustrated with his simple ways her efforts to rid of him always fail either by guilt or chance and eventually lead her directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded cop robert duvall who has ideas of his own the plot is <UNK> but coppola does a great job at <UNK> the emotional life of these characters and uses editing techniques to <UNK> back story that were not at all common in american films of the time shots are simple yet extraordinarily effective conveying both the moody <UNK> of the open highway and the <UNK> of american suburban life <UNK> with a gentle melancholy provided by the film score coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic <UNK> from a woman's point of view in the <UNK> <UNK> 60's overall a fairly low key film that is not what audiences have come to expect from coppola but one that is a minor triumph in its own quiet <UNK> way 7 5 10
<START> a young woman nicole <UNK> alexander and her boyfriend jess joey become targets for a deranged serial killer after stopping for a at a remote road side rest stop br br what might have been an effectively scary <UNK> in more competent hands turns out to be a confusing ill considered mess under the sloppy direction of john who also wrote the screenplay there is a good deal of <UNK> violence a brief <UNK> of nudity and confident performances from the cast but the silly script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions one cannot help but feel disappointed br br on the surface the film plays out like a standard cliché ridden <UNK> on the <UNK> movie but an ex writer for the x files throws in some subtle supernatural elements which suggest that his aim was something else entirely a ghost story with the rest stop acting as home to a vengeful <UNK> out to <UNK> <UNK> br br by reading up on the film checking out <UNK> theories here on imdb and watching the extras on the dvd certain plot elements begin to make a little more sense although even with the advantage of extra information there are still many questions left unanswered in my opinion any film that requires this much investigation to make itself only partially understood is not particularly a good one
<START> i was wandering through my local library <UNK> vhs tapes when i saw a movie that made my mouth drop i have been hoping to see this movie again it's been over 22 years since i saw it cable movie channel around <UNK> <UNK> i had <UNK> a good many of the details in particular my son who is 4 and i watched it br br he agreed with me that was not nice and the best way for me to describe it was that he didn't love tom he accepted that it was amazing that i still <UNK> some of the songs too they had stuck in my head for 22 years which means they had to have some memorable <UNK> eh br br it's a good child's movie with <UNK> <UNK> in case of questions about what children had to go through that were not <UNK> society in the time frame this is what all the children faced daily except for a few lucky ones and while we try to disney coat movies making them more pc for children these days it doesn't mean that cruelty didn't exist or even still doesn't i enjoyed the animation it wasn't disney no i don't think don <UNK> touched a <UNK> on this movie br br there's a lot going for it though david t plays two roles i really like him james m does too the themselves are cute you feel sorry for tom and root for him then <UNK> herself is extraordinary in the multi role part she's playing it's as if her eyes are <UNK> i'm a huge fan of woo <UNK> and company and looking forward to <UNK> and i <UNK> this along with those kind of movies yes he jumps in the water but not because of suicide he jumped because he trusted the lady in black she'd been appearing to him all along br br i think it's a good movie if you have kids pick up a rental copy if you happen to locate a buy able copy let me know where ian liked it br br dee
<START> although never say never again has a weak sound track it is far superior to its competition at the time <UNK> never say never again is an updated and improved version of <UNK> <UNK> least popular bond flick is rich with clever dialogue wit <UNK> sex appeal and one of the best and most convincing bad guys in the entire bond series in addition features a very talented young and beautiful kim basinger british comedy fans will also recognize the actor known as mr bean i wouldn't trade any of the moore pictures for this one however the earlier connery bond efforts with the exception of <UNK> are superior br br
<START> billy and <UNK> had a very close relationship that went to far one evening even though billy was sleeping with mother <UNK> has to deal with the fact that her mother may never know and that it will never happen again billy is played by rob <UNK> who couldn't have looked better lifetime tv has made another movie that everyone is bound to like
<START> i see hundreds of student films this is tops james cox is a fantastic director he moves the camera tells the story and uses music in a way that is far advanced for his years no wonder he got a feature from this film br br
<START> oh dear the bbc is not about to be knocked off its <UNK> for absorbing period dramas by this one i agree this novel of jane <UNK> is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience the heroine is hardly a elizabeth <UNK> even edmund is not <UNK> to cause female hearts to skip a beat however i must say i was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed the basic story was <UNK> but the dialogue was so altered that all that was jane <UNK> tone manner feeling wit depth was <UNK> if not lost if some past <UNK> may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern <UNK> life is one long <UNK> the cast was generally adequate but i think <UNK> <UNK> was the wrong choice it needed someone more restrained i gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a <UNK> exterior she was more like a <UNK> child i see i must wait for the bbc to <UNK> its magic once again
<START> i have decided to <UNK> this show from my memory down the toilet of bad tv show into the obscurity of <UNK> disappointing pointless garbage tv show hell br br the <UNK> guy who is the host star creator of this show is boring uninteresting unbelievable not particularly good looking and not at all funny in short why is this guy on tv and especially why is he in a comedy show when he's not funny pretending to be a professional con man when he definitely is nothing but an obvious <UNK> others have said it here already but this guy is a total fake and fraud if you believe any of these cons i think you should seriously consider going to get your head checked because they're all fake and the ones that might possibly be true are so pointless like spending all day to con someone out of giving you an average meal at a restaurant seriously this guy needs to go away glad this show got <UNK>
<START> this movie was in one word terrible first of all the people who invented that <UNK> that puts you in the tv are slightly insane secondly the three teens are so obsessed with the show it's scary the movie was stupid and no effort or thought was put into it
<START> boogie nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any would be filmmaker should take a long hard look at sure you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the from hitchcock to scorsese but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half <UNK> br br where to begin i suppose one could look at the film as simply a story perhaps even <UNK> which focuses on the late 1970's porn industry and what an industry it was the other half could focus on the incredible detail one <UNK> filmmaker can achieve simply by using <UNK> and <UNK> rubber but honestly boogie nights brings back the pure no <UNK> in your face kind of cinema i haven't experienced since the film <UNK> of the 1970's ironic or stroke of genius the story is full of richly detailed characters all of which you either can relate too love or hate but the impact is clear you are feeling something for them among the characters the two performances which stand out are burt reynolds as director jack <UNK> and mark <UNK> as eddie adams <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moore is also <UNK> as is heather graham but if i focus on any one actor it would have to be john c <UNK> john's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion i'm a sucker for the line ever see the movie star wars people say i look like han solo anyway the look of the film is incredible the director of photography and director writer producer have come up with a vibrant colour and flashy style that <UNK> to martin scorsese and stanley kubrick in terms of his perfection of his craft but with creating his own unique look and pushing the edge with the longest single shot ever seen that being the new year's party sequence br br the music like in any great film is a character of its own at times it <UNK> <UNK> with sorrow or grief but mainly its all about fun dancing and having a good time the spirit of the 1970's ok back to the performances br br burt reynolds plays the character of jack <UNK> a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of film means to his genre the awful transition from shooting on film to recording on <UNK> tape the lose of his art as it were and the changes in mentality to the people he works with adds the perfect blend of and sexual <UNK> needed for the character for all those individuals who have seen <UNK> planet of the apes pay no attention to the performance of <UNK> in that film rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make br br <UNK> moore plays the would be mother to all and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels as life <UNK> art and she loses all those close to her heather graham is the eye candy but later holds her own and steals some of the scenes from even the great mr reynolds himself each character is <UNK> rich with life and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part br br the film itself is often funny tragic exciting and provides a <UNK> look into the lifestyle of the fast pace 1970's it makes no excuses and tells no lies and offers the audience a trip back but even more importantly the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film
<START> more is yet another addition into the countless pile of 60's <UNK> <UNK> junk avoid at all cost terrible acting equally <UNK> script the only thing to enjoy is pink <UNK> wonderful soundtrack which is too good for stereotypical waste like this
<START> the man with <UNK> face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30's late 40's film era it fails miserably for several reasons first <UNK> while looking reasonably like bogart and even speaking like him on and using his mannerisms completely lacks any of <UNK> charisma or acting ability this is really apparent whenever <UNK> is not clearly imitating a scene from one of <UNK> films second the film does not have the first rate character actors bogart was able to work with there are no peter <UNK> or sydney <UNK> in this one folks sure we are treated to performances by victor olivia <UNK> and george raft amongst others but they just aren't of the same caliber or aren't given enough screen time or are miscast third the attempts at modern humor all fall through all of the underwear jokes having <UNK> almost never remove that damn hat and <UNK> coat even though bogart would have etc just aren't funny and really pull down this film fourth i've never heard a <UNK> theme song this side of mitchell finally the film's false <UNK> for bogart and other classic actors work is truly irritating bogart almost never played a straight hero on those occasions he was a hero he played complicated characters this movie makes bogart out to be a trigger happy <UNK> do <UNK> while this may have been true about some film characters <UNK> characters rarely fit that bill it's movies like this that make people to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl crap with low production values
<START> when <UNK> <UNK> gets an attack of the <UNK> about what she does she wants out unfortunately madsen is her immediate superior in a company where giving two weeks notice ain't an option br br as a teen killing vampires <UNK> did a very good job the valley girl image seemed to fit but as an assassin on the run well keep running <UNK> run run far away this film is not a concept that hasn't been done before but it has been done better br br i didn't want to watch the rest of this film but i felt i should if i wanted to give a review of this movie i've always liked madsen and his character was a bit predictable but this movie was definitely a waste of time both to watch and make no wonder it never got released <UNK>
<START> very good starring dick which in a way kind of reminded me of <UNK> only angels have wings 1939 in which also acted this film was directed by masterful william <UNK> who was responsible for the landmark <UNK> silent picture wings br br plays a devil may care airplane pilot who is a blamed for an <UNK> accident afterwards he meets and falls for pretty sally who <UNK> as part of an act in an <UNK> air circus but when brother appears in scene a <UNK> relationship ensues br br central airport has many thrilling moments and some moving and touching scenes too thanks to the great chemistry that develops between and who in my opinion in this film resembles very much actress dorothy tom brown is good as brother fresh from his success in <UNK> tom brown of <UNK> br br great special effects good flying stunts <UNK> paced film in all highly entertaining don't miss it when tcm <UNK> it again
<START> i will start by saying i have always been a bonnie hunt fan she always adds life to any character she plays and she did a wonderful job in her directorial debut br br i have to admit this is a chick flick but keeping that in mind it is a wonderful story it touches on many emotions and <UNK> all sorts of reactions br br this film depicts real life like people with real life like situations tho i have to <UNK> the coincidence that is the major part of the film br br it's a love story not just of a man and a woman but the love of family friends and loved ones past even pets br br i really enjoyed it well worth the rental or the purchase
<START> <UNK> innocent no smoking drinking or <UNK> but jeremy <UNK> good actor and <UNK> lane good actress make this <UNK> for a bad biker flick post biker exploit time they knew it we knew it adam <UNK> and <UNK> are wasted but they lived on br br a 3 out of 10 best performance <UNK> lane lane is the only really to catch the final exploit biker film after run angel run which also has good actors like don <UNK> etc it was over they knew it they were trying to make a living but <UNK> lane from two elvis bad flicks <UNK> me and something bad one in yellow and leather is the modern hot chick with j <UNK> fighting for honor it's worth seeing but it sucks but check it out well worth non biker non <UNK> non <UNK> biker types with hot chicks
<START> it says a lot about the united kingdom when television <UNK> like this not only get made but also run for three series unfunny politically correct to the point of sickening and poorly acted and written <UNK> <UNK> has not been funny or accomplished in anything that she has been in go on tell me i am wrong and <UNK> <UNK> funny guy as he is is well past his eighties prime this is such a bad comedy that it could have been made by <UNK> but even <UNK> like the upper hand and the one with james <UNK> as a car park attendant look like <UNK> towers compared to this rubbish i would love to sit down with the writer director of this show so that they can point out the humour in this programme admittedly the majority of the <UNK> population is made up of poorly educated but this would not <UNK> their funny bones that's if they could tear themselves away from big brother or from their mobile phones but that's another story complete and utter dirt
<START> being <UNK> and brought up with the history of tin mining this film is quite special to me filmed in and around various locations in <UNK> it depicts the story of two your children who get trapped down a mine with a group of <UNK> br br the of the title refers to the ghosts of child <UNK> who <UNK> in the mine and are said to bring evil to all that mine there events take place with an american wanting to <UNK> in local tin mining but when the young local kid josh is plagued by <UNK> of the ghost of a young boy he and his american <UNK> set out to unravel the mystery behind his death <UNK> in the rescue of themselves and several <UNK> from almost certain death when a new <UNK> is opened and the save them br br top film albeit low budget and short but worth a look if you're from <UNK> and or into tin mining
<START> who's the man what's that i hear a <UNK> cry of kevin well if you didn't shout for the <UNK> <UNK> i'd recommend changing your <UNK> <UNK> anyway this is no first class movie just a very well produced story that is almost believable considering its about an alien your probably wondering what the all acting is top stuff and also the first i've seen a balanced sarcastic alien just enjoyable is all i can say and almost for the whole family if not for the scene later in the movie seven stars
<START> more of a character study then a movie committed is yet just another relationship romp with the <UNK> specifically made for a young target audience the direction seems very basic with obvious dramatic irony and a classic case of the lost loser versus the clueless committed committed is watchable at times and there is a small feeling of originality from lisa krueger br br committed is completely <UNK> for the first twenty minutes we get to know but the movie picks up when her husband disappears sets off to find him br br some parts are strange other times the movie drags the second half is more humorous as we see spiritual antics take a turn for the more intense the annoying guitar music is awful but perhaps a necessary evil as committed offers very little anyway an average movie <UNK> by some completely pointless moments committed 's only asset is heather graham and patricia <UNK>
<START> admittedly i am not a fan of the <UNK> chan films the plot involving <UNK> <UNK> from a bank vault is a bit far fetched and a long way from the atmospheric mysteries that fox produced <UNK> <UNK> and benson <UNK> as no 3 son tommy provide some laughs as usual but otherwise there isn't much here great title that is wasted
<START> feeling <UNK> is one of the worst films i have ever seen it is also one of the most disgusting films ever made it has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting mob man at the wedding she meets his brother they have sex in the house after they eat the cake than decide to run away together the other brother of course comes after him guns blazing and he kills his wife wakes up to find her corpse in the <UNK> and <UNK> her he than seems to become friends with and they try to get money together because someone is <UNK> them because he saw them and the body this <UNK> about and several characters dies or come back to life but it never comes together with anything that could be called a good plot the performances are horrible by pretty much everybody cameron diaz keanu reeves and dan the direction dialogue and visual effects are just horrible a disgusting and horrible movie
<START> the plot was really weak and confused this is a true oprah flick in <UNK> world all men are evil and all women are victims
<START> i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences i guessed the film will be interesting in fact isn't at all not so much profound for a such subject eternity never ending life experiences after death and the film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all at least not express yet it's so naive charming film but naive film a must to avoid the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all <UNK> <UNK> is so charming and voight is doing his best normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store it's a pity 'cause i well know voight was seriously involved with <UNK> and the film isn't so much profound about it
<START> avoid this film if you are looking for entertainment br br it is filled with <UNK> trying to be something that they are not and <UNK> is just wasted in the role of a tour guide who falls for a newcomer who needs to go to acting school seriously where to they get these people from just because you're pretty doesn't mean you can act or should be an actress br br <UNK> needs to send an <UNK> letter to everyone who accidentally watches him makes a fool of himself in this poor excuse for a film he plays an insipid wannabe gangster who drugs girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them off to the highest <UNK>
<START> yes watch this movie if you like brave films this is maybe the best mexican picture since alley just because the excellent cast the outrageous direction and a sublime soundtrack many people did not like they think it's very aggressive but they didn't understand that it was just a representation with hyper realism of the mexican society but so similar to all the third world families i hope that benjamin <UNK> and bruno <UNK> who in this movie gives another example of his greatness as an actor soon get together again with a new film just remember how los <UNK> luis <UNK> was misunderstood when released but now we consider one of the best movies of all times please prepare yourself and watch this film
<START> considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history someone had to be the first one could make a case that in shoulder arms charlie chaplin invented the genre br br hard to believe that back then this was a daring move when you consider that some of the best films involving such people as bob hope <UNK> <UNK> laurel hardy involved military service and made during war time it's just something you accept and laugh at br br in the first world war chaplin along with fellow stars douglas fairbanks and mary pickford went out on bond <UNK> he was a great <UNK> of the allied cause unusual for someone of his left wing views it would seem only natural that the tramp would be <UNK> and unfortunately would around and <UNK> havoc on all br br a lot of things you'd see in the service comedies of world war ii got their start in shoulder arms chaplin had no more <UNK> because within a few weeks of the film's release the war was over br br but a comedy art form had been established by one of <UNK> greatest geniuses
<START> telly <UNK> <UNK> it up as the mexican revolutionary though he's matched by chuck <UNK> as a military <UNK> in this <UNK> yet rather boring <UNK> on the famous historical <UNK> life and times an earlier attempt villa rides 1968 with <UNK> <UNK> in the role and co starring robert dealt with these events more <UNK> and on a <UNK> scale as such <UNK> villa is an all too typical european venture and an <UNK> one at that despite its <UNK> the end result is more often silly rather than amusing though a few moments most notably the action set pieces and a scene involving a <UNK> inside a church offer some mild pleasure oh and <UNK> even gets to sing over the end titles
<START> this show makes absolutely no sense every week two ladies go to an estate to do some <UNK> and every week without fail they somehow stumble upon a murder because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder right but even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder wouldn't the smart thing to do be to tell the police you know the people who can actually do something about it but every week these two fools go around <UNK> evidence committing crimes of their own and in some cases causing more murders once they do miraculously solve the murders there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted all the evidence has been <UNK> and you'd think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two wouldn't you <UNK> we've solved the murder now like every other week let's go and confront the murderer ourselves and with no back up tell them that we know about it there is no way we could get ourselves into any danger is there <UNK> and is one of the worst shows on television and certainly the most ridiculous
<START> i am the kind of person who can enjoy a good b movie if it has some kind of redeeming value to it but dead space has nothing to redeem it this is the kind of film that will make you frustrated restless and sick to your stomach br br bad acting lame story terrible effects horrible excruciating dialogue dead space has it all
<START> richard norton really lights the screen up in this <UNK> <UNK> based martial arts masterpiece norton an aussie <UNK> plays the evil mr who runs a successful <UNK> <UNK> business both <UNK> arms and <UNK> in the female flesh trade usually the women are <UNK> from his favorite dance club with the help of a squad of <UNK> the most well known of who is <UNK> <UNK> playing the role of ice trouble comes for when a new cop in town john kim <UNK> lee is out to avenge his dead partners murder at the hand of organization if you have time to see only one martial arts movie this year don't miss this classic
<START> all the way though i was thinking to myself oh god why at the very beginning i thought right it might be average but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious br br every part in it was so predictable even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring it was a half decent movie but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves <UNK> the part were <UNK> falls off the building had me in <UNK> my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next and more times than less i was right br br why does going into the house make her come after you it doesn't make sense it was a poor excuse for a lot of killings and no really depth was seen at all br br you can see everything coming which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching oh <UNK> behind her didn't see that one coming <UNK> br br surely these people must have thought to oh i don't know carry a knife round or at least try and fight back instead of being eaten but someone hair at best during the movie i was very mildly scared and i mean mildly i was just crying out for the credits as they rolled i <UNK> a short oh thank god if you haven't already don't waste time and money on this pointless plot less sorry excuse for a sequel

<START> hilariously inept like she wore a yellow <UNK> remade by five year olds br br spoilers ahead despite its title and the high <UNK> slaughter trail is in fact a musical with <UNK> battles instead of dance numbers br br if you ever wondered what ed wood might have done with a b movie budget this film should answer your question some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect such as filming in the short lived process which resulted in faces changing <UNK> within the same shot but there was definitely some ill advised <UNK> on the film's main set a <UNK> <UNK> that seems to be partly a norman castle br br terry who later wrote the 'the bare for disney's the jungle book supplies a score full of original <UNK> which would have been wonderful for a cartoon but which fit western action like a fuzzy <UNK> stuck in a one song tells how horse <UNK> pound and their melody sounds like the <UNK> during a dead serious scene of a <UNK> <UNK> other songs literally <UNK> the story shot by shot introducing characters describing their <UNK> and gestures as they happen on screen and even stop to <UNK> the process br br the script sends <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio by the end of the film what looks like a hundred <UNK> and have bitten the dust thanks to repeated footage of the same characters dying over and over but the chief is satisfied once he sees the trio of <UNK> have been <UNK> as the singer <UNK> informs those of us who weren't paying attention the <UNK> ride away their battle called off the <UNK> captain surrounded by the corpses of his fallen <UNK> waves his appreciation br br the direction could most <UNK> be described as wooden or more to the point wood en <UNK> are consistently shot off their horses in <UNK> never just one virtually every red man on foot dies by throwing his hands in the air and <UNK> over the film also employs the most <UNK> <UNK> in hollywood who <UNK> before dropping off a one story roof and still fail to stick the landing or turn to look behind them as they slide dead down a rocky <UNK> br br the star is brian <UNK> who surely deserves an oscar for not <UNK> after the endless final battle scene climax is <UNK> the word he <UNK> a list of the dozens of his troopers killed and <UNK> it could've been a lot worse <UNK> andy <UNK> gets to sing and <UNK> murderer gig young laughs at <UNK> antics which leads a character who had been held up by masked <UNK> to rat gig out i'd know that laugh anywhere br br and <UNK> anyone forget just what a nasty piece of work howard hughes could be recall that as head of rko hughes was first in line to <UNK> original star howard da <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> him it would take hughes another six years to finish running that once celebrated studio into the ground but it didn't help things when he insisted on da every scene for this film <UNK> <UNK> br br it was nearly a decade before da <UNK> was able to work in hollywood again but all things considered for getting him out of slaughter trail he should have sent hughes a thank you note
<START> stealing time actually dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously titled <UNK> landing which explains how director marc was able to afford this cast of now established television movie actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production about ten minutes into the film you understand why this thing never got a theatrical release after it made the film festival rounds several years ago br br its recent distribution by franchise pictures probably reflects a perception that the rising popularity of certain cast members can be <UNK> to recover some of the modest production costs although not a great addition to anyone's resume young actors have done worse things when they were desperately seeking acting work of any kind br br peter ethan <UNK> scott <UNK> and charlotte play college friends who do an early big chill reunion and compare war stories about the failure of reality to measure up to their dreams br br unfortunately nothing else happens absolutely nothing yes alec dreams about a <UNK> store <UNK> and a bank robbery which are then cheaply and <UNK> staged to completely inappropriate music it is the least suspenseful bank job since w c fields was the guard in the bank dick br br if anyone can point to any moment in stealing time where something actually happens i would like to know about it because as far as i can tell not a thing happens in the whole film perhaps through <UNK> visual <UNK> is trying to say something profound about taking control of one's life before it is too late like st <UNK> fire the movie is <UNK> with every profound thought ever <UNK> by a young adult who has left the <UNK> tower to experience the real world for the first time br br i felt was going for a kind of howard <UNK> young professionals in action only angels have wings <UNK> then again i'm sure i was reading much too much into the film after all things actually happen howard <UNK> films br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> an awful travesty of the greek resistance <UNK> <UNK> badly miscast as a greek girl there are plenty of attractive good english greek actresses so why pick a spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an english actor as her father supposedly a greek doctor many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from greek theatre and tv series the only foreign actor to my knowledge who has successfully portrayed a greek was anthony quinn as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> the greek as the in the greek <UNK> and as a greek colonel in the guns of br br there is some historical truth reflected in the film people who remember the italian <UNK> of the islands agree that the italians were not harsh unlike the germans who succeeded them also <UNK> forces as hinted in the movie had been defeated by the greek army in the <UNK> campaign after the germans <UNK> in the <UNK> they allowed the italian military to <UNK> certain parts of <UNK> so the <UNK> of the local government to surrender to italian forces rather than to the germans as portrayed in the film is quite plausible although i am not certain this actually happened
<START> purchased this film for one dollar and figured i could never go wrong my big mistake was watching it enjoyed the acting of ice t and the <UNK> which gave lots of class to this film about los angeles and the world of <UNK> there is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and who has a career but because of mental problems from childhood and the killing of this other boxer he <UNK> he gets hired by a <UNK> who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls that work for him at their trade and make sure they are not beaten up this boxer falls in love with the <UNK> girlfriend and all kinds of trouble starts this is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy
<START> even if you're not a theatre person i highly recommend that you see this based off of a play of the same name by christopher bond which in turn had been based off of an old london legend <UNK> did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage the score is just amazing by far <UNK> best and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever the show was cast extremely well my only complaint being of <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> it s good mind you and she's a very versatile actress but she just doesn't sing and bird too well but other than that it's all phenomenal angela lansbury made the role of mrs and she just does it so well george was a good replacement for <UNK> in the title role and ken <UNK> gives a great performance as <UNK> the ending will give you chills top marks for a wonderful show
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was fun from start to finish br br it's difficult to define why one film touches or <UNK> with you or not and i won't try to analyze such perfect comedy so politically incorrect that even academic papers should be dedicated to it br br everything is old fashioned here from women's clothes sigh <UNK> dance the hero singing <UNK> sounds like an italian sung in <UNK> br br <UNK> is physically <UNK> but dumb as hell from all the he looks like sean connery but is definitely more because he's silly speaks his mind all the time <UNK> even has some <UNK> fantasies and there are <UNK> about him in short as an anti hero he rocks sometimes he only raises his <UNK> or <UNK> and that's all it takes to make you laugh br br is the true queen of the film <UNK> <UNK> but with ideals to the contrary is reduced to a femme fatale of sorts it's surprising to see her that sexy bomb <UNK> br br you just can't compare it with austin powers i agree with <UNK> d hartley seattle <UNK> on it being <UNK> to the genre br br which is your favourite scene one of my favourite scenes is the fight of the <UNK> with the masked villain but the truly perfect one is when <UNK> at the cocktail with his contacts how they all <UNK> <UNK> with confidence this scene alone makes the comedy genre worthwhile
<START> the worst movie ever made if anyone asks you what is the worst movie you've ever seen tell them <UNK> fiction of all the movies i've ever seen this gotta be the most lame experience even the <UNK> sequels are pure masterpieces compared
<START> i saw this movie yesterday i must admit i love it it's like early tarantino but better really a must but don't show this movie to anyone younger than 18 it's full of blood and sex rape scene is great now i'm just waiting for other movies of this director and a dvd release
<START> why on earth does five us keep repeating this one the title actually says it all the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you never heard of and that resembles to nothing br br you'll see ninety minutes of changing locations most of them will be blown up later on in the movie right in the beginning you see a nice little farm typical for the <UNK> which is in the movie moved close to paris but then it does not survive the transport to the <UNK> de france very well it explodes 1 minute later there are also two gangster who have no <UNK> as if that would make sense in the world of and internet let alone <UNK> and paper br br it just goes on like that nothing makes sense in this story my only credit goes to the cameraman the camera is excellent
<START> i loved the first american <UNK> with all my heart and soul that i considered it to be the best movie about rock <UNK> roll along with being the best teenager flick i've ever seen the first film <UNK> the careers of george lucas who would later do the blockbuster epic star wars before doing the <UNK> two decades later while making richard dreyfuss a star in jaws close encounters of the third kind and other films as well br br somehow without those two the magic died off br br more american <UNK> shows audiences what happened to the rest of the characters later on in the sixties where steve ron howard and laurie cindy williams are <UNK> against the vietnam war while their friend terry the <UNK> fields charles martin smith is in the war himself and trying to get out john <UNK> paul le <UNK> is still the hot drag <UNK> in california where he never quite left home the rest of the supporting actors in the film from candy <UNK> debbie <UNK> girlfriend to the <UNK> gang members along with harrison ford and others really don't do much the original film showed teenagers <UNK> the streets without any bloodshed with the early music of rock <UNK> roll from buddy holly the chuck <UNK> <UNK> domino bill <UNK> and the buddy knox and more that brought back the nostalgia bug in classic music the soundtrack for more american <UNK> is a mixture of rock soul country hippie music and whatever <UNK> the mood during the late 60's of <UNK> drugs sacrifices and more br br after watching more american <UNK> it looked like it wanted to show audience members what happened after the title <UNK> of the four main characters in the first film with the exception of <UNK> character where it wasn't necessary this film wasn't necessary either as i was glad to see that neither lucas or dreyfuss moved on to bigger and better projects
<START> okay the title house of frankenstein was a reference to a line from the original frankenstein movie when they follow it up with a movie entitled house of dracula which makes no real sense you know that it's just beginning to turn into a franchise br br without explanation dracula is back and he's calling himself baron he <UNK> the home of a doctor with the claim that he is seeking a cure for his <UNK> has a <UNK> nurse who <UNK> him what is it with <UNK> <UNK> in these movies but what dracula is really interested in is his other more beautiful assistant at this point larry wolf man <UNK> returns again no explanation given and just happens to be seeking the same doctor for a cure to his <UNK> and then he just happens to fall into a cave in which plants can be grown to help him which also just so happens to contain the frankenstein monster dear god when will it end sure the other universal monster sequels were silly but this is just ridiculous br br first the good stuff there are some great settings and the vampire bat effects are slightly better than usual some of the other effects are pretty neat too john carradine isn't bad as dracula once you get used to him but still nothing like as brilliant as lugosi was in my opinion <UNK> stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie although he has exactly the opposite problem to carradine all of the creepiness and none of the class none of the performances are that great but it's more due to the atrocious script than anything else the female parts are particularly badly written but stupid as it is it remains reasonably entertaining for the most part the best thing about it is it's short length br br now the bad stuff it's not creepy it's poorly written and it doesn't work i was hoping the three monsters would begin some kind of a supernatural struggle for power but it doesn't happen the focus is almost entirely on dracula who isn't particularly well portrayed on the other hand this is the only movie in which dracula <UNK> another man but it is done via a blood <UNK> rather than a bite as universal were always uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext larry <UNK> is decent as always as the wolf man but he plays a <UNK> small part once again the part of <UNK> monster is reduced to the anti climatic closing moments for god's sake glenn strange was fantastic as the creature why not give him more screen time it's unfortunate that the series had to end on this note not counting the classic comedy <UNK> <UNK> meet frankenstein in the end it just <UNK> in the <UNK> and died much like dracula himself
<START> brilliant screenplay br br the screenplay is very tight that u will be <UNK> in seat br br this movie is an example for movie can survive only with screenplay and no story needed br br story is very simple that u can write in one line but screenplay was amazing br br brilliant performance by <UNK> and br br though plot is similar to director adapted only the plot <UNK> version is much fast paced than <UNK> br br movie travels straight without any chance of <UNK> though u can understand each and every characters back drop br br keep going
<START> <UNK> is a nice heartwarming movie for whole family it's obviously not a great movie free willy looks much better almost in every <UNK> of film making possibly at times it becomes a bit naive and the writing and the script are not the best part of the movie but it's a entertaining film with very good cinematography including underwater shots and some important moral messages <UNK> wood proves himself one more time as an incredibly talented and underrated actor he can make bad movie watchable okay movie good good great and great movie becomes all time classic paul hogan performance also was very good and he is completely fit to his role as i already say above whole cinematography was very good but underwater shots definitely is the best parts so <UNK> is a perfect way if you want to see nice sweet and entertaining movie if you like me become sick and tired of modern hollywood trash filled with sex violence <UNK> and profanity you most likely would like this movie br br my rating 7 7 out of 10 feel free for <UNK> me about any of my comments and <UNK> here br br sorry for my bad english
<START> i've commented once on this <UNK> great but i had to do it again to say some things about the film when i first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater the film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first <UNK> film ever in a theater and that was a special moment for me because i <UNK> <UNK> the other horror villains are <UNK> with great <UNK> and the gore was shockingly great the scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful that was a great gore scene and the ending was so bizarre and shocking it made me s my pants the idea of having the seed of <UNK> was very very bizarre and shocking when i left the theater i just loved it and i <UNK> believe it was real the bizarre and different qualities of this child's play installment for some reason made me mark it as the jason goes to hell of the child's play series it just had that intensely shocking bizarre and different quality that reminded me of jason goes to hell a sure out of here's how i rank the series 1 4 2 3 i loved it but not quite as much as tom <UNK> original child's play classic i can't wait for seed of <UNK> bring it on
<START> the answer no sadly not though miller and the <UNK> has to be <UNK> as a most whimsical cinematic treat the drama suspense romance and the <UNK> crowd at the end all add to the films complex storyline which must have been too much for the audiences of <UNK> a <UNK> experience one for all the family
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> is by far the best single entry in the <UNK> genre i can recall the charge against it made by critics it is a cut and <UNK> of two previous <UNK> films with some added new material to make it appear fresh misses the fact that this cut and <UNK> approach <UNK> one of the central problems of the sword and <UNK> movies with most of these films the middle third <UNK> horribly usually involving a sappy love story or <UNK> political intrigue or both queen falls in love with <UNK> and her evil brother plots against them etc it's often hard to hold on through this to watch the exciting finale <UNK> the <UNK> cuts all that crap from the source films and adds a rather <UNK> narrative of a <UNK> <UNK> bullying his way into power it should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but <UNK> critical remark on the rise of <UNK> in italy this also sets up a fine final match between the real <UNK> and his <UNK> br br in a focus i might also add that further editing has improved individual scenes borrowed from the other films for my money the <UNK> scene here is much better than it first appeared in <UNK> and the captive women since it has been <UNK> with the <UNK> of several characters and their plot complications br br there are also <UNK> monsters creepy underworld <UNK> borrowed literally from mario <UNK> an entire city destroyed and the usual amount of lovely babes in revealing <UNK> since no one expects any of these films to compete with the seven samurai or even with the magnificent seven it seems a bit <UNK> to hold the film's <UNK> from other films against it
<START> the film starts out great with a mock <UNK> film about the <UNK> of swedish <UNK> after that we get a detailed <UNK> of post war <UNK> with lots of amazing cars electronic equipment and interior design a minimal jazz score nice cinematography and stylish <UNK> also there's some funny rivalry like in von <UNK> br br sadly after the set up kitchen stories <UNK> like the twin towers on 9 11 actors who try to portray the emotion by just staring in front of them corny dialog filled with stale gay symbolism in the vain of i don't like white <UNK> i prefer bears and wolves u ever <UNK> bear meat the music becomes <UNK> than at his worst br br it's a pity the director put all the effort in this great set up just to screw it up after <UNK>
<START> fat man and little boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs that were dropped in reverse order on <UNK> and how these came to be and came to be in american hands is the story of this film br br the terms by the way are the code names of two bombs <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> fat man was the <UNK> bomb and that one was dropped on <UNK> and little boy was the one used on <UNK> br br the film is primarily a conflict between general leslie r of the united states army and <UNK> j robert <UNK> who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under direction with two men from as widely <UNK> backgrounds as these were conflict was inevitable br br paul newman who all his life has been a <UNK> <UNK> plays general to his credit newman does not play a man whose views he would very little in common with as any kind of caricature is a military man first and foremost with an <UNK> background he wanted a combat command as trained military professionals would naturally want in this greatest of wars but because of his background in <UNK> got to head the manhattan project which was what the effort was code named so be it newman is determined to make his contribution to the war effort count br br most of us first became <UNK> with dwight <UNK> from the a team as h m <UNK> the pilot whose grip on reality is <UNK> at best if one was only <UNK> with the a team one might think that <UNK> had a great future in comic roles br br instead dwight <UNK> is one of the best actors in the english speaking world with an astonishing range of dramatic parts since leaving that television series j robert <UNK> in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy the challenge of the problem also <UNK> him later on <UNK> got into a real <UNK> because of his left wing political views and associates which everyone knew walking into the manhattan project br br some of the lesser roles that stand out are bonnie <UNK> as mrs <UNK> natasha richardson as communist mistress whose affair with <UNK> got him in such a <UNK> later on and laura dern as a nurse at the los site br br but the best is john cusack who as michael <UNK> is a <UNK> of some real life scientists who might accurately be labeled as the first <UNK> of the atomic age his scenes with laura dern especially with what happens to him take on a real <UNK> br br the debate over the bombs as the use put to them is still a matter of raging debate fat man and little boy presents the facts and lets you decide what might have happened if an alternative use of them had been taken
<START> pitch black is a survival story it's about how to survive in an hostile alien world against even more hostile enemies the task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group br br the plot of pitch black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations but what makes this movie shine above others is it's well written characters br br the group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others jack a boy with a secret <UNK> a pilot having hard time with her own conscience <UNK> a bounty hunter with a drug habit <UNK> a holy man facing the fact that god is sometimes cruel and <UNK> a convict and a murderer learning to value others not only himself characters start to live in the movie they aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre you start to care for the characters especially for <UNK> though that feels quite odd he is supposed to be the bad guy in this movie the line between light and pitch black is very thin all characters are familiar with both br br other thing that works in this movie is the casting rarely do actors fit to their roles this well <UNK> mitchell is suitable for <UNK> cole <UNK> brings the right amount of <UNK> and sense of responsibility for <UNK> but the most impressive work is done by <UNK> <UNK> he does great job as <UNK> in his hands <UNK> is quite creepy definitely very dangerous and also deep character just as he is supposed to be br br so how do you survive in pitch black keep your friends close and enemies even closer
<START> i just caught this on showtime not even fun in a bad movie kind of way one of the <UNK> monster flicks i've ever seen plus the tv reporter in the movie was that annoying <UNK> from a past season of survivor the only amusing thing was that the secret base was the house from fantasy island and a million other movies and tv shows the place is located in the l a area i fully expected mr <UNK> and <UNK> to come out and <UNK> the <UNK> if <UNK> had gotten eaten by the snake i might have given this movie a 2 but oh well watching people stand there and scream for five minutes while the <UNK> or the <UNK> <UNK> over them instead of making a run for it was pretty funny especially because you could really tell that they were just screaming at an empty spot where the computer animators would later paint in the monster i nearly fell out of my chair though when in a flashback scene they brought in either the <UNK> or the <UNK> then normal size in some <UNK> solid steel <UNK> with some air holes <UNK> into it wouldn't a wire cage have <UNK> lol guess they couldn't afford to rent a real <UNK> and <UNK> i have to remember i rent showtime for their series and not their movies
<START> following the <UNK> atmospheric original and the <UNK> silly second one this incredibly dull slow and <UNK> sequel comes across as a major letdown once again the <UNK> criminal mastermind the bat hammy luis is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the aztec mummy the bat builds a hilariously clunky <UNK> robot with a human brain in order to achieve this <UNK> goal <UNK> directed by <UNK> with a talky and tedious script by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> continuity for example the bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film but is miraculously alive and well here an excruciatingly <UNK> script an excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks a meandering narrative a <UNK> lack of action and momentum largely dreary going through the motions non acting from an understandably <UNK> cast and a poorly staged climactic battle between the mummy and the robot the movie finally bursts to <UNK> stupid life with said big bash but alas it barely even lasts two lousy minutes and thus proves to be much too little far too late to <UNK> the <UNK> of the general overwhelming boredom this numbingly dry <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> rates as a complete <UNK>
<START> such a shame that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such talent in writers and actors such wonderful scenery that was the ultimate <UNK> for those in a land locked sun <UNK> state many of the actors went on to bigger things another <UNK> that there was something wonderful sadly lost i lived in <UNK> <UNK> at the time with all of my now ex husband's very large family in a chorus of <UNK> no ' every time it would be yet again taken over by a baseball game broadcast br br someone who wrote here mentioned it was up against all my ex and i noticed was that it was always always always <UNK> by baseball yes fox really wasted something wonderful that one and nothing will ever equal it thank you for the memories of it
<START> this is a joke right this can't be a real film it's not even a real video give any harvey milk high school kid a video <UNK> and they could make a better movie than this the film <UNK> can't be serious right is this satire comedy drama gone horribly wrong the script is about as single minded and dull as is <UNK> ten monkeys locked in a room with a <UNK> could come up with a better screenplay the dialogue isn't clichéd clichéd dialogue might elevate this holiday mess to something akin to camp fun but it doesn't and it isn't worst of the worst a <UNK> wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed a carrying a <UNK> pan like something out of a <UNK> episode <UNK> i have seen better acting from middle school drama <UNK> one of the leads is an attractive <UNK> the other is not both can't even manage a convincing kiss so much for romance the supporting players are jaw <UNK> over the top br br everything is <UNK> by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a back room toilet most of the dialogue is mercifully <UNK> br br this stale cinematic <UNK> isn't even worthy of being the next rocky horror or a gay holiday installment of mystery science theatre 3000 it's just plain bad in every way visions of will not dance in your head they will <UNK> your every expectation have an <UNK> and stare at <UNK> at the <UNK> holiday lights it will be time better spent
<START> if <UNK> is a territory of the <UNK> with its <UNK> of perspective that's part of this movie's challenge to realism and it's an <UNK> pleasure here <UNK> fellini with not one but three film directors plus of course the actual <UNK> who has made some really great movies and shouldn't be <UNK> about his honor there is a variety of takes and casting <UNK> on i with somewhere there actual marriage <UNK> is also taken to be a territory of <UNK> you already know this version of the island so there's no spoiler involved a comic version of which makes the picture worth seeing for sergio work with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of a <UNK>
<START> how bad idea was to remake an almost oscar worthy film martha is much more better has <UNK> <UNK> and so on and mainly a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role <UNK> it's a joke and <UNK> with the handsome aaron and the whole atmosphere again a ridiculous effort from hollywood there are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes isn't anybody there who can create a good and newly script or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the well tried cartoon figures the films are getting much less interesting nowadays oh yes if you want to see a really good movie watch the original one it's definitely worth
<START> i think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after seinfeld after and after friends those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time br br came at the end of this special time in tv br br but don't let that <UNK> you br br king of queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned br br seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic i never laughed so hard than i did at seinfeld but comes real close br br when it comes to laughing i have to rate second only to seinfeld has to be second though as the character creation and interaction is more endearing br br either way is top ten of the last 20 years br br the only other sitcom worth mentioning now is two and a half men which really doesn't hold a candle to the other four but is all we have left
<START> i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie it was unbelievable me and a group of friends decided to watch this one night and it was just the stupidest thing any of us had ever seen i couldn't believe it we watched the first 15 minutes in utter awe that somebody actually thought of this and then made it into a movie are they on crack my guess is yes in huge doses i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash is this supposed to be sci fi or comedy or what i don't thing the idiots who made this even care they just decided to make a movie about nothing and see how many <UNK> they could trick into watching it well we put something on film so let's take it to the movie store and see if they actually put it on the shelf no no no this is not movie making the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is i feel like going to the movie store and complaining and getting my money back nobody should have to endure this crap so i am here to warn you do not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen
<START> i was unfamiliar with this film until i saw it included in a list of the top 20 spaghetti westerns i recently came across following the marathon i made these last few weeks of films from the <UNK> it was <UNK> then that the film had to turn up almost immediately on late night italian tv for the first time i'm pretty sure in a good number of years br br unfortunately the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast hasn't been great lately i recorded the film on vhs but i decided not to keep it due to this factor as it happened the very next day i watched the film i found out that it was available on a region 2 dvd from italy featuring an interview with uncredited scriptwriter <UNK> <UNK> and having been <UNK> impressed i decided to order it there and then even if i knew that i wouldn't be getting to the dvd for quite a while as i like to allow some time between one viewing of a film and the next a brief <UNK> here when i recently purchased a <UNK> of spaghetti westerns on italian dvd i <UNK> not to order sergio face to face 1967 since i was under the impression that it was a bare bones affair however i've just learned that the disc actually contains an interview with the director as had been the case with the big 1966 which i bought it did seem <UNK> to me that wouldn't offer similar contribution to that film's dvd edition when he actually considered face to face as his favorite work as per the director's talent bio included on the blue underground region 1 disc of yet another spaghetti western run man run 1968 the trouble is that i loved the big so much that i followed it with a viewing of face to face via the recording i owned made off italian tv i did order the dvd of that film now especially since it's still <UNK> but as i said with respect to a second look at the price of power although i may still check out interview when the disc arrives br br o k rant over the film under review is quite an unusual spaghetti western and a very interesting indeed ambitious one at that being a <UNK> of the <UNK> assassination case to an old west setting actually it's reminiscent of anthony <UNK> <UNK> black and white thriller the tall target 1951 which dealt with an assassination attempt on the life of then u s president abraham lincoln it features one of the most popular italian stars from this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in what is perhaps his most impressive western role many of his other films tended to have a light hearted bent the supporting cast includes at least two other <UNK> van johnson in one of his few and mainly <UNK> italian films as the american president killed in post civil war dallas and <UNK> <UNK> as the head of a conspiracy of <UNK> who not only plots his assassination but also conveniently <UNK> the new acting u s leader <UNK> vice president by means of blackmail br br <UNK> also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who <UNK> <UNK> all through the picture and with whom he's engaged a couple of times in a in the <UNK> with the guns <UNK> on the floor rather than in their respective <UNK> and the only light in the room provided by the end of the <UNK> <UNK> also involved is ray <UNK> as black sidekick whom the narrative eventually turns into the doomed lee harvey <UNK> figure <UNK> who later cut his teeth as director on a number of is behind the film's <UNK> cinematography similarly luis <UNK> supplies yet another great euro cult score which is different enough from the style of <UNK> <UNK> as to be equally <UNK> direction here may <UNK> be as <UNK> as that in other spaghetti westerns but he handles the proceedings <UNK> enough the final <UNK> is especially nicely done the film is certainly one of the more underrated entries in the <UNK> and for those so inclined the novelty of the plot line alone should make it one to look out for
<START> saw this film during the <UNK> <UNK> fest in august i was so inspired and touched harry had an amazing life and one of the best and distinct voices ever recorded for those of you who don't know about harry <UNK> do a little research and you'll see that harry has probably found his way into your life in one way or another maybe it was his 70s special the point or everybody's talking from midnight cowboy for me it started with people let me tell you bout my best friend the theme song from the <UNK> of <UNK> father watching this film you can really feel the love and admiration from harry's true friends and peers don't shed a tear for harry he had a ball br br brett
<START> it's been said before strangers on a train is hitchcock's best movie and he's made so many good ones like other hitchcock strangers on a train requires your full attention to really appreciate it but once you can you will
<START> lucio fulci was famous for his italian splatter movies mostly his undead films like zombie or the beyond here he directed a black comedy of sorts but there's just one problem its nauseating i say this knowing that i like city of the walking dead which is also gross but not like this a <UNK> <UNK> gets money for his habit by <UNK> ugly and <UNK> rich women then murdering them and stealing their cash the film makes this plan look that easy i guess the women were too ugly to go to a bank so they always had their cash on person after the murder i began to suspect what i've always heard about fulci he hated women he must have at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies avoid this film at all costs
<START> first off i am in my mid 40's been <UNK> horror films since i was a kid so i have seen a lot of variety imo this is not as bad as the <UNK> that gave this a 1 or 2 br br yes it is a low budget horror flick the dialog is <UNK> and acting tolerable sometimes the basis of this film <UNK> is actually pretty good for those of you old enough to remember or lucky enough to have seen them on dvd this is very much like a 1970's movie of the week just add in blood and minor gore minor t a and swearing without big names that is it to a t i would rather watch this than jason vs godzilla or whatever other crap is out there tho not as good evil dead was a low budget film at least give these guys credit for trying with <UNK> budget this could have been a pretty good flick my score a watchable 4
<START> i won't say anything about music because this topic can be so deep that it can become one huge separate review so let's concentrate on movie that is brilliant no doubt one of the best works of <UNK> br br the simple story about love friendship freedom and ideals oh yes the ideals for which even <UNK> are ready to go in war br br there is not a single fake word single fake character single fake feeling in the story because the love freedom and friendship isn't something complicated for the characters of movie these things aren't something that everyone can view from different angle these aren't things that need much thinking to understand their love is simple their friendship is simple their ideals are as simple as the word simple itself and that's why these characters are so deep br br <UNK> the leader of a hippie played by treat williams is a guy who lives to live and that's the biggest happiness for him he has his ass as he sings in one of the scenes in the movie and that's enough to make him happy with his property br br <UNK> never accepts that something can't be done and his right if he wants to go to some rich <UNK> <UNK> in his dirty old clothes and huge long hair he will do it if he <UNK> to go to another state to just see his friend he'll do it he never thinks twice he just do it br br how why is he so powerful the answer is simple because he is free br br just watch how the wind makes the hair wave in this movie and you will understand it all maybe you will even free yourself too
<START> a harrowing masterpiece on the sheer madness and despair of war fires on the plain is not going to be to everybody's taste this is a war movie in the <UNK> possible sense of the term one that <UNK> neither to flag waving <UNK> nor <UNK> sentimentality cuts deep it's ugly <UNK> and bleak as few things ever committed on celluloid will ever be this is war behind the <UNK> with no <UNK> or heroes no moral <UNK> or <UNK> to be had just a handful of <UNK> and terrible looking men <UNK> across a land <UNK> by war like <UNK> fleeing a great disaster the characters defy moral judgment because they are creatures <UNK> by a great <UNK> a <UNK> that does not <UNK> questions of a moral nature war and survival <UNK> one's will against the other's in a battlefield <UNK> the loser is simply removed from existence br br <UNK> soldier in the japanese <UNK> army is <UNK> from his platoon and ordered to report in a nearby hospital on account of him <UNK> blood and being disliked by the rest of the platoon he's told to never come back and instead commit suicide by hand <UNK> in case the hospital rejects him which it does the hospital is nothing but a shack made of wooden <UNK> and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he's capable of walking he's just fine it is in that <UNK> excuse of a hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes of the film takes place as the area is carpet bombed by american planes the doctors and those who can walk and sustain themselves flee from the hospital and into the woods moments before the hospital is blown to pieces the <UNK> and crippled figures of the sick and injured crawl out of it in every manner of <UNK> dressed in their <UNK> white <UNK> as if the building is some kind of beast <UNK> <UNK> and filth out upon the earth br br that is greatest success the stark and brooding depiction of the suffering of war in simple but <UNK> images without melodrama or pseudo <UNK> soldiers cross a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> deep in mud move across the opposite bank and into a field only to discover enemy tanks hiding in the woods their lights shining like <UNK> eyes as they <UNK> the dark a <UNK> of injured soldiers dirty and half mad crossing a road dropping to the ground on the sound of enemy planes <UNK> <UNK> on a pile of dead bodies an abandoned village a mad soldier that believes himself to be <UNK> sitting under a tree covered with flies and his own <UNK> offering his arm to be eaten by <UNK> when he's dead these are the images <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for our eyes <UNK> and <UNK> in their <UNK> but honest and raw br br doesn't rush to get somewhere it is content to follow travels through the war torn land as he tries to reach the <UNK> center of and observe the madness and <UNK> of war the movie <UNK> through the <UNK> of the horror of war slow and brooding just like the characters it follows the final thirty minutes with <UNK> taking <UNK> with two who feed on <UNK> are the closest comes to <UNK> to conventional <UNK> and they're no less powerful for that matter strikingly photographed in black and white with great performances from the cast and assured direction is not only among the best war movies to be made but also among the finest of japanese cinema
<START> this <UNK> fails so miserably on every level that it is difficult to decide what to say it doesn't merit one line much less ten but to <UNK> to the rules of imdb here goes and i probably won't succeed the first time around and have to type some more to make up for this <UNK> to be accepted lol br br if i had seen this schlock during the '70s while i was going through my <UNK> phase i would have still considered it unimaginative and shallow the most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door opened and closed i was on the edge of my seat br br one person on here wrote that he had met the creator of this mess as if that were a red letter day in his life one can only pray that something far more exciting occurs in that posters life get a grip <UNK>
<START> 80's comedies especially ones with john <UNK> are awesome almost all are <UNK> and instant classics and this film is no exception plenty of <UNK> to other films i e godzilla and jaws through out the movie that are so <UNK> you'll be laughing for hours some may complain that the movie is a little corny at times but hey it was the 80's and things were always a little cheesy throw in a young <UNK> moore and an even <UNK> bob cat and you have a <UNK> on your fans if you haven't seen this you better soon
<START> having already seen the original jack frost i never thought that jack frost 2 would be as absurd as it is boy was i wrong then again a <UNK> movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material even worse than you might expect i believe this is the first a <UNK> sequel and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more a <UNK> sequels br br it's hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack <UNK> <UNK> which are essentially <UNK> with eyes arms a mouth and sharp teeth start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it they are shown both as puppets with a stick underneath to move them and as computer animation which i have to say looks very cheesy the computer animation surprised me as the first jack frost had no such effects br br i'd strongly recommend that you see the original jack frost before seeing this one both of which it would be <UNK> to watch with a group of friends to get the full amusement out of it and because it would make more sense sense being a relative term br br now only if there was uncle sam 2
<START> is one bad movie this doesn't even rate in the so bad its good category it's just bad from the lack of set design to the acting to the special effects everything about this movie stinks for starters the film looks like it was filmed in just empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look good then we get acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like it was an oscar candidate and to top it all off there's the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them off in their garage the towns that the monster is supposedly <UNK> look like my <UNK> train set so obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer the only good thing about the movie is the monster suit its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film and maybe a decent script would have helped too
<START> my only question is why did they make this movie did they have a script or did they make it up as they went along boom boom doesn't look like a <UNK> davis john garfield probably turned over in his grave if he saw this
<START> an expedition party made up of constantly <UNK> and obnoxious <UNK> go <UNK> into the dangerous african jungle in search of both a fortune in <UNK> and a missing young lady named diana <UNK> brunette <UNK> <UNK> clad solely in a skimpy <UNK> that shows off a lot of her hot <UNK> body who's <UNK> as a <UNK> by a deadly primitive tribe called the director screenwriter jess franco <UNK> fails to <UNK> any style or <UNK> into the generally blah and meandering proceedings allowing the <UNK> pace to crawl along at an often <UNK> slow clip and staging the <UNK> action scenes with a <UNK> lack of skill and <UNK> the lousy dubbing excess amount of grainy national <UNK> like animal stock footage <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> score terrible acting talky <UNK> narrative tepid soft core sex scenes and static photography don't help matters any as well fortunately there's plenty of tasty gratuitous nudity on sight to <UNK> the tedium to a reasonable extent besides the <UNK> both <UNK> mess as fierce wicked high <UNK> and <UNK> carmen as the conniving <UNK> <UNK> are likewise real easy on the eyes the beautiful jungle scenery is very nice too but overall this picture <UNK> up as barely watchable and hence instantly forgettable <UNK>

<START> a washed up reporter called bart pat <UNK> <UNK> gang boss <UNK> <UNK> george for the money to pay for his son to have a life saving operation in return he agrees to turn himself in for the murder of his editor whom the gang killed in order to prevent an <UNK> story being <UNK> about them br br typical poverty row b <UNK> of the time directed for far more than it's worth by <UNK> fisher who within months of making this would become one of the leading british horror film directors at the hammer studio the script is far fetched and teen idol tommy steele guitar in hand was <UNK> in to sing a poor rock and roll number called the rebel at a coffee bar that acts as a legitimate front for the <UNK> activities
<START> john candy was very much a hit or miss comic actor his death was a tragedy and we all miss him a lot but <UNK> east in which he plays a bumbling who agrees to take a group of <UNK> out of the wild west is even <UNK> i don't understand why it was even released the story is pointless and weak and the jokes aren't there it <UNK> me even further that <UNK> last film would be his all time worst movie so let's forget all about this one and remember him in his better films such as summer rental planes trains and <UNK> and uncle buck br br 0 out of 5
<START> dr lucio fulci lucio fulci is a director of gory horror movies who is starting to feel the effect of having filmed too many bloody scenes he visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his <UNK> this proves to be a bad idea since the shrink is actually a crazy murderer responsible for a <UNK> of grisly killings <UNK> the opportunity to make fulci his fall guy the <UNK> nut doctor the horror hack into thinking that he is responsible for the recent series of murders br br on the surface cat in the brain appears to be a fantastically gory treat from spaghetti splatter god lucio fulci chock full of chainsaw <UNK> axe attacks and various other bloody killings the film certainly <UNK> enough for even the most hardened gore <UNK> but when one looks closer it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are lifted from earlier movies mostly <UNK> own remove these from the <UNK> and one is left with a nifty basic plot idea that is totally wasted some welcome nudity and dreadful performances from fulci himself and david l thompson as the psycho shrink br br as the film progresses it develops into an incomprehensible mess with the gore footage inserted randomly with no attempt at working it convincingly into the story if you've seen <UNK> touch of death and <UNK> of or mario <UNK> the murder secret then you've already seen the best bits of cat in the brain before br br after much <UNK> the film <UNK> itself up rather quickly leaving the viewer feeling <UNK> and somewhat cheated watch the film if you're a fulci <UNK> but i would suggest seeking out the films from which the <UNK> were taken
<START> enchanted april was one of harry last movies he only directed a few more after this one he had made the <UNK> movies in the 1930s and 1940s in the opening credits it says from the novel by elizabeth and completely leaves off the author's last name rather odd but since it was von <UNK> they may not have wanted the german association at the time sad to hear it was a flop when it was released with those fun names like frank morgan the wizard and jessie ralph who played w c <UNK> <UNK> mother in law in bank dick two <UNK> in london ann <UNK> <UNK> alexander decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends but things don't go the way they planned <UNK> owen plays the husband with multiple personalities aside from a few funny moments it does move pretty slow ralph is the only bright spot here as the overbearing take charge type and the picture is quite fuzzy and out of focus for much of the film the views of italy are all obvious backdrops the only saving grace here is that the turner classic version is only <UNK> minutes long too bad they didn't give frank morgan a larger role this was remade in 1992 by the bbc as a british film
<START> this second full length lone ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and <UNK> action and moves along at a good clip the ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful indians being the victims of a gang of <UNK> killers there are more killings and violence usually associated with lone ranger adventures and the film has an <UNK> of racial <UNK> the comments of which are <UNK> throughout the screenplay the ranger uses <UNK> as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice <UNK> moore and jay star in a colorful presentation that shows the desert and <UNK> country of old <UNK> to good advantage the music score is good but the familiar william tell <UNK> theme is <UNK> aside by <UNK> that are interesting but lack the <UNK> and beauty of the traditional theme
<START> i saw the movie on its north american premiere july 14 2004 at the <UNK> festival i was slightly disappointed as i had been expecting a more epic ensemble cast movie along the lines of <UNK> the warrior instead the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters still the movie was solid thoughtful and visually intriguing there were slightly jarring tone shifts from the <UNK> thoughtful and realistic tone of confused <UNK> intrigue and blood versus the lighter more flamboyant martial arts sequences it almost seemed as though the filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about whether the movie was supposed to be a martial arts flick or a historical epic the story touches nicely on the issue about the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations is it really worth your life and those of your friends to be loyal to one's master or does there come a time when one must submit to the winds of change is there perhaps greater courage in leaving the old ways for new ones how does one decide these questions are raised in this movie and ironically there is the suggestion that the answer given may in fact be the wrong one
<START> well it is a <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> period of the <UNK> when poverty row studios put out a good many horror films that are almost <UNK> dull so i was expecting the worst br br the story concerns a doctor who has been working on a way to <UNK> life to the dead through the use of a room full of non <UNK> <UNK> devices which spark nicely there is a <UNK> heart hanging under a bell jar and <UNK> <UNK> which we are informed is proof that his method is <UNK> br br a brief discussion of the <UNK> <UNK> and mention of an important plot point <UNK> the inevitable death of a young man who is <UNK> in a rather <UNK> sequence <UNK> even with the sparks the important plot point is that a convicted murderer is being executed just at midnight which turns out to be exactly when the young man is <UNK> it is no surprise that the young man is very different after his experience apparently <UNK> and with a strange desire to visit the <UNK> of the underworld and become <UNK> with certain gangsters br br it's hard to explain why this all is not completely unwatchable but perhaps it <UNK> to say that it's mildly interesting and contains several murders and a couple of interesting characters towards the end it even begins to move along with a bit of real tension and a confrontation that is downright <UNK> spoiler br br i have to warn of a very very bad ending a <UNK> on unnecessary pain in the ass sorta ending after the plot <UNK> rather effectively br br you know the sort of thing it's all a dream never happened
<START> spoiler alert br br this was the worst of the series it is horror disguised as political satire and it is as subtle as a <UNK> hammer not very scary and not very insightful did micheal moore have anything to do with this piece of garbage br br i'm really sick of hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against george bush and constantly repeating the same talking points over and over again this movie wants to be but unlike that movie which subtly <UNK> <UNK> the problems soldiers who came back from vietnam by clever making the main character come back as a blood <UNK> zombie and slowly built on this theme it was a true horror film that was also good social commentary because it didn't get <UNK> and preachy br br i guess joe <UNK> thought this was trying to make a horror film to scare <UNK> <UNK> and and me being the last in that list found this film to be totally ridiculous manipulative and all at the same time and i don't mean the good type of exploitative that you often find in the drive in type movies i mean exploitative in the most sickening and vile manner using the deaths of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror film br br this film assumes that all the soldiers who died in iraq would vote against a conservative president if they would come back to life as zombies which is a flawed premise because as i recall for the most part and going by george romero's rules zombies are mindless flesh eating creatures operating on pure <UNK> and even though the zombie andy in could talk he couldn't really hold a conversation and he was driven by his addiction to human blood okay zombies are mindless creatures driven by <UNK> and not intellect and obviously they are dead so why would dead people be allowed to vote in the first place my interpretation of this film is that the only war a liberal <UNK> could win is by having mindless dead people vote for him i guess they meant to say the people that vote for <UNK> like george bush are the mindless zombies while the real mindless zombies are actually the ones making the intellectually sounds decisions yeah whatever dawn of the dead <UNK> this idea much better but user the idea of mindless <UNK> this film isn't dawn of the dead by any stretched of the imagination br br the film <UNK> the issue while the soldiers are alive that a majority of them voted for a bush like president but after they die they would vote for a liberal anti war <UNK> after they are zombies who are normally considered brain dead creatures and laughably has them <UNK> after they vote br br if you are gonna make a zombie movie mr <UNK> and <UNK> george romero's name in it you better have mindless zombies that like ripping people apart and eating their intestines not zombies that vote i also like how the zombies just go evil <UNK> who support the war br br if you want a good movie with social commentary skip this poorly made preachy piece of junk and watch instead br br the worst of the master of horror series hands down

<START> it is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists sometimes even without the 20 20 vision that <UNK> offers you can see the <UNK> and <UNK> that make these people what they are following is one such look into the past of christopher nolan one of the great time <UNK> story <UNK> of today br br christopher <UNK> style of film making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story although people might complain it relies too much on the back and forth shifting of time i still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time <UNK> was probably the most convoluted piece of story telling i have ever seen <UNK> the hardened <UNK> who say it is an old piece of meat wrapped in fancy dressing <UNK> shows how even the <UNK> of stories can be turned into a mind <UNK> the <UNK> which was considerably stripped down in comparison still showed creativity in how its three stories were <UNK> even in a jaded enterprise like the batman series did christopher nolan <UNK> some of his outstanding yarn <UNK> tricks breathing new life into the dark knight br br following is an intense tale of intrigue and mystery where we see a <UNK> writer who becomes a reluctant <UNK> who becomes an <UNK> <UNK> to a variety of petty crimes and finally sees an end no one could have expected having never heard of following before i had no idea what i was to expect at every point the film kept me guessing as to where it was leading me since the mystery angle was clear i was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next and that is where i think the film succeeds so well the film has many elements that led me off on many wild <UNK> chases br br the film is entirely in black and white and told in multiple <UNK> both of which are considered <UNK> these days following does all of this in the least formulaic or contrived way possible there doesn't seem to be a reason why the story is told in the way it is but you don't feel like you are being taken for a ride the lack of <UNK> or self aware arrogance is what makes this style of story telling work highly recommended
<START> this flick is terrible it sets out to disgust and make you laugh but it fails horribly the director obviously has no sense of slap stick gore comedy and the actors are like nothing i've ever seen lacking both acting talent and flair of comedy even their attempt at the english <UNK> is really sad and actually the down right peculiar swedish accent in which the incoherent dialog is spoken is probably the most comical and enjoyable thing about this film even the gore i awful and unconvincing if you <UNK> gore comedy i'd suggest you turn to classic fare such as the evil dead series or even brain dead if you must we all enjoy a bloody good laugh but this is ridiculous
<START> i saw this movie as part of a billy graham program the church i attend was part of a community wide <UNK> to present god and christianity to our community <UNK> <UNK> usa i was one of the <UNK> who helped <UNK> who were invited to come forward and make whatever kind of religious profession they wanted and to follow up on them after the movie as such it did what it was supposed to do and i personally found it to be a medium to <UNK> my faith in god i also found it to be very helpful to those i <UNK> i especially like the work of kim <UNK> in this movie and the parents the were in a way a little <UNK> no one says to their child if they think that he or she may be the parent of an <UNK> child something like the did oh no no not that isn't exactly what they said but the audience i saw had a laugh at whatever it was they did say and also at the son's <UNK> no mom not me don
<START> i went to the cinema slightly <UNK> i came out <UNK> with anger at the garbage passing for a film i had witnessed the actors particularly travolta should be ashamed of themselves for their participation in this clearly the only thing in their minds was the pay <UNK> never mind the <UNK> of their talents and us travolta needs to go back to doing some more look who's talking movies as he has sunk back to the level of his pre tarantino work it comes to something when the l w talking sequels are better than this one travolta is no longer the king of cool but the king of corn michael caine himself admitted to doing bad movies for the pay <UNK> should follow suit if he has any self respect

<START> this short which won an oscar <UNK> two sequels and a tv cartoon show has minimal animation but script by theodore <UNK> aka dr seuss and more memorable and enchanting main character <UNK> <UNK> a style of animation that even influenced disney during the mid 1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts done in the late 1940s and the 1950s this is on of their finest god to have it in print highly recommended
<START> i'm starting to wonder if all these pg 13 horror movies are just <UNK> screen <UNK> for young and <UNK> talent get a first time screenwriter an inexperienced director a few tv actors looking for their <UNK> break and see what they can do <UNK> a stranger <UNK> is a little better than most such recent offerings but is still completely by the book <UNK> with plot holes and genre clichés br br the story is unbelievably simplistic the slim <UNK> minute running time is heavily padded with <UNK> friends and a pointless cheating boyfriend the killer is devoid of even the token motivation of jason or michael or even the original movie's killer and as a result is never particularly frightening the police behave in such an unbelievably <UNK> and lazy manner as to verge on professional <UNK> simon west brings the same attractive <UNK> to proceedings that he managed with lara <UNK> but his style of directing is decidedly generic <UNK> no of real talent or vision the performances are routine dark <UNK> replace genuine horror and the scares are of the tired cat in the closet variety br br the cinematography and production design however are above average for this kind of film the house is beautifully designed all dark wood and <UNK> <UNK> and there are a few moments that are of visual interest br br though lacking an ounce of dramatic originality it acts as a reasonably satisfying <UNK> <UNK> thriller and maintains interest longer than most of its <UNK>
<START> i was wondering what possessed the <UNK> of the victoria film festival to include this film in their program i guess they must have agreed with the others who have reviewed this film i on the other hand consider it the worst film i have ever seen it starts with a bad script full of holes and dialog so unlikely it's embarrassing ideas are introduced then dropped with no development the acting left me totally cold and <UNK> the set decoration was appropriate for the time but a nightmare the only way the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been ghastly the attic looked as if the items had been thrown in for the scene with no attempt to create the look of a real attic that has been filling with junk over the years the photography was <UNK> and lacking in variety save your money for something worthwhile
<START> as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about the worst film ever made let me see how many different words i can use to describe it boring unbearable laughable lousy stupid horrible br br i could go on with such <UNK> but you probably get the point br br i would have given this a 0 if possible bad acting bad directing bad production bad plot br br this was made in 2001 and it looks more like 1965 very low budget boring plot horrible acting really bad special effects etc br br i rarely ever see a sci fi film i absolutely think is this bad i mean this is pure garbage it has nothing going for it either as far as a b movie this is the very bottom of the lot br br i think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes junk like this gives good low budget b movies a bad name this makes ed wood movies look good br br the thing about watching direct to video movies is just when you think you've seen the worst you see something even worse br br dj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out br br avoid this waste at all costs oh the humanity
<START> the first season was great good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home it was actually a pretty funny show br br now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone and the whole thing revolves around the <UNK> company even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill way too over the top where before it was perfect br br that and no more sarah mason one of the best looking girls in hollywood br br this is what happens when you let some <UNK> get their hands on a show you can almost see the meeting the old man is funny lets focus on him make him way over the top and make it all about the <UNK> it'll be a nutty version of the office anyhow no hot chicks no watch
<START> the subject matter was good direction was ok <UNK> was efficient in his role as a major the acting of the supporting actors was amateurish at best the casting director and director should be held responsible for this <UNK> <UNK> was terrible he stood out like a sore thumb with his poor <UNK> he did not look the part nor did he move like a soldier there was a scene where a satellite feed was required of the <UNK> with the <UNK> and they were showing it from a camera angle satellite is located hundred of miles in the sky so the only angle is from above it was quite an embarrassing moment audience these days are <UNK> and they recognize when one is trying to pull <UNK> over their eyes the director is a major so the story could be out of his personal experiences no problem there but the movie is only as good as its actors and director so if major <UNK> is going for any other projects he should pay more attention to the casting
<START> some of the films produced by roger <UNK> new world film company in the 1970s represent the best kind of b movie where the limitations of the genre actually act as a kind of <UNK> influence on the writers and directors  such classic drive in films as 2000 hollywood <UNK> grand <UNK> auto and <UNK> heat emerged from this environment unfortunately his former <UNK> at american international pictures were running out of steam in the 1970s particularly in the absence of jim nicholson and they often produced second rate <UNK> of <UNK> films sometimes featuring his self made stars black mama white mama is one of those films it's basically a cheaper imitation of the big doll house with some of the same stars doing a lot of the same things yes this is a john ashley co production yes the same john ashley who was the hilarious elvis wanna be in how to make a monster and paired up with debbie in beach <UNK> <UNK> with all the signature marks of his productions  women's <UNK> where everyone except maybe 2 or 3 lead characters including the inmates and the guards are <UNK> actors in mostly non speaking roles where we see <UNK> type women taking on the roles of revolutionary <UNK> and where the primary joy of the film is derived through <UNK> s m exploitation br br the print i saw most recently was horribly light damaged good <UNK> will described it as yellow mama yellow mama but i think even in the best conditions the photography and directing are extremely routine there's also very little visual value <UNK> corman must not have had very much to do with the film itself because he was always <UNK> enough to at least give his films some extra production value by filming in free public spaces that would make the film look more impressive this film doesn't look impressive it doesn't have an impressive soundtrack and you just feel embarrassed for anyone who shows a shred of talent the only remotely interesting performances come from pam <UNK> as a <UNK> whore out to escape the life <UNK> actor <UNK> as her <UNK> self indulgent <UNK> and sid <UNK> as a cowboy <UNK> <UNK> the story places <UNK> and co star margaret <UNK> in a low budget female version of the <UNK> ones but does very little with the melodramatic possibilities <UNK> by that premise it's basically just an excuse to ensure that the two protagonists can still stop for a good mud wrestling match while they're trying to escape the prison together this is all in the spirit of good fun but the film ultimately fails even as exploitation because there's a certain edge and <UNK> that should be present in such scenes that is instead replaced under this director's hand with a kind of <UNK> predictability br br so the film will have little value for fans of hard core exploitation value  at least in the version i saw it's no more explicit than faster <UNK> kill kill from over a decade earlier and far less interesting visually and <UNK> for those who just enjoy getting a laugh out of so bad it's good films this one might provide some fun but it's not in the upper <UNK> people would be more advised to seek out <UNK> heat or some of the others that <UNK> in their own brutality to the point that it becomes camp this one is more similar to less ambitious efforts like <UNK> the sadly the best thing about this particular film is the title and the presence of pam <UNK> who was better in other films around the same time particularly jack <UNK> <UNK> this film perhaps illustrates a <UNK> point in miss <UNK> journey from corman secretary to b movie queen for a day but other than its historical significance as such it will have little value even to <UNK> big fans because she is given very little to work with here br br worth skipping unless of course you get to see it in a movie theater with a lot of friends and a lot of beer like i did and even then its value is questionable
<START> this is a low budget well acted little gem alice a small town <UNK> teenager fed up with her existence takes to the road to escape her mother who <UNK> <UNK> and her own job as a check out in a super market she sets out for florida and to stay with her <UNK> high school friend who is a <UNK> at miami after her car <UNK> breaks down on the and she loses all her money she ends up with a retired couple in an <UNK> who also happen to be traveling to florida the couple brilliantly played by <UNK> <UNK> and bill raymond are overly <UNK> and it turns out a prostitute and and her <UNK> slowly alice is <UNK> into truck stop prostitution as the <UNK> <UNK> down the in the general direction of florida through <UNK> flashbacks we learn a little more about alice and her desire to leave tiny <UNK> we also see the couple in a new light and their life and the choices made by the couple and alice all seem quite credible an excellent well made film that you will think about when it is over
<START> i actually had seen the last parts of this movie when i was a child thanks to the search feature of plots i was able to find out the name of it for years i did not know the name but the movie stuck in my mind the ending left hope that the main character would get back to earth eventually it was a shame it did not make it to a series this movie reminds me of journey to the far side of the sun also known as <UNK> if you liked this feature the other one is worth a watch it was done before the stranger but shares a similar plot yet different i just picked up the stranger off of ebay on vhs hope they make a dvd but it is <UNK> unless it comes out on dollar dvd a few pilots are making it on the budget dvd's and maybe this one will
<START> first the premise stinks little boy likes to dress in girls clothes it reminded me of norman bates in psycho or ed wood in ed wood the jokes are lame and old you've seen 'em in a dozen 50's 60's films the whole cast is wasted i bet people signed on just to be in a shirley <UNK> vehicle please would somebody tell shirley she did her best comedy in two <UNK> for sister sara see it if there's no reruns of andy griffith on
<START> talk about being boring br br i got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical night on the <UNK> <UNK> i expected to see crazy stories and <UNK> of an eccentric man and to discover his <UNK> for such bizarre material boy was i wrong br br spring and chaos is mostly boring with only <UNK> moments of innovative animation it's certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as which is something that i suggest you watch instead leave this bore alone if you absolutely must see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap do not pay top dollar
<START> this film is the <UNK> comedy i have ever seen a lot of jokes are either a parody of another film from star wars to dragon ball to power rangers to kung fu etc or somehow related to history of whatever <UNK> creates the elevator a lot of jokes are also related to the modern world and made fun of because it was b c like the <UNK> of the horse <UNK> spinning other jokes are just plain total non sense but also hilarious like the famous scene with the dog running after the roman guy with the little music in fact in this movies they mix pretty much every kind of humor i watched this film 6 times already and every single time i watch it i find other subtle jokes like the scene where <UNK> is part of the egyptian crowd it is the funniest movie i have every seem finally a laugh out loud comedy that doesn't include toilet or sex humor is also what makes the movie everything that comes out of that guys mouth is hilarious this movie is nearly perfect except a few clichéd thing like the fact that <UNK> gets his power back because he is <UNK> that is plain stupid but overall an excellent movie 9 5 out 10
<START> what a crap that movie is the script is simply non existent the movie at times seems like a music video but it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match pathetic way of combining action and rap one might think it being a recipe for a successful flick here it fails miserably dialogues in this flick just killed me the scene when <UNK> is <UNK> by some policeman is merely pitiful generally speaking recent <UNK> films are hardly watchable what the hell happened to the guy i know he's old but can't he get hollywood to drop him a decent script or something is he running out of <UNK> for his <UNK> to india that he takes on anything they serve him
<START> the only people i would recommend this film to are both blind and deaf although i'm sure a would get a kick out of it this film had nothing no acting terrible music awful script only the power to suck any happiness from your soul you may be wondering by now why or even how i managed to sit through the full hour and a half of sheer <UNK> and it is honestly a difficult concept for even myself firstly i had to pace up and down as the film progressed as i found it extremely hard to get comfortable secondly i only made it without <UNK> off my own arm in order to have something to beat myself to death with by <UNK> friends for moral support when the plot became particularly slow the problem was it became a matter of pride for me to finish it after the opening thirty minutes and that was a fatal error on my behalf i normally like films to leave you with something by the end but all this did was take for the sake of your sanity do not watch this film
<START> but a great cast jonathan <UNK> kathy bates rupert everett <UNK> redgrave julie andrews and dan <UNK> and that's just the beginning br br i'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to <UNK> you to watch this one suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone death singing a <UNK> suit cell phones a little person nice looking woman actually a modern not medieval a <UNK> and a <UNK> oh and a psychotic and barry <UNK> br br you will have to trust me when i say that 50 of you out there will hate this movie because of the lack of the absurd gene in your <UNK> makeup it's not your fault it's <UNK> the other 50 of you will probably want to change the channel after 20 minutes but you have to keep watching br br even at that at the end you may wonder why you watched but keep in mind that absurdity thing it should grow on you it is a test
<START> <UNK> sets and <UNK> costumes well photographed by <UNK> and a good not great performance by <UNK> as henry cannot overcome poor writing and static camera work <UNK> <UNK> the scenery as anne br br it's all very beautiful but it's all surface and no depth the melodramatic tale of a woman <UNK> made it a hit in america where the <UNK> the <UNK> of dr <UNK> <UNK> in the same year <UNK> proving that what is popular is not what <UNK> lubitsch would be remembered for his lively comedies not <UNK> <UNK> like this
<START> this is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and see br br it really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and like an h g welles story i can't quite recall may live to want back br br keep in mind that this is a short very short it starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring bang it's over and believe me the <UNK> <UNK> is one you will remember br br i'm not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase or available on the web but either way you'd be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy of that i am sure
<START> i guess <UNK> intended this movie to be the definition of the cool it has the cool approach of the late '60s early '70s same <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> a bitter and story is also the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> in defining roles br br is a cop who has in his flat three cats and a daily routine <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> is a sick failed cop plays an escaped suspect le <UNK> is of course far above a heist movie <UNK> uses his techniques <UNK> detailed depictions of every step of the heist etc yet this particular action drama is far better than his other it's very unlikely them by being so much better the look of le <UNK> is very peculiar to <UNK> very br br <UNK> was sharp and cool brings his craft and <UNK> makes maybe the finest role of this movie his performance has an unexpected warmth br br on the other hand the characters are barely <UNK> no more than strictly necessary and are <UNK> or masks yet the portrayal is inspired economic but suggestive br br another of the movies that prove <UNK> to be a good a very good actor and the fact that he's not a genius does not imply that he ought to be <UNK> as a fourth rate actor he's good he can bear the <UNK> of a and <UNK> br br only ten <UNK> before le <UNK> <UNK> was doing towards the end of the <UNK> a boring overlong insipid noir <UNK> starring himself <UNK> after only a decade here he is in full form with this quite amazing action drama <UNK> it's a success br br before seeing le <UNK> i was not a fan now i guess i rather am one br br le <UNK> is a an action drama one of the most genres <UNK> scores
<START> we are in a small town a <UNK> widow <UNK> <UNK> hires a <UNK> robert ryan to look after her house she soon starts to regret it as ryan grows <UNK> by the hour it appears that she is host to a dangerous <UNK> and now she is unable to escape her house br br beware my lovely is adapted from mel the spiral <UNK> story and play called the man pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness one however shouldn't be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve <UNK> picture because it isn't it's clear from the get go that <UNK> howard <UNK> is a dangerously troubled man but this is a different sort of peril movie one that throws up another <UNK> on <UNK> and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist br br ryan and <UNK> are a great combination they had also done the excellent and far better on dangerous ground this same year so with both actors clearly comfortable together it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house re prison ryan is particularly strong as his character in and out of madness with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others <UNK> deep sympathy the direction from harry <UNK> is safe he in truth doesn't have to do much other than let his actors run with it and george e cinematography contains some smart and <UNK> visual touches with one involving christmas tree <UNK> immensely memorable falling some where in between being average and great beware my lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow film noir for fans of robert ryan tho it's something of an essential viewing oh yes and then some 7 10
<START> the further adventures of ma and <UNK> <UNK> almost <UNK> picks up where the egg and i left off for the first solo adventure of the a new writing team and director is introduced leonard <UNK> associate producer of the egg and i was producer of the further adventures of ma and <UNK> <UNK> with many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the to the works very well there is a reference to ma beating <UNK> <UNK> for first prize at the fair for her <UNK> an <UNK> scene in the egg and i the prize money from the <UNK> contest was to be used to send tom <UNK> to college in this movie tom is returning home as a college graduate br br there are two plots <UNK> in this movie one is the comedy of the simple mountain family moving into a state of the art modern house the other is a light morality play on how environment affects children as they grow up br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wanted a free <UNK> <UNK> for entering a contest and ended up winning a house his disappointment at not getting the free <UNK> <UNK> is played for laughs quite a bit when <UNK> plays with dynamite he is totally oblivious to the explosion never in the scene as the <UNK> from the explosion fell around him he played the part to perfection in his autobiography jack benny mentioned how impressed he was with <UNK> deadpan delivery took that comedic device to a high level of perfection br br ma <UNK> main and <UNK> move into the new house with modern <UNK> that confuse ma and <UNK> almost as much as they help them ma <UNK> far more quickly than <UNK> included with the modern <UNK> is a television a very new household item in 1949 moving walls hidden <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are used as comic props but the attention is on ma and <UNK> never the props themselves br br tom <UNK> richard long meets kim parker meg randall a magazine writer who feels that <UNK> and environment are essential for children to realize success as adults tom is a bright self made man who <UNK> the theory that success can only come from a <UNK> environment this subject is briefly discussed in a couple of scenes but left to <UNK> it was also the only serious discussion in this otherwise whimsical movie br br seeing the moving out of their run down old house to move to a new house would almost be a disaster if it were not for the characters staying true to themselves ma was the practical one just as she had been in the the egg and i <UNK> was the fish out of water that provided the best comedy he never felt at home in the new house but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never be of concern to him
<START> <UNK> meets <UNK> iii or maybe it should just be called <UNK> iv this is my friend all time favorite movie largely because he still has a thing about j v <UNK> as someone once said this is fine more than fine but as you get older you need to branch out whether you want to or not society demands it br br <UNK> an f has <UNK> greatest j v <UNK> mary ann played by beth miller who looks like a sweet faced alicia <UNK> from before her clueless days wesley hates <UNK> other film the horrific teen wolf too made three years later where she plays a <UNK> southern belle much like martha smith's character in animal house personally i admire <UNK> range as the two characters could not be more different and she is convincing as both br br anyway mary ann is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from a member of the lucky <UNK> squad who comes to camp for <UNK> <UNK> she's <UNK> by jenna karen lee kelly the leader of the tough girl squad appropriately named the demons jenna becomes protective of mary ann after her main rival takes an instant dislike to mary ann br br later mary ann gets a crush on tommy hamilton the head <UNK> tommy is spending his summer wrestling with the dilemma of having to grow up and move on which is a problem as his only skills are teaching <UNK> and performing elaborate dance routines in the shower for the enjoyment of viewers who get off on that sort of thing <UNK> daphne is <UNK> long suffering girlfriend she has a well <UNK> attitude and an experienced perspective she even <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with mary ann <UNK> that tommy will not actually take advantage of young mary ann br br while these four characters are solid and their relationships have a nice charm the supporting cast is almost as weak as the material they have to work with which is a shame because had they brought some actual comic relief to the production it would have been a decent film jennifer <UNK> plays pam a social climbing and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is carrying on with <UNK> money hungry owner and there is another couple with a thing for the characters from mad max since nothing is very funny you are left with only a cute semi romance and some great dance routines br br an attempt is made to create some suspense by slowly leading up a final competition but unless this is your first movie experience the outcome is never in doubt and there is a back story about some japanese <UNK> wants to get money from but it goes nowhere dramatically or <UNK> br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> very serious spoilers br br this movie was a huge disappointment there are so many problems i dont know where to start so i'll talk about what is good about the film br br the cast was great steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle aged upper class uptight white guy queen <UNK> plays a big beautiful urban black gal and eugene levy well he pretty much plays himself add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well and if watching these guys for 1 75 hours is worth 8 to you then you wont be disappointed br br but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone all the white people are uptight <UNK> all the black people are ghetto <UNK> <UNK> the blacks are hip cool with it and poor the whites are <UNK> stiff and rich except eugene levy he is clearly taken with queen and speaks the <UNK> so <UNK> him a freak so if you're a white man and you like black women and you know street <UNK> you must be a freak the movie is <UNK> with overt racial <UNK> towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs br br putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy character she comes to <UNK> home under false <UNK> but martin takes a liking to her anyway she's supposed to be wrongly accused of robbery martin takes up her cause 3 4 of the way through the film we find out character escaped from jail so our sympathy for her goes out the window br br there is no real plot the movie <UNK> along from scene to scene with showing up in some place where she's not supposed to be like a country club or <UNK> house and martin trying to hide her thats the running gag then in the last minutes of the film they decide that they're going to finally deal with <UNK> that she was wrongly accused of bank robbery martin goes under cover as a <UNK> to <UNK> a let's face it <UNK> confession from ex boyfriend and everyone lives happily ever after br br finally but there is a lot more wrong with this flick this movie appears to be a <UNK> <UNK> of clips from other movies the premise is clearly borrowed from another martin movie the house <UNK> where goldie hawn comes to live with martin and shakes up his <UNK> middle class life martin and meet online ala got mail the whole quirky <UNK> <UNK> rich man's life goes as far back as the sound of music and mary <UNK> br br i <UNK> see this movie again for free
<START> one thing i have noticed about british horror movies from the 1970s is that they don t hold up to repeated viewing theatre of blood is a case in point as are all those <UNK> anthology movies add the beast in the <UNK> to the list br br much of the drama of this movie revolves around the build up of a plot revelation at the end once you know what the revelation is this becomes a rather flat film it does open with a fairly good hook but after that we re treated to long boring sequences of two old ladies making small talk correct me if i m wrong but how many people watch a horror movie expecting a couple of old ladies making small talk the only sort of interest to be found in the beast in the <UNK> is the anti smoking stance some people have mentioned that this is an anti war or anti military film but watch carefully and you ll see that <UNK> a lights up for a fly <UNK> he gets killed rather strange considering attitudes to smoking t nearly so hysterical as they are nowadays
<START> jack <UNK> quirks are at first somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this movie br br i found myself getting <UNK> and <UNK> as i was <UNK> into seeing this one through to the end in hopes that the payoff would be worth the super tedious wait br br the climax can't begin to make up for all the setup time br br normally one might expect shallow characters from this genre but the fact that the wait time before action <UNK> is so high should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character development br br not so br br while not without its initial charms this movie ultimately <UNK> and disappoints br br wish i could get all that setup time back to it into something that pays off
<START> despite its new york setting new york characters <UNK> in the <UNK> is not an american movie it is better than that what is most unusual is the mixing of styles and genres director shows a <UNK> touch in combining comedy with tragedy pathos with drama br br the secret of success appears to be a of great characters each could have their own film built around them and then filling them out with beautifully realized performances from one of the most wonderfully <UNK> casts one would struggle to find in the same country let alone in the same movie ranging from <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> robert burke to peter <UNK> who here reveals that he has a lot more in him than the bad guy stereotypes he plays in hollywood pictures even sandra <UNK> is funny here br br an added bonus cream on the substantial cake is john <UNK> soundtrack
<START> some people think this was a rather bad tv series with cheesy effects considering it was filmed between 1977 1979 but really look back at those years and think we didn't have computers back then so if you think about it it's a rather good tv series br br i always figured bad ratings killed the show but no the network did they canceled out their theme as the superhero network and abandoned a short lived spider man series if it had gone on it probably would have run well into the 80's and if it was really lucky and i mean really lucky the early 90s br br and no one wanted to pick this series up br br anyways jolly old or young nicholas <UNK> of the sound of music fame is brought to the tv screen as peter parker the secret identity of the amazing spider man along the series peter deals with a clone a beautiful girl from a foreign country and a corrupt politician br br while the series is way out of <UNK> being that peter is already <UNK> from university and thats when he gets bit and uncle ben is already dead the audience is treated to action suspense and the attitude that the characters have towards peter and his alter ego spider man br br while it's also slightly disappointing that robert f simon looks nothing like j j jameson it's not so disappointing that betty grant isn't betty grant but a hot african american girl who reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> who is one of the <UNK> women on the planet so really this one wasn't so bad br br but considering the time and how much drama they packed into this one it kind of <UNK> what bad tv is today either way it's entertaining even for today br br 8 10
<START> there is nothing good to say about this movie read revolution for the hell of it or any of his other <UNK> <UNK> was often <UNK> as the clown prince of the <UNK> but he was a man of ideas who used his <UNK> his sense of humor and pop culture and his flamboyant personality to get attention to his ideas the media too often concentrated on the man not the ideas and that's the problem with this movie too later in his life he did suffer from depression but this flick is like a national <UNK> version of <UNK> he deserves better if you don't know <UNK> or his times this movie won't help br br this film lies i give it a zero br br
<START> there are good movies and there are bad movies and then there's <UNK> zero a film so utterly bad it makes spending a month in <UNK> with an insurance salesman an attractive entertainment alternative br br with an incomprehensible plot about the gates of hell opening within a <UNK> of <UNK> under <UNK> the film is a mess of repetitive and nonsensical shots of a little girl running through <UNK> red lights floating about and strange wall shadows none of which serves to <UNK> any fear or tension but instead <UNK> the reaction of here they go again with the girl or lights from the viewer br br directed by <UNK> who for reasons i can only conclude as shame was billed as <UNK> the movie stars vince <UNK> as owen an american priest who travels to <UNK> in search of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a friend and colleague who has gone missing in the <UNK> he <UNK> the help of a series of locals who with the exception of are all portrayed by spanish actors trying with limited success to russian accents br br along the way they cross paths with members of some sort of underground leather <UNK> religious mafia headed by a <UNK> val kilmer whose career seems to be in such free fall that he's <UNK> to appearing in dreck like this and henchman <UNK> stallone <UNK> son who seems to have been cast merely so the stallone name can be included in the film's <UNK> br br apart from watching the <UNK> try to <UNK> their way through the <UNK> with the aid of a <UNK> drawn map and repetitive shots of them being followed or <UNK> by a pale faced young girl not much else goes on throughout dialogue <UNK> switches between english and russian with actors frequently taking turns in each language and entire conversations are <UNK> half in one and half in the other with the only apparent reason being they felt like it adding a frustrating dimension for the viewer over and above trying to figure out the <UNK> <UNK> together story br br about the only thing <UNK> zero gets right however is its title which could only have rendered a more accurate description of this movie if the word <UNK> had been <UNK>
<START> things that are only just now news were taken as a given in this shocking documentary i fear that as the investigation proceeds the producers of this film will be <UNK> in <UNK> br br the producers show us the <UNK> the government agents the <UNK> with all their faults and all their humanity nothing any reviewer can say could approach the impact of watching and listening for yourself pieces of evidence <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tapes news footage expert commentary interviews photos and home videos are <UNK> woven together and tell a disturbing tale br br do not wait see this film and tell your friends
<START> first let's call this movie what it is br br 1 it's a feel good movie with a message br br 2 the acting is just okay dialog slightly better production value pretty good br br 3 <UNK> scenes just barely passable br br but here's the trick this isn't something hollywood contrived and it isn't trying to be a <UNK> accurate portrayal of the sport it is instead a pretty good representation of mostly real people in real circumstances and a real storyline sure they could have done a better job actually the sport but my vote it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do br br and i can't think of many football baseball hockey or soccer movies that are true to the sport either c'mon bull <UNK> br br i'm not a <UNK> player i was a wrestler but i <UNK> from <UNK> attended <UNK> <UNK> and occasionally trained with the <UNK> guys my brother in law david however was one of the original <UNK> members of the <UNK> <UNK> club in 1976 his younger brother billy played the next year as i recall if you're interested there's a <UNK> <UNK> site at net that <UNK> the history of the team br br by the time i was there the club had been in existence for about a decade and had long since built a reputation for excellence it's a fact that they focused on broad training topics devotion honor discipline effort not tactics i thought the <UNK> guys i knew were a little <UNK> in the head but i think i might have just been a little jealous they were hard core dedicated to the belief system that promoted br br with regard to the cultural mixing issues that have been brought up it might be interesting to note that while i was there in the 80's one of the larger schools in the city was shut down south high school and its students distributed among the other 3 primary <UNK> schools to be honest <UNK> pre 80's was pretty <UNK> i've got a picture of the team from i think 1977 that shows an all white club south high on the other hand was a much more <UNK> integrated school before it closed i had a pair of friends from south who joined the team one one <UNK> and as i recall there were a bunch of island nation players that joined up <UNK> <UNK> i don't think anyone <UNK> the credibility of the team in <UNK> or other cultural traditions if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys it's that they walked the walk br br and as to the strength of the team when compared to the best <UNK> age teams in the world yeah it's true that us <UNK> on average when taken as a whole does not represent particularly well against the best elsewhere there are exceptions but hey it's a simple fact that <UNK> doesn't have the <UNK> or exposure needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the us that <UNK> in other countries br br with that said judge <UNK> on its merits br br the only team to qualify for the usa <UNK> national <UNK> every year of that 25 <UNK> history br br a win record of wins 9 <UNK> read that again coach in any us sport in history br br regular international <UNK> br br some compelling wins against some legitimate international teams br br are they the world best maybe some years probably not most but they're pretty good on a consistent basis and it's <UNK> to the game to blow them off when <UNK> <UNK> may be the best <UNK> to the sport in the us
<START> while i agree that this was the most horrendous movie ever made i am proud to say i own a copy simply because myself and a bunch of my friends were extras mostly in the dance club scenes but a few others as well this movie had potential with <UNK> and the director of enter the dragon signed on but as someone who was on set most every day i can tell you that robert <UNK> was an old and confused individual at least during the making of this movie it was a wonder he could find his way to the set everyday i would also like to think that this might have been a better movie if a lot of it had not been destroyed in a fire at morning calm studios i can't say that it would have been for sure but it would be nice to think so i was actually surprised that it was ever released and that someone like <UNK> would <UNK> his name to it without a fight oh well also look at the extras for pro wrestler scott levy aka <UNK> he was a wrestler in <UNK> at the time nice guy very smart
<START> this is the best movie i have ever seen and i love it very much is is so sad and loving i could watch this movie over and over again when i first seen it on disney channel i was like i would love to see this movie again i would love to watch this movie everyday and i recommend it to anyone this is really a good movie to anyone who has not seen this movie and is thinking about it they better go and see it because it is really good i love the part when the boy found out about the girl and from then on i was just all into this movie if i could watch two movies everyday it would be this one and beloved those are my two favorite movies i really love them
<START> can to some people look a bit long but it's one of rare real adventure film it could be compare to with a bit of sleepy you must see it
<START> okay this wasn't the greatest horror movie i've ever seen in my life despite the fact that it's lower budget it's a pretty decent movie though the monsters are unique and believable heck they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly <UNK> havoc on this poor family although when you finally do get to see the monsters completely you really think wtf those <UNK> <UNK> things are after them the only part that really disturbed me is when <UNK> they killed the kitty not the kitty <UNK> why seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore this is not the movie for you go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines if you have small children i wouldn't recommend watching this with them though probably would give them nightmares about <UNK> in their room
<START> this little two person movie is actually much bigger than it looks it has so many layers i've watched it over and over and always pick up on something new i am amazed at the depth of the acting and i feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that alan <UNK> is a major star
<START> admirable but weak james bond film mainly because both the hero bond and villain were seriously miscast is too big and innocent looking to play bond he looks and acts more like the good natured but dim witted sidekick in a police action movie the director and writer try to establish his credibility but his saying of lines like royal north of the just aren't effective in establishing him as this <UNK> and suave rogue <UNK> doesn't do a bad job but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster the best portrayed characters of the movie are those of tracy and her father but the performances by those actors when sharing the screen with only serve to emphasize his <UNK> as an actor this movie is too long <UNK> mins for a bond film and doesn't offer any excitement until <UNK> mountain escape where it begins to pick up this film tries very hard but falls short many <UNK> elements are present and the climatic battle is top notch but i always get a sense of something missing when watching this one
<START> i rented this movie under the impression that it was scarecrow 3 dark <UNK> thinking it was a <UNK> in the scarecrow <UNK> series another extremely laughable and all together awful series of movies i wasn't disappointed though it was just as awful if not worse than what i expected i was laughing throughout the entire movie every piece of bad acting poorly shot and cut footage and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth renting br br the special features include a pathetic view into the cast and <UNK> six months of filming br br favorite line the sins of my <UNK> they've down to this very moment of time
<START> well i remember when the studio <UNK> <UNK> and hired <UNK> to do <UNK> to this film they were quite right to do so br br <UNK> prequel to the exorcist is simply a bad movie it's boring really it is br br it would be nice to think that the studio put aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who in such big words condemned <UNK> version and praised even if no one had ever seen it would have been right br br but they weren't br br to put it in a nutshell <UNK> has no idea what a horror film should be and it shows in a big way br br <UNK> boring unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and bad supporting cast br br save your cash and your nerves don't see it
<START> if you like who <UNK> its you will like this film considered the best italian detective story giallo fulci has done br br it's not mickey <UNK> for sure there are scenes designed to <UNK> anyone br br many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12 year old boy she was joking but she was naked nonetheless and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones she also tries to <UNK> the local priest br br young boys are turning up missing and there are several interesting suspects you have to watch carefully to discover the killer can you don't jump on the first guy it's way too early and he is too obvious br br anyone familiar with fulci will be able to guess the killer who died a violent death at the end what crazy reasoning he had
<START> the story takes place in rural germany on the eve of the second world war a unique setting with a couple of british agents being held by the germans in a farm house since they aren't technically at war yet it seems as if both sides must have realized what was coming both agents bruce lester and ray <UNK> escape into the countryside and split up <UNK> happens upon gypsy woman marlene <UNK> one evening as she's alone at her camp preparing dinner their encounter is an amazing and captivating scene not so much for <UNK> but for <UNK> who takes sexy to a whole new plane <UNK> <UNK> himself as a gypsy in order to hide from the germans but he remains committed to his mission to do with <UNK> the scientist who knows the formula for a new poison gas but who also isn't a committed nazi the hollywood take on gypsy life and customs is predictably portrayed but the underlying knowledge that they would be one of the targets for <UNK> by the nazis adds a certain tension the film the line between being a serious story about the poison gas and the <UNK> search to get the formula and a colorful though not too convincing love story between <UNK> and <UNK> however they're both very good it's the fault of the film that didn't give them or their relationship enough dramatic realism relying on and <UNK> obvious cultural differences for questionable comedic purposes nonetheless there are some tense and interesting points here and there the surprise <UNK> with german soldiers and <UNK> agents where <UNK> does a great palm reading and <UNK> nearly as good <UNK> one and a dinner party of germans of various <UNK> at which the <UNK> comes over the radio that germany had been attacked by <UNK> and everyone stands and does a stiff arm <UNK> mitchell may have missed some opportunities here and there but he fully took advantage of others
<START> forget everything that you have ever read about the <UNK> straight to video release snakes on a train especially if it was a negative review this movie is way more fun than the movie that it obviously rips off snakes on a plane frankly i am surprised that more people aren't about this low budget asylum release instead most reviews that i've read have nothing kind or <UNK> worthwhile to say except the usual stupid herd mentality idiocy such as the acting was amateurish the action didn't <UNK> live up to the advertising and the entire thing <UNK> to a hideous waste of time of course it doesn't help that the title is a tip off to the obvious rip off nature of this film actually i felt that snakes on a train <UNK> snakes on a plane for a number of reasons br br first the producers used real genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they <UNK> either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a super giant snake that consumed an entire like train how many movies have a snake <UNK> a train as a result snakes on a train ranks as the first movie to scale that height br br second this low budget movie employs some grisly gross out effects the woman who <UNK> up baby snakes real ones was fantastic the special effects of her getting <UNK> up later in the movie were visually <UNK> also you get to see a little white girl get eaten alive by a snake she was as cute as she could be no more than 10 years old or <UNK> and she died screaming all the way as nasty giant mister snake head <UNK> her not only kids in <UNK> but kid eaten this is exactly the kind of graphic material that you won't find in 99 of all theatrical hollywood releases of course she wasn't eaten by a real snake but it's the <UNK> thought that counts br br third it is one of those cursed upon movies where <UNK> julia <UNK> of that guy the chief female character no heroine has a curse placed on her by her parents because she didn't marry the man that they recommended as a result she is filled with snakes <UNK> up <UNK> of green <UNK> fluid <UNK> then <UNK> up a baby snake imagine <UNK> the mythical characters that had snakes for hair only with the snakes in her belly her psycho <UNK> type boyfriend <UNK> all the snakes that come out of her because they are heading to l a on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back inside of her and return her to normal talk about a whacked out character performing stomach <UNK> routines prepare yourself for lots of <UNK> blood and gore br br fourth the train had only about twenty or so passengers not hundreds nevertheless it looked like the brothers filmed this above average horror flick on board a real train with real snakes and they played up the <UNK> motion of the train on the tracks br br fifth the snakes <UNK> around for the first hour quietly <UNK> the train before they turn weird and attack everybody in other words it's suspense suspense suspense before people start dying from snake bites br br up until the last five minutes when the snake grows bigger than the runaway train and <UNK> it snakes on a train is <UNK> wonderful and way out it doesn't have the attention <UNK> editing of a big league hollywood movie it's a fantasy about an unfortunate hispanic women <UNK> because of her feminist at odds with society attitude br br altogether you've got gory fantasy type stuff suspenseful snakes around the train and am over the top gigantic snake at the end incidentally they get on board the train because a bunch of other <UNK> have <UNK> a train employee and the <UNK> on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend on free br br i think it's better than snakes on a plane if you want a tough little <UNK> produced horror movie
<START> below average action melodrama in which the lovely ms <UNK> plays a private eye who comes to the aid of her father <UNK> <UNK> and his partner austin <UNK> of the original assault on <UNK> 13 whose <UNK> business is being threatened br br i'll be frank i agree with the few other user comments for this movie <UNK> baby has a less than satisfying script direction that isn't particularly distinguished action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best and one of ms <UNK> more <UNK> supporting casts although there's an important supporting role for martin also a familiar name in i get the feeling that this routine movie may have been put together quickly merely to cash in on her then enormous popularity br br it sure was cool seeing <UNK> again although ms <UNK> doesn't have as good a role or dialog as she has had in other films although she is doing what she does best and that's playing a sassy sexy sister on a mission of vengeance br br non stop soul <UNK> soundtrack is enjoyable at the very least br br mostly recommended to those who wish to see everything in the pam <UNK> film <UNK> br br 4 10
<START> i'll be honest the <UNK> out purple plane with <UNK> <UNK> at the <UNK> is an amusing visual gag it would have been a decent concept for a 30 second commercial or maybe a 3 minute music video but the producers have committed the age old concept comedy sin of <UNK> 30 seconds of material into an hour and a half of film and the results are predictably lame the remainder of the <UNK> minutes are filled with the typical gamut of racist and sexist humor and fart jokes offensive and worst of all painfully unfunny the <UNK> plot screams under the weight of its <UNK> best to be avoided unless you are drunk or stoned
<START> i can't describe the feeling when i got this crappy vhs rental <UNK> in my hands about 20 years ago somehow i got my father to rent it for me and i watched it twice with my little brother yes we got nightmares this film was originally rated as pg in the us in many other countries including <UNK> it was <UNK> under 18 or 16 the film was aimed to teenagers but this must be the <UNK> pg rated film ever there's no bad language or nudity in it what so ever originally made in 1981 stayed on the shelves for a couple of years before release br br this is an a class b movie a true well made 80's horror flick a bunch of college girls decide to spent a night in a <UNK> not knowing that a supernatural evil <UNK> br br you can almost smell the rotting flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie it's campy utterly stupid but they just can't make these movies anymore there is definitely a certain feel to this 80's horror genre this one is still effectively spooky and entertaining after all these years br br the effects are just <UNK> quality by <UNK> <UNK> jr and thomas r <UNK> the make up effects play a big part in this flick otherwise it would've been just a boring teen slasher br br it's now available on dvd at last and it's a special edition dvd including some extras too commentary track is interesting br br in fact this version isn't so special after all below average transfer on dvd some <UNK> and <UNK> here and there at first it was going to be released by the blue underground but unfortunately it was canceled so <UNK> show released it without <UNK> the print too bad br br great date movie br br recommended br br note i only gave 8 out of 10 because of the nostalgic values otherwise 6 out of 10
<START> i had never heard of this film and only got it because i am a martin sheen fan now i am stunned as to why it did not receive the praise and recognition that it truly deserves the four characters all make you feel for them the father trying to <UNK> his authority the mother still <UNK> to traditional family values and both trying to keep up appearances despite the total <UNK> of their family the daughter wanting her own life and the son haunted by his experiences in vietnam one felt that this was a scenario that must have been played out in thousands of <UNK> families after vietnam <UNK> <UNK> as jeremy was superb totally unhinged by his war experience which none of his family could relate to the screen chemistry between him and his real life father martin sheen was amazing and there were times when <UNK> face was so like <UNK> in apocalypse now i feel sure that just as martin has counted as one of his best films <UNK> will count this one as one of his best too the scene with the gun was totally mind blowing as all the emotions were there on the family's faces brilliant acting by <UNK> sheen and kathy bates i watched the film for the first time last night and today the lead story in the news was about a <UNK> war veteran who had shot several members of his family how many more young men are going to have their lives destroyed by war
<START> miserable film not even to be compared in one breath with to kill a <UNK> or in the heat of the night br br yes there is racial prejudice but the film is at most ridiculous br br come now would you really have elizabeth <UNK> of all people <UNK> a jail so as to avoid a <UNK> <UNK> in her day played everyone's mother and was the <UNK> in i love lucy before fred and <UNK> <UNK> bought the building br br imagine the body so that it will not come out that the black man's gun killed a white man br br claude <UNK> jr who was so fabulous in the <UNK> appears in this mess he still had those sad eyes my eyes would be sad too if i appeared in this awful film br br to me this was nothing more than a <UNK> flop all the way
<START> <UNK> richard <UNK> and kitty <UNK> <UNK> have just finished celebrating their engagement <UNK> in france with family and friends when he receives a letter asking him to visit an <UNK> castle located in scotland uncle reportedly has fallen ill and has <UNK> <UNK> the sole heir be present <UNK> goes off to scotland leaving his future bride behind a few weeks pass and he doesn't come back concerned kitty sends out <UNK> but doesn't hear back from her fiancé four more weeks pass and kitty finally receives a weird response from <UNK> calling off the engagement and telling her to move on with her life not ready to give up on her relationship and looking for answers kitty <UNK> on a plane and decides to pay <UNK> a visit accompanying her on the trip is her level headed aunt edith <UNK> <UNK> best known for her starring role in the classic <UNK> <UNK> of the dead when kitty and edith arrive at the estate they immediately suspect something strange is <UNK> for starters <UNK> seems to have aged twenty years in a matter of weeks secondly this once nice and charming guy has turned into a complete jerk who repeatedly demands they leave the castle and never come back when edith comes down with a mild cold kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there to try to get to the bottom of things br br why is <UNK> being so cold and cruel to the woman he was just about to marry why is <UNK> so opposed to having company why do the house rules state that guests must be locked inside their <UNK> at night why are guests forbidden to enter certain areas of the estate such as bedroom and a large <UNK> <UNK> out back and what's making those strange dragging noises every night these are just some of the questions the <UNK> poses the movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and intrigue you genuinely become interested in what's going on and <UNK> <UNK> the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place and then it happens i definitely don't want to ruin the finale of this film because you're better off not knowing but it takes one of the most unbelievable and jaw <UNK> strange turns i've seen in any movie it's wonderfully ludicrous in a way but it also takes a pretty solid little b w mystery and sends it straight into z grade schlock territory and yet this ending seems so out of place you're not likely to forget it once you see it br br despite the ending or maybe even partially because of the ending i really enjoyed this odd bird it's extremely talky and slow moving for the duration of the run time but it managed to keep my interest throughout director william cameron <UNK> who made the much more famous <UNK> from mars the same year is best known as a two time oscar winning art director and his set designs here are also really interesting there's almost a silent movie feel at times with model work for some of the <UNK> some painted backdrops and <UNK> <UNK> interiors with very high <UNK> as with any good castle set there are also secret <UNK> and long <UNK> this one also throws in a few rubber bats on strings for good measure br br a few of the actors are a little stiff and awkward but i liked most of the cast <UNK> is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never seemed to catch on despite being both beautiful and talented <UNK> who also gets to play narrator in framing shots at the beginning and end of the film is decent enough as the overly mannered and <UNK> aunt my favorite however was michael <UNK> as the silver haired sinister servant who does this hilariously <UNK> zombie walk every time he <UNK> the stairs also on board in smaller roles are <UNK> brooke who played the title role in the sherlock holmes mystery the woman in green and <UNK> bond <UNK> the old dark house of course <UNK> also starred in it came from outer space creature from the black <UNK> and some other horror flicks so you've got yourself a pretty decent cast for genre fans right there i say check it out
<START> when it comes to movies i don't easily <UNK> between crap pure crap and masterpieces i believe this movie is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to keep me entertained for more than 90 minutes this movie ran slower than <UNK> river and harry potter 3 combined and i still managed to stay <UNK> to my seat for me it was the passion that eric <UNK> put into his performance it's extremely difficult to pull off such a stunt and manage to garner any positive effect from it <UNK> probably nailed one of the <UNK> single man performances in modern cinema i didn't have any respect for <UNK> until the end of the film the entire monologue minutes before the <UNK> climax was the turning point it was the key that turned me around this man hit a point so low that he knew he could never recover from it the corporate boys <UNK> him on the performance his <UNK> <UNK> made even the <UNK> one in the <UNK> shake his head in awe it made me realize that personal integrity and <UNK> don't matter in the world of talk radio even in the corporate world for that matter stone may have been pushing some uber liberal agenda but it was the actual movie and production that got my attention oliver stone is a minor master of the moody the final third of the film had probably the best lighting and cinematography i have seen in any film stone <UNK> makes the dj booth feel like five by seven cell in a <UNK> century prison visually speaking it appears that only friend is the black <UNK> that <UNK> his routine <UNK> he speaks and it doesn't speak back it's a sad metaphor considering the way he treats the people who handed him his success stone and <UNK> <UNK> out a stunning film of a man who is trapped in both a prison of walls and a prison of self this man is confined to his own <UNK> and he can never escape it the scene that made me realize his <UNK> was when he was unwilling to his ex wife back he preferred his own prison instead of the world on the outside every story has a conflict and it came down to the <UNK> of all conflicts man versus himself presents this conflict in an intelligent gripping and <UNK> fashion there are no hidden messages in this film and the progression of events should be expected by any <UNK> viewer i just <UNK> back and let my mind be <UNK> by this film and i loved it it's <UNK> unseen and it will never receive its due recognition let's hope it stays that way because gems deserve to be found and then hidden again it's a gem because i found it in the <UNK> dvd bin at my local wal mart store for 5 50 it was worth the half hour i spent digging trying to find it i did and i got more than my <UNK> worth this is one of the best movies ever made and that is worth ten reasons alone ten reasons give a score of ten br br here ends my rant
<START> this would have to be by far the greatest series i have ever seen i vividly watched every sunday night and purchased the box set as soon as it was available this is a timeless play written by a fantastic australian that people of all ages could relate to whether they are australian or not however for those of us that are australian it truly brings across the typical australian icon a must see 10 10
<START> terrible movie just terrible the start of this movie is like something out of a bad women in prison movie then it moves on to being a b movie version of aliens b movie in this case meaning the addition of gratuitous sex scenes and women in <UNK> oh and a lot of the footage is the exact same as used in two other movies by the same company including the women in prison <UNK> the only thing saving this movie from a 1 10 is that i have actually seen worse movies not many and not much but worse
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is simply a wonderful film writer director has created a story unlike any other and cast it with such consistently fine actors that it remains a puzzle to me that this film has not become an audience favorite throughout the world it is intelligent emotional <UNK> and warm entertaining and in all categories it is a winner cohen in a brilliantly understated performance is a 16 year old <UNK> who takes care of his highly dysfunctional family his mother is about as <UNK> a <UNK> as ever <UNK> and in a constant state of ill temper because of her husband cheated on her and because she is stuck working double shifts to support her <UNK> father in law <UNK> who as grandfather is a bright funny wise loving old man who deeply cares for a married sister <UNK> who <UNK> moves back in to the house because of constant <UNK> with her husband who doesn't help her care for their <UNK> twin sons his brother cohen whose life is loud electric <UNK> <UNK> about female <UNK> and the favorite son of his mother stir this mixture and the result is the <UNK> dysfunctional family unit <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for them <UNK> <UNK> house runs <UNK> <UNK> and cares for this grandfather and in general leads a life of <UNK> to a family that views him as a <UNK> for a girlfriend and practically fails his school because of his lack of time devoted to caring for his family and a lack of concentration <UNK> his <UNK> teacher begin notes his natural genius on a <UNK> test and with the aid of the <UNK> <UNK> the two encourage him to be tested and discover that he is a genius with <UNK> and <UNK> for him to try for a special school in <UNK> mother will hear none of it but between fights with <UNK> father albert and <UNK> with the teacher and <UNK> they finally <UNK> to his testing for the school meanwhile discovers a girl his age <UNK> <UNK> who has moved in next door and gradually the two become <UNK> in a physical and intellectual relationship always in the background is the support of grandfather and when the grandfather dies sets off on the journey to live his life for himself to realize his gifts to find his happiness the manner in which the family comes to grips with this is the peak of the movie and need not be revealed for the sake of <UNK> the power of the message the film is beautifully photographed the musical score is <UNK> lovely and the final result is one of <UNK> of the human spirit highly recommended on every level in <UNK> with english subtitles
<START> i haven't reviewed anything on here for quite awhile but after having the misfortune to sit through this rubbish as entertainment i had to put forward my thoughts br br normally however bad something is there is one redeeming part whether it is an actor who was okay a scene that was passable an attractive cast member or a general <UNK> moment unfortunately that isn't true here as the film starts of <UNK> with a ridiculous shootout which was so poor i thought it was a practice two otherwise known as the boys in blue <UNK> beside a school br br one of these idiots was daniel baldwin who not only starred in this but also actually directed this garbage unlike his brothers cannot act for <UNK> not that he was on his own here as everyone in it seemed to belong to the acting school of a trained <UNK> br br luckily certainly for me i only watched an hour of this masterpiece as the dvd wouldn't work was probably made by the same fools who produced this so if you have nothing to do but watch paint dry do watch this as it is just as boring ideal for getting rid of <UNK> guests
<START> i really enjoyed this movie i have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it being an old navy guy im still <UNK> by the rousing rendition of anchors away i also love the navy pirate atmosphere i could have done without the female dive officer but im just old fashioned i guess she was still good to look at lol after the crew got done with her <UNK> the cook and <UNK> made the movie loved the <UNK> old engineer and his first class <UNK> too and actually did a very commendable job of being a <UNK> officer i loved the driving scene as they passed the golf course on the way into <UNK> lol pure navy and i swear i had an <UNK> that was just like that little <UNK> im am so glad this is out on dvd about bloody time 0
<START> bill <UNK> the capture of bigfoot is one of the most awful horror movies ever made a greedy owner harvey olsen richard kennedy decides that he wants bigfoot captured at all costs however local game ranger dave <UNK> <UNK> morgan learns that the bigfoot used to live in peace upset by a <UNK> expedition and sets out to protect the creature there is nothing even remotely interesting in this piece of crap the film is extremely dull and filled with horrible songs and cheap special effects no gore no suspense just gigantic boredom avoid this horrible junk like the plague
<START> this is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before not much action in this one though again it's about the guy protecting the president he's macho as usual and at the same time soft and <UNK> as usual does he have the guts to take a bullet for the president and then there's the girl and the usual conservative <UNK> around stereotypical and predictable to the last toe <UNK> minute
<START> as a canadian i didn't know very much about the <UNK> i had read the <UNK> page about those events but that was about it earlier this year when canada went through a potential <UNK> crisis it <UNK> out thankfully that might have led to <UNK> by our <UNK> general the <UNK> was mentioned in the press in an effort to learn more i ordered the dvd of this mini series through ebay br br i was greatly impressed by how interesting the account was as dramatic as events were this could have been a very boring political drama however it was a pretty suspenseful mini series i was also impressed by how understandable it was despite my lack of <UNK> with australian politics it didn't take long to figure out who everyone was and what their roles were br br having said that it is not an entirely <UNK> account malcolm <UNK> is certainly portrayed as a rather <UNK> figure who lets no person or thing get in the way of his quest to be prime minister <UNK> is portrayed in a more noble almost <UNK> light however the actor portraying channels the <UNK> in such a way that it comes across more as <UNK> i thought that sir john kerr was portrayed in a fairly sympathetic manner br br i must warn people that the dvd is of very poor quality i understand that it was made for television in the early 80s but it would appear that no effort was made to <UNK> the picture quality or sound quality it was very disappointing that no extras were added either a documentary or even some interviews with the historical figures would have enhanced the experience but there is nothing br br i highly recommend this mini series for anyone interested in the real life events
<START> debra <UNK> 1987 black widow is much better br br this is like a lame version and jane seymour usually does better br br <UNK> allen is pretty poor in this too just playing his usual role as a boring rebellious child br br maybe the both of them being from dr quinn was supposed to make us get excited br br if it's on go grab a copy of black widow
<START> i haven't seen this movie in 30 years so i don't know if i would like it as much as i did when i was 12 at the time however i loved this movie this is a great <UNK> chick flick for young pre teen girls be careful of the ending though there are tears and harsh emotions br br looking back at it from a 2008 perspective with so much more knowledge of child psychology politics and political correctness i think it would be interesting to watch again <UNK> <UNK> abusive father indifferent mother and <UNK> sister all contributed toward making her vulnerable and starving for <UNK> patty was sad when anton left she was <UNK> when he was killed the rage that was directed toward her afterward was shocking after all she was only 12 years old br br the thing that i most strongly <UNK> is how this movie taught me even enemy soldiers are people too not all german soldiers were hateful nazis when i was older i saw tv shows like <UNK> heroes and the rat <UNK> which also made the point that the regular german soldiers were not the same as the <UNK> br br regular soldiers were <UNK> the <UNK> were <UNK> among <UNK> for their special attitudes of hate i believe that one of the <UNK> of being a nazi was that they had special <UNK> and therefore didn't go into battle their <UNK> were <UNK> and torture br br later during the cold war i would think about russian soldiers and remember we were taught that the soviet union was evil but the reality was that russian soldiers weren't out to destroy america they had a job their government probably told them that our government was out to destroy their way of life which in a way was true since the us fought to end communism br br the lesson is still <UNK> today german soldiers were not the same as nazis just as muslims are not the same as al <UNK>
<START> i remember watching this for the first time in the 80's as a teen man i've read the reviews on this trash and i find myself <UNK> by the voting this movie does not deserve four stars this movie is not better than has its own problems don't get me wrong this movie should be banned just for its own stupidity so many stereotypes so many loop holes so much poor dialog i cannot think of one redeeming quality of this vomit this is not action adventure this is a bad joke on film kinda like watching plan 9 with stock f 16 footage this movie not only defies logic and common sense within the context of a military setting it sends a disturbing message the military is not going to save your dad from the <UNK> evil of the middle east b <UNK> so go out there and <UNK> a multi million dollar weapon and blast him out of the sinister <UNK> of the backwards anti american <UNK> <UNK> you can't reason with those animals this is a bruckheimer flick without a budget bland direction weak acting lame music idiotic plot equals iron eagle
<START> some less than inspired opening string music notwithstanding we somehow know that from the word go this is heading straight for the big fun <UNK> by the time we observe monica <UNK> in a truly genius bit of casting delightfully <UNK> it up as <UNK> early on we're already hooked but it is only later on when she reveals herself in her marvellous screen creation that deranged scheming <UNK> queen of murder and <UNK> posing in the <UNK> of the uptight miss <UNK> that she not only effortlessly steals the entire <UNK> for herself but quite simply blows off screen anyone who comes near her including the ever well <UNK> david <UNK> who himself seems to be somewhat <UNK> by her acting talents and very <UNK> allows her to take centre stage <UNK> is the true engine of the film and her miss <UNK> a genuinely well rounded character in this christie rendition helped by a <UNK> script and the <UNK> paced direction and also by the rest of the cast led by <UNK> james and dominic who all display signs of sympathy for the given material and play with <UNK> <UNK> br br the production values are spot on as usual and if there are any weaker <UNK> they might be located in the <UNK> <UNK> music score to the majority of later <UNK> and also perhaps in the lacking of a genuine italian born actor for the role of husband other than that this is an hour and a half of pure <UNK> delight which is as self indulgent and entertaining as it is lovingly put together
<START> seriously if you want to see a cliché horror movie you have to see this one i guess it contains all the scary parts where nothing happens the nerd type who actually isn't killed boy and girl coming together and surviving facing an old child fear etc i can go on i wanted to see this movie cause i <UNK> the mix of a video game and a movie would work out guess i was wrong which makes the movie more bearable it is only so if you are bored it might be a good idea although i rather stay bored why absolutely not see it frankie aka malcolm is just irritating as the nerd type i could <UNK> the guy and it is so sad he didn't die earlier and in the end he even comes back see something else
<START> this wretched <UNK> uses every <UNK> device in the book to <UNK> attention and sympathy from us for its characters who with one exception are not worthy of any notice at all let alone two precious hours of time br br as in robert <UNK> ordinary people a superb film that in comparison clearly shows up the <UNK> of heroes a late teenage boy has died leaving his family in the <UNK> of <UNK> in this case the death was a suicide an event that nearly always <UNK> the emotional well of the survivors in a particularly <UNK> way we follow these people over the next 8 or 9 months br br the father jeff daniels becomes a <UNK> virtually mute usually drunken stiff who secretly takes leave from his job for months sits instead on a park <UNK> all day and insists on setting a full plate of food at the deceased son's place for every meal he treats everyone else in the family with <UNK> <UNK> he sees his doctor regularly but the issue of <UNK> <UNK> in his obviously dysfunctional state never comes up br br the mother <UNK> weaver yells at the neighbor woman among others gets <UNK> when she <UNK> tries to buy marijuana her term at a head shop what adult in reality would ever try such a dumb stunt and near the end <UNK> into coma with a lung condition that everyone in the theater assumes is cancer she's a heavy <UNK> ms weaver has a few flip lines but generally behaves too to merit much empathy br br it's not that there aren't people out there who behave in these silly ways when severely <UNK> circumstances <UNK> but why make a film of such drivel what can anyone learn from this <UNK> conduct br br the older sister michelle williams is away at college and all too happy to distance herself from the family <UNK> the younger brother played by <UNK> <UNK> is the only credible member of the family his suffering is genuine its causes and his conduct is coherent within the circumstances but <UNK> character is too soft spoken too <UNK> and beaten down to carry the movie the other bit players <UNK> and <UNK> unreal dialogue don't help br br the suicide theme is <UNK> in an almost <UNK> manner in the case of two other minor characters so what is the writer director dan harris trying to say about this subject that it isn't a serious matter why jeff daniels agreed to play the <UNK> of a father as written in this screenplay is something only his <UNK> might possibly be able to answer avoid this dog instead rent <UNK> classic my rating 4 10 c seen on 2 17 <UNK> if you'd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my <UNK>
<START> as spectacle it's hard to fault the japanese people have <UNK> from their intimate relationship with the sea and the concept of the film implies that an entire world and way of life at risk thanks to its <UNK> <UNK> from the standpoint of reality it's rather silly to have a drama <UNK> the entirety of japan <UNK> under the waves why just japan br br so presume instead that we have movie reality <UNK> by spectacle and popcorn and some may find this quite affecting compared to adventures with japanese <UNK> monsters this comes off as more mature and better paced the emotional element is <UNK> and it really works it loses a bit with the overblown theme song at the climax however br br is credible probably not but the thrilling <UNK> and the relaxed pacing make for a more pleasing entertainment that one night expect
<START> an asian assassin takes out victims in <UNK> falls and new york city before getting run over by a car sheila morris former miss sweden janet given a hilarious southern belle dub to show she's from <UNK> finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister diana <UNK> and sets out to investigate this brings her to new guinea where she promises a sleazy guide robert i e american porn star r <UNK> 80 000 dollars to help locate her sister after barely making it through a jungle full of <UNK> cannibals they finally locate diana who's under the control of jim jones type cult leader <UNK> melvyn <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does the typical mad guru style things like passing out <UNK> <UNK> group suicide threatening to kill anyone who <UNK> him and <UNK> with a giant <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> blood every once in awhile a character will look to the right or left and see a gory scene lifted directly from jungle holocaust or man from deep river both of which were also directed by i'm pretty sure they also use at least two scenes from cannibal holocaust as well here we get the expected animal slaughter scenes <UNK> a <UNK> natives eating live snakes plus some additional nudity and a <UNK> me me <UNK> shows up to give her breast <UNK> another <UNK> playing a widow who is gang <UNK> by three of her brother in laws on top of the <UNK> of her <UNK> <UNK> husband mel <UNK> briefly appears as a professor and isn't given much to do br br so anyway with you pretty much get a promise <UNK> with all the nudity gore dead animals and bad taste you expect with one of these titles so if you're a sleaze <UNK> by all means watch it personally i got bored with it about <UNK> through and just wanted it to end the original heavily cut u s release in 1985 was titled the <UNK> jungle in order to trick people into thinking they were actually renting john <UNK> <UNK> forest it was also called doomed to die and eaten alive by cannibals
<START> peter o'toole is arthur <UNK> a latin teacher with strict <UNK> to detail and in helping young minds grasp the meaning and definition of latin words and phrases he is seen as being cold and unfair and not in touch with the times but upon meeting stage actress singer <UNK> clark not only at a late <UNK> after a performance of london is london but at an in <UNK> his closed minded world starts to open up br br goodbye mr <UNK> is an mgm musical remake of the 1939 movie also from mgm during this time musicals were out and the hollywood studio system was in total <UNK> when it premiered in new york los angeles and london the musical numbers were left intact but when it came to the local main street theaters world wide it was sans songs therefore making the movie shorter and <UNK> to the max br br thanks to mgm <UNK> home video under ted turner in the late 1980's early 1990's when vhs and laser disc were the main home video <UNK> of choice the musical numbers were re <UNK> and the gaps closed <UNK> though was the only format chosen to view goodbye mr <UNK> in the widescreen <UNK> format br br for awhile now the original motion picture soundtrack was only available on the original out of print <UNK> and <UNK> tape and can still be found today on ebay br br thanks to the wonderful people at film score <UNK> com in 2006 the soundtrack has been <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> into a 3 cd set featuring the completely <UNK> score the original 1969 general release album score and narrated sequences source music and interviews a plenty you also get 1 <UNK> song which is a real lost gem tomorrow with me by clark which would have been chosen in place of you and i before hand br br this movie is both a classic musical and a real tribute to <UNK> everywhere i most certainly would buy this movie if warner bros mgm and <UNK> would put their money where there mouth is and get this film restored from all master film sources and put it on both dvd and <UNK> ray with all the <UNK> and <UNK> put back into place with all the extras you can find and stuff into a release
<START> although this film is set amongst the sophisticated english upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn <UNK> it has a slightly dated air being an adaptation of a way through the wood a 1950 novel by <UNK> once hugely popular and now forgotten julian <UNK> who despite an academy award for the script of <UNK> park has a somewhat <UNK> persona himself wrote the script and directed the latter for the first time with the dvd version i saw there is a most <UNK> audio commentary by julian his primary focus was on getting his characters right and by and large he has succeeded in this he was helped by two outstanding performances from tom <UNK> as james the <UNK> up city lawyer and emily watson as his attractive wife anne he also kept it short the running time is only 80 minutes br br james and anne have a town house in <UNK> and a comfortable former in anne is some years younger but they are <UNK> <UNK> they seem happy but james one of <UNK> unusual for a city lawyer is a control freak just down the road is the <UNK> the william who is not one for middle class morality and he is more than happy to take advantage but there's a <UNK> a road accident in which an elderly <UNK> is knocked over in a country lane by a <UNK> driven range <UNK> just like the <UNK> soon james anne bill and the <UNK> widow who happens to be <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are drawn in to a conspiracy to <UNK> what really happened the primary focus is on the <UNK> effect of all this on james and <UNK> relationship br br the third person in this <UNK> a <UNK> bill is played by rupert everett from the point of view of casting his <UNK> superior manner is right for the part yet somehow he doesn't quite get there partly this is because he is supposed to be sick for some of the time and he looks well when he is supposed to be sick and vice versa the part seems underdeveloped it is interesting that john <UNK> as <UNK> father who has only one significant scene manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he has br br the world of five star <UNK> and superior <UNK> is nicely <UNK> as julian <UNK> says in the audio commentary these people are able to convince themselves that the <UNK> age still exists at bottom though the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart <UNK> was going through a marriage break up when he wrote the book and <UNK> has made a good fist of conveying the atmosphere as he says his is a fairly free adaptation but the central theme is the same
<START> the first time i had heard of guest house was in the er <UNK> after having just seen fight club in each <UNK> was <UNK> a small round black circle when the circle came into contact with <UNK> to put it <UNK> it caused a colour picture to form with photographs of the two stars and the tag line you'll p yourself laughing when you'd finished <UNK> your hands the circle had <UNK> and faded to black again waiting to spring it's surprise on the next victim br br okay maybe the punchline wasn't terribly sophisticated but you have to admit it was innovative in fact i think i can honestly say i've never seen anything like it in my life before and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing that's a real feat what a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise br br i hate to pan guest house and i am <UNK> to richard and adrian eddie elizabeth for many years of laughter through their appealing television series be it the invention of the young ones 1982 1984 the sitting room plays of bottom 1991 1995 or even solo work such as in the new <UNK> 1988 1993 in fact this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special unfortunately its an <UNK> minute film br br there's definitely some merit to be had and i laughed continuously throughout the <UNK> finale which <UNK> the exorcist and <UNK> of the lost <UNK> and involved well you'll have to see that bit for yourself yet often the pace is <UNK> and a <UNK> atmosphere is throughout the two stars taking his usual <UNK> this time due to the fact that he adequately directs never really get into first gear only <UNK> showing the foul mouthed <UNK> that makes us love him on the small screen indeed the <UNK> <UNK> that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being to the audience the slight hints of depth seen in the series <UNK> <UNK> failed social climbing for example are not present here and instead we are left with parodies of parodies br br the <UNK> towers <UNK> does pass water complete with drunken chef and unseen called for <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> some of the ideas such a hotel next to a nuclear <UNK> with a <UNK> swing hanging over a cliff face are very very funny but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn't there and all the dead laugh areas <UNK> up with incidental comedy music that would have been dated in a carry on film two decades ago br br brand of <UNK> sadistic perverse humour is funny and i feel sure it will make you laugh just not as often as it should
<START> the problem with tv today is that people have been spoiled by <UNK> tv viewing this type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or easy listening jazz the typical viewers idea of continuity is remembering who got voted off the island last week and wondering who will be the next to go show them a program like surface <UNK> dr who or anything with a plot arc of more than three episodes and well they'll just flip back to survivor br br 95 of the sheep watching tv don't want to rack their brains they want excuses to not think they want to make sure the <UNK> tube lives up to its name and they don't want shows that try and go any other route because of this surface and many other high quality shows that should have lasted far longer have gotten the axe br br tv viewers don't want stories or morals or philosophy or anything over a third grade <UNK> level they want people eating or over <UNK> real life series no such thing you cannot observe something without changing the very nature of what you observe or <UNK> shows involving groups of people having <UNK> and then <UNK> about it to their friends br br today's television is nothing but a <UNK> and the few <UNK> you can pick out of the dust are just tossed out because no one even knows what a diamond is anymore surface was one of those <UNK>
<START> one of the great things about the best years of our lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post world war ii era the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on v e or v j day of 1945 the problem of how to <UNK> returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet br br and while we don't often learn from history we can be thankful that for once the united states of america did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous world war the <UNK> bill of rights is mentioned in passing in the best years of our lives was possibly the greatest piece of social <UNK> from the last century so many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like march dana andrews and harold russell who you see here br br all three of those actors played <UNK> veterans characters that every corner of the usa could identify with they all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them <UNK> city <UNK> br br war is a great <UNK> of class and distinction bank employee march <UNK> jerk andrews and high school football star russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like <UNK> city but they do meet and war <UNK> <UNK> bonds that can never be broken br br march is the oldest a man with two children and hollywood's perfect wife myrna loy he <UNK> in the first and the best he has some wonderful scenes getting <UNK> drunk on his return and later with a little bit of <UNK> in him tells the bank officials at a <UNK> off in no uncertain terms br br i also love his scene where another returning veteran a <UNK> wants to get a bank <UNK> for his own piece of land watch <UNK> expressions as he <UNK> to the man's pitch for money you can feel him read the man's soul it's what got him his second best actor oscar for this film br br harold russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the pacific he got a special recognition oscar for his performance because of that it was probably unfair to <UNK> him in the supporting actor category which he also won in his performance especially his scenes with cathy <UNK> as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands is beyond anything that could be described as acting br br dana andrews is the only officer of the three a <UNK> in the army air <UNK> of the group of them maybe he should have stayed in he also comes from the <UNK> background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform that uniform and those <UNK> <UNK> are what got virginia <UNK> interested enough to marry him the problem is that he's considerably less in her eyes as a <UNK> br br while <UNK> is <UNK> around with steve <UNK> andrews has the great good fortune to have <UNK> daughter <UNK> wright take an interest in him they're the main story of the film andrews <UNK> to <UNK> life and <UNK> to the fact he married the wrong woman not all <UNK> problems were solved with <UNK> bill br br myrna loy gets little recognition for the best years of our lives my guess is that it's because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had <UNK> over at mgm still as wife to march and mother to wright she really is the <UNK> that holds that family together br br the best years of our lives won for best picture for sam <UNK> best director for william <UNK> and a few others besides the two acting oscars it got it was a critical and popular success possibly the best film sam <UNK> ever produced it remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries it's almost three hours in length but never once will your interest <UNK> br br the best tribute this film received came from frank <UNK> who had a film of his own in the oscar <UNK> that year in several categories in his <UNK> he said that he was disappointed to be at the oscars that year but that his friend and colleague william <UNK> had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it br br by the way the film <UNK> had hopes for was it's a wonderful life the beat years of our lives can't get better praise than that
<START> this movie has everything it has a good storyline good acting great scenery adventure and some brilliant gags chris <UNK> plays tommy mega successful company auto has to go on the road to stop the company going under after big tom dies the trouble is that tommy knows nothing about break <UNK> and needs the help of <UNK> auto parts worker richard david spade from the moment the two <UNK> hit the road the movie is just so much fun if you love slapstick with a great storyline you'll love this because the gags keep coming thick and fast and the movie will just make you laugh out loud it was so sad about <UNK> death in 1997 but a credit to his genius is <UNK> get it chill out and enjoy this brilliant slapstick
<START> first off i've read the comments by the director further down and i'd like to thank him for offering his opinion i've always wondered what the makers of the films <UNK> on mst3k felt about their works being <UNK> not to mention how best brains acquired the rights comments make me curious however as to how much sci fi could have cut the film to make it seem different now i'm thinking i might rent it from netflix of course i've never seen the uncut non mst3k version of this film but even having seen it on mst3k i never thought of it as a bad film or something unwatchable though i did think it was a pretty funny mst3k episode certainly not as pearl describes it skin awful not after seeing the likes of future war and hobgoblins br br as far as cutting the film it's been done before on mst3k at least once case in point the joe don baker flick mitchell in which the subplot involving john <UNK> character is cut in the mst3k version yet joel and the <UNK> comment on <UNK> absence after his appearance in the beginning of the movie if i may submit a criticism of mst3k if you need to cut the film for time <UNK> fine but be fair to the film being cut even if it is a film as lousy as mitchell of course such criticism is rather pointless what with the show being over but i think that aspect of the show was kind of unfair but anyway if it's the case with it gets my <UNK> br br still i maintain that it's an enjoyable mst3k episode though the movie itself even the version that's been <UNK> in mst3k is no where near terrible br br as a final note in a weird coincidence or perhaps a case of <UNK> i happened to watch the <UNK> <UNK> the day aired and wouldn't you know it the guy who played vivian father had a bit part in that movie one of his three other credited roles actually i thought that was kind of weird
<START> i saw this movie over 5 years ago and the subject still <UNK> me as it should her anger and <UNK> were inspiring not that i would <UNK> an army and kill people but the scene at the well and at the rebel strong hold will never leave my mind this is a great film but be prepared for the strong subject matter
<START> i didn't understand the people who rated it over 5 i think it's a horrible film from any point of view plots acting art dialog music whatsoever i don't mind a low budget however you have to get some point wandering wondering pointless then two boys started kissing in bed awful just awful i love indie films don't mind it is slow however this movie disappointed me from any perspectives even the not artistic br br i was wondering what kind of people would like it i am a female in my 30's is it for teens who have some kind of the loneliness about life or i just don't get it what i gained then wasting time please go for some others
<START> from the start you will like sam <UNK> character <UNK> a <UNK> cop that is notably loyal to his partner but too loyal and too when seeing his partner dead in an alley cause he then kills who he thought to be the <UNK> before giving him a chance to explain <UNK> is an alcoholic and that tends to <UNK> him from being in self control though he manages to direct his attention towards finding who's really behind his partners death he carries along a rookie as his new partner which seems to be seen too often in films but <UNK> <UNK> does well in accompanying sam elliot though puzzling pieces begin to fit to where <UNK> begins a self <UNK> investigation towards <UNK> he mainly wants to find the answers since fallon isn't letting him in on the whole story and does not like what he finds there is not a last minute showing at who the bad detectives are which is okay and they are not able to <UNK> <UNK> into joining them leading to a dramatic ending fine acting all the way around with a touch of humor from paul sorvino who is the captain of detectives it's a good movie that will make you want to see it several times so it qualifies as a must see and a good addition to a movie collection filmed in san francisco
<START> i saw this last night on turner classic movies tcm i had never heard of it before and was quite surprised to find it so engrossing br br bogart does a star turn as a city wise cynical editor who reluctantly goes along with his greedy radio network boss in this <UNK> b <UNK> about 12 years before he played similar city wise <UNK> to perfection in movies like <UNK> usa knock on any door the <UNK> <UNK> and the harder they fall <UNK> already had the star qualities down pat br br in order to boost ratings and bring their somewhat high brow programming to a more popular level the voice of america pushes a tell all radio mini series about a woman who was <UNK> 20 years ago by a <UNK> of self defense of killing her husband not willing to be <UNK> in order to save the woman's and her husband's <UNK> the station uses <UNK> methods to reveal all to all <UNK> and as <UNK> as possible br br as a time capsule i also found it very <UNK> of male female <UNK> in the <UNK> in the mid 1930's although beyond henry o'neill i'm unfamiliar with the supporting cast the players were uniformly excellent and the direction was taut br br if you like this kind of movie at all e g a face in the crowd an inspector calls etc don't miss the opportunity to see this one br br
<START> who said it had to be believable do yourself a favor and turn off your <UNK> before you sit down to view this film you'll enjoy the experience much more you'll find yourself <UNK> some of the movie's more outlandish plot set ups and simply accepting it for what it is a great family film i appreciated not having to be concerned about questionable elements in a children's film for once that to me is worth the price of the ticket and it manages to maintain its <UNK> without being obvious about it older will enjoy this film enough good humor to keep adults interested very good film
<START> imagery controls this film the characters although interesting ultimately take a back seat the first scene i remember is a framed black and white shot of the ocean that then opens to full screen and color the <UNK> of the water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface the theme of the movie here being that death can be accepted and brought into the realm of the living br br water as an ultimate consciousness as a tool of god is used to here to force people to get their houses in order judgment day the dead have to be <UNK> for and lifted to a better place whatever one has left <UNK> or <UNK> will be washed away there's no <UNK> on to the past to a buried memory of what was br br this movie has been compared to o brother where art <UNK> and the threat of water and its use as a <UNK> force is similar to that film what's different in this movie is that the coming of the water is <UNK> and so again the emphasis is on what needs to be done with the here and now br br i agree that the some of the scenes are reminiscent of a david lynch work take for example the dinner segment with the deep voiced and <UNK> waitress one gets the same surreal feel from the setting and odd character as one does with the backwards <UNK> in the scene from fire <UNK> the difference is that lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological <UNK> of a troubled character whereas this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message the men in black suits can't have anything they want they must be patient and accept what is available
<START> i have become a big fan of the work of <UNK> <UNK> so maybe i am already a little biased by now but i think this movie is great although there may be a few <UNK> it is a romantic <UNK> view of the great <UNK> in the later sixties <UNK> amazingly polished great set design and in my opinion still very watchable br br basically this is an ironic re telling of the story of adam and eve who are driven from paradise after having <UNK> the fruit which has turned from an apple into a <UNK> filled with heroine the woman <UNK> a man into using it thus <UNK> his doom i say <UNK> as the guy seems to be doomed and bound for an <UNK> life and an early grave right from the great title sequence <UNK> there is no place for any hope br br although the story is rather sad i was captured by the beauty both of the beautiful location <UNK> and farmer i found her character was at once shallow enigmatic endearing annoying interesting and boring somehow she represents what men see in women in a basic way architecture and built <UNK> in general are put to very good use  which seems to be a <UNK> trademark of sorts br br there is even some humor mainly delivered by <UNK> the german main character and his accent his main nemesis is not a snake but an older german of dubious reputation  and <UNK> of the heroine called wolf although it is a german name and <UNK> is german he <UNK> it english and in fits of jealousy <UNK> the name out at his girlfriend in regular <UNK>  becoming a boy who cries at times <UNK> has to work in order to earn a at one time the guy goes and afterward <UNK> <UNK> up a rock with his rubber <UNK>  never has male frontal nudity been funnier in movie history
<START> i recently rented <UNK> a movie i'd seen several years ago on tv and it has aged well i found myself laughing out loud several times at it and as weird as all these people are by the end i profoundly cared about them this is the sort of little movie that is made for a cult audience because rather like well i think that's what it is it's an acquired taste you have to be <UNK> to its peculiar <UNK> the production values might be <UNK> called <UNK> and the pace and atmosphere take a while to get settled but the film has a look especially in some wonderful shots <UNK> the dry <UNK> of the land with the <UNK> of the mansion interior michael <UNK> had a good eye even then life with <UNK> eugene cleveland harry dean <UNK> and his household two adult children a <UNK> and a <UNK> seems so detached from life outside we could be in everyone in this film is wonderful especially <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> glover as the <UNK> genius siblings maureen and <UNK> <UNK> their roles so <UNK> after a while you just buy the strange premise that somehow having survived the <UNK> and being apparently incapable of happiness these people are lucky and yet don't know quite what to do with their luck there are some truly great scenes <UNK> sudden <UNK> first with his gold digging children's tv host girlfriend virginia an <UNK> lois <UNK> then with his children william s <UNK> taking target practice in the <UNK> and telling a story about a mysterious jim <UNK> boyfriend chris proving himself by battling a shed full of <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> and and old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> maureen and chris all sitting on the couch the latter three in appropriately lightweight summer <UNK> the former in a red <UNK> and black leather <UNK> gear staring at images of <UNK> on the huge tv and <UNK> the future the images were done by bill <UNK> who did the backdrop video <UNK> for nine inch last tour <UNK> glover is predictably magnificent as <UNK> as always he remains perfectly in character <UNK> has made a cult of his misery and brilliance he's like the oscar <UNK> of kansas <UNK> to live up to his red <UNK> suit whether he's <UNK> away yet <UNK> on an electric guitar cracking a <UNK> while wearing an all black cowboy outfit <UNK> a room or even doing simple things like driving or <UNK> the aforementioned soup from a <UNK> <UNK> he's mesmerizing if you like his work you'll like this
<START> this is the story of a maniac cop who for some reason has it in for a young college stud and his mates after they report him to his <UNK> who in turns <UNK> him <UNK> psychiatric <UNK> he finds an opportunity to psychology torture them when on a bet the kids hack into a department <UNK> security and <UNK> the door only they get locked in the store along with the weirdo murder and mayhem are <UNK> and the kids are running around trying to survive until morning when they may be able to escape br br <UNK> would have been a successful cat and mouse psycho thriller probably if it was set in a different location the thought of psychotic cop chasing around a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn't work especially when he comes face to face with his <UNK> prey quite frequently and yet does nothing serious quite often there was no real confrontation as would be sufficient for this kind of story and <UNK> worked better if say for example the teens were loose in the neighborhood and left to <UNK> for themselves against this weirdo especially if that took a few days while he makes them increasingly paranoid although granted even that is clichéd br br what a shame too that it could not have been a better thriller considering a funky cast of young australian characters even a light hearted adventure despite the madness of the villain interspersed through the picture might have even made it a more satisfying picture instead it started out fresh and sure did have plenty of action sequences but wound up <UNK> on the ridiculous
<START> a while back i bought the chinese box set of fist of the north star which came with all of fist of the north star fist of the north star 2 new fist of the north star and the fist of the north star movie while there is an american version and a few european versions they end half way through fist of the north star which is about as far as the movie goes br br the series is about the <UNK> of an ancient martial art called shin ken fist of the north star named or ken for short there is only one <UNK> each generation it takes place in a post apocalyptic future where martial arts is the most powerful weapon the two most powerful arts are shin ken and divine ken as my version calls it is really multiple styles but they are all the same since they allow a person to chop someone to pieces there are six masters and each has their own star is an art that allows someone to damage kill or <UNK> someone by hitting a point on their body each art has their own <UNK> big <UNK> goes around saving the world from evil <UNK> of going after his two brothers and three of the masters and their <UNK> each army captain has their own way of fighting which makes each episode different and the number of soldiers bloody also is looking for his girlfriend who was stolen by the master shin along the journey is joined by his brother after <UNK> him from his brother <UNK> who calls himself or boxing king he is also joined by two masters <UNK> who is looking for his sister who was taken by <UNK> brother and <UNK> both of them and die along the way other characters that join ken are two kids <UNK> and who don't do much that's about as much as i can say for story since its so long and full of details the series is also divided into four parts br br what makes this show great is the fighting ken normally goes up against a group of people that think they are tough and then get killed in one hit which is funny and <UNK> but makes for quick fights another great part is comedy ken hits someone and they think its nothing ken says they are already dead then they die other parts are when he'll hit them and tell them they have a few seconds to live then a counter will pop up or when he tells them they are not worthy of knowing his name then there is when he does a rapid fire kick or punch and goes <UNK> da da da da da da etc eventually you might find yourself doing it with him one great part was when a bad guy thought he knew he went up to ken and hit him ken stood there said he was dead in a few seconds the bad guy counted off then died it isn't limited to ken everyone else kills just as quick there has never been a character as awesome as ken and their probably never will br br there are a few problems though one is the repetitive nature some flashbacks mainly the one with being taken are played too much and there are also too many <UNK> episodes especially in part four of the series in fact the last episode is a <UNK> of the whole thing another problem is the ending the final battle with <UNK> wasn't that impressive ken and <UNK> fought then talked etc until <UNK> came to some realization and kills himself instead of ken killing him but it is better than the american and european versions that just cut off halfway br br who would i recommend this for this is for older teenagers and adults who like action since the styles cause people to explode or get cut into pieces the violence is very graphic and there is a lot of it but they don't show much blood because they usually make the death just a <UNK> that still looks like the person but less colorful this was probably done to avoid censorship if you don't like action rent the american version if you like action though then i say go for the <UNK> since you can see all of the series but they do not have the best english translation since it is subtitled by the chinese note my <UNK> came with everything i said at the beginning some <UNK> versions do not but you still have to get an <UNK> to see all of the series and fist of the north star 2 if you don't think you can handle the subtitles for any reason then go get the american version another note in the version i got no subtitles were on the last disc for new fist of the north star although new fist of the north star isn't very good to begin with br br i give the show an 8 10 for its high amount of action good story and the <UNK> of br br update br br animation released an english subtitled version you can <UNK> the episodes as well as no ken 2 from or watch it free on site
<START> what some mistake for stilted dialog and or dismiss as <UNK> characterizations accurately represents how people talked lived and were before world war ii let alone in whatever years the big trail represent on film br br the movie took my breath away the first time i saw it years ago reading the boards here helped me understand why it missed at the box office and why movie goers got the benefit of wayne in b westerns for another ten years wayne was in my opinion better in the big trail and the years of <UNK> than most of his star turns after 1939 with ford's incredible <UNK> trilogy true <UNK> and the <UNK> being big time exceptions br br what a shame theaters missed the boat on this in 1930 had this movie hit we might have enjoyed more movies with more realism and less <UNK> in my opinion this is not only one of the finest westerns ever filmed with accurate dialog and accurate character realization but among the finest <UNK> of a passage of any kind ever put on film br br it still takes my breath away especially the dialog and accurate characterizations of types that simply don't exist any more some celebrate the surface of our culture that in fact hides the largest cultural <UNK> into <UNK> like <UNK> and <UNK> like <UNK> and political <UNK> vs main in us history but for me the big trail represents a time when our surface differences were more obvious but underneath them most folks wanted to work out the <UNK> failures and most folks <UNK> to build a great culture and a great nation br br the big trail is an epic of the melting pot in motion toward the american dream certainly the finest film on that path i ever saw that subject ever filmed
<START> my wife spotted this film on the <UNK> at a local video store from the cover it looked like a science fiction film but upon turning it over my wife saw rebecca st james was in the film realized it was a christian movie and suggested we watch it we are conservative but we also know that christian films have a poor reputation in the mainstream nevertheless we decided to give it a screening br br to be fair there were a few things i liked about the film the musical score much of which was <UNK> was quite good the cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower budget movie br br unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a <UNK> script the film begins with an interesting premise <UNK> <UNK> but by <UNK> through the feature the storyline <UNK> wildly into an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by the movie's two main characters which then <UNK> wildly into a <UNK> on the rapture at least the frank <UNK> inspired the which was itself a deeply flawed film had an <UNK> that tied together the movie's premise <UNK> ends nowhere even close to where it started which is a huge letdown br br as for the acting the supporting acting <UNK> from decent to awful rebecca st james plays a bit part and is passable for their part a few of the main characters are <UNK> <UNK> enough sadly their talents are wasted on characters so one dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable the protagonists are anything but you know it's bad when two christian viewers find the most vocal christian character in the film to be the most annoying br br a final note on the <UNK> tone of this movie which will be of more interest to christian than non christian readers in a word it is embarrassing other christian films like the champion and <UNK> the <UNK> curse have managed to communicate a genuinely <UNK> portrait of the christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive this film by contrast is a <UNK> that feels so heavy handed and lacking in <UNK> that a non christian would have a hard time taking it seriously br br i do believe that the <UNK> heart is in the right place and i applaud efforts to create good christian film unfortunately this is not one of them if your church is looking for a screening of a good christian film consider mercy streets the aforementioned the champion or if you're <UNK> robert <UNK> provocative the <UNK> br br as for <UNK> rent it if you must but screen it before you show it to a non christian or a larger audience
<START> i expected fame to be an uplifting film but it ended up the opposite the overall plot which follows the lives of several determined students attending a performing arts school has strong potential however fame builds its characters up beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions when its over i was very surprised when the <UNK> scene pops up we thought the dvd had <UNK> or something all of the characters have internal and <UNK> conflicts of some sort and virtually none of them are resolved when the movie ends you might think there are too many characters but its probably too many scenes its evident the film was cut up and <UNK> because its sometimes lacks transition i think laura dean as lisa monroe is my favorite character i really connected with her character's ambition and following her heart <UNK> <UNK> as michael the stereotypical poor student who can't read but is a divine dancer is also very good i didn't especially like irene <UNK> character of <UNK> but this is not <UNK> fault since her script is weak and her character is not fleshed out her voice is beautiful and hearing her songs <UNK> watching the whole film in summary the film could use many <UNK> but the quality actors and great music earn its place in film history
<START> even if ryan wasn't such of an annoying person this would still be bad i said even if where do we begin directors <UNK> you will have the urge to snatch his tape <UNK> and pound it with a hammer or <UNK> it into a lake a haunted lake of course oh how i wish dead time was more literal as opposed to what they refer to it as but alas no death maybe a <UNK> out of place or a <UNK> noise oh wait thats the cat i actually expected to see some sort of evidence or at least something to <UNK> their <UNK> don't worry you wont see anything you that you would not see on a normal day br br an entire season and what do they have to show for it um nothing no in fact they have less than nothing they have a waste of time they took my challenge the do something for the <UNK> challenge now in this you actually do something for the <UNK> you could say go on camera and say i love the <UNK> so much i'll draw stick figures of ghosts or i love the <UNK> so much i'll film hot co <UNK> pretending to be ghost hunters you would be wasting film but wasting it for the <UNK> or you could say i'll mess with a demon but don't say it's name you might get hurt and you know god doesn't like that that would be quite a thing for god but he wouldn't like that so don't do that so i asked them to waste time for the <UNK> and they followed suit they went into an old building looking for it was a waste of time it made no real difference at all it had no effect we learned nothing new it was a waste of time and film br br there amazing detective work is just so uncanny well we found your problem a cat died here so were going to <UNK> communicate with that cat and tell it to move on kind of throw some at it and it'll be ok directors <UNK> captain <UNK> star date 2 oh i mean directors <UNK> i just brought on a few new <UNK> a couple <UNK> and <UNK> but this <UNK> is a 10 um yeah we have a new case strange things happening focusing on one of the children were going to investigate now we will bring is a psychic we haven't told them anything this is tv trust us
<START> victor who is the grandfather of swedish cinema directed this stark <UNK> film about <UNK> betrayal death forgiveness guilt redemption and the <UNK> moments of the human condition he stars as david <UNK> a no good nick who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways only to later have to bargain for his soul with the driver of the phantom <UNK> death br br unlike many silent films during the period the film is nearly absent scenes with over acting the pacing does becomes tedious with its overly familiar <UNK> narrative however <UNK> the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time it's a very daring and unique film audiences of the time were not exposed to such subject matter and the cinematography is tremendous symbolic and accompanied by double exposure effects and multi layered flashbacks it's a genuinely creepy and frightening film for youngsters for sure br br watching the film it's easy to see the later influences this film had on swedish master <UNK> bergman most of the great bergman themes are here on full display of course later starred in <UNK> masterpiece on alienation and loneliness wild <UNK> this would be final performance as an actor based the script on a novel by swedish writer <UNK> of 4 stars
<START> this is a nicely done story with pretty music lots of dancing lots of big sister little sister interaction almost all of it positive and lots of wishes granted there are funny moments that older children and adults will enjoy such as when king randolph <UNK> they're just shoes aren't they and tender moments such as when princess <UNK> <UNK> her youngest sister <UNK> after a <UNK> br br the animation is perhaps not as good as disney but it still is very good the facial expressions are nuanced particularly for <UNK> king randolph <UNK> and her servant derek the <UNK> and little princess <UNK> my only <UNK> on the animation is in the dance sequences where the dancing <UNK> become absolute <UNK> copies of each other without the slightest <UNK> even the three youngest copy the dance steps perfectly i would have liked to see a little more <UNK> in the dancing considering that these girls are not professional or chorus dancers br br the resolution of the story is handled cleverly to get rid of a <UNK> without actually hurting her there is some violence done to guards in the story and the monkey is mean to other animals in the story br br my 4 year old daughter loves this movie and has watched it repeatedly and i have found it to be quite acceptable for her to watch
<START> i found this an awfully disappointing experience but i have <UNK> a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry br br this journey is intriguing it has drama but it is full of <UNK> types br br so it only serves <UNK> without concern for <UNK> justice fairness truth beyond black <UNK> white <UNK> that fit 30 second ads of news that <UNK> our <UNK> experiences everyday especially news <UNK> true or misleading in such depictions br br it is so exaggerated it reminds me of the fairytale of little red consider the innocent young girl with no <UNK> crossing borders <UNK> by a guard but freed without any evidence to venture on in search of her who didn't give her an address versus the <UNK> inept lack of substance in the <UNK> voice of the <UNK> <UNK> her with his unlikely story <UNK> by the <UNK> br br it seems to suit the directors management team that no one has faith or <UNK> to god even in their times of desperation br br so in these early settings it <UNK> tells much of what is to come a nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairytale resolution without truth or integrity or credibility then one twist it's all over what a disappointment if you want to see a much superior movie that <UNK> similar themes with much more credibility with much more powerful insight watch the 1983 paul cox norman <UNK> man of flowers movie br br unlike here you will not be disappointed
<START> this is a great example of what could have been a great film and a great idea but turned out to be really bad in the process i was mainly tempted to get this because of the dvd cover stupid me but i did anyway and i was blown away in a bad sense this movie is essentially about el <UNK> havoc around los angeles and it's up to a local animal cop and a writer to save the day before two corrupt cops and two evil scientists bring them down the main reason why i did not enjoy this film was because of big continuity errors that were hard to not notice along with some bad acting okay lighting and nothing scary this movie did not hit me as much as is it probably should have however compared to other movies this one certainly tops the <UNK> just barely br br first off the continuity in this movie is way off and i mean off the shoulders and into the <UNK> there were so many points were the characters said or did something and then in the next shot they aren't doing it or the change never occurred case in point the main character has a gun the attacks he <UNK> out a flair from nowhere and <UNK> and the gun in missing the girl runs while he <UNK> here with the mystery flair and she had no gun then the main character is running with the girl and has the gun where did the flair come from and what happened to the gun the time of day gets screwed up one minute it is sun set and you can still see the sun and then the next minute it looks like midnight there were some plot holes as in why was the there what were the scientists doing what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal and it still lived these things <UNK> the heck out of me and none of the questions were answered br br next on the list is the acting boy was it wooden and bad the main character played by eric <UNK> seems a bit too calm at points and too dedicated to finding out what killed a few dogs and when a tragedy hits his emotion was just not there <UNK> madison who played did a fairly poor job she was the author of a <UNK> book about the and she just didn't seem into her role or her performance her acting was kind of laughable and a poor even for an author she knows too much about that thing and knows how to <UNK> a high security defense system in a hidden laboratory tony <UNK> was okay but he seemed a bit to calm for some of the stuff that was going on the movie reminds me of a bad <UNK> to murder for some crime solving show where the actors and actresses aren't really that committed to their work br br i rarely don't get this <UNK> when it comes to lighting or editing but for this movie i could not help but be harsh on the lighting it took me out of the movie a number of times because the lighting was so poorly directed there were times when they were trying to be creative by adding color <UNK> to the scene to make it more comic <UNK> but it <UNK> the worse part is at night when it is <UNK> black outside but the scene is so with light it seems like its day they keep switching from high intensity light to soft light for random scenes and the lights seem so bright that the actors were <UNK> it shouldn't be that bright that there are dark shadows at night during the sunset when the lighting was perfect that's the only time when the light was good other than that it was terrible br br there were not scares in this film there was only one time where i did jump but other than that it wasn't scary there were points were it probably could have been scary but it was so damn light out you could see the approach the man but if it was dark it would have been better even the creature design for the was poor it looked good but it was a short man or kid in a jump suit they didn't hide his face they showed him with no sense of mystery or any enigmatic appearance there was a fair amount of gore but it seemed unreal this movie just wasn't scary that's all br br overall they did <UNK> a great south american legend into a blood <UNK> human eater which the isn't in fact it was scared of people and it only killed <UNK> sheep dogs and deer because it was said that it hated the smell of humans but then were would the story be i did not enjoy this film for any reason but i will give them credit for trying to make a good film with good intentions i would not recommend this film to any horror fan but if you like indie or b movies you should check this out also if you are easily tempted by cult classics you'd enjoy this film i didn't i won't see it again but in some deep <UNK> way i enjoy these kinds of movie just to see what the other side of hollywood is making
<START> i don't mind the odd artsy film but when they are <UNK> with <UNK> symbolism and murky dialogue and when it's obvious they were done for the <UNK> ego rather than the viewer's benefit i get upset i'm not a stupid person yet i simply didn't understand what this film was trying to say or do film is a magnificent form of human communication why do some filmmakers use it instead for
<START> <UNK> is an brilliant movie it is 1 of my favourite films <UNK> has done a mind blowing job in the movie br br this role couldn't have been played by anyone else because this type of role only suits <UNK> br br <UNK> plays a mental villain in the film br br <UNK> performance in this movie is the best performance ever in boll wood br br <UNK> deserves an honour and an <UNK> appeal for his fantastic performance br br <UNK> also delivers an excellent performance br br sunny <UNK> looked strong and physically fit in the film
<START> this 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the <UNK> world as <UNK> this follows the same idea as three <UNK> in a <UNK> a few years before this takes place in new york while <UNK> takes place in rome italy our three <UNK> are hope lange in her first starring role <UNK> parker and diane baker lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business namely joan crawford <UNK> plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau hard to believe that anyone could reject this beauty for any reason but louis her heart <UNK> does just this sort of takes you back to paul <UNK> <UNK> the gorgeous taylor in cat on a hot tin roof doesn't it diane baker the third damsel in distress meets and dates robert evans before he became the producer and husband to ali <UNK> he is known for <UNK> boyfriend from home played by newcomer brett <UNK> is promising to marry her she also meets stephen <UNK> a fellow worker who has interests in our hope all three ladies have their drama ahead of them crawford almost steals the film her presence and her usual strong bitchy self is fun to watch veteran actor brian plays one of the bosses with a <UNK> for <UNK> our leading <UNK> back side he's delightfully charming also in the cast is martha <UNK> wasted in a <UNK> role never really explored too bad as i like this actress who never seems to get that one role to <UNK> her abilities she has a crush on a married man in the office played by donald harron whom i had the pleasure to work with in a couple of shakespeare plays in nyc he is a distinguished actor that is wasted in this film also br br all in all it's great fun in technicolor and <UNK> directed by jean <UNK>
<START> this is one incredibly standard western that features some bad acting dull storyline and silly action br br biggest problem perhaps is how incredibly formulaic this movie is it features all of the usual clichés yes even a bar fight and the movie really doesn't has any surprises in it it makes this a dull and a weak western to watch also not in the least because it's such a poorly made one br br it's obviously a small production and the movie looks like it got shot in 30 days the directing and editing can be called bad and all of the action sequences featured in the movie are incredibly silly it perhaps almost becomes a bit humorous to watch for all the wrong reasons br br its story also isn't that interesting it's a pretty friendly western so also no blood in which for some odd reason everybody seems to be against the younger brothers who in this movie are being portrayed as good and very friendly guys the story gets <UNK> and <UNK> as it heads toward its ending the younger brothers really existed and were part of the james younger gang of which the famous brothers frank and jesse james were also part of of course they were not as friendly in real life as portrayed in this movie it just was <UNK> for an early <UNK> to have likable man characters in it it wasn't really until the western age really that the main characters became rotten criminals themselves really strangely enough that approached has always worked out better than those early <UNK> in which the main character is on the good side of the law br br thing that does make this movie original is the fact that it was shot in color this was something pretty unique for an <UNK> western and still gives the movie something extra you can wonder though why they shot this western in full color the movie is still done in the style of a black white early western after all and i actually believe that this movie would had been a bit more credible if it got done in black white instead br br you could easily do without this western br br 4 10
<START> normally i wouldn't even <UNK> to viewing trash like this but since role playing is a dear <UNK> to me and such was the subject of the film i did it was garbage in so many ways that i do not know where to begin i would rather sit through the plan 9 from outer space marathon than watch another minute of this vomit at least plan 9 didn't have an agenda how the media could <UNK> and <UNK> represent <UNK> agenda as fact is beyond me it is a scary time when a whole group of people can be <UNK> <UNK> with no defense and no real facts presented i know this commentary went more social but it couldn't be helped as this movie <UNK> it imagine a pro nazi film being reviewed strictly on film merit won't happen as it sits the people who made this film are themselves and should perhaps move into a communist <UNK> where <UNK> is accepted
<START> a group of teens decide to take their <UNK> party to an abandoned school where 27 years prior a horrible massacre took place unfortunately for them the person responsible for the slaughter still <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> school and he is not happy with their presence br br this film is not like most modern teen slashers we've seen it's much darker much more suspenseful no wise cracking murderer etc and i liked it for those reasons from a film making point of view it's not great the acting is below average the writing was pretty bad and quite full of clichés containing randomly tossed in references to american horror films some that didn't even make sense like have you seen scream 3 a girl asks yes i have and it had nothing to do with walking through the doors of an old school so it in no way relates to this film but hey it's a slasher flick those are part of the fun also the of characters was heavily <UNK> in this film there were six main characters not including the security guard and to be honest only three or four were really used two characters the token black guy and some other girl that wasn't important enough to get a label barely spoke between them i'd <UNK> about five or six lines total also the girls other than one weren't formed well enough to <UNK> them from one another they could've replaced each of the girls with one another repeatedly throughout the film and i wouldn't have noticed the difference the pacing however works well as the horror begins right from the start and rarely <UNK> the atmosphere is <UNK> well and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments although the overall appearance is a bit cheap looking due to what i assume is low grade camera equipment and operation the ending though i liked the idea they were going for was fairly poorly done it felt rushed and without explanation enough to make it effective with the amount of time they spent running around looking for nothing they could've spent a little bit more time on the conclusion to make sure it didn't feel like some random event thrown in for no good reason which is a flaw many modern horror films are <UNK> with however ignoring a few <UNK> issues and trying to focus on the first 98 of the film rather than the ending this is actually a rather good modern slasher that should be checked out especially if you're a fan of spanish and or atmospheric horror br br obligatory slasher elements br br violence gore there's a good bit of blood and gore realistically done but not <UNK> the violence is extremely well done not to excess but pretty brutal at points br br sex nudity little bit and with the <UNK> girl in the film br br cool killer well security guards are hardly considered <UNK> ' but this guy is pretty wicked his creepy smile was chilling br br scares suspense the suspense is top notch very tense very well done there are also some extremely creepy moments that <UNK> jump scares and the spooky atmosphere br br mystery none at all really br br awkward dance scene of course between a couple of guys and a half unwilling female in the flashback br br classic quote of the film <UNK> more <UNK> ' br br final verdict 7 10 this may be <UNK> it but fans of session 9 might want to check it out simply for the similar tone and atmosphere br br <UNK>
<START> bar <UNK> seems to be trying to be about the stereotypical bar tender and lay shrink serving up <UNK> of wisdom followed by example vignettes played out by the cast however this turkey is a <UNK> mess with a script full of simple minded cliched nonsense hard to follow <UNK> jerky flow unsatisfying and not worth the time d
<START> yes i give it a 10 because i compare it not only to others of it's kind but also to the dreck one is <UNK> with on a daily basis in what's laughably called today's popular culture that aside the film is beautifully cast as has been stated elsewhere and gives us a fairly good look at popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th centuries no small coincidence is that many of the plays that played in involved a similar plot boy meets girl someone objects usually the father or some authority figure boy struggles boy wins girl the was actually known at the time as a <UNK> act no coincidence too that john ford directed one he called it the quiet man and my wild irish rose is in itself a <UNK> act great stuff no anyway great songs great stuff enjoy br br ps after seeing the film i'd like to know more about bill i found an <UNK> that said he quit as a result of insanity replaced as in the film by <UNK> and died in an asylum several years later but he had been a very big star in his own right who wrote songs and plays and had plays written for him br br anyone know more
<START> i loved the blood and gore the kind of violence is what alien and predator movies are about which is no one is <UNK> this truly answers the question of how it would be like if aliens were on earth the answer to that is simple we are screwed the effects were beautiful how ever there are some real problems with it br br 1 the acting was horrible on the part of the human characters side witch almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring it was which really interrupted the flow of the movie and was very annoying the writers could have done <UNK> much better the good part was the alien and predator acting which i thought was done very well for the most part br br 2 the size of the predator ship was much smaller then how it was in the first movie this i <UNK> my head on br br 3 <UNK> having their mask on while still in the ship this upset people and i cant understand why its not a plot hole like most people make it to be so i say to you people calm the hell down its no big deal if it will make you feel better remember they did have face on bored in <UNK> so that could be a good reason why br br 4 predator firing its <UNK> <UNK> inside the ship i thought that was rather stupid on the <UNK> part but then i began to think if it was a younger predator that <UNK> br br 5 the hunter and his son almost instantly arriving at the crash site after it fell several miles away at least they didn't bore us by showing them run through the woods for 30 min so be happy about that br br 6 why did only one predator go i thought this was odd but then i thought that it was because he thought it was only one that he was dealing with and not an <UNK> br br 7 why didn't the <UNK> in the ship self <UNK> well if people were paying attention one did but he was killed before he could completely <UNK> it br br 8 the <UNK> blue melting goo i thought that was rather dumb br br 9 predator hiding evidence with the goo but <UNK> a cop that was also dumb br br 10 the black out well come on people an alien and did fight it out at a power station br br 11 being half face <UNK> queen this really <UNK> me off i am an alien and fanatic i know for a fact that aliens do not do that just like they don't give birth like a human does like they showed in out of all the comics games books and the movies 1 2 and 3 clearly shows their behavior they need a queen to lay eggs the eggs <UNK> into face face <UNK> host the <UNK> pops out and kills host and grows into a <UNK> if it <UNK> a human a with a predator and runner with any kind of four <UNK> animal and then after living for years upon years then they <UNK> into a a mini me queen that does not lay eggs i can go on and on but i wont but that scene alone nearly ruined the movie for me if the directors are smart they would go back and edit that by making a face <UNK> <UNK> the pregnant women br br any way if you are going to see this movie just go see it for the aliens and <UNK> and when the scene comes up where the <UNK> that pregnant women close your eyes so you don't have to see that insult to the alien and universe
<START> the <UNK> of <UNK> blues is the character rachel <UNK> crosby who runs a <UNK> and provides <UNK> support to a young boy <UNK> the narrator of the film based upon the experiences of writer actor <UNK> <UNK> hudson the film lovingly <UNK> the <UNK> new york <UNK> and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s br br the first half of the film is virtually non stop music the second half <UNK> more completely the various characters in the <UNK> <UNK> ability to take <UNK> and make them whole affects everyone within her <UNK> an especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband telling him firmly if you ever touch that child again we're going to dance as delivered by actress s that line is so <UNK> and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair trigger temper is frozen in his tracks br br from start to finish delivers a commanding presence her character <UNK> together the <UNK> lives of the borders in her home this was a touching heartfelt film with a wonderful cast as played by the character of <UNK> simply <UNK> love this is a film experience that i will remember for a long time to come
<START> if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot or corny acting then is definitely the one br br however if like me you like watching films that you can believe then has some serious flaws it doesn't offer anything new and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical <UNK> whilst not being quite as clunky br br after two <UNK> i'm thinking this has got to go somewhere else i mean how many big fires are there in one city surely <UNK> do other things such as getting cats out of trees well i was wrong and the <UNK> continues again and again up until the end br br a good aspect of the film is the fire itself well filmed and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste
<START> i just finished watching following and i thought it was great i rated it 8 out of 10 i plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in <UNK> order br br i rented this movie because of my fascination of christopher <UNK> more recent movie <UNK> following has some similarities this movie was probably the <UNK> for <UNK> even the music in some parts is very similar br br shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel the story and dialogue is really good the performance of the actors is believable br br christopher nolan made this movie on a really low budget i look forward to his next release insomnia a big budget movie with my favourite actor al pacino
<START> i have just started watching this show its airing in ireland at the moment on the irish television station at 12 <UNK> in the afternoon as of <UNK> july 2006 br br this program literally makes me laugh out <UNK> and i cannot <UNK> that on most apart from <UNK> 'the <UNK> with ricky <UNK> in it br br todays episode of 26 july 2006 was the one where carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes off to make some coffee and doug wants carrie to have no friends so he lifts up his top and shows off his hair ' and <UNK> <UNK> when he goes out to dinner but another funny episode was the other week when the old <UNK> carries dad won on the <UNK> and that episode me up with laughter especially when they went out and got a replacement <UNK> and carries father stood there looking at it and thought it was new br br so i don't know how much longer this has got to run on irish tv or at which stage year recorded we are at but i hope it don't end soon because i am really enjoying it br br to sum up there is some great writing some great characters and comedy acting namely by carrie doug and carries father some great <UNK> and delivered well a bit <UNK> and near the mark sometimes send the kids out the room but i think this us sitcom is a winner and very funny
<START> bill roy is the leader of a desert <UNK> cult who tries to <UNK> one of his people only to have a heart attack himself he ends up dying on an operating table and for the sake of revenge his spirit takes over the body of the title character jill <UNK> who then proceeds to go about <UNK> and <UNK> until her fellow <UNK> learn what needs to be done to <UNK> the demon br br while i know enough about the <UNK> filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock nurse <UNK> is really not all that bad sure it's clear that this was very low budget stuff yet all that i found cheesy about it were the visual effects the acting is not as bad as one might expect either br br there are two different versions available of this on dvd a much more sex oriented version featuring <UNK> amounts of t a is the original cut with such hilariously silly vignettes as the victim and and her love interest sharing their strangest sex moments including one involving <UNK> during a college lecture br br the movie would then be re cut for theatrical version with the horror elements <UNK> more strongly some scenes are dropped with new ones added with stevens the role played by j c wells expanded the <UNK> most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a and it works quite well this cut of the movie is more interesting overall i would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare them br br both versions hit their <UNK> in the final third and benefit from a <UNK> scene stealing performance from bill roy as the crazed and a moody climax set in a graveyard although actually filmed in backyard marilyn is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse who is attracted to football player turned patient marcus washington <UNK> who's lost his eyes in a car accident and who incidentally is key to <UNK> the story with his knowledge of voodoo <UNK> the movie also makes amusing use of music from composer harry personal collection including compositions for such tv series as <UNK> step <UNK> and 'the outer br br nurse <UNK> known by more alternate titles including beyond the living and hospital of terror than any other <UNK> movie is actually fairly entertaining low budget fare i ended up having a good time watching it br br 7 10
<START> spoiler br br in 1993 african american director actor mario van <UNK> followed up the tremendously popular urban action film new jack city with <UNK> the film was co written and directed by van <UNK> who also stars as the main character jessie lee br br plot the film begins at the turn of the 20th century when the united states was <UNK> in the spanish american war apparently a time when the u s justice system could send <UNK> into military service jessie lee finds himself an unwilling <UNK> man serving with an all black <UNK> <UNK> in cuba some of his <UNK> include little j stephen baldwin fast talking charles lane and the <UNK> but simple tiny <UNK> they find a hidden chest of gold on a <UNK> run and decide to keep it however the ambitious <UNK> colonel graham zane finds out about the gold and is apparently willing to kill jessie lee and company for it a shootout between the <UNK> forces and jessie lee's leaves the colonel blind in one eye and his forces <UNK> jessie lee's <UNK> crew manage to <UNK> themselves and the gold back to new orleans but it turns out that graham isn't far behind jessie lee and his allies are forced to go on the run heading west to a town called apparently was <UNK> by blacks in the years following the civil war jessie lee's father king david was the charismatic preacher who co <UNK> the town however as is revealed in <UNK> flashbacks king david was soon brutally murdered by a white mob in a parallel of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> terror <UNK> that began around the same time jessie lee and company eventually find their way to only to find that the <UNK> aren't exactly glad to see when sheriff bates richard jordan of a nearby white <UNK> makes it clear that he wants jessie lee and his or alive <UNK> blair <UNK> is the sheriff and de <UNK> mayor of his own agenda may not square with having jessie lee around br br analysis the action sequences are all very credible and mario van <UNK> turns in a good performance as the brooding hero in the aftermath of the success of new jack city it was almost expected van <UNK> would <UNK> a sequel or at least a similar urban action follow up instead van <UNK> looked 100 years into the past creating a mostly black western effectively the black themed westerns of the 1970's and continuing the legacy of largely forgotten black themed cowboy films from the early 20th century unlike new jack city the film was <UNK> <UNK> and originally released through <UNK> entertainment allegedly <UNK> at the major studios <UNK> when van <UNK> pitched to them some of the more curious casting at the time involved <UNK> big daddy kane and tone <UNK> as father time and angel respectively in certain interviews mario van <UNK> has said that he often likes to cast against type in the years since the trend of casting rap singers in non musical films would become almost <UNK> keen viewers will notice several cameos by various entertainment personalities black action film veterans like <UNK> hayes truck turner pam <UNK> <UNK> brown and larry cook the <UNK> who sat by the door show up as does stand up legend russell not to mention tv producer stephen j <UNK> who hired the junior van <UNK> to star in sonny <UNK> years earlier the film is <UNK> with woody <UNK> <UNK> in a key role
<START> one would think that a film based on the life of the japanese author <UNK> <UNK> would be a <UNK> if not impossible task however paul <UNK> has indeed made a film about <UNK> that is both superb complex while it is not a literal biography <UNK> his co screenwriter leonard his brother have taken several incidents from his life including his and crafted what can best be described as incidental <UNK> that are visually sparse and stunning homosexuality is almost not there due to legal <UNK> from his widow but in spite of this the film is still terrific and one of the best films i saw in 1985 i should also mention the important contribution of philip glass who did the score which adds an additional <UNK> to the film and is superior to the one he did for <UNK> also notable is john <UNK> fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by <UNK> who went on to do the memorable costumes for <UNK> dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar hopefully this film will soon be available on dvd
<START> i'm a huge fan of the spy genre and this is one of the best of these films the assignment is based on a true story which has been somewhat <UNK> for the big screen and it really takes you on a fun ride the film has a great cast starring <UNK> quinn donald sutherland and ben kingsley br br naval officer quinn is a reluctantly <UNK> by sutherland after a chance meeting with kingsley who believes quinn to be the famous terrorist carlos the because quinn so closely resembles carlos sutherland stops at nothing to <UNK> him because sutherland is obsessed with the <UNK> capture or death br br the training sequences are awesome quinn is really put to the test by kingsley and sutherland having to <UNK> attacks from remote controlled <UNK> from eating the same food each day to being drugged with a <UNK> he even has to learn how to make love to a woman the way carlos would br br the film has some great action scenes with quinn <UNK> allies because they believe he is carlos and in his final mission when he is to kill the throughout the film quinn must struggle with the new personality he has <UNK> versus his own will he remain as ruthless and free as carlos or will he once again return to his life of a good husband and father br br if you like the spy genre this is a must see the action is used only to <UNK> the story of this thriller forward no gratuitous explosions or fight scenes rating 10 of 10 stars
<START> i normally finish every movie or book i start even if they're poor just 'cause i hate giving up on them this was so poorly made i was in disbelief br br i'm not just looking for spielberg magic i rent foreign films and i rent really old sci <UNK> most recently soylent green worth the rent i like both hollywood action and slower moving character development different films need to be approached differently to be appreciated i could find no redeeming element to this one the action was so wooden i wasn't the least bit on edge the character development was virtually absent you're not left feeling sorry for anyone or even <UNK> with them finally there were so many pieces that just didn't add up br br don't waste your time better to watch paint dry
<START> interesting plot but painfully dull the script lacks lacks acting to me this film <UNK> with made for tv type movies i was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn i watched this film with my family it is fairly safe to watch with your kids only 1 semi sex scene if you wish to see a young meg ryan check out this movie very 80 ish you will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at christmas booze super <UNK> and <UNK> or maybe you are like me and have have a higher standard for acting in films however i did like the way the movie began and ended mark
<START> what a shame our first movie is so bad hi <UNK> what did you do in this movie it is awful and the director there is no story in this film i had sleep when i was watching this film it is a disappointment and the majority of the crew is not from <UNK> <UNK> supposed to be a comedy movie but it lacks the essential elements in comedy br br i know it first experience of cinema in <UNK> <UNK> but i expect better from <UNK> al hal the only positive in the movie is the presence of some talented actors who did not help much text to explode their talents finally to know your comment about this movie guys is it bad or what
<START> i've got to say that i'm not a massive fan of troma films granted i've only seen three of them or four including this one but two blood sucking freaks and <UNK> day are widely <UNK> to be the best which leads me to believe that all the others aren't worth seeing that would certainly seem to be the case with <UNK> day which is a troma take on the over popular eighties slasher while the film is never particularly bad given the type of film it's never particularly good either and by the end all i could think about was <UNK> did i bother watching this ' anyway the plot sees some girl die on a race track and shortly thereafter more people start dying naturally there are a few possible suspects but it's hard to really care about anything that happens of course in slasher terms it's the gore that is most important and given <UNK> track record where the red stuff is concerned i was expecting <UNK> of it there are some decent kill scenes and some of them are gory but it's never very shocking which really just makes this another dreary slasher based on a <UNK> event on the american <UNK> it's worth noting that there's a small role in this film for sleaze queen <UNK> <UNK> but the rest of the cast aren't worth mentioning the direction plot and its execution are all very mundane and i will say that unless you're a big troma fan or someone that wants to track down every slasher ever made don't bother with this film
<START> this film is a good companion to blair witch because it does so much wrong that <UNK> did right like <UNK> this one pretends to be a documentary of ghostly events with each member of the team <UNK> his her own camera br br the sense of reality is never there however the participants are poorly written clichéd characters and the events that take place are equally clichéd the cat jumping out of a closet falling <UNK> etc also the stilted dialog and inept <UNK> work by the overly attractive cast <UNK> from the <UNK> feel and worst of all the supposedly <UNK> held cameras record too many events too perfectly to be even remotely believable actually with some re editing this thing could have been a blair witch parody in fact there is a scene in which the blond <UNK> is eating a <UNK> with a huge roach on it that is actually pretty funny as is reminding me of a similar gross out scene from austin powers the spy who <UNK> me but in the end the event is played straight with no punchline it's hard to tell what the intent was with the st experiment other than to <UNK> a few stray <UNK> bucks but it's pretty sad when the only real interest i could find in it was whether the blond <UNK> was going to have her t shirt tied up off her belly in a particular shot or not
<START> i really enjoyed this movie i like prison movies in general i'm not sure why i'm sure some shrink could make something out of it i spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago and i knew then i would never go back i got the individual version of scared straight i did get locked up in an isolation cell on <UNK> for a couple of hours <UNK> of a park ranger but that's another story anyway the genre really interests me the soundtrack specifically sympathy for the devil by the rolling stones was the perfect backdrop for the film to this day i think of the <UNK> mile every time i hear the song
<START> a very interesting plot of the film based on the novel <UNK> into darkness of the writer <UNK> <UNK> it is a drama rather than a film noir which tries to send a message that love changes your own life i e your love to any person and the love you received from him her a wealthy man really changed his life for love while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her <UNK> played well as usual while a somewhat still young michel <UNK> played his eternal role of a detective or police agent frankly <UNK> was not so impressive in this film but less than that was the performance of catherine <UNK> she was not so convincingly in her role as a prostitute then lover wife of louis <UNK> for those who like to visit the world the film offers the occasion to see part of the <UNK> island and also <UNK> city in france
<START> i want very much to believe that the above quote specifically the english <UNK> translation which was actually written not spoken in a <UNK> letter a <UNK> sends to the protagonist was meant to be self <UNK> in a tongue in cheek manner but if so director <UNK> <UNK> apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude <UNK> actually takes himself seriously here or else has so much disdain for everyone especially the viewing audience that he can't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke br br some <UNK> are able to get away with making <UNK> bizarre films because they do so with <UNK> and unique personal style e g david lynch and <UNK> <UNK> others use a <UNK> approach while still <UNK> surreal elements into the fabric of the story e g <UNK> and david <UNK> later less bizarre works in x <UNK> throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then <UNK> him to find fault with it well here it is the pacing is <UNK> and choppy in particular continuity is often <UNK> with superfluous characters abound e g the gypsy mother and child most of the performances are overwrought the lighting is often poor particularly in the <UNK> discussed sex scene <UNK> scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason and the list goes on br br not to be completely negative it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions i liked the musical score even the <UNK> industrial <UNK> music being played in the <UNK> abandoned complex to which the main characters <UNK> in the second half of the film perhaps a reference to andy <UNK> of the '60s much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful an obvious attempt at contrast with the <UNK> city settings and even well into middle age <UNK> shows that she still has <UNK> her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn't sink into <UNK> br br there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as x more <UNK> <UNK> is admirable even when the experiment doesn't work but <UNK> tries nothing new here the film is a <UNK> of elements borrowed from countless earlier films and after several decades of movie viewing and literally thousands of films later i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal poorly crafted tripe at this early moment in the 21st century one is left asking with the exception of jean pierre <UNK> are there any directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore rating 3 10
<START> jack brooks <UNK> <UNK> is a college student with some severe anger issues his family was brutally murdered when he was a child by a monster and now he takes out his anger on everything and everyone br br so when his professor robert englund begins to show signs of he learns he has to control his rage and use it for good instead of evil and fight the creatures that have been haunting his nightmares ever since that <UNK> night br br truly earns its b rated rating but what was cool about it was that it didn't focus on crappy b rated cgi graphics in fact 0 of the film was cgi the monsters were actually <UNK> put together and although the storyline was lacking it was somewhat watchable if for only one time
<START> if it were possible to award a 10 this would be the one film i would choose br br i remember catching this film on tv many many years ago and fortunately being prepared enough to video it now my video copy is getting old video technology is outdated and i'm starting to worry that i may not be able to enjoy the <UNK> of this movie for much longer br br as a <UNK> film it is superb as a film about the relationship between man and nature it surpasses anything screened before or since how can the film industry allow such a classic to go <UNK> and forgotten if such a thing as a <UNK> pressure group exists to push for the re release of this film count me in and send me the details <UNK> br br my guess is there's a <UNK> to be made by anyone able to re release this in today's market
<START> jennifer novel was brought to the screen by canadian director adam brooks in a film that based on some comments from <UNK> to this forum sounds a bad <UNK> but in fact it's much better than one is led to believe br br this is a story about two sisters who loved one another <UNK> faith the fair headed and happy go lucky hippie girl takes her younger sibling <UNK> under her wing <UNK> <UNK> loves faith when the older one decides to follow her boyfriend wolf to europe on a summer vacation from <UNK> she promises she will send <UNK> a post card every day faith does that until the cards stop coming in and one night some time later the family receives a phone call to inform them faith has died under tragic circumstances br br <UNK> can't forget faith that is why after some years pass by she decides to take the same route the older sister took she takes the cards from faith and visits each place starting in <UNK> then moving on to paris and she wants to end up the trip in <UNK> where faith encountered her <UNK> death br br in paris <UNK> <UNK> up with wolf who by now is not a hippie anymore and is living with his girlfriend wolf tries to <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> her trip and to go back home she suspects that wolf holds the key into solving the mystery and as she is going to <UNK> for <UNK> she makes a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly <UNK> <UNK> version he has told <UNK> he feels guilty and against his <UNK> wishes decides to <UNK> <UNK> to the town where faith died the story changes at this point and we go back in flashbacks to what faith experienced in europe and what happened in her final days br br the best thing in the invisible circus are the performances of the principals something that mr brooks has to take the credit for the big surprise is the range of cameron diaz who as faith seems to <UNK> light comedy parts when she is quite able to do good dramatic work under the right director <UNK> <UNK> is seen as the older <UNK> and makes a wonderful contribution to the film she is a stunning beauty with what seems to be a <UNK> for acting christopher <UNK> is wolf and shows he also is capable of doing more serious drama the sweet <UNK> belle plays the younger <UNK> quite convincingly <UNK> <UNK> appears as the mother of the girls br br the european locations are <UNK> photographed by henry the film is also enhanced by the musical score of nick <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> original song elizabeth edited with great <UNK> ultimately this film shows adam brooks in great form as he gives the right tone to the adaptation of the novel and gets rewarded by having the right cast doing wonders for him
<START> if you are a pretentious person it would sound like a good idea to <UNK> about your <UNK> saying that you really like this movie br br otherwise don't bother and better watch something good br br this is the stereotypical movie for <UNK> the plot line would be very silly if you could see it from beginning to end it is just presented in a messed up way as an attempt to make it hard to understand and make the movie look intellectual br br <UNK> drive is not enjoyable to watch you would very rarely understand anything the first time you see it and if you do you would most likely be disappointed because it is not a big deal
<START> i can't believe that <UNK> washington and ice t were in this mess the plot and i use that term very loosely centers around an army of rats that <UNK> an urban apartment complex at least i think that's what it was about the script made no sense at all i couldn't have cared less about the characters and the camera work consisted of repeatedly showing shadow images of rats standing on their <UNK> legs or running running is what i should have done as an african american male i often read <UNK> from my brothers and sisters to support african american films i try to help out but enough is enough no one should watch garbage like this for any reason whatsoever please brothers and sisters don't produce any more direct to video rat <UNK> like this please
<START> ok last night i saw the world premiere of paul <UNK> the exorcist the beginning at the <UNK> international festival of fantasy films with all the <UNK> around the film it was highly anticipated br br the director was there and so were most of the stars except br br unfortunately the movie sucked big time it was a real disappointment for me because i'm a huge fan of both and <UNK> rip original 1973 film br br what was wrong with it most of it actually the fx you would think that the matrix and lotr digital revolution never happened it was so badly rendered the editing no real pace or rhythm the acting only at times could convince the script was a imo set up to explain the african scenes in the original film so the movie had the feel of a set up scene only it contributed nothing br br the only thing that i did like was <UNK> cinematography although i've seen better from him now br br all of the time i was thinking this was just a rough cut a work in progress and that given the well known circumstances is probably what it is but that doesn't change the obvious problems with the script br br i had the chance to meet <UNK> very briefly but i didn't have the guts to tell him what i thought of the film and i was so nervous this is the guy who wrote taxi driver for christ sake that i forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his taxi driver script
<START> <UNK> regular max von <UNK> and <UNK> starred as a village couple jan and eva <UNK> the story began with an ordinary couple who fights and make up jan was a sensitive person but an <UNK> who isolated himself from the world eva is a practical woman who is getting fed up with her husband's lack of ambition because jan <UNK> in <UNK> their radio the are oblivious of the impending war of course the war arrived and the movie was a fascinating study of their transformation of each other and to each other through the invasion as they were <UNK> by the enemy and by their own government br br there were no musical score to the movie but the soundtrack was the war noise in one scene the <UNK> background gun shot the explosion and sound of the fly by planes was incredible now and then bergman <UNK> into the facial expression as different event took places when something violent happened he <UNK> out to let the audience <UNK> the violence rather than seeing up close very well done movie
<START> i like errol flynn i like <UNK> and i like action movies this featured all three of these but i didn't like this film it just went on too long although the last 20 minutes was excellent especially in the photography with some great low angle shots however i seemed like it took six hour to get to that point and i really can't say why i feel this way br br the action is interesting errol flynn and olivia de <UNK> are fine in fact it was refreshing to see de <UNK> actually be supportive of flynn instead of her normal role as antagonist to him yet something is lacking in this movie br br the film has been <UNK> criticized for its historical <UNK> but i don't hear that same criticism for a lot of other films which have done the same in fact its rare when a film is historically accurate for some reason this <UNK> history offended most critics if the film had made general <UNK> a lot worse than he really was they would have probably liked it well too bad in their twisted way critics prefer villains to heroes br br i really wish i could have enjoyed this more but i'll take a lot of other flynn adventures over this one
<START> request you to not watch this movie it starts with a promise and as it goes on you <UNK> for the movie to end predictable not entertaining at all wasted movie save your time and watch better thrillers the synopsis sounds good and that is why i watched the movie but it was way too predictable with nothing to give you a start no great suspense no great direction nothing phenomenal with the acting shy away from this low rating nothing to write about this movie so i am filling up the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much a time <UNK> this movie is really irritated at how good a premise that was and how bad a screenplay was written out of it
<START> this is a comedy version of strangers on a train it works pretty well i am a harsh <UNK> so the 3 rating reflects mostly on the characters and plot the performances are extremely good all of them of course the two stars <UNK> and crystal shine most each performer acts well enough to play off of the comedy works in a level just short of slapstick <UNK> characters work best when <UNK> his character portrayed as a writing hack would probably be more real if he was published and <UNK> as much as most <UNK> are his character would in real life have a great agent and multiple the characters are one dimensional which is okay in comedy but character is not written very well his desire to kill the all of a sudden makes no sense at all it looks like a pitiful attempt at humor the pitiful attempts are not too often and the movie flows fairly well
<START> br br when this film was released i <UNK> as being lightweight pop nonsense that was a mistake br br after repeated viewings and seeing a documentary of the making of dirty dancing discovering the depth of this film certainly <UNK> its appeal br br dirty dancing is a film about change the <UNK> nature of relationships within the family the changes in one's view of the world during their coming of age etc the story takes place during august of 1963 the final weeks of the last summer of innocence for the american people the many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in american society that would be marked by the kennedy <UNK> and vietnam br br female movie <UNK> this film and repeated <UNK> to the movie houses made it the world's most successful dance movie as a male i find the romantic pairing of ultimate stud patrick <UNK> with very plain jennifer grey very hard to accept this would be fatal for most romantic dramas and it also may have create the intense dislike expressed by most male reviewers br br the film's soundtrack found 1 status before the release of the movie to this day it is nearly impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a dirty dancing song br br near the <UNK> of the film <UNK> mother wakes up and asks <UNK> father is anything wrong br br <UNK> father the anti change family member attempts to keep all that is happening a secret he tells his wife to go back to sleep however resist as one can change is dirty dancing is the story of one person waking up just at the final moments of our country's last sleep in innocence
<START> i decided to watch this movie because i'd not seen carol lombard before in any movie i'm sorry it had to be this one because quite frankly this is a dog  and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn both of whom were great actors br br the problem with the film is simple it tries to put too much too quickly in to a story about a young lawyer john <UNK> played by stewart who marries jane played by lombard within an hour of meeting her what's that cliché marry in <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> br br in short the story is a series of episodes that show the <UNK> financial status their troubles with john's live in mother their struggles to pay the bills john's <UNK> status at the office the arrival of their baby son john <UNK> unexpected and causing additional <UNK> at home with mother the <UNK> angst about their marriage the <UNK> sickness which <UNK> thus <UNK> an heroic flight by a lone pilot in a fierce storm to bring a special serum to save the child and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm br br how many more clichéd situations could the writers include maybe mother dying soon after there wasn't much comedy the drama was <UNK> at best the dialog was painful to hear only the acting of the four main players was adequate br br this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long <UNK>  during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie br br so it made sense for <UNK> to <UNK> good ol' home <UNK> american values of family relationships <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK>  all against the backdrop of the average american family who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard br br and it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939 so it was planned in 1938  soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii hence this sort of film was a great <UNK> for the general public at that time many of who would soon have to join england in war as many here would know hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before during and after the war br br however i'm glad i saw it  as a piece of disguised <UNK> political propaganda but i'll have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range br br as another reviewer noted see this one just to say that you've seen all of stewart's movies otherwise don't bother
<START> one of my co workers recommended this one <UNK> that it was one of the most frightening movies she ever watched i checked it out together with my girlfriend and we gave up after 50 minutes or so br br yesterday i had a long talk with my co worker we're still friends br br this movie is as original as the latest film starring steven seagal it brings absolutely nothing original to the table the spooky parts have been done thousand of times before br br the biggest fault however is the painfully slow pace of this movie the periods between the scares are completely wasted with meaningless dialog and a lot of nothing br br 1 of 10 <UNK> <UNK>
<START> jackass number two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006 beating the also hilarious <UNK> ii it is one of the best sequels in recent memory beating jackass the movie in every way now this film may be the funniest but it is also the most offensive appalling and utterly disgusting you will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film i'm completely serious when i say don't eat anything before watching or during this film because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you keep the drinking to a minimum as well you've been warned because just like the <UNK> says it will make you beg for mercy br br jackass number two follows the crazy men from the hit show jackass johnny <UNK> <UNK> ryan <UNK> steve o chris <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> preston <UNK> dave england brandon and jason man' chris is absent as they perform the most outrageous life threatening and revolting stunts imaginable i'm not going to tell what the stunts are but i will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening and that one cast member once again not telling will <UNK> with death several times in the film br br what makes jackass number two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves but how the cast <UNK> to them and to doing them to put it simple if they loved doing it and had a blast you will too this goes for 99 of the stunts all the stunts are very original and 90 of them are never before seen you will witness a few recycled ones but they're <UNK> up you wouldn't think directing really factors into a movie like this but it does jeff <UNK> direction makes the movie so much funnier because he provides <UNK> for the gang in their comedic timing which is simply brilliant on his part he could have just sat back and slept throughout filming actually you'll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could i give mr <UNK> two thumbs up for that another great thing about jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos and this time they include <UNK> legend <UNK> hoffman <UNK> god tony <UNK> director actor jay <UNK> super troopers actor luke wilson miami <UNK> star jason taylor and director actor mike judge office space the scenes with hoffman taylor and <UNK> are among the funniest in the film as it's even funnier to see these men as a part of the film br br jackass number two is one of the most politically incorrect morally <UNK> and just plain wrong movies of all time if not the most despite this it is so original and so hilarious that you won't care about that you'll be <UNK> for air laughing so hard you'll be crying and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film no one under 18 should watch this film you've been warned i hope you enjoy jackass number two as much as i did br br 10 10 spy
<START> the year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns 'the by henry king and by john ford 'the was historically notable as it clearly influenced <UNK> 1951 and later <UNK> westerns br br however i personally find superior to it's contemporary counterpart ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling it should be conceived more as a poem describing <UNK> of old west although optimistic and warm at heart we are deserved from <UNK> because it's completely free from pretentious <UNK> frontier scenery is well used as it supports the poetic narrative perfectly add <UNK> camera work and we are transported among the mormon <UNK> to witness western <UNK> told in cinematic means
<START> imagine what it must have been like for john <UNK> one of hollywood's handsome leading men married to shirley temple for five years he finds himself doing movies like this i remember him in <UNK> where he wasn't half bad unfortunately there is nothing to recommend this film the monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent the police are boring the teenagers are boring the plot is stupid people run around there are events that do nothing to advance the plot there's dancing that goes on and on and then there is no attack there is some idiotic love triangle that no one could care the least about it isn't even campy or outrageous it's just no worth anything <UNK> might as well have been a post he's given nothing to do
<START> don't listen to most of these people ill give you a better review of this movie which me and my friend love its about jill johnson played by <UNK> belle who <UNK> at the house and someone breaks in if you're wondering how he got in the house he went through the garage most likely so anyway don't listen to the worst acting it has amazing acting with a great story i think that there are 2 benefits that jill has 1 <UNK> a fast runner and is on the track team 2 she got out alive lol br br it is a cool movie and quite scary check it out you will be happy with this masterpiece don't listen to the other people on the site its very good trust me i am good at reviewing movies i'm a future movie critic i totally want to buy this movie and you will too when you see it it is amazingly awesome
<START> i have reasons to love the great users of a camera fluid direction of action lends itself to fast paced adventure and comedy narrative but such a skill in the hands of a king <UNK> or an anthony mann can also be applied to idea level work this is paul masterpiece its storyline can be in a single pair of sentences general hector is setting up as near emperor in northern mexico and steals a huge cannon from general <UNK> he sends his crack mission unit divided <UNK> but determined led by george <UNK> to get the cannon back and bring back alive to put an end to the rebellion charismatic <UNK> plays the ladies in the piece are giovanna <UNK> and <UNK> york with the squad even further comprised of <UNK> peter and don gordon other <UNK> in the class include john and john russell also in on an already fantastically dangerous operation are miss <UNK> and a stubborn mexican whose <UNK> was betrayed when set up on his own the danger is <UNK> when <UNK> brother as advance spy is captured and tortured to death while he has to watch and he decides he needs to kill <UNK> the attack that captures the cannon when orders are not by a regular army type is one of the most <UNK> visual and staging achievements in cinematic history the <UNK> of <UNK> the revelations <UNK> there and the actions that win the mission team a chance at victory or almost victory are <UNK> presented this is a beautiful color adventure film with unusually strong costumes acting lighting art direction sets and music by elmer <UNK> the script by stephen is probably his best ever for a feature film this is probably the most underrated major western at the moment but i have always appreciated its heroes as result getting hard workers but as <UNK> reminds his group on the way home the trouble with being a hero is the morning after to find out why he says so you will have to see cannon for
<START> the rap the book this movie was <UNK> on was one of the most difficult books i've ever read yet i could not put it down raunchy crude foul <UNK> you name it it had it it also had some of the best characterizations of any novel i've ever read br br well as for the flick it was <UNK> i mean tim mcintire as was the <UNK> <UNK> talking <UNK> mcintire as is like casting tim <UNK> as charles <UNK> br br what happened to the main character in the book little he doesn't even exist in the movie fast walking was not the main dude in the book why even name credit this thing with the rap none of the spirit atmosphere <UNK> or drama of the book was captured in this movie br br for me it was not only a disappointment but a total waste of time and celluloid
<START> this is one of <UNK> best performances the entire cast is outstanding as is martin <UNK> understated direction the anger angst and of urban labor battles is <UNK> told in a fashion that is neither <UNK> nor <UNK> in a way it is dated with its era but in many ways it is <UNK> timeless
<START> i recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase i'm going through i was born in 1980 and so film from mid 80s to mid 90s has quite an important place in my growing up br br this particular movie was one of my favourites and so i was thrilled when it became available in the uk it hasn't become worse with time it is still a great fun film with plenty of excitement in its own way sure it <UNK> in the shadow of bigger larger budget films but don't let that stop you enjoying this br br worth a rent or even a purchase at the <UNK> <UNK> you'll find it for
<START> big fat liar in my opinion is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it when jason frankie malcolm in the middle and amanda <UNK> all that played those tricks on marty paul <UNK> doctor <UNK> i really <UNK> and felt good that's what i liked most about this movie as a matter of fact everything that happened after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ended up in <UNK> hands was hilarious i especially loved <UNK> cameo when i first saw him i couldn't be certain but when i asked my mother if it was him she said of course before i wrap this up i'd like to say like i said earlier there is a moral to this story and that moral is always tell the truth now in conclusion if you are a fan of frankie amanda <UNK> or paul <UNK> i highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it
<START> jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of sydney australia following the desperate attempt of <UNK> year old jimmy heath ledger who <UNK> a job for a local gangster and needs to make <UNK> before they get to him the gangsters led by bryan brown are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them that's what makes the film work because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly but this mob <UNK> your funny bone as well a clever structured script by jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot
<START> the first time i saw this movie i just thought what the hell a 10 year old kid driving around bizarre places meeting bizarre people going after a game called hell yeah i enjoyed this movie a lot br br jordan christopher michael is a brilliant young actor it's a shame he stopped act he <UNK> very well his character gus on the movie br br gus loses an eye got <UNK> and go at the most weird cities acting with flea drew barrymore and meat <UNK> want more br br ok don't even try to understand the story but why this movie needs one just open your mind and let gus drive you into this journey br br gus you won
<START> this has to be my favourite film the script is sharp and played to the limit by an excellent miller and fantastic <UNK> sharp wit excellent narrative and no hollywood <UNK> a totally film which has you <UNK> for the bad guys excels again as the <UNK> chance while <UNK> tyler truly beats her other lighter performances as the excitement hungry rebecca the soundtrack may not be known to you by name but anyone who has ever seen top gear watched the football or seen any tv action sequence is probably familiar with it particularly due to craig <UNK> <UNK> which must allow him never to work again the soundtrack on first play may seem out of place in a costume drama action comedy but one re watching shows it is perfectly at home in giving the the script it's drama br br my one <UNK> about this film is that it isn't shown enough on tv where is it truly excellent sharp and classy you'll not regret watching it again and again <UNK> to switch on dvd player
<START> i was truly looking forward to this title it sounded and looked fun the idea of someone making a cheesy 50s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs but instead this title only <UNK> first off there is almost no in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment i have to sit through 75 minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the <UNK> a bare <UNK> chick why on top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot i mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads i wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp i wanted to see some <UNK> dragged off to his <UNK> in desperate need of rescue creature from the black <UNK> stuff i wanted to see a few goofy action scenes of the going on a killing spree or it maybe escaping a silly trap something exciting <UNK> have fun with it be creative who wants to sit through endless and <UNK> dialog scenes in a creature flick my advice to the filmmakers keep going your concepts are good but your execution needs to be a lot more inspired have some fun with the creature put the humor in the action and most important put more creature in a creature movie
<START> i loved the first grudge i watched it in an empty theater and in all honesty i was freaked out never before had i heard the unique audio of chilling sounds it truly was gripping br br the grudge 2 however had a couple of good jumps but the story line was real messy and not entirely believable and all over the place with a couple of scenes like a female <UNK> herself out of fear or another one of a young woman drinking a <UNK> of milk then <UNK> it all up again which really made no sense and did not help to enhance the creep factor of the film during these scenes and a couple of others people in the sold out audience actually laughed out loud that was a good <UNK> to show how this film lacked the thrills chills or creeps the acting was decent the emotions portrayed were believable so hats off to the actors but the <UNK> storyline and its lack of direction was something i couldn't shake throughout the entire movie i was annoyed more than anything same old grudge <UNK> noises a couple of quick unexpected scenes to make me jump but overall i was very disappointed
<START> a political satire of a comedian williams who after <UNK> the political <UNK> and <UNK> is forced into the running but shockingly we wins and makes a mockery of the office man of the year is not the funniest movie nor the best but in small doses it does work williams again <UNK> with <UNK> after a hit with good morning vietnam the two seem to have a great chemistry and work off each other i am not comparing them to scorsese and deniro but you can get the picture although i wouldn't quite say to rush out there and see the movie in theaters i would recommend renting it this movie is a comedy but also has a great satire please if you like movies like scary movie 4 this is not for you take your brain with you to see it
<START> comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with mike <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and more recently steve carell in the big screen version of the hit <UNK> show <UNK> smart ' br br back in 1974 it was david jason who was wearing a shoulder <UNK> and carrying an case full of documents marked <UNK> br br 'the top secret life of edgar <UNK> was his first starring role in a sitcom after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as <UNK> dates with the <UNK> series and at br br <UNK> <UNK> had found him working in a <UNK> theatre in and was <UNK> impressed to include him alongside michael <UNK> terry jones and eric <UNK> in the children's comedy show <UNK> not <UNK> your set ' br br <UNK> t s l o e <UNK> cast jason as <UNK> a well meaning but incompetent agent for the secret intelligence service whereas john <UNK> wore a <UNK> hat <UNK> had a whereas <UNK> solo carried a radio pen <UNK> owned a <UNK> objects fell to bits in his hands he read <UNK> documents in bed while his wife barbara <UNK> <UNK> woman's own on one occasion it would be the other way round when he <UNK> a pair of russian agents to a he accidentally switched on the system and broadcast his plans to capture them when he <UNK> on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an s i s man and his enemy contact it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to <UNK> when he tried to <UNK> the <UNK> of a female russian scientist he took a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> his <UNK> only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park yet like he always seemed to come out on top at the end much to the <UNK> of his colleagues br br as previously mentioned he was married his wife jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their high rise flat secret service this secret service that you never stop thinking about the secret service he <UNK> back think of the <UNK> they're not supposed to know i'm in the secret service br br <UNK> was part of a team of agents whose number included <UNK> villain mark <UNK> he was the psychotic alan <UNK> as michael <UNK> as and <UNK> at <UNK> as the lovely <UNK> they answered to 'the played by the late <UNK> coleman the commander was kidnapped in one episode leaving <UNK> <UNK> in charge of the s i s which naturally horrified everyone br br this hilarious show was by richard and bernard <UNK> who had written for the <UNK> series rather than spoof bond it was more of a send up of the serious spy shows such as though it had a bond style theme tune <UNK> <UNK> in underground car parks code breaking stolen missile plans that kind of thing jason brought a lot of energy to the role doing a lot of his own stunts such as <UNK> falling off a ladder whilst <UNK> his flat and <UNK> down a hill in a <UNK> bin and were reminiscent of those to be found in the <UNK> films br br had all the ingredients to be a smash hit unfortunately it was not <UNK> in the london area it was put out on <UNK> at 7 25 p m where it was <UNK> in the ratings by the b b c 's <UNK> drama 'the <UNK> it was then moved to <UNK> at 7 p m because i t v wanted to showcase its latest american <UNK> the t v version of <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> never found an audience a similar fate <UNK> <UNK> next major show <UNK> <UNK> it was not until 1977 and 'a sharp <UNK> of that he found his first successful solo vehicle br br you can see the title sequence along with two brief <UNK> in german for this series on youtube unfortunately that is all you can see jason will not <UNK> his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on d v d a great shame for the moment however edgar <UNK> life will have to remain top secret br br <UNK> i have seen a number of episodes recently and i'm pleased to say it stands up incredibly well
<START> look we rated this a 10 on entertainment value it's a comedy sure not an epic like lord of the rings or gone with the wind still for comedy particularly these days it's a 10 br br not a long movie moves quickly and easily <UNK> <UNK> right at home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a <UNK> sub <UNK> against the us nuclear navy in a war game designed to see if terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our <UNK> kinda ironic this plot pre <UNK> don't take this topic seriously cause it's mostly laughs from start to finish br br rob schneider is 2nd in command like frank burns and pulls many laughs all the others are perfect for their parts as well rip torn and bruce dern br br look plain and simple you got 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and you're not a <UNK> their is some language and innuendo then rent it or buy it we did and enjoy i wish they would make a part 2
<START> what can i say this was hands down the worst movie i have ever seen in my life and believe me some of my favorite movies are admittedly horrible the acting was amateurish the sets were boring and the <UNK> was shoddy and <UNK> this whole movie seemed like a college final project i had to keep convincing myself that it was done by a teenager to make it seem somewhat good the most disturbing factor of the film is that it's not even film at all it 's shot on video that was extremely distracting on top of all that the dialogue is simply disastrous and the plot line is so basic it makes my eyes water not to mention they steal from at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes or so if there were such a thing as zero stars this movie would get it br br the only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is
<START> the jazz soundtrack makes this seem like a clint eastwood movie br br in fact the whole thing strikes me as burt doing clint the story is good and the movie is full of one liners that i carry with me to this day reynolds to bad guy i'm gonna pull the chain on you pal because you're <UNK> up my town and you wanna know the worst part you're from outta state br br highlights the reel to reel is nice set dressing for br br charles <UNK> coming <UNK> while listening to tapes of prostitutes having sort of phone sex you'd have to see it trust me it's hilarious br br brian keith plays against type as a tough guy and does it well br br <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> br br rachel ward wow <UNK> she go br br doc and the tonight show band play their <UNK> off as usual joe <UNK> guests on <UNK> manhattan transfer re recorded route <UNK> the soundtrack lends class to the whole affair br br need i say more it might be <UNK> best film ever br br yeah he plays himself as usual but it works br br enjoy
<START> the premise is interesting and the cast does the best it can but the script and the directorial effort are so poor that it is not surprising that this film was buried which is fitting given the screenplay as i watched this i could not decide which was worse the screenplay or the directing the actors are over the top the art direction looks like a disney movie the music is contrived and the sentiment so sweet that it gives viewers <UNK> it's a bad attempt to imitate four <UNK> and a funeral if one wants to watch comedy that is as flat as a <UNK> and how poor direction can turn a story into <UNK> <UNK> this is a good one to watch
<START> sorry but i usually love french thrillers e g <UNK> but this was a glossy <UNK> mess the fact that it was based on a <UNK> cohen book is telling because rather than being a french film strong on psychology and character it's more like a john <UNK> esquire roller coaster ride by numbers with ludicrous plot twists flashbacks that update previous flashbacks a predictable villain as soon as his name is mentioned you think <UNK> he'll be the bad guy ' and sets of mysterious stereotyped characters who seem to inhabit different movies by the end i was laughing hysterically at the <UNK> of the film's tone the scenes where the lead character is being helped by two <UNK> shady characters are unintentionally hilarious the utterly <UNK> plot the absurd <UNK> and <UNK> of good fortune e g guessing the <UNK> for an email account and <UNK> <UNK> thought i must have the <UNK> <UNK> running time as it seemed to drag on for 3 hours 50 minutes
<START> i usually give horror films around 6 10 but this one caught my eye house of wax was by far the best horror film i have seen even better than the <UNK> horror br br paris hilton was quite good in this and i must say has a good future ahead her death scene was probably the coolest i'll just say how she dies br br she gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close ups on and everything gory eh brian van holt was very good as both the killers bo and vincent vincent had the long hair usually he plays a mean cop or soldier but he did very well in this br br <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> michael murray also acted very well as <UNK> and nick jones nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie then <UNK> stole it back by enduring a lot of pain in the second half like getting the finger <UNK> off ripping her lips apart after they got glued together and getting a straight forward punch in the face by bo br br overall i give this movie an 8 10 fans of horror films must see this
<START> director and fx man john carl doesn't have to do much in order to <UNK> me the sight of his name in the credits alone is enough to strike fear into my heart br br his <UNK> straight to video <UNK> in the 80s sat on the bottom shelf of the horror section at my local rental shop twenty years later and his dvds <UNK> the same space it seems that the more things change the more they stay the same you can rely on old to serve up dreck whatever the format and regardless of advances in movie making technology br br in this <UNK> offering a bunch of friends travel to a remote town where they discover the secret treasure <UNK> of stone aka the forty evil claim jumping <UNK> <UNK> who caused havoc in the mid <UNK> before his death cursed anyone who should find his gold and it's not long before the pick axe wielding killer is back <UNK> off the hapless treasure <UNK> br br with its dreadful script unimpressive make up effects and scooby doo style villain 'the curse of the forty is par for the course for only genre <UNK> <UNK> black richard lynch and john phillip law lend this movie any credibility whatsoever with the rest of the cast giving performances ranging from bad to awful although i'll forgive alexandra ford who is a complete <UNK> br br even fans of bad schlock horror will be disappointed since most of the women keep their clothes on and a lot of the deaths occur off screen which is probably not such a bad thing since the on screen deaths are pathetic br br 'the curse of the forty is another in a long list of <UNK> for john carl
<START> like the other comments says this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> kusturica but have you already seen <UNK> there is nothing new it this film i thought <UNK> was great when it came out but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest i don't think it's a worse film than <UNK> but it's a bore to see it now like it probably would be to watch <UNK> again there is really no point to the film nothing that really matter or stays with you there may be a distant similarity to the films of kusturica but he's really in a different league so you should rather go see his films than waste your time on
<START> how i deserved to watch this crap worst ever the acting was awful when i read that this was a comedy i expected at least to smile once or twice but if you are to loose hour and a half of your lives this is the right movie i recommend just look in a wall or something anything else but watch this film can even watch a documentary if you are a guy about pregnant women i guarantee it will be more entertaining the actor in this one i forgot his name is not that bad and i am surprised how hi accepted the role anyway i want someone to eat cheese with is the right film if you want to <UNK> someone
<START> this movie is not so good as i thought it would be there is no story whatsoever no characters and some dialog would have been nice the gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top it starts with an <UNK> on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts the music is a classic score and fits the movie very well they should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the <UNK> table and some more info about the would have made this movie far scarier than it is don't expect a scary movie but a nice gory special effects reel
<START> a pretty transparent attempt to <UNK> cash out of the <UNK> british club scene <UNK> is a film that shows promise in certain <UNK> but does very little else a <UNK> thriller plot which is there merely to string the club sequences together <UNK> acting and a pretty ludicrous script all stop <UNK> from being the showcase that director obviously intended br br however although is sometimes over indulgent especially when using the often ill fitting dance music he does show potential and the lack of an anti drugs message is enormously refreshing overall however the film is a wasted opportunity and the <UNK> for a great <UNK> movie remain out there somewhere watchable nevertheless
<START> <UNK> on to the imdb to say what a charming film love love is and am totally confused seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up plastic demon baby what this wasn't love life a little bit <UNK> for my tastes but a great funny and original film especially liked the ending that didn't fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it nine out of ten
<START> i really like the show as a part of greek life i can say that some things are over exaggerated but overall it's still pretty damn funny br br rusty is a likable lead character his roommate is hilarious and the entire cast is entertaining in their own rights i like that it focuses on individual situations as well as <UNK> relations with the <UNK> br br this show covers it all and they do it without <UNK> or anything else that bad how else could it be on abc family br br my favorites are of course roommate and pretty much all of <UNK> <UNK> this show is a great launch pad for them and i'm excited to see what doors this opens br br please <UNK> this show next summer abc family like i said love love love it
<START> the biggest problem that the tv program key west faced was that it was advertised wrong if you saw the ads you would think it was a <UNK> how and be sorely disappointed it was a vastly more complex show than that br br i happened to be in key west just before <UNK> andrew hit and i think i actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in <UNK> <UNK> of course that was before the show hit i did see the that was in the opening go by a few times and with the guy who you see <UNK> up in the opening too he was a real local yes i'd love to see this on dvd
<START> gold <UNK> 1951 br br a dull western comedy feature with the three stooges including <UNK> howard at this point who i've always enjoyed as the third <UNK> doing their usual <UNK> and directed by the normally <UNK> edward <UNK> who also did some of their funniest classic shorts so one has to wonder just what went wrong this time the most <UNK> answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15 minute two <UNK> comes up as too much for a <UNK> minute feature film unlike so many of their classic short subjects gold <UNK> is not worth <UNK> br br 1 2 of
<START> in this desperate and thoroughly silly attempt to keep <UNK> dracula franchise alive despite having lost most of its power long time already our legendary vampire is brought back to life in the swinging london of 1972 exactly hundred years after he was destroyed by his <UNK> van <UNK> an occult <UNK> named johnny <UNK> get it get it <UNK> his flamboyant friends in an abandoned church among them van <UNK> great <UNK> jessica and performs a satanic ritual that <UNK> dracula in a <UNK> of smoke <UNK> only mission is to <UNK> havoc upon the entire van <UNK> <UNK> and fragile jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this this is probably the only 70's film that goes immensely over the top in trying to look 70's film considering the previous six dracula films were all set in the victorian era director alan gibson really wants to stress the fact we're in the 20th century now and thus he <UNK> his film with <UNK> hippie characters hideous 70's fashion <UNK> and awful 70's music christopher lee and peter cushing seem hopelessly lost in this setting and their performances <UNK> show it the opening sequence a flashback and the showdown climax are fairly enjoyable but everything in between is painfully boring and the complete opposite of scary the greatest elements in this series of films have always been <UNK> dark <UNK> and the <UNK> coach races and obviously this installment lacks all of that luckily for the fans hammer studios contemporary released other films revolving on vampires that are much better the vampire lovers twins of evil the legend of the seven golden vampires  not recommended
<START> i have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of <UNK> masterpiece i was lucky enough to meet martin sheen outside the santa monica <UNK> <UNK> one night in 1981 as he waited for charlie and <UNK> to leave a concert he was very humble about the praise i shared with him for this work of art especially his portrayal of the young captain this is without a doubt a must see a complete 10 and an important part of american film history charlie don't surf robert <UNK> famous line the other one does not need repeating as it has become an <UNK> repeated <UNK> and his character will long be remembered as a classic american war <UNK> in the john wayne tradition it is a surprise to see how young laurence fishburne looks
<START> evil behind you was created for a specific purpose in mind to <UNK> the writer directors personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil sadly it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took it's power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewer the way its message is presented almost reminds me of the stories i've heard of the spanish <UNK> from one real christian to another avoid this like the plague fear tactics never work when trying to send this kind of message br br the acting was horrible the selection of muslim terrorists was racist and unfair they're terrorists so they must be muslims the premise of this was good the story provided a great <UNK> for its message however it was the execution of these ideas that fell short making it very difficult to even separate the message from the <UNK> so to speak br br you'd be better off <UNK> off your old ghost dvd with mr <UNK> to better receive this message at least that movie didn't try to <UNK> itself down your throat or if you like good christian movies with a powerful message try end of the <UNK>
<START> the three stooges are arguably the greatest comedy team in film history for that reason alone they deserved a much better ending at columbia than they received with this short br br sappy <UNK> is just not good granted this is not all joe fault i personally feel that some of his shorts are fun enough simply because of the departure from the stooges usual <UNK> that they contain and for the fact that larry is sometimes <UNK> more however this short just will not do and the fact that one knows that it is their last short that was ever shown well that just adds to the overall disgust br br this film just <UNK> how short subjects were on their last dying <UNK> during this time and how little effort went into making them this short is so sloppy it is a simple re make of a curly short what's the <UNK> filmed years before as if this fact wasn't bad enough the studio actually threw in footage of moe and larry from the original which was filmed nearly 20 years prior are these things not obvious laughable or sad you be the judge br br another part of this short that makes it miserable is the fact that it is basically a joe <UNK> showcase with him showing that all he is at least in this film is a curly wanna be gone completely wrong moe and larry have little to do in this short as a larry fan i also must say that i feel it a bit <UNK> to have <UNK> get to use the joke that larry originally <UNK> in the short ants in the <UNK> to see <UNK> say i can't see i can't see and have larry say the simple why can't you see while <UNK> gets to <UNK> i got my eyes closed is just wrong on all levels br br the two brave soldiers who stuck it out for all those years howard and fine have so little to do in this short there are hardly any funny bits with them the only thing that qualifies is larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband attempting to be <UNK> his dog br br one can't blame the dynamic duo larry and moe give it their all no matter how ridiculous things could get and i'm sure they had their opinions by this point in their careers howard and fine never gave anything less than their best their efforts do not pale from 1934 1959 br br i often enjoy many shorts that some will dismiss as horrible i'm all for their more experimental unusual shorts at least those contain new ideas however this short i think everyone can agree is just not good br br thank goodness tv later discovered the boys after the shorts department closed had they been forced to go out in this fashion well that would have been a gross injustice to all the years they invested in making audiences laugh
<START> spoilers the killer in the movie doesn't wait a second as we see him <UNK> into a girls shower and <UNK> her to death taking her severed and <UNK> arm as he makes his <UNK> we then get this official looking prologue as if were watching a true story stating that a number of gruesome murders were committed in the late fall of 1985 in a small mid western <UNK> br br <UNK> looking and hearing <UNK> sheriff ron is <UNK> by this murder and later when the murders of local <UNK> students all women continues his run for state senator is in <UNK> with him bumbling the investigation at every turn there's at least two times when says that they'll never be another murder as long as he's on the case and within minutes another murder happens br br finding a golden <UNK> at the scene of each murder the <UNK> daughter the <UNK> <UNK> tina finds this reference book about <UNK> that the <UNK> is a symbol of a witches cult that <UNK> in the early <UNK> just after the <UNK> witch trials this cult was out to avenge the 19 accused witches hung by the local <UNK> back in <UNK> and they went out at night killing men and women of authority and taking off with a body part when the body parts would form a complete person they would be burned in an occult midnight <UNK> ritual br br you never get a handle to what's exactly happening in the movie blood cult not just because it's totally disjointed story but it's ever more outrageous and <UNK> school level <UNK> especially by charles <UNK> playing the sheriff ron getting himself into more trouble then even the on the loose killer could have gotten him into the bumbling sheriff ends up with his head <UNK> coffee <UNK> as well as almost burned alive after being <UNK> the only reason he wasn't is because he seemed to have <UNK> it all up while under the influence of some strong and <UNK> drug br br there's a weird dream sequence in the movie suggesting that a number of highly respected members of the community are members of the witches cult that's responsible for the <UNK> murders the movie doesn't bother to explain at all if the dream that the drugged sheriff had was a dream or actually a real experience on his part by dropping the whole thing as if it were cut out of the movie br br getting out of the hospital and <UNK> out the <UNK> <UNK> house while <UNK> down a bag full of <UNK> <UNK> sheriff finally comes face to face with the killer find out to his shock and <UNK> that not only does he know who he or she is but he's also willing to let the killer escape br br the very first straight to video motion picture and it shows not only would no one it their right mind be crazy enough to pay admission at least with the video you can tape over it thank god to see this disaster but no movie house owner would dare play it on their screen without the danger of the <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> show of righteous <UNK> tear the place apart
<START> this is <UNK> a dvd rental movie i'm a big fan of the cast members but the storyline never really grabbed me don't expect oh brother where art <UNK> in any way shape or form funniest part in my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens over in the seems like they were trying to copy some of <UNK> funny facial expressions from oh brother where art <UNK> but you could kind of tell they were trying for that john was the bright spot and was solid throughout <UNK> <UNK> plays the part of a <UNK> reporter willing to do whatever for the story overall it's a movie worth watching at home
<START> this is a cute film starring <UNK> and <UNK> from the our gang comedies set in the south during the civil war it may seem a little odd to see <UNK> as <UNK> slave but this film is as charming as the best of the shorts with the same cast this was the only our gang feature film and i highly recommend it over the little <UNK> remake from 1994
<START> this movie like so many others remember the <UNK> miracle follows the basic sports movie formula there's a guy he's a jerk jerk does bad jerk must play by someone else's rules someone else's rules change jerk jerk becomes good insert tragedy death drugs <UNK> etc tragedy effects jerk makes him totally change jerk must now play championship game lots of close ups on the <UNK> players and the balls jerk wins quote from coach or news or something that explains title credits weren't you touched these movies can now be used to sort out the morons of society anyone who pays to see this in theatres must be slapped
<START> ten years ago i really wanted to see this movie on the cinema but i missed it and then forgot about it oh boy am i glad this movie didn't get to ruin my teenage eyes back then br br i saw it yesterday and seriously this must be among the 10 worst movies ever made and i'm talking about movies which has had too much attention such as those wonderful trailers on tv and too much money spent on actors and the making of the movie br br the script sucks and the acting sucks even worse do i need to say more br br please hollywood no more arnold
<START> angela sandra <UNK> is a computer expert but being shy and somewhat of a <UNK> she does all of her work from the confines of her <UNK> just as she is about to take a vacation in mexico a co worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash angela heads to mexico but takes the disc with her while she is <UNK> on the beach a terrific looking gentleman named jack jeremy northam makes <UNK> to her she falls for them and the two end up on a boat to however jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it even after angela escapes from his <UNK> and lands back in the usa jack makes things difficult he changes <UNK> identity on every computer across the nation making her lose her <UNK> her bank account everything can angela a computer <UNK> beat jack at his own game this very exciting movie has many <UNK> first <UNK> and northam are two very beautiful interesting actors and their presence adds immediate the script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the <UNK> of computers and their relevance in today's world the costumes sets production and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful and despite how it sounds there is a great deal of exciting action as angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy if you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence this is a great choice it delivers twists and turns with great <UNK> making it possible for the viewer to net a very good evening of entertainment
<START> this is easily one of the worst films i've seen in many years i started viewing the film not expecting much and that is exactly what it delivered not much in fact it ended up delivering even less than i expected my first reaction when i saw the opening portions of the film was that i would probably end up rating it a 4 i thought that it seemed to have reasonably good photography and a haunting atmosphere br br as the film progressed however the rating kept going down and down in my mind mainly due to pedestrian acting and a plot that went from being just plain silly and tasteless at the beginning to being both silly and <UNK> near the end by the time the movie was over i was willing to rate it no more than a 1 br br don't waste your time or money on this one
<START> gray can make the english language jump through <UNK> like none other he <UNK> a number of events tied together by his writing of a <UNK> the monster of the title some sad some <UNK> funny all in his characteristic sarcastic manner if you liked swimming to cambodia you will love this one i actually thought this was a bit more interesting and better told than swimming to cambodia a real masterpiece
<START> whoever plays the part of j douglas <UNK> in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job he apparently received no credits too bad br br all the dead end kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry it is odd to watch them in a western setting with their brooklyn accents i guess that should be <UNK> they even show some swimming abilities br br i think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing love crime story my favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film busby berkeley shows his dance movie expertise when john garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move the camera moves up to his face i will not give away why or when but the look on his face at that point probably brought the 1939 audience to its feet in the theaters br br some will think john garfield looks a lot like frank sinatra in many scenes just his face actually frank was not yet making movies so maybe frank looked like john the boxer named smith in the movie looks like a clone of ed <UNK> jr br br now i must tell you something that is not a spoiler but if you watch the movie watch <UNK> hands may <UNK> does her part well she seems to have hands that wander a bit in a scene where she and a crowd go into the <UNK> john garfield dressing room watch where she touches the <UNK> john garfield while he is wearing only his <UNK> br br a great ending lots of wonderful characters br br best line might be at the gas station eight <UNK> that's a dollar twenty eight tom <UNK>
<START> having only seen five episodes of the show before this i've been watching the repeats on bbc two i haven't really had much experience of the league but as a <UNK> fan as well as a massive fan of british comedy i can say this film is hilarious seeing <UNK> who i had not seen on screen before the film <UNK> and <UNK> on the big screen was a great comedy experience being on screen is something that the league take full advantage of with heads blowing up it'll come as a surprise who it is and gruesome murders with random middle ages style battles all the way br br <UNK> is easily the funniest character of the three protagonists in this film because he has the best one liners and overall behaviour just like in the series one of my only <UNK> with the film was not hearing <UNK> shout well now i've got this gun even once even though there is a build up to it in one part of the film the film itself overall is to use the phrase everyone else does and it's very reminiscent of films like life of brian appearances from <UNK> and edward were welcome but <UNK> <UNK> line hello <UNK> <UNK> me up more than anything said by them <UNK> probably my favourite <UNK> character after <UNK> and edward it's got quite a poignant ending with one of the main character being killed off and i can only hope this is not the last on screen <UNK> venture with <UNK> mentioning the possibility of another series or film i'm now very excited this is a film i will see again partly because the <UNK> died towards the end leaving out 10 minutes or so of the film but mainly because it's inventive and hilarious i'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the tv series because i loved it br br one thing though if you've never seen the league you'll still love it but dave knows what you'll think about the people who make this stuff up as <UNK> or edward might put it it's a local film for local people and a precious thing at that br br out of 4 5
<START> this show reminds me of an episode of the simpsons where had just been fired by mr burns and was forced to live a miserable life being unemployed all he did to while the way the hours was to drink and watch comedy central the <UNK> was that comedy central was a pathetic tv channel for miserable people with nothing else to <UNK> their time mind of <UNK> is slightly better than most of comedy <UNK> programming but it still serves as an example of why this channel is low quality filler for people with absolutely no lives br br truth be told <UNK> is a fairly competent comedian who throws out trite soft ball ethnic jokes and <UNK> in on bland stereotypes of people based on their race gender or economic status or a combination of two out of three of these characteristics if you've heard one of these jokes by one of your friends at a bar or at work believe me you've heard what passes as comedy on mind of <UNK> carlos also tries to make fun of current events but lacks creativity or originality this is not to say that carlos is a <UNK> all the time i found some of his skits amusing such as his rap video portrayal as an oil <UNK> if you find bland run of the mill comedy up your alley you'll probably enjoy mind of <UNK> for those people who are tired of repetitive pedestrian comedians <UNK> out the same old time worn jokes stay away
<START> this movie was well done it covers the difficulties a returning vietnam veteran has in dealing with the horrors of war unfortunately the writers chose to focus on a vet who had been involved in an act of atrocity i was in vietnam and only once heard of such an act by one who witnessed it the <UNK> was <UNK> and sentenced to many years in <UNK> br br the notion that only vets involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a <UNK> to all who served all of the soldiers i knew personally or knew of by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed they were there to halt the spread of communism the biggest problem was coming home to learn that many americans were opposed to the war that is what caused many veterans to feel they had taken part in something less than honorable not the manner in which they served br br the ending depicted the father acting more as a <UNK> bully than a loving caring father for that i gave it a 7 out of 10 had the ending allowed for a degree of acceptance i could have rated it a 9 br br most decent men will come home from war with guilt and emotional <UNK> they need acceptance and understanding to overcome that i pray that the public is more understanding of our present day veterans than it was in the the vietnam era
<START> the last dinosaur was one of those out of nowhere movie of the week films in the 1970's that was pretty exciting for the time especially to fans of japanese films originally <UNK> for a theatrical release around when the <UNK> king kong was out in the previous december it was suddenly pulled and made into a friday night abc movie of the week <UNK> bass who were no strangers to japanese co productions were the guns behind this production co produced with productions of japan the people who brought us in various forms starring mostly an american cast including the late richard <UNK> joan van <UNK> and the late steven <UNK> it told the tale of a <UNK> pocket of time in what was a <UNK> somewhere at the frozen <UNK> circle containing dinosaurs it plays a lot like the films the land unknown 1956 and the land that time forgot 1975 in feel and pace sure the dinosaurs were guys in suits a <UNK> with front knees but they were filmed in such a way the music and score was so well done and the cast did a fine job that this didn't matter much to many of us brought up on godzilla the film has a lot of class to it from the opening score by nancy wilson the last dinosaur to the overall big feeling of the film the locations at hot springs in northern japan were excellent and lush and the <UNK> feeling of <UNK> to it there are some amazing set pieces the t <UNK> bone yard and a tracking shot that takes us deep into the jungle to see the t rex eat a giant fish from a stream fx people did their job in style here and aside from a few dodgy <UNK> shots they do their job well this film is considered the best 1970's <UNK> film from japan even over the five godzilla films made during that decade <UNK> bass did several other co productions with providing the creatures or <UNK> the <UNK> depths 1978 and the <UNK> ape 1980 but neither <UNK> up to the epic look of this film
<START> when i first watched this film i thought that it would be <UNK> good because it featured my favourite actor of all time he gives a sterling performance though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the work he is the only good thing in it you're into explosions and american dream working class hero trash which i'm not br br i don't get it how can this film get away with being so that bit with the little boy being rescued i mean come on you can't tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire guy wearing any <UNK> i know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you can't see for more than a couple of feet <UNK> of you and no breathing equipment he'd have <UNK> after 2 minutes this film was just bad ok br br why robert br br sorry if this is your favourite film
<START> i have copied my video of this on to dvd so that i can enjoy it whenever i like and it makes a very successful and rare wedding present as well this is just an absolutely wonderful adaptation of a much loved novel everything about it is just perfect and it has aged amazingly well there is always a chance with something this old that it might appear a bit <UNK> next to more modern dramas but more than holds its own br br the quality of the acting is amazing with janet <UNK> making a <UNK> <UNK> and a young clive owen <UNK> around as the <UNK> <UNK> br br i challenge anyone to watch the final sequence without at least a little at the sheer romance of it all it is the perfect film to watch when it is cold outside and you are <UNK> up on the <UNK> br br i really can't recommend this highly enough
<START> <UNK> is an apt title however a leather <UNK> would be more useful to self <UNK> after <UNK> a ticket to watch this <UNK> attempt at entertainment <UNK> attempt at self <UNK> humor comes across with a quiet <UNK> as his demeanor implies that he is anything but perhaps with another actor playing the clooney role the movie might be <UNK> <UNK> sorry george i doubt there will be any oscar <UNK> this time george clooney is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to comedy unless you are <UNK> to his politics anyway only the most <UNK> of clooney fans will enjoy watching <UNK> everyone else will long for the days of the silent picture
<START> just been on sci fi channel uk <UNK> july its was shame on may be he was bored one week he cant be after lotr i suppose he wasn't to blame mr was i turned off after 50 minutes couldn't bear it the cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a large 5 foot bat who <UNK> this project i think the whole thing must have cost 250 bucks avoid at all costs don't think about buying the dvd if they release one i cant imagine they would spend dollars on producing one lets hope someone makes a decent film and a decent bigfoot movie sasquatch was okay poor lance its a shame a big studio and direct wont risk it no more super hero films please
<START> what can i say about this movie except that it is great fun br br john cusack plays <UNK> <UNK> a recent high school graduate who has two choices learn to take up the family business of street sweeping or spend the summer at with his pal george <UNK> played hilariously by joel murray and his zany friends br br when i say zany believe me it can't get much than the <UNK> brothers egg <UNK> <UNK> and clay tom <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> raymond curtis armstrong throw in a little girl named <UNK> and her weirdo <UNK> and a great performance by <UNK> moore and you have the <UNK> of a split your sides laughing movie br br the laughs flow <UNK> in this movie and the story line though the typical good versus bad and good <UNK> is great with the twist of a <UNK> as the showdown br br i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes loads of laughs and a feel good time if you like to thoroughly enjoy your movies then you can't miss one crazy summer
<START> this is a very cool movie the ending of the movie is a bit more defined than the <UNK> ending but either way it is still a good movie
<START> my sister a friend and i went to see this film for my birthday on the <UNK> of september we had all seen the first jackass movie a while back and we all enjoyed it we were really looking forward to number two br br we were not disappointed br br from start to finish i was laughing hysterically it is equal parts shocking and amusing however and is definitely not for those with weak <UNK> it is obscene but it is also groundbreaking american cinema well perhaps that's a bit too much praise for a movie where men intentionally get their stuck to ice <UNK> but it is groundbreaking in that it shows us <UNK> whether we like it or not things that no other decent american movie released nation wide would dare show us br br there was only one scene in particular that i felt was unnecessarily obscene and it involved a horse i'll not elaborate br br i laughed i nearly <UNK> and i came damn close to crying out of a physical reaction to viewing a scene involving a <UNK> and an <UNK> not sadness in my humble opinion jackass number two is the film of <UNK> br br does that make me a jackass perhaps but if it does i could really care less
<START> i give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called haunted homes but this kid and his buddies conduct their <UNK> like total idiots they assume that there are ghosts from the get go and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences they have to be drug kicking and screaming into <UNK> it but beyond that the show's whole format is incredibly annoying even though a lot of it seems scripted the college educated kids who make up the the cast can barely speak english but still insist on trying to use big words they obviously don't understand and head investigator <UNK> ridiculously self important <UNK> make me just want to throw the tv through the window and he looks stoned all the time in short this group make the guys from <UNK> on ghost hunters look like <UNK> scientists
<START> unlike some movies which you can wonder around and do other things this movie kept me in front of the screen for the entire two hours i loved every minute of it br br however i have to say that the story is not very believable especially when the <UNK> was <UNK> by the government and then later on actually sent a package to the guy who helped him <UNK> liu is a very good actor he shows his emotions and he shows his silliness and his love toward that girl
<START> this has to be one of the most powerful message sending movies i saw lately it was absolutely flawless all the way amazingly original and thought provoking story is unusual and original and the characters make this story very very powerful it's about a guy who kills his ex <UNK> retarded kid brother and as he is sent to juvenile prison through many memory flashbacks you get a grip on a story and you don't let it go until the very end murder he commits changes the course of life for every member of his family and the family of deceased and as you watch and realize that everyone has its own story and its own dark side you just appreciate this movie even more it's a total tour de force cause those actions cannot be described by simple words his motive of committing murder is left explained and it makes viewers think acting was pretty much flawless and the cast was very good it contains many familiar faces if you like the movies that are thought provoking and that just make u think during them e g <UNK> dr ' then 'the united states of is an excellent movie choice for you otherwise you should pass this movie and watch it when you're in the mood for serious thought provoking movie br br 10 10
<START> based to some extent on writers david <UNK> and jimmy <UNK> own experiences as <UNK> holiday camp <UNK> in the uk during the same the programme follows hi de hi <UNK> the <UNK> humour of post war britain set in the <UNK> <UNK> town of on sea hi de hi chronicles the comedic goings on within the holiday camp one of many <UNK> along the british coast owned by the mega rich but never seen on screen joe br br although the actual show began in 1980 with the pilot episode and ran until 1988 when the bbc deemed it too tame for it's cutting edge comedy department seasons 1 5 focused on 1959 while seasons 6 9 <UNK> 1960 a time when the old style british holiday camp began to fall into decline during the first 5 seasons jeffrey played brilliantly by the late great simon was the <UNK> entertainment manager a well meaning yet slightly <UNK> ex university professor breaking free of his upper class background and <UNK> into the real world to head his team of entertainment staff who were in stark contrast to his own laid back personality from season 6 <UNK> was replaced by clive <UNK> played by david <UNK> when quit the show at the height of it's popularity an ex <UNK> war hero who in many ways was similar to character in background but more a <UNK> than a gentleman br br however the real stars of hi de hi throughout the nine seasons were ted played superbly by paul <UNK> a stereotypical working class <UNK> drinking <UNK> comic someone who could never resist an opportunity to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> played by ruth who's currently experiencing a career comeback with appearances in the hit bbc comedy little britain chief what the entertainment staff were called because of their bright yellow <UNK> and sports <UNK> but more importantly the one person who saved jeffrey and clive <UNK> from embarrassment by covering up their <UNK> in running a holiday camp peggy <UNK> <UNK> the slightly dopey yet lovable <UNK> maid with a burning ambition to become a and spike dixon jeffrey holland ted's innocent <UNK> learning more about <UNK> than he hoped for br br as usual with a <UNK> perry production the assembled cast of characters were a bunch of <UNK> played superbly by the actors involved mr <UNK> played by the late leslie who was in his 70's by the time he left the show the alcoholic child hating children's entertainer fred felix a former champion <UNK> with a dubious past <UNK> barry stuart <UNK> holland barry howard the <UNK> former ballroom dancing <UNK> who were in the twilight of their careers and sylvia and betty <UNK> kelly and <UNK> howard the two main girl who were always looking for the type of fun joe would never allow in one of his camps br br hi de hi <UNK> the slapstick era of the late 50s with it's <UNK> and to a certain degree vulgar tongue in cheek humour jokes about people sitting on <UNK> and <UNK> about <UNK> with big were the order of the day but despite it's <UNK> of carry on it was always so innocent and became something of recommended family viewing back in the 80's of course the critics of the show <UNK> that the show had it's welcome by a good couple of years but i disagree while the early seasons focused mainly on and slapstick humour the latter series of hi de hi saw more thought put into the scripts and the main characters especially spike dixon <UNK> <UNK> were able to grow with more sensitive story lines that said there were a few criticisms of the show clive <UNK> was no jeffrey and the former didn't quite have the on screen chemistry with <UNK> as jeffrey did i personally think it would've been more believable if <UNK> had married jeff five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than just a few continuity errors the disappearance of old faces and <UNK> of new characters weren't explained properly especially with the who came and went with much <UNK> and the character of <UNK> <UNK> who in the pilot episode was made out to be a free loving man eater that was suddenly transformed into a naive virgin like character also to mention quite most of the 1959 holiday season was covered in season one so to stretch the rest of the year out in five further series was something <UNK> unbelievable still the show wasn't meant to be <UNK> looked upon and the comedy more than <UNK> it's flaws br br all in all hi de hi was probably one of the last comedies from the <UNK> golden period and even if it never managed to rival such british comedic <UNK> as only fools horses <UNK> or even last of the summer wine hi de hi will be best remembered as a comedy the whole family could enjoy if you haven't already checked it out for yourself i <UNK> you to do so
<START> this <UNK> simple film makes a remarkably clear statement about a teenager and his father though a theatrical release it has a made for tv quality we can <UNK> this to the director john <UNK> who learned his craft in the early days of live television in new york city indeed he directed the <UNK> on which the film is based deal a blow on the cbs drama series climax young stranger represents his hollywood debut after a <UNK> of four years during which he would do more television he returned to direct the young <UNK> with burt <UNK> and a year after that all fall down with warren beatty and angela lansbury br br the casting is competent with james <UNK> and kim hunter particularly good playing the parents of the title character performed by james macarthur his first theatrical film who played the same role in the television version which was his first appearance on the small screen look for james gregory and <UNK> <UNK> in supporting roles
<START> this is from much of the same creative team behind better off dead but is not quite as good as that amazing teen comedy its a lot of fun but its all over the place and just not quite as funny curtis armstrong is used to less effect he was incredibly funny in better off dead <UNK> is hilarious cusack is good <UNK> moore is <UNK> moore only with better hair here overall its fun and as a person from cape <UNK> it catches the feeling of an 80s cape <UNK> summer very effectively for some reason this film feels more mainstream than better off dead there isn't quite as much left field absurdity going on here again if you are a fan of john cusack and savage steve holland its definitely recommended
<START> the original the man who knew too much brought alfred hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the united kingdom of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks <UNK> how hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen the original film was shot inside a studio br br for whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big hollywood studio behind him paramount decided to see what the man who knew too much would be like with a lavish budget this is shot on location in and london and has two big international names for box office this was james stewart's third of four hitchcock films and his only <UNK> with doris day and her only hitchcock film br br i do wonder why hitchcock never used doris again at first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that hitchcock <UNK> possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication hitchcock also wanted in his <UNK> br br doris does some of her best acting ever in the man who knew too much her best scene is when her doctor husband james stewart gives her a <UNK> before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an english couple who <UNK> them in <UNK> stewart and day play off each other beautifully in that scene but doris especially as she <UNK> about four different emotions at once br br day and stewart are on vacation with their son christopher olsen in <UNK> and they make the <UNK> of frenchman daniel and the aforementioned english couple bernard miles and brenda is stabbed in the back at a market place in and <UNK> some dying words to stewart about an assassination to take place in albert hall in london their child is <UNK> in order to <UNK> their silence br br for the only time i can think of a hit song came out of a hitchcock film doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother the song was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and i remember it well at the age of 9 you couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956 it even <UNK> with the fast rising elvis <UNK> that year <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> won the academy award for best song beating out such titles as true love from high society and the title song from around the world in 80 days it became doris day's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back br br in fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as doris sings it at an <UNK> party at the climax br br instead of doing it with mirrors hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real albert hall and like another reviewer said it's not directed it's choreographed you'll be hanging on your seats during that moment br br this was remake well worth doing
<START> the very first talking picture has returned from oblivion and now you can hear it and see it in <UNK> of <UNK> at the edison lab complex in west orange new jersey thomas <UNK> associate william <UNK> tried to combine two existing <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> to record sound and image together in the event <UNK> was unable to the <UNK> of sound and image so this experimental film was never released to paying audiences and consequently unlike many silent films which <UNK> made for edison at this time it has no official title the silent image recorded at 40 <UNK> has been in the library of <UNK> for years known to film historians as a mute curiosity it was also known that the had been recorded on one of the crude wax <UNK> <UNK> at the edison national historic site although nobody knew which one br br but now that's changed recently located the wax <UNK> which had broken into several pieces these were <UNK> a <UNK> was <UNK> and the sound was <UNK> hollywood's veteran soundtrack editor walter <UNK> up the background noise and <UNK> the to make it <UNK> with the film image which had <UNK> <UNK> to 30 <UNK> sound and image are <UNK> at last br br the film begins with an <UNK> man's voice calling 'the rest of you <UNK> ready go ahead ' the unseen <UNK> remains <UNK> but was probably assistant fred <UNK> on screen <UNK> plays a <UNK> into an immense <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> one of <UNK> sound recording devices while alongside him in full view of the camera two male lab <UNK> embrace each other for some quick ballroom dancing to the <UNK> of music br br the film lasts barely 17 seconds just long enough for us to marvel at this crude technology before being <UNK> to laughter at the sight of two men <UNK> in each other's arms speaking of which here's a warning a well known but extremely inaccurate reference book 'the celluloid <UNK> by the late <UNK> russo includes a frame <UNK> from this movie and <UNK> it as 'the gay <UNK> that's incorrect 'the gay <UNK> is an entirely different movie made by <UNK> at the edison lab during this same period 'the gay <UNK> never had a soundtrack it's a brief fiction film about two brothers who are not <UNK> in the sense russo meant it the deceased mr russo for his own reasons wanted us to perceive experimental sound film arguably the first movie musical as an <UNK> of 19th century <UNK> hmm what is it about gay men and musicals sorry but there's just no such content here br br this important film deserves a rating of 10 out of 10 i've often <UNK> that no <UNK> movie should ever be considered <UNK> unless it was deliberately destroyed i'm delighted to report that this film is finally available to audiences as its producer intended it more than a century after it was filmed
<START> i just managed to find a copy of mission <UNK> which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the united states so far i have only watched about the first 10 minutes of the film and i can safely say that i laughed more in those 10 minutes than i did watching the entirety of the first live action <UNK> movie br br i am watching the dubbed version and while the dubbing job is a little <UNK> i have found the movie to be very funny and true to the book i see that people on here have said that the dubbed version is very inferior to the subtitled version that may very well be true and after i watch the subtitled version also on my dvd i may have to come on here and alter my review as it stands though i find it to be a very entertaining movie and it more than makes up for the mess which they made out of the first movie
<START> if someone had <UNK> me about 15 minutes into and asked what i thought of jamie foxx in the title role it would have been time for a blank stare after all what is this <UNK> person <UNK> about that wasn't jamie foxx up on the big screen that was ray charles this is one of the best performances by anybody in recent years like the soundtrack jamie as ray is flat out brilliant br br the blind genius of soul who took a revolutionary step of mixing <UNK> with r b died during production the movie about his troubled life is good not great taylor direction and james l <UNK> script follow the well worn biopic outline super talented <UNK> battles <UNK> achieves greatness while also self <UNK> then picks himself up out of the <UNK> for a happy ending the film shows <UNK> flaws heroin abuse <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bastard <UNK> even as it sucks you in with his beautiful music br br <UNK> washington and <UNK> king play the main women in <UNK> life one his long suffering wife and the other his longtime mistress both actresses match foxx <UNK> for <UNK> what takes him to a different level though is his deep understanding and uncanny <UNK> of the great musician the entire cast is effective especially sharon warren as his <UNK> mother and curtis armstrong as a music <UNK> stars are likely to be rewarded with <UNK> and better yet more starring roles br br i was not a ray charles <UNK> before apparently the film has left out a lot as do all <UNK> but this picture functions as both an old fashioned crowd <UNK> and a dark investigation of a brilliant troubled man for those who <UNK> that foxx doesn't actually sing as if that somehow <UNK> his performance take a <UNK> no mere actor can sing like mr charles anyway you can't have everything what the talented star does in this picture is about as close to everything as we'll probably see for a while
<START> i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me later i found myself lost in the power of the film how do you <UNK> a gift from god the ability of characters to rise above their base <UNK> and respond to the touch from god <UNK> my heart the entire audience <UNK> at the conclusion of the film i left the theater with a <UNK> in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race what more can any film do hollywood i hope your paying attention america does like positive upbeat films
<START> i got this as part of a competition prize i watched it not really expecting much from an obviously low budget production i laughed myself sick there are obvious references to other films in the horror genre texas chain saw massacre friday 13th etc all the standard clichés were there long drive through partially <UNK> and somehow menacing countryside <UNK> red <UNK> mysterious vehicles tracking you throw in some really good humorous scenes <UNK> from the <UNK> van and dialogue f g virgin that's got to be an <UNK> and you have one of the best spoof horror films for years i particularly liked the way our reluctant hero used his stress related nose bleed to great advantage
<START> i just saw this movie on <UNK> and let me tell you this movie was downright corny and <UNK> but after a certain point i began to laugh my <UNK> off and to tell you the truth they should <UNK> this movie as comedy rather than action adventure the absolutely most hilarious scene comes when the <UNK> and kennedy are making loop the loop <UNK> to avoid the french <UNK> that wagner ordered to destroy the <UNK> our <UNK> leader kennedy decides to shoot <UNK> out the window to stop the heat seeking <UNK> dumb yet funny the <UNK> comes here though after one shot the <UNK> gun <UNK> and kennedy tries to fix it in the <UNK> and well if you want to know what happens get a hold of this movie the dumb parts of this movie include the total lack of plot yeah lets have some action for 25 minutes than land in paris and go one hour with love scenes with prostitutes and flight <UNK> now lets switch to the <UNK> for ten minutes then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that is visually breaking apart and the passengers don t even see it its right in front of their eyes final rating for this move 1 10 out of 4 stars if it were action 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy
<START> let me start by saying that if you're expecting subtle humour you're in the wrong theatre it's low brow and heavy hitting but he's not out to <UNK> your funny bone he's got the <UNK> out and he's drawn a <UNK> on the side of your head but fear not as movies go this is a fairly gentle education oh also heavy on the swearing but once again mike judge not fred rogers br br was this movie called f no the gem the essence that is mike judge is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves <UNK> and <UNK> was most popular with teen aged boys the very people at which it <UNK> <UNK> fun br br with that in mind i don't think the humour in this movie is aimed at the super intelligent maybe you are all too smart to get it but he's not aiming at you he's aiming at your average joe and he's got a message get your act together and for god's sake study it is a little disjointed and the narrator gets to be a little irritating after a while but once again this movie is meant for people who need a lot of narration it's funny it has a message that it wants to make sure that we all understand br br i question the casting of luke wilson in the role of a man with a 100 iq sometimes he's not able to play down what's he got like a <UNK> to the level of his character slightly forced at times br br kudos on <UNK> shepard in this one i remember seeing him in and thinking this guys looks like an idiot in this movie he makes a great idiot maybe i'm psychic br br it took a while to warm up to <UNK> <UNK> but i gave her a little <UNK> after all she did have to play straight man to an entire planet but once she got a little screen time she made a solid contribution br br terry <UNK> played the same psychotic aggressive character he's played many times before but he makes a first rate president none the less br br another bonus is that the place was practically empty counting my girlfriend and i there were literally six people in the theatre we could've had a <UNK> pit and a <UNK> band so no annoying people talking as appears to be the norm in the to the <UNK> age br br all in all a good premise and a competent delivery given the intended goal lots of laughs <UNK> throughout br br what made this movie scary was the fact that when we walked out of the theatre it was sort of like the movie was still playing we saw a lot of idiocy in the people immediately around us maybe made more apparent by the dose we got in the theatre br br they're all <UNK> all of them
<START> the summary was promising but watching the movie was a huge disappointment nothing happens in this movie plot is linear and without surprise normal characters stay normal until end of the film weird characters stay weird until end of the film there is even not a single <UNK> to foul the viewer into thinking that the bad guy is someone else than the most obvious candidate on the positive side actors play quite well and there is a tiny bit of atmosphere in the movie but much too little to be any significant br br people who vote 10 for this movie either didn't see it or are member of the movie production team 4 is well paid
<START> i am a huge fan of big loud trashy completely stupid action movies such as the rock con air etc all of these are great fun to watch but when you think about it extremely silly in the line of fire tells a story and it tells it well with <UNK> as well as excitement and suspense it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think the last shot of the movie is eastwood and russo sitting together on the steps of the white house watching the <UNK> to gentle peaceful music and i felt a deep feeling of satisfaction this was because i cared about the characters and i was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion it felt like a true story as the aging secret service agent tormented by the fact that he failed to protect <UNK> on that <UNK> day in dallas clint eastwood is fantastic he brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his <UNK> on the other side of the spectrum is john <UNK> as the creepy predator who <UNK> eastwood about what happened in 1963 by openly telling him of his plan to kill the current president this oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin throughout the movie <UNK> talks to eastwood as if they are friends he doesn't <UNK> him he doesn't lie to him he doesn't laugh at him but he <UNK> him with his unbearable <UNK> right up to the last moment as well as this thrilling main plot there is a charming love story involving <UNK> russo another agent and eastwood despite the age difference they have superb chemistry on screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much but keeps it as part of the backdrop which works nicely to sum up i love this film because it has a mind
<START> as a child of the 80's like so many of the other reviewers here i hated the original v and v the final battle i own both on vhs and never hook up the vcr to watch them i do remember not liking this short lived series very much but i couldn't remember why so i rented the first disc by the third episode i had my memory <UNK> it's terrible the writing is beyond horrid it's not even fun they had a lot of material to work with here but it seemed like they just didn't know what to do so they turned it into of our lives with lizard <UNK> how cool and full of potential is the concept of elizabeth the all they could think of to do is grow her into a whiny boring teenager to compete with her mother <UNK> marc singer looked less embarrassed to be in <UNK> ii than he did when he was trapped in this drivel point is whether you're one of the younger folk who's just discovered v or one of us older sci fi fans looking to <UNK> some old fun spare yourself and skip this
<START> alert this review contains major spoilers do not read on if you plan to see this film br br judging from the amount of votes this got my vote was the fifth one very few people know or care who <UNK> is well back in the late 1980s professional wrestling was pretty decent an all woman's <UNK> called the ladies professional wrestling association opened it was a great league and <UNK> was one of the names on the <UNK> i always thought she was one of the best people the had in terms of ring skill and acting ability unfortunately the closed down in the early 90s so it only seemed natural for someone with as much talent as <UNK> to start an acting career right but surely there was an alternative to stuff like this this movie is really bad as it was going along i kept comparing it to an underrated movie called survivor quest ' only this film lacks everything that made survivor enjoyable br br as i started the tape i went to fast forward through the preview to get to the meat of the tape at first i wasn't paying much attention but then i realized that the preview was for a movie starring <UNK> oh ' i thought here's another movie featuring <UNK> to look for ' but as the preview dragged on i became aware that is was a preview <UNK> <UNK> fear ' you know you're in trouble when the only preview at the beginning features the movie you are about to watch the plot of this thing is pretty standard plays an ex <UNK> that is living with the guilt of <UNK> an <UNK> friend so she focuses herself on her second career which she shares with her friend sammy being a wilderness guide on this particular occasion she gets a <UNK> of three couples two of the couples are just there to take up space you think that one couple a <UNK> husband and a korean wife will be explored as an issue appears between them halfway through the film but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the woods which consistently scares the korean wife the joke is funny the first time you hear it but it certainly isn't by the <UNK> time they do it the third couple is just painful to watch it consists of mr and mrs page they trade insults back and forth and mr page uses his video camera for the art of <UNK> when he's not busy playing cruel jokes on his <UNK> just like your typical american couple before the <UNK> mr page is <UNK> on two stupid guys and their prostitute one of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out mr page taped it so begins the peril as the two guys track the group on their trip and we and and and wait for them to finally do something when they do it's a fiasco br br you can't blame the cast they try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with the main <UNK> is director robert f <UNK> who needs to go back to playing bit parts and stay out of the director's chair <UNK> starts and stops scenes in such a sloppy sudden matter that you start to think he was suffering from throughout the entire shoot there's even one incompetent moment when a broad daylight scene with the thugs is slipped between some <UNK> scenes then there is the sound department the music and background noise completely <UNK> the dialogue so that you have to move your ear right next to your <UNK> <UNK> don't <UNK> your head on the screen it isn't worth it to hear the poorly written lines speaking of poor writing gets some of the credit there as co writer the few interesting developments between characters are often abandoned for shots of the thugs or bad practical jokes early on knocks out a thug with a <UNK> knife so not once do you think they are in any danger from the two stupid thugs when the crooks finally get their rear ends kicked by in a well done and long fight our cast all have a huge laugh together despite the fact that one of them has been shot and is bleeding everywhere yes everyone is happy in the end everyone except the poor souls witnessing the film wishing for the good old glory days when <UNK> performed in the wrestling ring <UNK> score 4 out of 10
<START> cary <UNK> have to say puts on a better performance then <UNK> did in but anyhow br br have to say this film it just makes me laugh so much mainly because the actors seem really into what their doing and you just sit there and thinking <UNK> the hell are they <UNK> but in a very very very very good way the random <UNK> of songs were brilliant and well and the musical score used i really really liked great casting and as said before everyone seemed so into their roles br br 10 10 from me <UNK> br br unlike some other robin <UNK> i can speak with an english
<START> this movie is one of my all time favorites i think that sean penn did a great job acting it is one of the few true stories that made it to film that i really like it is in my top 10 films of all time i watch it over and over and never get tired of it great movie
<START> i first saw 2 on <UNK> in the 90's when i was at art college living and moving among artists and musicians hoping for future success so 'the second <UNK> of friendships made after leaving the <UNK> home of <UNK> for a professional excellence strongly <UNK> with my living reality i was captivated by the characters the storytelling the lyrical camera work and above all by the music in it i could divine the <UNK> of german electronic music of 50's can <UNK> of the 70's the sound experiments of john cage walter carlos and the british electronic <UNK> of the white noise the soundtrack composer <UNK> studied with carl of fame so i found its tastes contemporary to the electronic pop sound effects world br br i <UNK> seen or 3 so i watched it as a whole in itself without a before or after as someone else has commented it is both epic and lyrical historical and artistic many favourite moments including the wonderful voice of <UNK> <UNK> evelyn the bach of daniel smith juan the piano playing of henry arnold <UNK> and the <UNK> playing of <UNK> <UNK> br br i could write more but it's already been said here why can't british or us tv produce such masterpieces the wire had the realism and politics and epic <UNK> of a city david lynch and dennis potter had imaginative <UNK> to their tv work too but this is art house and soap at its most cinematic and narrative sublime it's never included in <UNK> choices of best films but it should be still as poetic and powerful as when i first saw it over 17 years ago i watch the 3 <UNK> sets every <UNK> for their inspired and inspiring
<START> i watched the <UNK> version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of <UNK> closely i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story while capturing the true horror of <UNK> and the murders this film makes the following factual errors 1 <UNK> did not <UNK> drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and <UNK> who rarely took drugs via <UNK> 2 the asian nurse who survived massacre did not <UNK> her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie this would have been impossible in real life she <UNK> under a bed while <UNK> <UNK> eliminated his 8 victims 3 the movie depicts <UNK> as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them not true in reality <UNK> was at first calm and gentle <UNK> the women he wasn't going to hurt them this is how he was able to tie each of them up 4 the real richard <UNK> was not the deep <UNK> the movie depicts him to be fbi <UNK> robert interviewed <UNK> in the 80's and said that <UNK> not only <UNK> know why he committed the murders but that he wasn't interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why <UNK> was known to be of below average intelligence and not the <UNK> king who <UNK> this movie if the story wasn't so tragic and horrifying the voice over would be laughable all in all doug <UNK> performance is adequately menacing and cold blooded even though i don't think the real <UNK> was so forward in his violence no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known after all for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before <UNK> them beverly ann performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film she is a very good actress if you are at all <UNK> do not see this film it's very graphic and disturbing
<START> <UNK> <UNK> would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda moore tries to call humor that this movie and moore's other <UNK> actually attract <UNK> proves that alas it's possible to fool some of the people all of the time br br let's see if we can bait <UNK> let's see if we can <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world let's see if we can pretend we're funny let's see if we can out <UNK> charles <UNK> the only thing moore lacks in comparison to <UNK> is a <UNK> from <UNK> br br admittedly in this film moore had a bit of self <UNK> to his <UNK> in this film moore <UNK> roger smith <UNK> of general <UNK> as an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moore could do that in 1989 but now that moore has <UNK> himself to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this characterization of roger smith has an ironic <UNK> who really wouldn't rather be <UNK> buddy than michael moore's
<START> i give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for damon wayans as the <UNK> show was for bill <UNK> it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and i felt that it in fact <UNK> to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character br br michael kyle an interesting <UNK> and a <UNK> person he is phenomenal in movies but in the show he was there for the <UNK> and though i loved it i felt that the laugh was more important than <UNK> br br jay kyle i have loved her since house party and have enjoyed her in school <UNK> and martin this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to co star in i also feel that jay and michael were more like equals in the show but jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of <UNK> discipline because she may have felt that it worked br br jr just plain stupid his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing which drives me nuts not to mention that most of the situations in episodes i've seen seems to center around him br br <UNK> the attractive sister who dated a christian i found her <UNK> character to be more interesting than she was she'd be better off sticking to movies the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but it's not stereotypical enough br br <UNK> lovable and the youngest daughter i think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and franklin br br franklin i love this character and i think they derived it from smart guy t j which only lasted one season they did a great job of casting for this little genius the effort would have been made if jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides also br br all in all this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it's homage to the <UNK> show is well done i love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that i can't wait to see the series finale
<START> nice <UNK> br br even though it didn't work out how you wanted with the original film you have a fantastic piece of work and great viewing br br it is self evident how much you put into it br br that goes for everyone else too it's great to see the <UNK> and all account of the process without being <UNK> <UNK> br br loved it well worth a view br br <UNK> <UNK> the writer of 'the <UNK> film couldn't appreciate what you have achieved br br love the attitude too great piece looking forward to seeing the next work br br keep going <UNK>
<START> obviously this one doesn't aim for the brain the so called humour is based on <UNK> and every cliché about any ethnic genre you can imagine gays included of course as long as they are not <UNK> and a latino this besides john <UNK> does have talent and charisma but in such a self indulgent movie it is a definite waste what the point in trying to out jim carrey jim carrey himself the <UNK> of the title could then be this movie almost as funny as <UNK> finest prepare to be annoyed not amused
<START> it was dumb sort of like an adam sandler movie br br there were a few funny parts but not that funny br br i liked some of the actors in it though br br there were some sat night live people in the movie but i wouldn't recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on and it was still better than any jennifer lopez movie
<START> i have seen chasing the dragon several times and have enjoyed it each time the acting was superb this movie really makes you realize how one bad choice at a weak moment can change your life
<START> the quality you're likely to remember after viewing the big knife is how claustrophobic it is it's pacing is sacrificed to a uniform <UNK> of dialog it's talky in the extreme modern viewers will feel every point has been made and then some but the movie will still not move on or do the viewer a favor and change the scenery it's very <UNK> at the 45 min mark i was sure i had watched two very slow hours my <UNK> response was good god where is this going it feels like <UNK> was paid by the word br br this is a good place to note the decline of drama from it's high point in the 40s through the <UNK> laden projects of the 50s and 60s until actual <UNK> merit was <UNK> in the 70s only to <UNK> again here we get show <UNK> conventional emotional <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> et al and camera moves pre arranged to meet over <UNK> <UNK> this is due to the rise of the method the <UNK> trend of <UNK> every other merit of film to grant actors their most selfish wishes great acting ho hum has killed thought in movies br br jack <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and thrust forward every time he <UNK> to something it's disturbing br br this is awfully boring stuff
<START> francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her we learn little about this woman's marriage except that she has been feeling her independence <UNK> away as of late she's also recently learned she's pregnant which has further complicated her heart she doesn't want to be a <UNK> despite the <UNK> way she speaks to her husband over the phone she meets two men on her journey a former college football hero who after an accident during a game has been left with permanent brain damage and a sexy <UNK> motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life the clear clean landscapes as photographed by the very talented <UNK> butler are <UNK> realized as are the characters shirley knight james <UNK> and robert duvall each deliver strong gripping performances most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms some scenes such as <UNK> first call home from a pay phone or her first night alone with <UNK> where they play are almost too intimate to watch coppola toys with reality turning the <UNK> memories of his characters into we've been made <UNK> to he allows scenes to play out yet the editing is quite <UNK> and the film is never allowed to get too heavy there are at least two or three very <UNK> moments it's a <UNK> <UNK> so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later some may <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of events in order to <UNK> the finale with bitter irony however the <UNK> and drive behind the picture nearly <UNK> its shortcomings from
<START> bad plot bad acting bad direction br br it had possibilities but just didn't achieve anything br br this film looks like someone started with an idea <UNK> a bit of info and then tried to flesh an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad suspense music br br others had to stop watching because they were scared 2 3 of the way through i had to take a break purely because i just didn't care anymore br br reminded me of an episode of days of our lives with <UNK> more suspense br br just bad
<START> pistol <UNK> pam <UNK> takes names and kicks butt as the heroine in asylum of satan director william entertaining <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> baby co starring martin and austin <UNK> <UNK> baby is one of several tough chick flicks that <UNK> appeared in during the 1970s including <UNK> <UNK> brown and friday foster the short lived co wrote this thoroughly routine private eye <UNK> with producer david <UNK> in one night and it features a <UNK> female <UNK> that refuses to rely on a man to help her take care of business unfortunately <UNK> baby isn't nearly as good as the <UNK> movies that <UNK> made under the <UNK> of director jack hill hill <UNK> the african american north <UNK> native in <UNK> <UNK> brown the big bird cage and the big doll house anybody that <UNK> images of african american women in cinema should be familiar with these epics the chief problem with <UNK> baby is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks naturally the secondary villains are trigger happy <UNK> that couldn't hit the side of a <UNK> with a as the main antagonist dick qualifies as both an <UNK> as well as smarmy villain with choice lines like anything worth having is worth stealing additionally composer monk <UNK> does provide a strong atmospheric <UNK> soundtrack and the best song with barbara mason <UNK> it is good man is gone <UNK> baby casts <UNK> as <UNK> chicago <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she leaves the <UNK> city to return to her hometown of <UNK> kentucky to help out her father when she arrives in <UNK> <UNK> learns that her father andy <UNK> <UNK> of detroit <UNK> is having trouble with a local black gangster <UNK> pilot <UNK> <UNK> martin of hammer who demands that andy sell out his <UNK> company to pilot or die br br initially pilot <UNK> a <UNK> squad to trash <UNK> office but our <UNK> father catches them in the act they turn <UNK> father into a <UNK> bag interestingly during the fight scene rarely shows <UNK> <UNK> flesh earlier <UNK> right hand man brick williams austin <UNK> of horror high had sent <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> that she return to <UNK> but she didn't receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who didn't know where to find her brick and <UNK> hook up <UNK> their romantic flames and share a night in the sack brick spends most of his time <UNK> <UNK> to remain calm in the face of <UNK> as a former <UNK> kentucky police woman <UNK> prefers to shoot first and ask questions second after she arrives home <UNK> borrows her father's car and barely escapes being blown to bits as she is walking out the door to get into her father's car andy receives another <UNK> call from pilot previously andy had refused to discuss the <UNK> of selling his <UNK> company to pilot but andy changes his mind and agrees to talk with the <UNK> a <UNK> pilot warns andy about the dynamite that has been attached to his <UNK> with a <UNK> action <UNK> in other words <UNK> up the car won't trigger the explosion the explosion comes ten seconds later andy and brick rescue <UNK> before the car blows up earlier <UNK> had agreed to let her father handle his problems without her <UNK> dad i know you think i'm doing a man's job but i'm not going to sit on the <UNK> just because i'm a woman <UNK> tells him after her near death experience <UNK> <UNK> to learn who <UNK> her father's car she an old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to <UNK> the information only after <UNK> has ground the guy's face into a bucket of dust does he and tell her about a pay off at the town's <UNK> museum brick <UNK> <UNK> and shooting ensues with a <UNK> pilot getting away by the skin of his <UNK> br br later pilot sends a <UNK> of out of town contract thugs armed to the teeth to trash <UNK> office these <UNK> ignore their no kill orders not only do they shoot the <UNK> company office to <UNK> but they also blast <UNK> dad with a shotgun <UNK> <UNK> in short order wielding her <UNK> <UNK> revolver she guns down three of the four <UNK> dirty harry style the last hit man <UNK> his weapon and <UNK> for mercy <UNK> has her finger on the trigger when homicide detective phil jackson charles <UNK> of <UNK> and a uniform cop arrive on the scene at the hospital andy <UNK> dies holding his daughter's hand naturally pilot is furious at this revelation and his fury borders on <UNK> afterward <UNK> tracks down a <UNK> shark walker christopher joy of <UNK> jones and information out of him about the pilot while she holds him at <UNK> in a car wash this is one of the better staged scenes with lots of ominous shots of the car wash equipment <UNK> and <UNK> walker warns pilot about <UNK> pilot and his henchmen confront <UNK> in a parking lot and <UNK> lead <UNK> <UNK> on foot to a nearby carnival while the police corner one of <UNK> men she deals with the others pilot shoots one of his own accidentally and <UNK> runs him down she <UNK> pilot to a roller coaster track and threatens to hold him there until the roller coaster cuts his head off pilot manages to escape after he has <UNK> his guts to <UNK> about the identity and phone number of the big man shark dick of the whose reputation is so <UNK> that detective jackson describes him as the guy with all the right answers <UNK> baby isn't top notch pam <UNK> however the idea that our heroine can handle everything by herself without help from guys makes it interesting as well as entertaining chick flick
<START> this is another of those rare movies one feels grateful to be introduced to instead of the usual hollywood tripe it really is a roller coaster ride as we follow the effects of a a <UNK> 500 euro note on a <UNK> of people one asks <UNK> <UNK> all the time but it certainly is a <UNK> effect captured on film it'll have you laughing crying and biting your lip i loved every minute of it and thank you <UNK> australia for showing films that are truly entertaining even worth the effort to read the subtitles the only downside to my mind is that i wont be <UNK> a holiday to the frozen land they all seem to be far too depressed must be all that cold weather either way watch it it's worth every second
<START> pretentious <UNK> <UNK> herman <UNK> about a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his <UNK> mother getting transferred to his long lost sister who has been raised by <UNK> or something like that  not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi layered plot <UNK> out with pornographic sex scenes pseudo symbolic imagery the siblings swimming in a river of blood and other bizarre touches a gypsy child repeatedly insults <UNK> by in the street until she is <UNK> beaten to death the <UNK> music of a rock group <UNK> in the <UNK> of old buildings considering the source material and the presence of catherine <UNK> who at least gets to <UNK> in the nude i was expecting a lot more from this one apparently there's an even longer tv version of x out <UNK>
<START> contains 1 spoiler market with br br not presenting itself as yet another remake of the interview five fingers actually is alas besides maybe the <UNK> of physical torture it never adds anything to it's <UNK> accomplishment in terms of suspense plot or performances in fact five fingers never gets anywhere near its level br br what i found to be in particular painful to watch wasn't the torture itself but the way ryan <UNK> acted out his ordeal to me it looked as if <UNK> tried too hard to get his accent right and it made his performance amateur which in turn even dragged down the performance of an otherwise great <UNK> <UNK> accent btw being far from anything near dutch sounded more like eastern european br br besides the acting of which to my surprise turned from poor to actually decent towards the end there is the matter of the flashbacks with the hackneyed dutch scenery if these scenes were set in switzerland they would have had the cast eat cheese on with endless <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> wearing expensive scenery aside the way these flashbacks pushed the plot didn't work for me at all it made it being served like french <UNK> at a drive in and caused the build up of suspense to br br admittedly the movie did become more enjoyable as acting improved but i couldn't help being annoyed every now and then with scenes that were just too implausible e g br br start spoiler br br at some point after days <UNK> is almost <UNK> washed by the female terrorist this only to be followed by the <UNK> <UNK> of yet another finger why give the guy a wash if he's in for a torture and the <UNK> of that last finger seemed to only serve the title of this flick anyway i mean he was practically begging to have it <UNK> off didn't make br br end spoiler br br what ultimately kept me watching was the performance of <UNK> who once again proved to be a brilliant actor but who also had the best part of the script to work with br br all in all one is just far better off seeing the interview with that other matrix icon hugo <UNK> and when you do i'm confident you won't find this review that <UNK> br br 3 5 10 br br the interview 1998 www imdb com title
<START> like many this dung heap caught my eye while i was channel surfing it's a horror film set in the woods it has a stupid title but hey michael <UNK> is in it and he has been a part of some great horror flicks i know he wouldn't steer me wrong ugh the most insulting part of this is that i actually watched it i see director johnny martin is a <UNK> well this stunt simply sucks and how he got some of the actors to do this <UNK> <UNK> movement is the biggest mystery of all i can understand casper van <UNK> but shame on you mr <UNK> your good name in the horror community has been forever <UNK> and your agent should be fired immediately i'm sure this <UNK> of <UNK> matter is available on dvd but if you enjoy the 99 <UNK> menu at <UNK> you'd get more for your money there
<START> its a very sensitive portrayal of life with or <UNK> desires what does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid <UNK> one husband finds <UNK> with the immigrant since immigrants don't belong or aren't accepted they don't need to <UNK> and <UNK> their desires the other husband looks for <UNK> in <UNK> and tries to <UNK> his desire into <UNK> it fails of course and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons <UNK> still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her <UNK> <UNK> to her <UNK> desires the mother in her still couldn't find the strength to destroy his myth she sees him as a child who is <UNK> himself in his lust control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up both the wives find courage and <UNK> through their shared <UNK> by their husband br br but the final act of <UNK> was by the grandmother she could not break free from her <UNK> mindset to accept desire a decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the <UNK> of her culture br br seems like it was <UNK> for the to let his desires flow since he's anyway damned by his culture being at the bottom of the <UNK> since there is anyway no respect and expectations might as well taste sin
<START> league of gentleman has been the most disturbing british sitcom to be on t v and how can a funny movie be so bad rated they just have no taste this film will make you want to watch over and over again and still find it funny br br it is surprising that it has done bad but it is british the cinema do crap most of the time but this time it in my words a boost with comedy with a <UNK> over <UNK> this is a top british comedy and better than dodge ball so by this and it won't prove you wrong as i don't really laugh through films but this film was amazing through comedy with the best characters but i was a bit disappointed of how much edward and were in there for back to <UNK> buy this film and it won't disappoint you
<START> someone says this anime could be offensive for girls not really embarrassing situations are funny first time i see this series i was in the video store people around me started laughing doesn't matter the age or gender a teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending shouldn't be obvious by just reading the last page during the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car during the last moments of the series the same car appears episodes had a touching and funny ending specially last one i don't regret to buy these series
<START> in russia in being <UNK> by two sides from the <UNK> by the <UNK> and from europe side by the germans <UNK> knights of the holy roman empire the city of is the last free city in russia the population in order to <UNK> the defense of and the lands of russia calls the prince <UNK> <UNK> who had defeated the swedish in a previous battle his successful <UNK> <UNK> the germans after a great battle on a frozen lake this movie was made in 1938 due to the <UNK> of the german to russia in a pre second world war period the idea was to make propaganda pro russia however it is an overwhelming marvelous stunning powerful masterpiece it is amazing the combat scene on the frozen lake the present generation is very <UNK> to special effects like in the lord of the <UNK> trilogy and maybe cannot understand how fantastic is this black and white fight if the viewer can forget the ideology and watch it as an art he will certainly be <UNK> in the end with such a masterpiece my vote is ten br br title brazil alexander <UNK>
<START> there has been a political documentary of recent vintage called why we fight which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation it is considered both <UNK> and <UNK> in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq yet a far more famous series of films with the same name was made during world war two by hollywood director frank <UNK> although considered documentaries and having won oscars in that category this series of seven films is really and truly mere <UNK> more in the vein of <UNK> <UNK> triumph of the will scenes of which <UNK> <UNK> for his own purposes that said that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries such as the <UNK> <UNK> the world at war lacked nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable they are <UNK> made and after recently <UNK> some used dvds at a <UNK> store i found myself with the opportunity to <UNK> a free dvd with my purchase i chose <UNK> dvd's four dvd collection of the series br br rarely has something free been so worth <UNK> while there are no extras on the dvds and the sound quality of the <UNK> <UNK> these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago when racism was overt as in many of the classic warner brothers pro war cartoons of the era and there was nothing wrong with blatant <UNK> of facts the seven films produced between 1942 and 1945 are <UNK> to war the nazis strike <UNK> and <UNK> the battle of britain the battle of russia the battle of china and war comes to america br br overall the film series is well worth watching not only for the obvious reasons but for the subtle things it reveals such as the use of the <UNK> for terms like x millions when referring to dollars rather than the modern <UNK> or the most <UNK> graphic in the whole series a japanese sword <UNK> the center of <UNK> yet it also shows the <UNK> of trying to apply past standards to current wars the lesson of world war one avoid foreign <UNK> was not <UNK> to world war two whose own lesson act early against <UNK> has not been <UNK> in the three major wars america has fought since korea vietnam nor iraq the fact that much of this series <UNK> on the <UNK> of the times it was made in only <UNK> its historic value in today's information <UNK> times it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a <UNK> position nor will you be the last
<START> and i'm so disappointed because i can't seem to buy the dvd or vhs of it anywhere br br its a kind of mix of uncle buck and the great <UNK> and molly <UNK> is fabulous as the <UNK> teenager this was made when molly was still a brunette just before she hit the big time with pretty in pink br br i'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy with an edge br br if anyone has a copy of this or knows where i can get one please leave a message for me it'll be much appreciated
<START> <UNK> todd is in my opinion one of a few perfect musicals like my fair lady and west side story it has a wonderful intelligent score it offers the two leads and several supporting characters interesting roles it has a timeless theme revenge it has a good deal of humor and is just as powerful when presented simply or on a grand scale br br <UNK> todd tells the story of a simply <UNK> man during the industrial period in england it shows <UNK> <UNK> to man how in <UNK> own words there are two kinds of men there's the one staying put in his proper place and the one with his foot in the other one's face in an effort to correct the wrong that was done to him mr todd devices a plan to seek revenge with the help of mrs <UNK> who owns a meat pie shop under mr <UNK> <UNK> they set out to have those above serve those down below br br i was fortunate enough to have seen the original broadway version eight times six with and lansbury the other two with and i saw the revival with bob and beth <UNK> and several other concert versions br br while the technical aspects in this production are lacking to say the least i believe that this filmed production version is the best lansbury and were the two best in these roles and they have a wonderful time playing off of each other br br very good supporting work by ken <UNK> and edmund although <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> as the young lovers have absolutely no chemistry and are basically unwatchable br br 9 out of 10
<START> tale about how the hell of the war can drive a sensible couple of musicians to the with many memorable scenes throughout the film i found particularly remarkable that close to the end where and von <UNK> go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea a fascinating masterpiece
<START> this movie is just about as good as the first jackass but with slightly more disgusting skits i wouldn't say this was as good as the first but it came very close jackass fans will not be disappointed but if you didn't like the first movie you will hate this one there are scenes that will be seen as jackass classics the elderly suits with <UNK> the cab ride and many others and those that you will wish you never watched eating crap drinking <UNK> etc overall this movie was a good watch and i am glad i got to see it i'm sure this movie will not have the best rating due to critics that rate it i sat in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted but don't let that stop you from enjoying it
<START> <UNK> jackson isn't completely unwatchable but either the version i saw on dvd was edited with a <UNK> <UNK> or the screenplay itself is the lowest level of <UNK> house <UNK> <UNK> or maybe both br br <UNK> bell is supposed to have been a <UNK> at one point in her career and the movie makes the most of the connection by displaying her breasts at least two times more than was really necessary including a hilarious topless fight scene that i am pretty sure was meant to be funny i will admit they are quite nice still she's sort of average looking and doesn't have the charisma of a <UNK> brown of even a <UNK> jones she does have her moments as an actress in the film though but it would have been nice if the director had pushed her a little harder or the screenplay had given her a chance to do more than <UNK> attitude and kick people br br speaking of kicking people the fight scenes the other <UNK> reason to watch a film like this are pretty poorly done there's no real choreography to speak of here just people posing and sticking feet and <UNK> in the general direction of their opponents one minor exception is a nice moment with an <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> knives another is a sequence near the very end where an obvious stunt double for bell and maybe for stan shaw leap around and do some decent <UNK> and <UNK> for a minute or two before bell jackson punches her <UNK> <UNK> out shaw <UNK> and the screenplay just stops again i will admit that this is very much in the tradition of shaw brother <UNK> since time <UNK> br br there are a couple of supporting actors who are actually better than the film deserves i'm thinking of joe and the fellow playing the drug <UNK> right hand man there's a halfway decent <UNK> laden soundtrack that <UNK> the action on the screen and add a star to the rating by itself there's a semi dodgy sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself br br this one is strictly for hardcore fans of <UNK> i saw it out of sheer curiosity and i'm not sorry i took the time but i can't imagine wanting to take the time to see it again unless i decide to write a <UNK> on the pop culture <UNK> of kung fu theater and <UNK> brown
<START> i would hope so and how can i get involved br br this movie is a classic and <UNK> with laughs adventure and an all star 80's cast br br what happens when you get together a group of <UNK> and a group of <UNK> <UNK> a band of <UNK> and couple of br br a load of laughs that will have you begging for more br br david <UNK> stars as adam the leader of the yellow team a kind and hip college <UNK> who helps students with everything from getting the classes they want to first dates br br his nemesis is harold the leader of the blue team played hilariously by stephen <UNK> of <UNK> 5 fame the no good son of a wealthy former college jock with enough <UNK> to make any hall of jealous br br pit these two against each other and throw in a red team a white team and a green team an unbelievable view at an <UNK> consequences of cheating at golf a super tour at the <UNK> blue <UNK> beer factory and a hateful old <UNK> among other adventures and you have all the <UNK> of a night to remember br br look for appearances by michael j fox eddie and director andy <UNK> in one of the last movies he acted in before becoming a director and you have an all star hilarious cast br br the only down side to this movie was debra performance as laura she terribly <UNK> but the rest of the movie is so good she can simply be ignored br br i own this movie and can never watch it enough br br
<START> a lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to china captures the <UNK> of film's first audiences pretty much as it's described to have been worldwide and uses actual <UNK> films for most of the <UNK> i don't agree with other people about bad acting on the british <UNK> part i thought he was fine but the chinese lead really stole the show in any case i found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie people who fear subtitles might note that a lot of the film is in english which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the chinese on the dvd
<START> this is a well done action movie there are plenty of fight scenes the acting is convincing for this genre and is awesome i don't know why people feel compelled to trash i thought his effects were executed very nicely and his design looked great the plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie br br having said that i must tell you richard sun is one of the worst actors from hong kong i have ever watched at least had the right idea by killing him now for all of you who thought sam lee alien was a bad actor he wasn't meant to be taken seriously i have just had the pleasure of watching gen x cops prequel and sam lee played the same character the same way br br now please all of you guys who watch highly reviewed oscar winners do not judge this is a thinking man's movie it isn't supposed to require thought just meant to be enjoyed that's all i hope they make another soon
<START> i'm generally not a fan of high school comedies they rely heavily on humor in bad taste and rarely stray far from clichéd story lines and characters and downright dull dialog however i've had my share of guilty pleasures particularly when i was still in high school myself seeing the oh so recognizable teacher figures get their <UNK> kicked always <UNK> me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case these movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instantly likable one this was not the case in especially not the protagonist of course it didn't help that the actor in play was one of the most irritating no talent arrogant kids i've ever seen in a comedy br br to act in a comedy is no joke it's hard to be funny the delivery has to be just right or the material goes to waste in this case there wasn't much good stuff to begin with and the jokes that were half funny were screwed up <UNK> by the cast br br this movie felt 3 hours long the director never heard of pacing obviously stay away from this one there are many other enjoyable teen comedies out there such as 10 things i hate about you who's your daddy and <UNK>
<START> the lives of <UNK> jackie and dylan <UNK> elliott change in the <UNK> desert between reno and las vegas they stop to eat at a small <UNK> <UNK> where they reluctantly learn about the infamous area <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> jonathan <UNK> after getting back on the road in their forty year old lincoln the radio gets a little crazy <UNK> hitler's speech at the <UNK> <UNK> and then later a 1958 news <UNK> of elvis <UNK> being <UNK> into the military the car slowly breaks down and the two are in for the scare of their lives as mysterious <UNK> things happen in the lonely radiation <UNK> desert <UNK> of nuclear testing <UNK> meets a lost little girl <UNK> <UNK> and a wounded wwii soldier the nightmarish journey doesn't end there is impressive to a degree and writer director james lay makes good use of <UNK> <UNK> tunes all in all moderately interesting sci fi
<START> i enjoy the show surface very much the show is very entertaining and it's a clean show a show like surface is interesting it keeps my attention it has compassion and suspense i love all the cast members that are on the show they are all very good choices i think it is very important to have the right cast of any show because thats what makes any show a success and of course the scenes and the show itself television has changed so much over the years it has changed in good ways and in bad i love to watch some comedy action suspense and romance and scifi but surface is a show that i hope comes back for many seasons because it is a great show and its something that families can watch my children are grown but my husband and i enjoy watching these types of shows i appreciate your time and letting me comment my opinion br br thanks br br <UNK>
<START> the not the best movie in the world that was an understatement i personally didn't like this movie at all not because of the story line not because of the graphic violence and the nudity the nudity didn't really need to be in it it did nothing for the story except maybe the girls were going through a rough time and being naked probably messed them up even more but one of the things in the movie that i hated was that it was <UNK> dark you couldn't really make out what was going on i think if it wasn't as dark and you could see where they were then it might not have been so bad all you know that its a basement somewhere you see no house no road the killer in it all you could see was half his face for about 5 seconds i wanna see some stuff in a movie it gets boring after 20 mins of pretty much darkness and all you see occasionally is a <UNK> or a wall then you will hear the girl <UNK> there was nothing that really stuck out to me that was good about the movie maybe the suspense in the first 10 mins of the film but not the suspense of how the movie is going to end but the suspense of will i get to see anything in this movie but a few naked bodies and various flashing lights but honestly people this was a saw meets blair witch project wannabe both top notch movies and both with the correct lighting to figure out what was going on forget this movie if you can see if your a blind person you might wanna rent it to hear the screams if your into that sort of thing but then again if you are blind your probably not reading this either so anyway bad movie
<START> a lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie but i feel this is only secondary it's really about living in japan and it really succeeds br br i spent a few years living in japan and i suppose the reason that this movie didn't do too well is that you sort of have to have experienced japan to get it i was watching this with a well <UNK> friend who's never been to japan and he noted that many of the events in the movie were so ludicrous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief my <UNK> was that those events were the absolute <UNK> truth about life in japan br br i think that this movie is definitely worth watching especially if you've lived in japan or are interested in it
<START> the story is incredible it begins with a new kid in town named roy while on the bus to school he notices a kid running with no shoes and on that same day he breaks the big bullies nose who is trying to fight with him roy soon discovers that kid is a runaway and he and his step sister are trying to mess a construction sight that could kill all the beautiful <UNK> that live there roy decides to help them him there fight can they win this fight before the smart but bumbling cop dave luke wilson stumbles on to them an enjoyable film funny and adventurous i do admire luke wilson for taking this role i don't think his brother owen would even take this role
<START> i recently picked up all three <UNK> films in one box set rather cheaply and the only reason i did this was for the special edition of the superb first one i have seen <UNK> 2 before but not for 17 years the year it came out i have never watched it since because i can still remember how disappointed i was when i discovered how appalling it really is its a complete mess really it has all the signs of a troubled production with so many sub plots going on at the same time it has a very uneven tone also and it is also one of the <UNK> films i have ever seen i don't mind a little violence the first one was incredibly violent but this one is just plain nasty also the <UNK> is terrible even for 1990 say hello to bad stop motion also having a drug dealing <UNK> kid as a villain is just a little too much peter <UNK> at least had the common sense not to return for the next one the only positive thing i can say for this film is it does have a couple of nice gags like the thank you for not smoking one and the kiddie baseball team robbing an <UNK> store to quote the kid who plays the villain it sucks
<START> latter days is the best gay movie of the homosexual genre most of the films <UNK> sappy stories one night stands and let us not forget infamous baseball teams latter days actually contains male affection beyond the kiss in the dark and quite graphic material that made me wonder whether the film <UNK> at blockbuster or com the films emotional journey is what sets it above the rest in the genre not until this film had i seen a story of such intense passion and love and the torture that it can bring i think when people cry during movies they should be beaten but i found myself <UNK> throughout several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world in which we live i suggest every gay male see this film and if you have a boyfriend thank him
<START> i would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie if at one point or another you thought you've seen good camera work be prepared to be amazed by this movie for the record this movie was made in 1957 in russia but the technique used here is probably something that we've seen much later in the western world about 20 years later the level of emotions through the film <UNK> quite a lot happiness love war despair joy but in the end you remain with something quite unique the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking the young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similar even though i think movies like this are very hard to come by if you've seen i am cuba then this movie would appeal to you very much but if not be prepared for a unique experience the russian directors have something in common very small budgets great actors and a joy of creating art and yes they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together i am not a big fan of russia actually i hate everything that's communist but the film making in that part of the world manages to create such feelings that are hard to describe br br enjoy it br br
<START> could easily have been better in fact maybe so much so that if the filmmaker hadn't tried even as hard as he did it might have actually been better br br on a good note the lighting was reasonably okay but pretty much everything else was lacking <UNK> camera work yeah yeah i know that's supposed to be the style now poorly recorded audio and editing that looked like someone watched too many <UNK> <UNK> movies which are some of the worst edited movies to sum it up the movie seemed to be a <UNK> for the director writer main character to get some young women naked put them in fake bondage and <UNK> them while saying menacing things
<START> black dragons 1942 william <UNK> bela lugosi joan <UNK> <UNK> moore br br just prior to the start of world war ii dr bela lugosi a world famous surgeon is brought in by <UNK> black dragon society as part of a secret plan dr <UNK> on six black dragon society <UNK> and transforms them into exact <UNK> of 6 high <UNK> american <UNK> who are replaced by these look with their <UNK> in place the black dragon <UNK> plan to <UNK> the american war effort appears to be set but the f b i chief and an agent begin to piece together the clues that hopefully <UNK> this sinister plot according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br that synopsis gives away the entire ending which in this case might be a good thing black dragons is an incredible wildly inconsistent <UNK> a <UNK> course of action would have been to stay with the <UNK> supernatural angle in early scenes mr lugosi as <UNK> <UNK> is effectively creepy confusing joan <UNK> as alice <UNK> future lone ranger <UNK> moore as dick martin along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans do the best they can with a story that looks as if filmmakers were making it up as they went along
<START> when i sat down to watch greek for the first time i wasn't expecting a show with complex characters intriguing plot lines and impeccable writing but that's exactly what i got br br greek follows several college students who are in the greek system at <UNK> university rusty <UNK> enters <UNK> as a <UNK> science major who <UNK> to be in a <UNK> his older sister <UNK> the show's center and soon to be president of zeta <UNK> zeta the most <UNK> <UNK> on campus isn't exactly supportive of his plans in fact none of her friends even knew she had a brother until he set foot on the college grounds on top of dealing with the fact that her <UNK> younger brother has been forced back into her life <UNK> boyfriend <UNK> <UNK> soon to be president of the <UNK> on campus <UNK> <UNK> is cheating on her with a new <UNK> rebecca logan diabolical president <UNK> is <UNK> her to stay with him and she still has feelings for her <UNK> ex boyfriend president of the party house on campus <UNK> <UNK> these characters are joined by <UNK> <UNK> an athletic intelligent friend of who happens to be gay <UNK> die hard christian and possibly racist roommate and best friend and <UNK> <UNK> quirky best friend and <UNK> br br throughout two seasons or four chapters viewers are often reminded that college life is not black and white but in shades of gray from here on out every character makes their fair share of mistakes but every one of them has <UNK> qualities <UNK> and have a complicated but beautiful relationship throughout the series rusty <UNK> and <UNK> friendship is not always perfect but they manage to survive every <UNK> that is thrown at them even <UNK> rebecca and <UNK> the show's villains are shown as human every once in a while br br greek shows college students at their best worst and in between it is a show that reveals college as what it truly is a four year adventure where one's morals beliefs and <UNK> are tested <UNK> and sometimes even changed br br greek has at least one season left if not more before it ends i cannot wait to see where the characters end up next greek is not your typical abc family sitcom if you want to tune in to a show that shows the truth behind human motivation greek is the show for you
<START> firstly this movie works in the fact that it is disturbing i really did not like seeing all these scenes where people get cut up alive etc the <UNK> erotic introduction gives one a sense of wonder it is somewhat to me personally but the movie really works in that respect and it is to be scary so i give it credit for that <UNK> a few points there for those <UNK> and well damned disturbing idea of getting alive br br but what this movie lacks is an interesting plot characterization or real surprises the whole teen flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple predictable way lots of moments creepy guys who are insane and the big question of all is the boyfriend the murderer this movie fits into the category of scream and countless others which have <UNK> over the 90s well i won't spoil it for you but it's not exactly interesting who is the killer we find out who it is half way through and from there on the movie on trying to fill in some time rather <UNK> to say the least i was looking at the clock a bit on this movie br br the lead actress is great as usual but the acting box she is placed into makes one <UNK> in pain the college girl who is a detective who everyone thinks is insane but she is the one who really knows whats going on and the cops <UNK> they just laugh and eat <UNK> very predictable flat disturbing at times and most of all boring and dull it's like an american film company took a flight to germany to shoot a movie to make it foreign hmmm or did they br br
<START> this movie is a cyborg in and of itself half nonsense half lifetime original movie br br as a cyborg this movie has but one objective to make you wish that you had spent the duration of the film in a dark room <UNK> yourself in the <UNK> br br unlike many people i did not rent this movie because of angelina jolie i'll explain why i rented it shortly i am not a big fan of ms <UNK> though i will say that her performance was stellar her blank stare and robotic acting really did have me believing that she was an <UNK> hooker if anyone has a clip of her on <UNK> the actor's explaining how she prepared for this role please send it my way i'll make sure to use it when i try james <UNK> for crimes against integrity br br so what drove me to rent this movie one would think that it was the hope of seeing angelina <UNK> <UNK> but it wasn't no the reason behind this rental <UNK> solely on one of the images on the cover of the dvd that of jack <UNK> face half of his face was robotic when i saw that i imagined <UNK> of slowly <UNK> through a fiery <UNK> laying waste to any humans that were foolish enough to resist in my <UNK> eye every member of this <UNK> army of had a red glowing eye a red glowing eye that looked at humans and saw only meat they were to be the <UNK> of oblivion a cold <UNK> apocalypse a nightmare from which humanity would never <UNK> it's a beautiful image that i will <UNK> till the end of my years br br like most things in my life the actual movie did not live up to my expectations no there was only jack palance and the only visible <UNK> that he had were located on his legs sadly those <UNK> didn't really enhance anything that is unless you count walking like a victim as a super power at least their was a scene where jack <UNK> like a trigger happy <UNK> patient got to shoot the hell out of some people i was waiting for him to yell i'm damn tired of paying too much for <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately any <UNK> of <UNK> rage were few and far between br br what the movie did have an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a man <UNK> <UNK> a k a poor man's de niro and a cyborg angelina jolie a k a demon <UNK> of john <UNK> oh man can the love between a romeo of flesh and a juliet of <UNK> ever be able to last it can if you follow jack <UNK> simple advice you have to taste each other's time br br yeah i'm not sure what that means however i am sure that i do not want jack palance to be the one to explain it to me i sure as heck don't want him to show me as an experiment i suggest that you ask your significant other if he she thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to taste each other's time
<START> lang does <UNK> as well as <UNK> does in the first part of this extraordinary western before <UNK> down into typical <UNK> dark and guilt haunted lang for the finale br br this is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly vance shaw randolph scott is on <UNK> and being pursued we know not why he stumbles on wounded edward dean jagger and decides to take his gun and horse but discovering that is in a bad way decides to fix him up first this is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief <UNK> dialog in 2 minutes we know that shaw is an outlaw but basically a good guy shaw ends up helping on his way to civilization then disappears br br cut to a few weeks or months later with on the <UNK> and in charge of an expedition to lay <UNK> wire going west from <UNK> he hires shaw as a <UNK> who tries to leave when he finds out that is in charge but wants him anyway a debt and <UNK> something quality also hired is a <UNK> son of a <UNK> of the project but <UNK> the richard blake robert young is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting <UNK> <UNK> sequence both of the hires <UNK> for sister sue virginia <UNK> who again not typically seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man the <UNK> between the three men the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and <UNK> types and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of howard <UNK> red river or only angels have wings than most lang but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesn't matter and doesn't alter our pleasure if it does perhaps change our expectations as the more usual themes of the haunted past dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film <UNK> old pals come back to haunt him as the the <UNK> train and its <UNK> move attacks <UNK> on the crew and shaw has to <UNK> with what if anything he is to tell about his tortured relationship with jack <UNK> barton leader of the <UNK> br br beautifully shot in early technicolor and moving fairly <UNK> from sound stages to western locations this is for my money easily <UNK> best western and one of his very best films conveying as <UNK> as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their <UNK> and build a new future scott is as good as i've seen him showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine the inevitable showdown between <UNK> past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary and a surprise even for a longtime lang <UNK> such as myself and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more <UNK> with meaning on the <UNK> of civilization than the <UNK> and the dusty street outside you can get a <UNK> you can feel like a new man but you can't really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back br br genius
<START> terrible below par not bad good brilliant br br warning minor spoilers br br homosexuality these day's is hardly the taboo subject it was over forty years ago however it must be said that perhaps more so in america than say over here in the u k it can still be a <UNK> subject just look at the whole <UNK> of in the some years ago in the us it's with <UNK> and <UNK> that writer paul <UNK> in to the small town mentality of middle america and the way the press in the us as well as in the uk make such a big deal in outing a celebrity you need only look at when will young and stephen of came out of the closet br br the movie <UNK> on howard <UNK> kevin kline a high school english teacher in his home town the local people are preparing themselves for oscar night as one of the <UNK> cameron drake matt dillon came from their town and was a former <UNK> of cameron who plays a gay soldier in a vietnam epic wins the award only to out howard as being gay during his acceptance speech this could not come at a worse time for howard who is just day's away from marrying his <UNK> and fellow school teacher emily joan cusack as you would expect the media reaction is <UNK> and <UNK> life upside down not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay but <UNK> sleazy news reporter peter <UNK> tom <UNK> br br although this was billed as a screwball comedy it's clear that and director frank oz are also attempting to be satirical you only have to look at the early scenes at the oscars and the way the people of home town as well as the teaching board of the school react to his outing br br sadly the film doesn't live up to the promise we see early on in the movie this is a pretty flat attempt to make social commentary out of a wacky comedy a good cast is sadly wasted on a script that never really delivers the amount of laughs and is no where near as insightful as it thinks it br br kline gives us the same kind of endearing performance that he gave us in his earlier comedy making howard an instantly likeable character cusack too is good value as <UNK> weight obsessed <UNK> while tom <UNK> <UNK> very well against type as a gay news reporter bob <UNK> is a joy also as the principal of the high school where howard works it's great to see him on the big screen for a change it's a shame that it had to be this br br the performances as good as they are can do little to rescue the movie from being a rather dull affair while a couple of scenes do offer some amusement namely the inspired scene where howard attempts to make himself seem more <UNK> by listening to a self help tape there is little to enjoy and when things can't seem to get any worse <UNK> to a sickening finale that <UNK> in to over the top sentiment i also couldn't help but feel that my intelligence was being insulted <UNK> appears to be too sleazy a character to become the man who <UNK> his <UNK> before getting a good story while finally come to the rescue in the film's climax seems at first to be too self involved a character to care a <UNK> about what happens to his former teacher after all it's he who caused all the trouble in the first place br br <UNK> and <UNK> isn't exactly dire but when you consider the likes of better work like 'a fish called you can't help but feel that here is a great talent being sadly wasted br br <UNK> rating
<START> holy sweet murder this is quite possibly the least funny movie i've ever seen you can take my word for this as truth because it's playing on television right now it's really one of the most pathetic productions i've ever seen there is not a single <UNK> aspect of this flick it just lacks any humor whatsoever the only good thing it possibly has going for it is that it's so unfunny that it's wholly <UNK> in fact i just sat through some ridiculous sub plot and i can't really tell you what went on the only reason i can even possibly remember having seen this movie is because it's so absolutely <UNK> it will stick in my mind forever based on that alone br br an absolutely must miss if your friend wants to show it to you shoot him and save yourself the boredom
<START> <UNK> sucked i saw this movie last week and it is horrible what bull has my 2 year old was asking me if all <UNK> have and trying to explain to her that this is simply not true and seeing the movie only confused her more br br in addition the violent theme scared my 2 year old they made the <UNK> <UNK> looking and this has <UNK> a fear of <UNK> into my daughter i know <UNK> for a fact are not <UNK> and are natural <UNK> the mother and son who were sitting in front of us were shouting kill him kill him <UNK> in a particular scene in the movie where good vs evil per say br br it is a lion king rip off and they should stop using big name actors for a lame movie steve who has also done thumb movies such as thumb wars and many others are so so bad br br if a good steve movie ever comes out in my lifetime i will roll over naked and swallow my <UNK> and post it on youtube com enough said
<START> oh well its funny should have been a sadistic comedy a lot of horror movies lack common sense but i think a retarded <UNK> would <UNK> his way around this situation don't really expect hitchcock or anything close to this this is a good one for friends but i wouldn't recommend it for anything else this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie the suspense the shock and good characters the killer failed to be the <UNK> force that i expected him to be and he seemed to be the average angry d student able to <UNK> only stupid people and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so called victims br br 3 10 just expect this one in the daily
<START> the first thing i noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up a quality movie all round br br i suppose you could love this film just for its action but i liked it for more than that br br this is a pure thriller horror movie it offers a more fully fleshed script than most horror films do i thought at least the u s version ended brilliantly and was great throughout the story felt honest and brutal br br the film has an excellent tight script that keeps the action moving with believable characters in largely believable situations
<START> i happen to have read all of english released manga i watched the <UNK> film and it was a big steaming pile of turd thankfully actually does justice to the manga i think those who have read the manga will really appreciate this film more as many <UNK> and camera angles are exactly like in the manga and it is interesting to see how the book characters are played in the film this film reminds me of eerie indiana the ending <UNK> to the manga which i was expecting looks like her manga counterpart and her male friend suits the whole very well very creepy i have to admit this film feels like a <UNK> nightmare the kind you have when you were a kid not really scary at all but freaky if you get my drift another great horror from japan get yourself a copy
<START> watching this on <UNK> on demand br br every time i see this musical i am amazed at the songs one show <UNK> after another br br this interpretation is for me magical the songs <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and choreography are amazing for a made for tv movie better than many stage versions i have seen br br the debate over bette just doesn't make sense she is her voice is brilliant and yet full of the pathos of the stage mother living through her daughters i still get tears at the end when she finally has her moment of glory no matter how faded that glory is br br the <UNK> louise <UNK> dance is on now fabulous br br stephen <UNK> is the king of musical theatre his lyrics just roll off the tongue like <UNK> music is perhaps the best ever penned for the stage screen br br thank god we have this masterpiece of the american musical theatre captured on dvd
<START> slow odd film that drags and <UNK> i mean really <UNK> along to its disappointing climax you may expect some sort of punchline at the end but there is none both <UNK> and give awkward performances in fact the film's weirdness may actually be the only thing it has going for it the generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey and there is a truly awful fantasy scene involving a gorilla
<START> talk about creepy if you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in <UNK> later on gets kidnapped there's entertainment for you but only if you like this sort of thing i don't so i thought to be frank this episode was appalling thankfully it's one of a few duff episodes in season 3 and the only charles grant craig episode so you don't get much of this sort of thing in season 3 so overall verdict just read the summary at the top this is a strong <UNK> hell money says hi for worst episode of season 3 to be honest though i hadn't really expected much i wish i could this episode altogether that's one thing they got right the title
<START> when i saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy american movie done on the cheap with appalling actors i was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong the movie <UNK> around or b who has been rejected from all of his <UNK> the actor who play b is very natural and makes his character seem real and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop <UNK> him however loads of people see his fake website and join feeling their <UNK> b can't turn them away much to the <UNK> of his best mate the college is the ideal place with you learning what you want or doing nothing the school faces opposition from the proper college which ends up closing it down the film ends on a high and i recommend you watching it its does have it flaws but it is a feel good cheerful film with a few unpredictable twists
<START> let me start by saying how much i love the tv series the nature of class war was always going to be a subject worthy of <UNK> fun at but this tv series exploits it better than most the chemistry between <UNK> <UNK> and brian murphy was always <UNK> and the writers wrote almost entirely flawless episodes every time in my opinion it is the best british sitcom of the mid to late 1970s <UNK> the likes of rising <UNK> <UNK> nest are you being served and so on with the on the <UNK> series having finished a few years earlier george and mildred became the next pride and joy of <UNK> or <UNK> 1 as it's now known enjoying a four year run on the channel br br the movie however is absolutely terrible in almost every respect the general essence of the tv series has almost entirely been stripped by the writers of this abysmal movie who anyone will immediately notice are not the same ones who worked on the series as one <UNK> has already pointed out mildred lacks the <UNK> she had on the tv series and does not come across as anywhere near as overbearing br br the plot instead of focusing on the class war with the that was the very foundation of the tv series actually writes out the almost entirely after the first half hour the plot if you can call it that consists of george and mildred going on holiday to some hotel and getting mixed up with gangsters first rate talent in the form of <UNK> kenneth cope david barry and sue bond are all wasted here most of these are well past their <UNK> and all of them look very embarrassed as if they very well know that the only thing worth hanging around for is a paycheck which probably won't be much br br the jokes and gags in the movie if you can call them that rely heavily upon traditional british farce including mistaken identities embarrassing situations poorly timed slapstick characters losing control of what is happening to them and general confusion and it all fails miserably as another <UNK> has pointed out it seems as though the writers of this movie have never seen an episode of the tv series and instead crafted out a something resembling a carry on romp the scene where george is stripped down by sue <UNK> character is particularly out of context br br a mystery surrounding this movie is the <UNK> <UNK> provided 15 just why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless non vulgar entertainment br br not surprisingly the era of sitcom spin of came to an end not long after this movie was released shortly after the sad death of <UNK> <UNK> and the company behind this movie hammer well known for producing first rate horror movies back in the 1950s to mid 1970s soon disappeared into total obscurity br br all in all the movie is a near total <UNK> my advice skip this and stick to the tv series you won't be missing anything i assure you
<START> somewhere on imdb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times spielberg <UNK> and others are named there the greatest argument was around spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director the problem with spielberg is that while he is a master <UNK> most of his films lack depth saving ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view but its message is dull and while its very entertaining it doesn't make you think about anything an is the best movie i ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things starting from war in general the clash of <UNK> the condition of soldier in is a soldier a hero or an assassin brando says he is neither the french lady says he is both and many others the problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false but a great movie and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments not to solve them maybe coppola is right or maybe he isn't nobody holds the truth anyway you can watch this movie for its outer beauty amazing scenes great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied but what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality you can't help but make a comparison with the recent <UNK> documentary both <UNK> and moore tackle similar issues but while <UNK> presents matters from an outside objective point of view moore takes a very <UNK> position that really <UNK> the whole point of a documentary it is really a shame that a film like <UNK> 9 11 won a <UNK> award like cannes but anyway if you want to start to understand a little of the vietnam war the iraq war the second world war and any war in general you should definitely see this movie and not the other one
<START> this video has audio that is meant for someone to hear during their sleep and the same can be said for the video br br morgan and his wife pretending to rough it at minimum <UNK> jobs with a camera rolling and his little poo complaining give me a break they are both rich they are sitting in their fake <UNK> month apartment filming this with their 1 000 month each video crew of 12 br br i used to respect morgan but now his 30 days experience is nothing more than trying to fool any <UNK> viewers who are willing to be fooled br br c'mon morgan you are being filmed doing a 6 00 an hour job and you are being paid by naive <UNK> who don't see those big cameras filming the whole thing and we aren't to think they aren't paying you under the table
<START> the <UNK> war on everything 5 words that i love to watch the <UNK> war on everything is an excellent australian comedy as the name suggests they <UNK> war on everything they seem to love hitting the most of all br br the <UNK> is one of the best comedies i have seen and is the top of the line in australia it is on the australian <UNK> abc which is where some of the best comedies are br br it has won the australian film industry <UNK> awards but did not win the best comedy at the br br last year 2006 the <UNK> was aired on abc on friday nights when everyone was out so no one could watch it well they have been moved to <UNK> nights at <UNK> a <UNK> better <UNK> and the best thing is if i miss an episode or even just want to see it again i can <UNK> it from www abc net <UNK> <UNK>
<START> and it's a good one too in fact this may be one of the best studies of sexual <UNK> ever made it's extremely well acted and has some downright chilling moments an often overlooked film in clint eastwood's filmography and <UNK> of him to be sure but if you're willing to accept him in such an ambiguous role it's certainly very gripping
<START> i really liked this movie but the ads i saw implied and one published review actually said that this movie benefits from a light touch that to me is very misleading br br there is indeed plenty of humor eccentric un subtle sometimes somewhat twisted humor the kind of humor i generally find very appealing indeed but most of the humor is the kind that appears conscious at all times of things deeply serious deeply sensitive even deeply painful the movie weaves together themes of past and present perception and truth memory and activity life and death the entire movie is <UNK> by the history of european anti in general and of the holocaust in particular br br how can humor and horror be combined in the same movie the review i saw suggested that the humor is <UNK> i don't think this is the case at all at least not in the common sense instead i think this movie stands in the tradition of much jewish <UNK> literature and theatre i don't claim to be any kind of expert in this area but from what i've seen humor is used in this cultural context both as a <UNK> tool for the horribly tragic experiences of this people and also humor is used as a means of recovering the divine for men and women who choose a path of faith rather than a path of either despair or <UNK> see <UNK> on the roof for humor used in both ways in this rich tradition br br <UNK> wood <UNK> wood wears horn <UNK> glasses that really make him look well strange compare sin city when he wore the same kinds of glasses with chilling effect in this movie it's easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his search and for his struggle between perception and truth eugene young alex and boris old alex are both really just wonderful <UNK> and young alex are from the same generation yet seem so very very different and then find that they are not so different after all and the way in which the apparent narrative voice changes gradually from that of <UNK> to that of young alex as a journey of intended discovery for <UNK> becomes one of discovery for both young alex and old alex is to me so very moving br br there are some wonderful scenes and <UNK> from i'm told <UNK> and <UNK> standing in for the <UNK> of the story line all feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place although i've never been myself to the <UNK> and can hardly <UNK> to this from first hand experience br br all in all if you're looking for light comedy i would not recommend this movie at all on the other hand if you are interested in a wonderful delightful and deeply moving film please check out this wonderful movie
<START> this film holds 7 0 rating on imdb so even i <UNK> something rotten in it's synopsis i decided to try it out what a waste of 100 minutes first of all the 80's were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre most of these in those days were badly done with silly plot if they had any so there are very few that can stand out and even if they were good they are still not very good the hit however suffers from everything that made silly crime pictures silly it has poor character development improbable plot and wasn't written or directed in a decent manner and when you have such shortcomings the acting doesn't help stephen <UNK> often tried to <UNK> french new wave in english style film making and the two don't match br br first of all <UNK> <UNK> is 10 years in hiding because he <UNK> against some of his former partners in crime he hides in spain of all places he is finally caught up with and than first kidnapped by a group of silly looking spanish thugs just do be driven away some distance to the two hit man that are supposed to deal with him these two are john hurt who is supposed to be hard boiled stone cold killer and tim roth in his first role as the devil's apprentice they don't kill <UNK> right away they first <UNK> of the three <UNK> they shouldn't have hired in the first place and then they are driving <UNK> to paris because one of the buddies he <UNK> against wants to confront him ok that's possible but even with <UNK> being such a dangerous figure that they had to hire four guys to <UNK> him they don't tie him down don't <UNK> him in any way and drive around with him like he's one of the buddies <UNK> doesn't object and is happily going to paris to be shot not using any of a half a dozen chances these professionals offer for him to escape than it appears that tim roth is just a school boy bully making the idea of big crime boss <UNK> him up with a hard core hit man like john hurt even more improbable especially on an important job like that but than john hurt is not so hard core himself he spends twenty minutes of the movie killing or not killing the totally <UNK> australian played by bill hunter whose only purpose in this film is to introduce the lovely laura del <UNK> his mistress who he says is 15 but she looks more like 25 and whose role in the story and acting <UNK> suggest that she was offered the role solely on the basis of being the director's or <UNK> mistress at the time after much <UNK> hurt kills the australian but takes along his mistress for no apparent reason than he wants to kill her but roth with his subtle ways convince him not to so even she kicks him bites him and <UNK> him through the entire movie he stays true to that deeply buried human side of him br br than you have plain idiotic scenes like when hurt and roth lock the car from the outside trying to prevent the people inside from getting out anyway the movie drags on tim roth falls asleep <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with his gun on his chest and <UNK> just waits there watching the <UNK> than the whole <UNK> of a plot comes to the point where everything we've seen in the last hour and 20 minutes just goes out through the window let's <UNK> the whole point in not killing <UNK> right away except for having a movie is to take him to paris so his former partner is to have a last word with him and the whole point in him not running away is that he is prepared to die saying it's just a moment we're here then we're not here we're somewhere else maybe and it's as natural as breathing why should we be scared but my friends here is where the plot twists hurt kills the man while still in spain and we ask why bother and drive around for days he could have done it in the first 15 minutes and than contrary to his philosophy <UNK> is very afraid of being killed so we ask again why didn't he run and he had plenty chance roth gets killed too but he shouldn't be in the movie at all and del <UNK> well she's promised a role in this film purely for romantic read sexual reasons so she stays alive again even she attacked hurt for the <UNK> time in the movie he killed all the others but not her she must have maximum screen appearance the movie was made on a shoe string budget and it shows but when you have no story and card board characterizations it shows even more and yes <UNK> ray appears and goes through the movie as the guest star having a single <UNK> line of dialog awful
<START> i'm really not too sure why people are being so <UNK> about this odd movie having said that i did actually sit through the entire 2 hours and can't say it wasn't entirely un entertaining br br i think the key problem is that frank marshall is not a true director and this is clear in the film he is an experienced producer so will have seen a movie made many a time and will understand what goes into the process but i think this is quite different to being able to truly direct a movie the direction was competent but somehow flat and direction less marshall has more experience as a unit or second director and this came through i feel in the finished product it appeared to be a group of sets that failed to really have any continuity in its feel or its character br br fun watchable but good no
<START> one hilarious thing i'll say off the top is i'm not the biggest <UNK> fan i've actually seen a fair number of his works thanks to a <UNK> the film festival had and i found his films just a wee too <UNK> driven for my tastes so i went into princess <UNK> <UNK> of what i was going to see boy was i knocked out is <UNK> attempt at a musical using the elements of japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements both and visual <UNK> is a treat from start to finish the lead actor joe proves that he's one of the <UNK> actors in japan these days in this role i have to admire that the younger japanese actors still take roles that take place in <UNK> times japan dressing up in samurai gear to full effect the story itself does get a bit confusing if you don't follow it really closely but even if you don't prepare yourself for the <UNK> that princess <UNK> has
<START> very strange screenplay by cameron <UNK> following on the heels of his fast times at <UNK> high has little inspiration and away at dumb gags at least fast times had a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick courtesy of a good director amy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for capturing letter perfect teen speak here chris penn <UNK> brother <UNK> is the goof off who makes life hell for straight arrow eric <UNK> and the filmmakers seem to think he's hilarious jenny wright has some good moments as a mall worker but mitchell smith is lost in a head scratching subplot about a teen who seems to be <UNK> with a shell shocked ex soldier <UNK> confused nonsense given a shiny sheen and a soundtrack full of pop rock tunes but characters one would hope to avoid supporting players <UNK> thompson rick <UNK> lee <UNK> and <UNK> are wasted in stupid roles from
<START> i found this on the shelf and <UNK> with joy i <UNK> up to the counter slapped down my money and ran home you know what i fell asleep less then half way thru tried again the next day yawn what the heck i could not watch it i love all the other stuff he's done i didn't see the one with the monster in it yet what gives is it me or him so sad boo <UNK> p s i did like the camera work
<START> i was surprised by how emotionally invested i became in this film peter boyle is a tour de force as the working class socially conservative <UNK> joe i actually <UNK> with some of his complaints of course he doesn't mention the underlying historical <UNK> economic reasons for many of his prejudices the film also provides interesting insight into the rapid change american society was <UNK> at this time <UNK> drugs casual sex and the challenging of <UNK> authority became in <UNK> and replaced the more time <UNK> traditions of respect for god country and <UNK> susan sarandon fans will be delighted joe is her film debut she also provides viewers with a visual treat near the beginning of the film recommended 8 10
<START> sometimes it's hard to judge how bad a film made in italy or spain really is because they all seem to use the same stable of 9 10 <UNK> trained voice actors to supply the english voices for release in the us and things are always lost in translation anyway dialog character <UNK> and plot elements written for the expectations of european audiences may not go too well with our american ideas of what is funny hip or dramatic i imagine that the team responsible for making the translation for the sound track of this movie to english had about 3 days to do it from start to finish and they probably each earned the equivalent of an installment <UNK> on their used to do it in other words pure tossed off in one or two takes and never reviewed or <UNK> by someone with a real ear for the american language br br watching devil fish i can imagine that if you were an italian watching this presented in your native language you might find it a mildly amusing little piece of fluff you'd laugh at the <UNK> <UNK> and the amusing drunk you'd gasp at the monster and the <UNK> of the bad guys and you'd <UNK> at the attractive pair of peter and not quite <UNK> hannah as they couple on the beach for no apparent reason in the middle of a search for clues about a man eating monster who has already killed one of their friends br br but since the jarring voice acting and tin <UNK> dialog keep <UNK> we americans out of the film experience we can't help but notice that the <UNK> had serious attention <UNK> disorder that no one on screen can really act so much as project an attitude that the stated reason for the creation of the monster makes absolutely no sense that the action sequences have all the impact of a <UNK> bowl full of <UNK> <UNK> and that the director screenwriters and producers really hate women br br don't even think about buying or renting this movie watch only on cable tv on saturday afternoon with one of several beers in your fist or with the help and protection of mike and the <UNK> on mst3k
<START> i'm not sure where to start with this in short it was a disappointing movie having taught the <UNK> i was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie the movie has a couple of interesting lines mainly between alfred and but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically <UNK> the <UNK> br br for one i was expecting an older and a younger in the book is <UNK> but he is described as pure ideal innocent whereas in the movie he <UNK> of sexuality and is a <UNK> he is an <UNK> to he always looks back at him almost in the book it is who steals <UNK> at the boy as for i imagined something closer to the professor turned clown in the blue angel based on a story by thomas <UNK> brother <UNK> than this forty year old with hardly any gray hair in all fairness i do think that <UNK> <UNK> did a good job but either someone else should have done that or he should have made to look older at the beginning br br i know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story but the movie <UNK> the talk about art and the <UNK> between the <UNK> and <UNK> and focuses instead on obsession of and does not justify it i liked the fact that music was used because ultimately he did inspire mann to write his story i'm not sure turning into a musician was a particularly good move or the creation of alfred who i don't remember in the book br br and one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors' lips i was wondering if it was dubbed because i expected it to be in italian but then i remembered that each italian movie i have watched has this problem it just bothers me because these directors fellini is the other person i'm thinking of are supposed to <UNK> perfection in italian cinema and here are their characters laughing without sound then you hear a noise that doesn't <UNK> to their faces i'm thinking of the scenes when almost <UNK> and starts laughing this scene could should have been the strongest but it was annoying instead
<START> this is one of those rare comedies where try as you might you can't help but giggle <UNK> <UNK> and yes even laugh out loud the lead actor's performance as hyde is pure manic genius see if you can keep a straight face when he does his transformation good luck on the downside there are times when the movie does <UNK> down it seemed longer than its 90 minutes
<START> maximum risk is quite surprising to a person that has seen more then on of his movies director <UNK> <UNK> made an average action movie that can be compared with most of the other mid quality action movies what is a special <UNK> to a <UNK> from <UNK> movie it has a quite classy style an interesting atmosphere and last but not least the natasha <UNK> even <UNK> <UNK> make you crying by his acting he does a relatively good job of course you may not compare maximum risk oh what a creative title to <UNK> but after watching knock off it´s the hell of a good movie in special standards of course
<START> time does extraordinary things it's the ultimate judge time has granted married to the mob an extra doses of <UNK> there aren't any dead moments or cheap shots it's more of a delight now than it ever was michelle pfeiffer creates a mafia widow that it's as far away from a caricature as anything she's ever done a true original creation touching or <UNK> at the stereotype just to guide us through but her angela is quite unique the legendary dean <UNK> presents us with a a mafia boss that it's just as <UNK> real as he is hilarious and matthew <UNK> why did i think back then that he didn't have any chemistry with pfeiffer i was wrong they are wonderful together they reminded me this time to the barbara stanwyck fred macmurray of remember the night i'm writing this comment now to <UNK> you to visit or <UNK> this jonathan <UNK> gem
<START> a british twist on harold and <UNK> driving lessons features a in rupert and an over the top julie <UNK> while it is true that is stone faced like a <UNK> benjamin <UNK> for the first half of the movie it does not <UNK> from the quirky family film there are things going on that are out of his character's experience that would create a shell shocked reaction the chemistry between <UNK> and carries the film though laura <UNK> hard work to make her written stereotype human is also notable these performances combined with a fun <UNK> soundtrack with artists like stevens john and <UNK> make this kids popcorn flick worth a saturday afternoon
<START> i admit to a secret admiration of the original love <UNK> <UNK> tv shows mostly because they exhibit the kind of <UNK> <UNK> and bad taste <UNK> with so many <UNK> of their era but i'd be lying through my teeth very uncomfortable position if i <UNK> that this big screen spin off is anything other than an abomination the opening scenes of <UNK> <UNK> are not only pointless but <UNK> as well it's never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people <UNK> each other's houses and nothing <UNK> from there by the time the film <UNK> the oldest joke in the book the horrible dragon of a mother in law turns up unexpectedly to stay is followed by the <UNK> obvious revelation that she's developing a soft spot for the black father moving her <UNK> son to ever greater depths of self righteous ignorant rage most <UNK> viewers will have switched off take that as a warning unless you're keen on spin offs with terrible acting static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning <UNK>
<START> over the years i've watched this movie many times from seeing it on hbo and i now own a copy on dvd i must say it's very memorable and entertaining in the meantime it's interesting and educational too as any tv fan can relate to the time of the early 90's when the time came up to replace <UNK> carson the tv living legend of the tonight show who's it gonna be jay or dave this original film from hbo the late shift stays true to form and depicts the real events very well showing the behind the scenes battle between networks heads of nbc and cbs and even abc they were all fighting for the services of jay and dave the acting makes it seem real as very little actual tv footage is shown with real life people as the actors portraying leno and <UNK> make it seem so real i haven't read the bill carter book so i don't know if it stayed true to the pages but i have highly enjoyed this film over the years from the moment when it starts showing cbs entertainment heads watching leno sub for <UNK> and they decide they want to get in on the late night game yet when carson <UNK> his unexpected retirement nbc wants to stay loyal with leno yet conflict arrives when <UNK> wants a crack at the <UNK> at 11 30 too it was fun to watch the wacky meeting with michael treat williams who makes all networks want to consider <UNK> for a show it was interesting to see the scene of <UNK> telling <UNK> by phone in a direct way to walk from nbc and consider cbs and by the way rich little was terrific as <UNK> carson his portrayal couldn't be matched and plenty of tense moments were provided by showing the <UNK> and firing of <UNK> talent manager helen which nbc heads <UNK> him to do overall great film that showed what tv is really like and it proves that networks are power and money hungry while showing that's it's a <UNK> business clearly there's no business like show business great work from hbo very memorable and a watch anytime it showed the true story of the late night wars
<START> andrew <UNK> is his <UNK> true story about four high school friends who <UNK> to cheat on <UNK> the <UNK> are <UNK> school hating <UNK> as handsome davis his likewise good looking pal matthew lawrence as victor their <UNK> school hating <UNK> <UNK> as sammy and crooked martin <UNK> as the adults include high strung north point principal mary tyler moore as mrs stark and pornography loving father <UNK> dunne as mr davis the high <UNK> begin with mr and mr lawrence supposedly <UNK> on a <UNK> grade book put this one at the bottom of the pile and be thankful it doesn't go on anyone's permanent record br br <UNK> 2002 andrew <UNK> matthew lawrence <UNK>
<START> i really think this movie deserves some oscars i really don't care what people can say badly about this movie because it's a really well played parts from samuel l jackson and mainly by christina <UNK> i'm a big fan of hers right since i saw her in <UNK> family been trying to watch all things she makes and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played i love her looks even though people say she's not pretty i think she is and i love her eyes the movie is about many things people say that is religious people say that it's about racism people say that is about drugs people say that is about <UNK> well maybe is a little bit of all that but what i truly feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what blues is what it stands for and mainly were it comes from life heart pain sorrow and above all spontaneous feelings i hope you get to see it if you are that kind of person that likes a movie not only from the pictures or the story it tells this is a good movie to see if your not well see it anyway cant hurt that much and you get to see christina <UNK> acting so horny she's a fox
<START> is this a bad movie br br of course what were you expecting from a movie called beach babes from beyond br br it is a babes in bikini movie and has no <UNK> of being otherwise given this is not a room with a view or <UNK> list if you wanted a film like a room with a view then you would not be looking at beach babes from beyond but if you are looking for a good babes in bikini movie with almost no plot this is the one for you this flick delivers on what it promises and then some it is pure 100 adolescent fun br br there were lots of babes in and out of <UNK> the movie was quite funny and great to watch these were some of the most beautiful women i have ever seen on home video br br every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this this is actually one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen so <UNK> i say again if you are going to watch only one babes in bikini movie this is it
<START> when the budget doesn't allow for a <UNK> or <UNK> or lincoln or <UNK> <UNK> we are talking <UNK> <UNK> that's bird language for cheap cheap br br what is in the hair of the forty year old teen boy the guy who looks like a <UNK> head who tries a couple of times to run over john <UNK> and provides the only scare in the movie by how close he comes his hair looks like a shoe a <UNK> leather shoe he is a shoe head br br the nurse woman needs immediate <UNK> hair <UNK> she has <UNK> in her blond locks that would <UNK> if the production company had been able to afford lights br br the monster the music was scarier i would try to run from the music the monster probably had better hair than the rest of the cast put some <UNK> on that monster and you've got older sister br br the camera work and editing and plot provided a <UNK> to prepare the audience for the bad music throughout br br hello mr <UNK> we're thinking of doing a sequel to night fright and mr <UNK> <UNK> tom <UNK>
<START> do not avoid this movie simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious it possibly is the worst movie i have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and i were able to laugh at every single moment of this film at times we actually <UNK> whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure that it is not characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly and the vampire assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire you will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the vampire assassin as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts to so if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh then i suggest this one as long as you go in with an open mind don't expect a good movie expect the worst and it will be even worse than that i seriously want to buy this movie and place it <UNK> my comedy movie selection right next to anchorman
<START> i though this film was okay i <UNK> think it was great it was a bit too slow for my taste lots of drama but not very much action until close to the end of the film this movie was basically a dramatic film with the payoff if you can call it that not until near the end to me the scenes of the <UNK> <UNK> and the water <UNK> the town were okay but much too brief the film itself is done okay the acting is decent but it just didn't do it for me in the long run think it had something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension built through the whole movie at least that's what i think the other factor is that i had just recently watched <UNK> <UNK> and its sequel <UNK> 5 these are 2 big budget event movies which in my opinion are a very hard act to follow in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction as a result i have to rate killer <UNK> the day the damn broke at 4 10
<START> i found it almost impossible to empathize with <UNK> character in this film if she was supposed to be a <UNK> i think the screenwriter and director neglected to research before making this film because <UNK> character was more a depiction of a self centered worthless sh than a victim and survivor of depression br br the forced attempt at <UNK> narration was as ludicrous as the <UNK> interactions between her and the people around her br br sorry but i couldn't buy it this is straight to video schlock i'm glad i didn't pay to see this
<START> this was not a very good movie the acting pretty much <UNK> and the effects were bad most of the time but there were some funny moments but most of those were not meant to be funny the most hilarious part of the movie to me was the part were a little kid in wheelchair falls out thats not the funny part what kind of person do you think i am anyway the kid falls out and starts screaming for his big brother well the brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so funny he's all stumbling and really over acting i had to <UNK> it several times so i could laugh some more so if your looking for something to rent but just can't seem to find anything check this one out and watch for the running part
<START> seriously if i wanted to make a movie that makes zero sense never will and features lesbian scenes as its only high point i could have br br david lynch is the worst as is this movie anyone could have made a better movie in which at least some answers were given and the story wasn't so slow and long <UNK> the story means nothing without something at the end besides the credits what a waste of time i will never get those <UNK> minutes of my life back and hope that others can learn from my mistake
<START> there's not that much to say in the end one would have expect much more from a director who made way better movies in the past it just seems like he did it without actually caring the actors are doing their job though <UNK> is far from amazing but you just don't get hooked in a word it's boring this is even more disappointing since i heard several time that this movie could be considered as a reaction to all the big american blockbusters which are considered to be a <UNK> to the french exception by those who just can't admit they should turn to another job i tell you if that's the best reaction we're supposed to get boy i'm going to be really depressed soon
<START> it's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film men are <UNK> chain smoking with one thing on their minds time hasn't changed men all that much but sexual <UNK> has women are in the <UNK> only passing time until they find a husband settle down some of the dialog is cringe worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent <UNK> way i love the opening credits that show a romantic exciting view of manhattan with johnny <UNK> singing the best of everything on the soundtrack i want to jump right into some scenes filmed on n y streets circa 1959 experience a time i've only seen on film in photographs some scenes in this movie reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> working girl especially when hope lange who's a cross between grace kelly <UNK> hart gets bombed in handsome stephen <UNK> apartment he her in just watches her sleep like <UNK> she wants to know if anything happened between them the following day joan crawford is definitely comparable to <UNK> <UNK> horrible female boss except she was <UNK> nasty with a soft core but character was sweet on the outside horrible on the inside i found it <UNK> how the <UNK> parker character <UNK> started out as an independent woman with career goals to be an actress who supposedly didn't need a man to complete her ended up she becomes a stalker lunatic nut job when she lets the man she falls in love with drive her <UNK> after he's done with her i loved the character mary <UNK> the office <UNK> with her thick new <UNK> accent if you enjoy films like valley of the dolls you'll like this one too
<START> i'm guessing that the movie was based on a <UNK> book given the number of characters and subplots during <UNK> i thought that the movie creators perhaps the writer or director intended to create an epic movie but really there wasn't enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story <UNK> there were many unrelated side stories that could have been edited out br br in relating the events leading up to the mass murder of all these <UNK> and officers i don't think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary was it political philosophical revenge the interesting part of historical movies are seeing personal motivations or emotions instead the murderers of <UNK> seemed like <UNK> controlled entirely by <UNK> who's appears occasionally framed as a <UNK> sketch the portrayal of the russians and germans seemed entirely one dimensional are polish people just that angry at the russians besides being badly edited and biased or at least unrealistic choices of music and cinematography felt <UNK> to each other and to the movie itself i don't think you can really shoot an epic war film or war event on hand held camera but if the director went with a character driven story perhaps by focusing on a single family maybe the handy <UNK> approach would have worked better and if you use really dramatic music it needs to be better balanced to the type of shots made
<START> i had a hard time sitting through this every single twist and turn is predictable you're sitting there just waiting for it waiting for it and yes there it is just as you predicted at the very beginning of the movie or 10 minutes out et <UNK> br br smart writing no br br torture porn no there's no nudity other reviews calling this torture porn are most likely written by people on heavy drugs unfortunately there's no torture and no nudity yes no nudity br br there's no suspense at all in this thriller the only good part about this movie is the ending but i'm not going to spoil that br br i'm giving it a 2 10 a 1 10 would be a horrible b movie this movie had better acting
<START> rarely will anyone deny that hitchcock remains one of the most creative inventive and prolific directors of all time because he is arguably all of these things it takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking <UNK> and wearing neck ties <UNK> however is not creative or prolific at all rather hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to <UNK> american pride a certain call to arms support our troops title which was a popular theme of the time with that in mind hitchcock severely <UNK> other important aspects of the film including but not limited to a logical plot characterization believable dialog and a <UNK> running storyline br br typically hitchcock does great with espionage films only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with the foreign and the <UNK> steps but seemingly lost his <UNK> in creating <UNK> and merely recycled the same once thrilling story lines both his previous <UNK> readily provided without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems br br 1 despite having his face <UNK> on every newspaper across america the only person who <UNK> kane is blind br br 2 at the dinner party kane and patricia don't want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were gate <UNK> <UNK> what <UNK> the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening besides does anyone need to be reminded kane is a wanted terrorist br br 3 since when can a fan belt cut through <UNK> br br 4 nobody <UNK> him his face is on every newspaper br br 5 the spies catch up with kane in the ghost town and assume he's the man freeman sent to work with them he have some sort of <UNK> i know spies don't run around with name <UNK> and photo <UNK> but a secret <UNK> maybe br br 6 cop picks up kane escaping from <UNK> house still seems no one <UNK> this guy br br 7 how exactly does the fbi come to believe kane with no evidence they don't even show kane talking to the fbi the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now <UNK> br br 8 when the cops search the carnival <UNK> how do they know kane is now with a woman the blind man believed <UNK> story thus <UNK> would not have reported his daughter missing kidnapped or even more importantly running with kane why does this movie not employ logic br br this is a running list the movie is not exciting the plot makes no sense and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing hitchcock fails miserably on this one
<START> love this little film that reminds me somewhat of the original japanese gem shall we dance not the overblown gere <UNK> remake luckily i found it and taped it when it was showing on a <UNK> <UNK> weekend because as far as i know it's not available on dvd i'll watch just about anything with <UNK> butler anyone remember the short lived tv series mann and machine in it and she positively shines in this she does a dance routine to a disco song that is hot loved all the other characters in it especially the ones played by patrick stewart and leslie caron where's she been all these years this is one of those films that i take out from time to time and always come away smiling after watching it recommended highly
<START> i have now seen the whole of season one and can say i have not enjoyed a show of this standard in a long time it great to see a show like this in the <UNK> and hope that there are many on the way the season final was the best bar none cant wait for season 2 as far as i am things can only get better like how will to change will rick get his family back and how will they get off the church roof with acting of this level it is easy to see why the show is such a big hit with people as long as people as making shows like this i will keep watching i think its hard now to come up with an original idea as so many shows have a large range of subjects so to see one as original as this is refreshing
<START> pretty disappointing i was expecting more of a horror thriller but this seemed to be more of an episode of <UNK> creek but with out the acting there were some very impressive shots though almost worth seeing maybe future efforts will improve
<START> altman's <UNK> has to be considered more than just flawed as so many other reviewers have pointed out the ideas behind the film even some of the choices in depicting those ideas ought to work and yet very little in this difficult film does the partially <UNK> camera lens i <UNK> to my wife that it has to be the most distracting directorial <UNK> i've ever seen never allowed me to get into the film's world br br in general there are serious problems with the <UNK> en scene employed here it's clear that no small amount of thought went into factors like costume and production design but neither is very effective in <UNK> a believable world perhaps it is a matter of scale the film is so stage bound that i laughed out loud once it was mentioned that five million people lived in the city yes i understand the constraints of the film's budget <UNK> paintings here and there might have helped in all the most disappointing altman film i've ever seen great ideas and grand <UNK> do not always come through in art it's just part of the game
<START> if love me tonight is the musical for people who don't like musicals it has to be said that the gay <UNK> is definitely not a musical for people who don't like opera in fact despite apparently being based on a comic <UNK> it is not really a musical at all but a spoof <UNK> story with <UNK> unrelated <UNK> to show off the voice of one character and what a voice it is br br <UNK> <UNK> as the young singer <UNK> who joins the <UNK> <UNK> to get a spot on the radio no the plot doesn't make a lot more sense later on either has a glorious golden <UNK> whose style hasn't dated a day since the era when it was recorded the and of some of his musical <UNK> belong to a <UNK> fashion but it's very easy to picture <UNK> <UNK> out <UNK> <UNK> to a world cup crowd and <UNK> the <UNK> in the process unfortunately while he has an engaging grin and a decent dramatic range he is completely incapable of acting and singing at the same time the result is that the otherwise rapid paced film <UNK> to a <UNK> halt every time <UNK> lays his hand on his breast and starts to <UNK> and the viewer's tolerance of the result is likely to depend on his appreciation of operatic performance br br aside from this <UNK> the film is an enjoyable broad brush satire on hollywood conventions and the mexican <UNK> stereotype in particular which achieves the vital goal of all such spoofs in making its characters engaging enough in their own right to hold the viewer's interest when the joke would otherwise have grown stale the <UNK> chief and his sidekick have the traditional double act relationship there is an enigmatic with a <UNK> <UNK> face and a spirited heroine a young <UNK> <UNK> who performs the generic you say you hate me but you love me really routine with a refreshing twist br br overall the film is entertaining and pretty funny and i feel i did get my <UNK> worth but it can't be denied that the musical <UNK> while admirable in their own way introduce severe pacing problems
<START> this must be the worst thriller i have seen in a long long time the directing the acting and the adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot into a meaningless waste of time within a few minutes of watching the film it was easy to figure out the whole plot and then there are more obvious clues very early on leaving no mystery i guessed this within the first few minutes and i kept hoping i was wrong and much to my <UNK> i was not br br the film starts off with two fbi agents who drive to a remote town to investigate a murderous spree which has left three witnesses a young girl a drug addict and a cop they are interviewed under <UNK> cameras <UNK> and each tells their account of the day each has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts this part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have made this film better br br spoiler the whole story ends in the fbi agents being the actual killers and the young girl is the only one who has figured this out and so left <UNK> by them br br why do they go through the whole <UNK> of <UNK> three witnesses and bonding with the young girl if their idea had been to kill them in the first place how did they get away with pretending to be fbi agents when you discover that real fbi agents had been killed and their <UNK> were found on them how did they know how to set up and use the <UNK> cameras br br bill <UNK> and julia <UNK> are so unconvincing from the beginning to the end maybe the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end come on they both look ridiculous stupid and not sinister in the least the character of the young girl is also wasted potential there is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to bond with in her ordeal she does not appear <UNK> but rather detached which again is not explained br br awful film on the whole
<START> what a bloody <UNK> you can't get on subjects like these with tv budgets and some director who can't tell the difference between a i ii and iii all the silly clichés are well in place on the character and human level the story is so <UNK> and unbelievable it hurts and all those responsible get carried away with joy for the brilliant ratings tech details rubbish flying that close would have kicked each other out of the sky by the dozen single night fighters attacking line ridiculous as i said made up by a director who i bet never even heard the name <UNK> before that project and some kid 3d guys who turned into <UNK> <UNK> but these are minor things compared to the overall mediocrity of this film although it might be too harsh i dare say this hurts the memory of those who died on both sides tv crap entertaining the dumb masses who don't care anyway shame on those responsible use your brains next time and enjoy the profit you made from it
<START> there are 3 of these movies all similarly crafted and each extremely amusing red plays radio sleuth <UNK> <UNK> aka the fox who gets <UNK> into solving real life crimes along with his <UNK> played by your typical wartime girl next door <UNK> ann <UNK> many of the one liners and gags are dumb and probably were in the 1940s which i anticipated but just as many actually made me laugh out loud which was unexpected to say the least red <UNK> has a surprisingly strong screen presence surprising i say because i grew up with a much older version of the man who's charm really didnt play well in my <UNK> years i have to give these movies the go ahead though if your in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare i almost threw in light hearted but in truth people get wasted and beaten up and dare i say it the suspense at times is well above average as with most movies from this era it gets a <UNK> politically incorrect rating for reasons you can well imagine wartime is funny that way i guess and so then again are these movies watch one watch them all
