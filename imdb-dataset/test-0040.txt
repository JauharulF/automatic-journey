<START> the concept of this movie is pretty compelling zombie children climbing out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their deaths in the backwoods of <UNK> cool the problem i had with the movie is the lack of creativity when dealing with the zombies the makers could have really <UNK> this film up with some terror like imagery a la the ring such as stop action reverse camera walking or stuff like that when the zombie children are <UNK> through the woods they look like a bunch of 9 year olds walking to a <UNK> in west philadelphia instead of pick <UNK> and <UNK> they could have easily been carrying baseball bats and <UNK> why would i fear these little kids anyone could just run away in a straight line to safety also who in their right mind would have stayed one night with their children in that creepy run down house the moment i opened that front door and looked around i would have said <UNK> hmm <UNK> hmm son go start the car i'm going around back to pee on a bush and then we're out of here totally unbelievable movie don't waste your time
<START> i really liked the far cry game nice graphics good level design interesting and clever enemies above average length and even a somewhat decent plot i am not by <UNK> against movie spin offs of games i thought doom the movie was hilarious but what uwe boll has done here is to take the game and <UNK> every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible well not the length the movie runs only a <UNK> 90 min the characters are even more stereotypical than in the game which is quite an achievement the entire plot is told without any twists or mystery several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story and come on <UNK> <UNK> soldiers they could have come up with some better name br br however this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene i have never seen anything of the like i could not believe they were trying to be serious we have to get out of the wet clothes i think i'll get <UNK> although everybody is wearing t shirts we need to <UNK> together for body warmth is that your gun but but weren't there people who <UNK> did this there must have been a scriptwriter a director actors a <UNK> an <UNK> some food guy why didn't anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening was this film done by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> film people i won't start at <UNK> about how many logical errors inconsistencies and <UNK> flaws there were but even to the die hard action fan this can't be anything but insulting br br this film did actually ask for being rated 2 out of 10 so i'll do it that favor but that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from special effects <UNK> acting not really references to the game you wish wait they used the <UNK> from the game for the title and the credits that was neat br br if you are looking for a flick for a bad movie night go for <UNK> <UNK> this one is just sad

<START> being a huge die hard monkey island fan i this one would be terrible since ron gilbert didn't make it boy was i surprised although it's still not as good as the first two it has the comedy that i wanted i was a little nervous about the new graphics new engine and just the fact that it was on a cd but it all came together and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters i especially enjoyed that sword fighting had returned and the whole story about finding the big ring was just incredible go ahead and try out this two cd adventure and now we can <UNK> because monkey island 4 escape from monkey island is coming out really really soon this fall
<START> from the portrayals of andy <UNK> in the films i shot andy <UNK> and this is the type of movie i would predict andy <UNK> might make <UNK> illogical <UNK> amoral the movie's almost non existent plot which is sometimes unbelievable is <UNK> by the movie's rough real looking cinematography the film has a way of being unreal yet <UNK> reality to the viewer the only worthwhile part of the movie is the development of the relationship between joe and holly and every thing in it should be viewed as a characterization device there are a couple of comical scenes that i do admit are funny but trash is really just about a character study of <UNK> people that is mildly enjoyable if you do not mind watching nudity and i v drug use
<START> this movie is astonishingly poor it was on television when i tuned in during an action scene and was <UNK> away at the cheesy macho dialogue waiting for leslie <UNK> to appear it took me a couple of minutes to realise that it wasn't actually a comedy it was meant to be taken seriously what has to be remembered is that somebody actually sat down and wrote this movie and worse still other people <UNK> it and gave it the green light br br <UNK> <UNK> obviously doesn't read movie scripts before he signs up either that or he has some seriously bad <UNK> to pay br br strangely this film is so poor that you find yourself staring at it wondering how it actually got <UNK> and how a tv channel must have paid money for the rights to air it the dialogue between hero and baddie whilst trying to shoot each other out of the sky is particularly painful with dialogue sounding like it was generated by a texas speak spell br br the hollywood money machine at it's worst funny though
<START> quirky vulnerable raw honest and a treat to watch i'm not here to give a summary or synopsis of the film i simply wish to <UNK> this small film with the great big heart i tip my hat to the filmmaker and it's excellent cast if you want to know what happens in the film then go see it michael writer director has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter suicide with great compassion comedy and empathy i see a great career ahead for mr this film works right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender honest moments between david and natasha as with every movie we need to suspend some disbelief yet i found with max and grace i was easily transported and completely convinced with it's surreal moments i only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further mr has pulled some wonderful performances from this already talented cast for instance <UNK> performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving the <UNK> <UNK> former mr <UNK> as a terrified patient perfect i can go on and on this independent feature has the star power of a big budget hollywood film however you forget about the stars on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story the real star here is the brilliant screenplay i look forward to seeing more from writer director michael
<START> once again john <UNK> has given us a magnificent film a simple but beautiful story located in a real paradise and the music can't be better stephen <UNK> <UNK> us once more and good <UNK> but why on earth is penelope <UNK> in this film i asked myself that same question while watching this movie of course her greek accent is not believable she's of acting <UNK> not even in one scene not even at the end she did a good job after so many events after years she finally gets to see again and she couldn't change the same face of we had to bear during the whole film anyway cage was very good in one of his best characters hurt also is great in his and the rest of the cast all did a great job so the final result is a movie that really is worth of watching this is a beautiful film that not even mrs <UNK> was able to spoil so far i think it's <UNK> best work so no fan will be disappointed
<START> pointless movie about making a movie no where near the flesh shown in the original which was quite enjoyable and even had fun music not here br br it's always fun seeing the guy though
<START> norma <UNK> <UNK> as she is transformed from a <UNK> house wife to an <UNK> potential <UNK> most 1930 films have a <UNK> edge to them the camera work is pretty <UNK> at times but we must forgive these all talking pleasures for their <UNK> a long qualities as a guest of the eccentric globe <UNK> marie <UNK> <UNK> mixes with an odd assortment of <UNK> types including her long lost husband the dialogue is fun <UNK> times clever and the performances on cue <UNK> and <UNK> shine the most <UNK> even shows off her piano expertise in a musical <UNK> her strange yet appealing <UNK> and affair with the camera are evident throughout and she hits every emotional note genuinely and on target for its time a good show
<START> evil never looked so bad they meant it br br when a buddy of mine picked this dvd up at a half <UNK> book store i didn't know what to expect i mean based on the title i knew it would be worth a laugh but i didn't realize how laughable it would really be br br the first time through i missed some of the dialogue if you could call it that because we were all too busy <UNK> fun at the plot of the movie it seemed like it was written in filmed in less than a week and they hadn't the budget to go back and fix some of the minor flaws wait did i say minor i meant the exact opposite for instance the main character is credited as but several times throughout the film he is referred to as <UNK> br br if the plot holes aren't enough fun for you take a look at the acting nobody seems overly concerned about the zombie <UNK> in their state including the mother of the main character who is missing for days while she sits in front of a <UNK> reading a book br br the constraints that the budget puts on the movie are equally as hilarious maybe they didn't have a <UNK> to film wherever they were because during the big motorcycle chase scene the characters are <UNK> all traffic <UNK> the zombies who had just killed twenty or so people actually stop at a stop sign coming out of a parking lot i don't even do that but then again i'm not a biker zombie the ending of the movie looks like they just ran out of money it ends so suddenly that it leaves you wanting more on second thought it ends just soon enough br br so if you're looking for a good time with your friends seek out this movie it's a great unintentional comedy
<START> most of this film was okay for a sequel of a sequel of a sequel br br i was impressed by the amount of suspense there was i had actually expecting that to be <UNK> out the window in favor of gore gore gore it wasn't but there's some pretty ridiculous deaths br br the thing that i disliked however was all of the plot complications those could have been okay if the <UNK> had taken the time to explain all of them through but what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution specifically why were they <UNK> from michael's damage until a certain point what exactly were they going to do with the baby how did <UNK> lloyd get pregnant for that matter why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant too why did michael kill all his co <UNK> in the end why were there <UNK> in the lab the actors seemed to have figured it all out once they saw the <UNK> but it was never explained to the audience br br if you're just going to watch this film to see people get <UNK> then <UNK> be okay for you however if you can't stand a plot being thrown at you which remains <UNK> by the time the credits roll you should go watch something else
<START> this cartoon documents the second encounter between <UNK> e <UNK> and the <UNK> and is definitely better than their first meeting in fast and <UNK> 1949 br br if <UNK> by aesthetic value then this cartoon would not rank among the top 5 or 6 of the year <UNK> regardless this is a very funny short <UNK> <UNK> chases the <UNK> along the road and gets completely tired out the ingenious scientific latin names of the characters are very original and has been <UNK> before in other un related cartoons the <UNK> <UNK> and puts on a wonderful expression of i don't know boredom such expressions make this cartoon provide more than its fare share of laughs in seven minutes then he has an idea and another laughable expression is worn the slapstick jokes are all hilarious and mask the fact that it is truly evil to <UNK> such pain on a poor helpless genius <UNK> everyone knows but who cares br br the old rocket gag is present too <UNK> <UNK> himself to a rocket which should produce enough <UNK> for him to catch up with <UNK> and grab him instead the rocket shoots up into the air and becomes a <UNK> in the distance eat at <UNK> this classical gag <UNK> from this cartoon though obvious it still makes people laugh br br the highlight truly is the chase through the <UNK> the two wear helmet lights and we see the tunnel through which the two are going with only the lights visible here the comedy reaches a peak a must see sequence maybe even the best sequence in the early days of <UNK> the final touch is provided by the writing of michael <UNK> as light goes out and he <UNK> lights a match in a room full of <UNK> the surface is shown where a bunch of <UNK> jump and spell out the letters <UNK> after the blast such small things make you laugh all through a mere seven minutes and as soon as it starts the all over the rocket <UNK> are another good idea as is the free drink of water and the <UNK> on the tight rope a sequence that appears in space jam 1996 to give the results of those away would be useless the free drink proves to be a problem for <UNK> e at the end of the second last sequence namely the rocket <UNK> br br this classical cartoon is <UNK> with fine animation except for the characters though they are animated very well the two characters are very primitive which might be an understatement though at first it may seem weird the humor of the ensuing sequences makes one forget br br if you like vintage jones watch this if you love <UNK> get this on video excellent entertainment rating 8 10
<START> odd one should be able to stumble into <UNK> only by chance it should be on any best of film noir list including <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> is as good as ever knowing of his dire delicate family situation gives extra weight to his almost <UNK> face and brief dialogues <UNK> restrained performance under firm direction only shows what a wonderful actor he could and should have been br br <UNK> is utterly dry and cold without <UNK> artistic scenery pretty faces and fancy cars it is almost film noir meet neo realism few hard words to his children describing their life of <UNK> from there on get a hold on your throat to the end of the film br br the final sentence of the film a voice over telling of end in no more than ten dry <UNK> words leaves you with a hard punch in the stomach br br a true jewel in the great crown of french film noir
<START> i consider this film to be a complete masterpiece actually i consider it to be <UNK> best work and undoubtedly the best of all portuguese movies i don't think you can come across such a zero budget kind of film as impressive and astonishing as this one br br the direction is done with perfection at an incredible fast pace and the music also composed by <UNK> is mostly excellent the story is creepy and humorous at the same time and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying misery loves company kind of situations <UNK> with a mind <UNK> mystery a more than perfect recipe to <UNK> the <UNK> eyes to the screen from frame one to the last br br it's been called neo hitchcock and i'll agree much like the best <UNK> it kept me guessing during the entire film and most of my <UNK> were far for what ends up being <UNK> revealed
<START> a <UNK> girl yes <UNK> is about as complex as her character gets won't take no for an answer and does quirky things to get her husband back it's too far fetched to be believable with such flimsy characters going through the motions but not far fetched enough to be fascinating in the way that say being john <UNK> was so it ends up boring br br
<START> the main reason for watching this picture is to <UNK> the brilliant performance of s ms <UNK> this film with her tremendous presence as <UNK> the woman who believes in doing good no matter to whom with no strings attached this actress clearly shows a range that is amazing br br thanks to director george wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best black americans actors together this ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place br br of course none of this would have been possible if <UNK> <UNK> hudson hadn't written his wonderful play working with mr wolf perhaps the best theater director of this generation they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of ms crosby when his own parents are not around to take care of him ms crosby becomes the <UNK> mother of little <UNK> in a way he represents her reward for having lost her own daughter br br unfortunately there is no time to develop some of the characters as the action solely concentrates in <UNK> the relationship between <UNK> and the young <UNK> played with such charm by the young marcus carl franklin who is a natural the only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times <UNK> as it doesn't <UNK> or justify what one is seeing frankly just by watching the interaction of the players is self <UNK> br br in the background there is always music no matter what hard times these people are going through but <UNK> house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era br br aside from ms other notable performances are given by <UNK> howard one of the rising stars of the moment <UNK> <UNK> jeffrey wright <UNK> gray louis <UNK> jr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> carmen jimmy and the rest br br ms s deserves to be seen by a wider audience in <UNK> blues she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma
<START> the cast and crew of this cheap horror <UNK> are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself we have barbara <UNK> raymond <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr tom <UNK> paul <UNK> and woody <UNK> in front of the camera and writer director <UNK> <UNK> cinematographer charles van <UNK> <UNK> francis d <UNK> and production assistant herman cohen behind it the ill <UNK> <UNK> turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the african jungle where she lives on husband plantation doctor <UNK> secretly desires her while hot headed <UNK> <UNK> approach is quite literally more hands on on the other hand <UNK> is surprisingly enough the laid back but knowing <UNK> figure and <UNK> is a native police official the plot is very simple but frankly does not make a whole lot of sense after a particularly <UNK> dinner complete with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> art imitating life  more on that later come to blows in the garden over their affection for <UNK> and conveniently for <UNK> a large snake just happens to be <UNK> near where <UNK> hits the ground witnessing the event from behind the <UNK> enigmatic maid a native witch no less for some inexplicable reason puts a curse on <UNK> who has in the meantime married <UNK> that <UNK> turns him into a gorilla starting from his very wedding day when his hand briefly turns <UNK> consequently <UNK> takes to losing himself in the jungle for days on end  even if the ape creature itself is barely <UNK> throughout the film it must be said however that the version that i watched ran for just <UNK> minutes when the <UNK> length is elsewhere given as either <UNK> 70 or <UNK> therefore the film feels understandably rushed and disjointed if never less than <UNK> enjoyable as it <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> shot chasing of <UNK> in the jungle with the former being itself pursued by the gun <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to get back to the film's tragic blonde leading lady for a minute after a promising start in movies next to such hollywood legends as james cagney and gary cooper  in respectively kiss tomorrow goodbye and dallas both 1950  her career soon nose <UNK> into b and lesser grade territory thanks to her own <UNK> off screen antics her most notorious <UNK> was being the cause of a much <UNK> bar room <UNK> between suave husband <UNK> tone and <UNK> former lover tom <UNK> which ended with the former in a coma and <UNK> actually <UNK> him for the latter shortly thereafter but that was not all <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> that woody <UNK> was among her <UNK> a controversial issue at the time short lived husband tone having caught <UNK> on camera spread the <UNK> <UNK> evidence around hollywood and this virtually served to end her days as a <UNK>  her last film appearance being edgar g murder is my beat 1955 which i happen to have in my <UNK> movies pile the last 12 years of her <UNK> life were spent on <UNK> row in the <UNK> of booze drugs prostitution <UNK> <UNK> and even a stabbing  before eventually dying in 1967 in her parents' home at the young age of <UNK>
<START> this is not a movie this is a collection of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world dubbed over with some random text the footage is not that great and the text is not that great either the end product is excruciatingly dull br br on the dvd turning the commentary on can provide some entertainment value as the director makes a rather deranged argument that this is a sci fi movie it's also fascinating to read about the extraordinary risks and <UNK> that the crew endured to collect this footage too bad it's rubbish but i think the making of <UNK> morgana would be a fascinating film sort of like <UNK> wood was
<START> after stabbing a retarded boy the fifteen years old troubled and <UNK> <UNK> p fitzgerald ryan <UNK> is sent to a juvenile <UNK> his teacher and <UNK> writer pearl madison don cheadle gets close and tries to understand him first with intention of writing a book and later becoming his friend <UNK> slowly <UNK> his sad vision of world showing that he is a <UNK> br br the united states of <UNK> is a <UNK> and interesting study of a character the low paced riveting screenplay <UNK> pieces of the story like a puzzle there are excellent lines and dialogs the performances are great although the twenty three years old ryan <UNK> does not convince as a fifteen years old teenager but it seems that a part is missing to complete the puzzle and make the united states of <UNK> an unforgettable movie the disappointing <UNK> of the why for the violent action of <UNK> against ryan <UNK> is not convincing or touching indeed shows that this character is a totally deranged <UNK> with a weird and sick sight of world further the way allen harris gets <UNK> knife is ridiculous my vote is seven br br title brazil o <UNK> de <UNK> the world of <UNK>
<START> for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience okay you don't need to read any further now br br i already guess most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture so i should say is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child discovering the world as you wanted to see it making up your own rules and <UNK> an <UNK> enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time <UNK> away from many of the problems that all age films tackle it never <UNK> all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems br br the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen they are not simple minded arrogant or naive just curious enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with many films regard children from the outside as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter brings everyone back to that world in there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most which the film values with high <UNK> it is worth it to remember to feel it again
<START> i just re watched this thriller one i had previously believed to be one of <UNK> lesser efforts how wrong can you be maybe because i'm older or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing but now i think it's amazing every bit of suspense is <UNK> out of the <UNK> detail and that final scene on the merry go round is just breath taking perfect in every way highly recommended
<START> the only thing in sudden death that <UNK> the amount of non stop action is the incredible number of plot holes what with that and the sheer amount of <UNK> one could hardly call what's left a storyline to say the screenplay has borrowed from the die hard premise would be to make the world's most blatant understatement br br here we have a troubled hero working in the huge <UNK> <UNK> ice <UNK> as a fire marshall on the night of the seventh game of the <UNK> series he gets tickets so he can treat his estranged children to the deciding game and of course spend a little time with them also catching the match but for political reasons is the vice president of the united states raymond j barry when a bunch of incredibly well <UNK> <UNK> capture the v p 's box and demand hundreds of millions in government money our hero darren <UNK> has his plans more than slightly put out br br each time a new one of these formula flicks is made it seems that all we get in the way of <UNK> is <UNK> bad guys and more and more spectacular and gruesome ways in which the good guys <UNK> of them director and his screenwriter have gone over the top not that this is an original sin in trying to make us <UNK> the wicked terrorists the horrible baddies go about shooting the secret service the security and the civilians both old and young with gay abandon and with <UNK> regard for the relative threat of each victim br br van damme <UNK> in plenty of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and death <UNK> stunts the script asks little of the <UNK> european almost everyone else has walk <UNK> apart from powers <UNK> who seriously <UNK> his under written shallow role as the <UNK> <UNK> old ring leader there ever was br br there's a lot of clever cinematography and enough explosive special f x to keep anyone awake but really that's all this action flick has action though there are some nifty sequences nothing could be called outrageously brilliant br br saturday <UNK> 10 1996 greater union melbourne
<START> this is a wonderful old fashioned christmas favorite which i try to catch on tv every year if i can it revolves around a martha stewart like journalist named elizabeth lane <UNK> portrayed by barbara stanwyck however in contrast to martha this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever the other cast members effectively complete the story and include dennis morgan <UNK> jones <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> and sydney <UNK> alexander <UNK> br br elizabeth lane is a journalist who writes food <UNK> portraying herself as a happily married country <UNK> with children in reality she is a single woman living in a new york city apartment and cannot <UNK> an egg her <UNK> are borrowed from her hungarian chef friend felix elizabeth gets away with her deception until the <UNK> of her magazine alexander <UNK> decides he wants a nice old fashioned country christmas and invites himself to visit her bringing with him a returning war hero <UNK> jones a sailor who had been <UNK> <UNK> demands total honesty of his employees to get out of her <UNK> and save her deception based career elizabeth borrows the <UNK> country home of her longtime architect <UNK> john <UNK> a dull <UNK> <UNK> who has long sought marriage she also borrows a baby actually several to pass off as her own and her <UNK> br br of course this scenario makes for much <UNK> it's a screwball comedy and a charming romance with the added attraction of a christmas atmosphere whenever i think of this movie i picture the falling the tree beautifully <UNK> the fire roaring in the <UNK> the turkey <UNK> and christmas <UNK> <UNK> br br why did hollywood feel compelled to do a remake i understand there is a 1992 version directed by arnold <UNK> and starring <UNK> cannon kris kristofferson and tony curtis i have not seen this modern adaptation nor do i wish to this old favorite is perfect just the way it is and a holiday <UNK> <UNK> along with it's a wonderful life white christmas miracle on <UNK> street and of course all the versions of a christmas carol
<START> it's not just that the movie is lame it's more than that this movie is just unnecessary do we need another western how about a western with <UNK> americans in the titles roles sound stupid implausible and a lame attempt at <UNK> the genre it is incredibly lame and simple minded it's like that lame <UNK> film romeo and juliet where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his of a classic tale well <UNK> failed miserably and so does this mess the story is actually not bad however the whole idea of <UNK> the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all <UNK> american cast is racist in itself it's also <UNK> and simple minded like <UNK> man he's a bad director hey i hear you say this was directed by mario van <UNK> he's also in the film how can it be racist it's not i said the idea of casting all <UNK> americans instead of <UNK> was the film isn't racist it's just pointless stupid and very very boring
<START> musical <UNK> are all cut of the same cloth hopeful struggles succeeds and finally wins the girl but this one a life of irish <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> has more going for it than the usual <UNK> it has great charm and great sincerity and is played beautifully by all concerned dennis morgan is fine in the lead as is <UNK> <UNK> as his love interest <UNK> king's supporting performance as <UNK> russell is far better than alice <UNK> leading bio performance in the film dedicated to her career william <UNK> is touching as the aging <UNK> champion william <UNK> and sara is lovely as mother george <UNK> ben blue and alan hale lend good support there are over 25 songs a true treasure chest come down my evening star my blue eyes you tell me your dream wait till the sun shines <UNK> will you love me in december by the light of the moon <UNK> days polly <UNK> the and the robert e lee miss lindy lou if i'm dreaming wee rose of shake hands one little girl a little bit of heaven mary sweet um when irish eyes are smiling mother the fair room in my heart my wild irish rose br br although the film only earned one oscar <UNK> for <UNK> and deservedly it also deserved <UNK> for art direction and costume design <UNK> and lovely in technicolor br br reasons why this is not on video may be due to the large <UNK> of time spent within the <UNK> show atmosphere at least a quarter of the film with a great deal of material quite politically incorrect for today's audiences it's historically accurate however br br this is a true gem and very worth seeking out it leaves one with a warm glow
<START> the death collector is truly a wonderful film labeled as a mean streets ripoff it has some really great stuff in it a lot of the stuff in this movie would later be used by scorsese himself including the actors joe <UNK> frank vincent etc
<START> depressing black black comedy about a woman <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> her house on christmas eve when she discovers her husband tony <UNK> has hired a hit man to kill her she ends up with a husband and wife scott glenn and mary louise parker and then things go wrong basically <UNK> keeps running and is continuously meeting very strange people and getting into <UNK> unfunny situations br br this was advertised as a feel good movie when i saw it around christmas time at its very short run in an art cinema i found it sick unfunny and just depressing i like black humor but this was way too dark for me what happens to <UNK> character especially was horrifying to make matters worse <UNK> brennan is thrown in as a nun later on and proceeds to chew the scenery with gusto br br the only saving grace was acting it's much better than this picture deserves also it was a relief to see the very talented stephen <UNK> pop up at the end the ending itself was kind of nice but it couldn't <UNK> what had gone on before br br sick morbid pitch black comedy a 1
<START> by the standards of hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a big time production studio within hollywood thats where anything remotely close to having hollywood standards ends this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i am not joking the story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that i could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film i know what you're saying its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story it's supposed to scare you well let me tell you something the movie is not even scary in the least bit its too full of stupid bits that <UNK> out the little suspense there may have been the acting was awful as well along with the <UNK> of the murderer who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage <UNK> off throughout the movie i kept getting a sense i was watching something that was thought up written produced and directed by a high <UNK> who watches too much pornography please don't see this movie spend your 8 50 on other things like a snow <UNK> which would be much more worth your while
<START> i absolutely fell in love with living in a big way when i first saw it reason 1 is because i love adore and am a huge fan of gene kelly he was such a wonderful dancer actor and choreographer not to mention his extremely handsome looks and his sensual personality i love his role in this movie he was such a gentleman this movie <UNK> his wonderful talent for acting i enjoyed marie macdonald as well it was my first time of ever seeing or knowing anything about her and this excellent movie made me a fan of <UNK> as well actually the whole cast in this movie was enjoyable and great the humor between the butler and the father mr morgan mrs <UNK> courtroom humor and especially grandmother <UNK> immediate <UNK> to and concern for leo and <UNK> number fido and me is adorable the opening dance number with gene and marie is very nice too i would recommend that anyone see this movie it will truly remain dear to your heart forever or at least it has to mine and you'll fall in love with gene all over again i rate it my 2 favorite gene kelly movie and i've seen and own a quite many of his movies they're a part of my daily routine so trust me when i tell you you'll love this movie watch it and enjoy
<START> the most accurate description of how billy crystal <UNK> in my giant is to say that this movie is to his career as <UNK> was to warren it didn't ruin it but it <UNK> it down a lot crystal should know the three golden rules of hollywood 1 never play opposite a kid 2 never play opposite an animal 3 never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet <UNK> than you is as innocent as a kid and acts like an animal br br what is this story a comedy i guess but i didn't laugh except at the scenes where crystal is on his own and not <UNK> with his what is her role in this movie ex wife or the <UNK> mentioned giant did i mention there's also a kid in this film well forget about him the son is brought in to make us feel sorry for crystal and we do but for the actor not the character billy crystal is a funny man if you don't believe me watch him in old episodes of soap or saturday night live go rent city <UNK> or running scared or when harry met sally br br giant is more ho hum than <UNK> fi <UNK> br br
<START> i watched this series after i had seen the naked gun films i found it much better than the films and i thought the films were great this series literally <UNK> you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun sight gag or funny situation the all night wicker place club <UNK> i don't think i've ever laughed as hard at a tv series in my life even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes i think its a shame that only six episodes were produced but i agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes overall the series is a must see for those who like <UNK> bad jokes and slapstick sight gags
<START> let's get this out of the way so the ones checking out this page looking for info on anything related to the word breasts and you know who you are can move along this is not in any way pornographic on the contrary if this has any value as masturbation material then frankly the filmmaker didn't do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on indeed i would be a little <UNK> of one who came across this on dvd or if it ever plays again late night on hbo or <UNK> and used it as a means for pleasure you might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a pair of <UNK> <UNK> and take them home and squeeze them and uh well you get the idea br br no this is semi serious film making meant for <UNK> late night viewing but it shouldn't have to be just for the late night types this is intimate in setting but not in tone all of the women in all their variety of <UNK> and <UNK> and races and even with one man thrown in with fake breasts have something of value to say from life experience in the most straightforward way if i say semi serious it's due to the several little segments that the director feels she needs to throw in with the <UNK> footage of old how to videos about <UNK> and sex and breasts and super rare cartoons with the <UNK> flying about this isn't a problem but an asset we need a few little visual ways to go between these interviews br br nothing is held back and we see it as <UNK> in a <UNK> form they don't need to cover up and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and <UNK> off they're still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex surprise comfort <UNK> curiosity <UNK> and sadly cancer in that last part there's another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast you know you've become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a semi normal life with one breast the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy <UNK> said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she would have to think about it and you don't <UNK> or go <UNK> gross that's the test folks br br it's not shot under the best of circumstances but then again for tv it's edited with a tight pace it's never dull for a moment and we never feel like anyone is holding back especially when a man might hear the hard truth like that breasts may not really be or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men breasts a documentary is about <UNK> <UNK> with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts laid bare if that's worthy of a i was alone session then well more power to you i guess though it's not the intention
<START> i would probably want to give this movie a zero if not for the climax which involves not really snakes on a train but rather train in a snake the premise was <UNK> up far more than likely over the course of a night of beers after hearing about snakes on a plane in production this in fact was released to <UNK> with that film's release the joke is probably not lost on those who will seek this out i don't think there would be a soul out there who would consider this anything as a serious action thriller effort unless on an ironic level beyond the capacity for rational thought it's about a <UNK> curse placed on a woman who's damned by her family for leaving with another man and is soon seen <UNK> and <UNK> up green <UNK> laced with of course snakes she and her beau go on a train headed for los angeles and very soon after the more than cliché characters are <UNK> to snakes <UNK> the train with the <UNK> woman becoming a snake herself br br if it would be worth listing more about the movie i would but there isn't enough time during the day all that can be said for the quality factor is that it's almost on existent there are student short films with larger budgets maybe that was a wise <UNK> on the <UNK> end that there would be so many copies sold just for the joke factor alone that they would re coup their budget in the first weekend because by looking at the sets the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene the actors if you can call them that with only one other actor the one with the very thin hair who hits on the one woman throughout the movie who <UNK> from the flick being produced the fx also next to non existent making the effects in snakes on a plane seem like star wars and the actual cgi snakes themselves with the final huge <UNK> snake something to behold in sci fi movie channel terms br br this all means basically that it is a laugh riot every step of the way especially as cruel as it sounds when a little girl becomes involved in a <UNK> attention with the very disregard for good taste working well in its favor this being said it is also 100 <UNK> like a b movie sour flavor <UNK>
<START> when i rented this movie i half expected it to be a low budget plot less <UNK> film but thought i'd give it a try i started watching part 1 and couldn't pull myself away till it ended 3 hours later it was by far one of my absolute favorite films of all time from the writing to the directing to the performances i was laughing crying and singing all the way through <UNK> <UNK> of passage from innocence to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is phenomenal in this film i had never heard of her before but now i will forever remember the vulnerability and strength i felt in her performance she <UNK> and may are incredible as they guide you through the emotional <UNK> that most feel as they deal with an alternate form of sexuality the fact that the film is set in the <UNK> not only <UNK> the audience about homosexuality in that time period but makes a statement about our society today you must see this film and probably like myself you'll be making a trip to the store to add it to your collection
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has impressed me before with his acting ability but i can honestly say that i very much look forward to his next efforts his portrayal of francis a 20 year old <UNK> who ignores his father's <UNK> that golf is not his place in life and enters the <UNK> us open <UNK> in his hometown the beginning of the movie does drag a bit but it's necessary to set up the underdog subplot that <UNK> works so well the entire cast is well chosen and they work very well together in a story that based on the actual event has an ending everyone can discover before seeing the movie but even knowing that information doesn't spoil the fun josh <UNK> is delightful as eddie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who keeps him grounded and loose while at the same time proving to be an <UNK> part of <UNK> effort stephen <UNK> is outstanding as harry the legendary british <UNK> who francis <UNK> yet does not fear and who knows the background francis comes from as he too had humble <UNK> bill paxton takes a formulaic movie and makes it worthwhile bravo mr paxton and bravo to the cast from the imagery to the story to the people who bring it alive this is a movie to get enjoy and <UNK> in it's nice to have movies like this that we can feel good watching
<START> this starts off in <UNK> in <UNK> a bunch of kids are killed in a mine explosion <UNK> set off by the <UNK> owner cut to 2006 recently widowed karen <UNK> her teenage daughter sarah <UNK> taylor <UNK> and little girl emma chloe move to a remote house located near that mine what they don't know is the ghosts of the little kids haunt the woods and kill anyone who's around after dark br br slow and boring horror movie the premise is obvious and has been done to death already also there are huge gaps in logic in the story it's never made clear why these kids just kill anybody or why they eat the bodies afterwards yes it's shown they're dead already why do they need food and why haven't they gotten the main villain in the story long before he was around the area why pick this time to attack him also the characters aren't the least bit likable sarah comes across the worst it has a few saving <UNK> the location is beautiful and eerie at the same time some of the killings were very bloody and brutal and the kids themselves looked spooky <UNK> walking through the woods at night but all in all i was bored and fighting to stay awake you can skip this one
<START> wow what a cheesy movie this is it starts off looking like it's gonna be a backwoods slasher with the camera following dogs running through the woods it then gets a bit boring and follows the story of some girls moving into some house haunted by indian spirits we then get plenty of shots of one partially clad girl and another naked girl in the bath it suddenly gets really cheesy when the zombie indians <UNK> from the earth and start <UNK> the girls we even get a samurai indian br br this movie starts off pretty boring although i did find the story of the four indians who buried themselves alive quite interesting once the indian zombies or whatever you want to call them for they aren't technically zombies start <UNK> the girls is when all the fun begins this is not a special flick and can't be taken seriously it's just something fun to watch when you're bored or when you're drinking with friends i can't help thinking though that it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is <UNK> boring
<START> i am the sort of person who never ever watches animated movies but i make an exception for and the <UNK> princess being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind determined to love it because i'd spent money buying it i finished the movie and all i can think is the horror i wanted to like it i really did i tried very very hard to like it but i couldn't enjoy a second of this <UNK> film the songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head the dialogue was so lame i felt myself <UNK> with frustration and <UNK> every time someone opened his or her mouth the villain was laughable and i felt myself wanting derek and <UNK> to die in the end and i was absolutely in love with them from the first film br br i am going to try <UNK> the memory of this movie because it almost destroyed the first one for me there is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film the difference in animation between the two is made very obvious and i began yearning for the first one and wishing i'd never set eyes on the third br br do yourself and favor and don't waste your time
<START> this film is a total bore <UNK> is way better in all aspects plot acting stunts etc plus the soundtrack is one of the most annoying i've ever heard i was close to <UNK> the film just to shut it up 3 out of 10 stars
<START> at least for me and rather unexpected as subject a movie that makes you question your beliefs your life your approach on everything that helps you see the world you we live in through a lens or a <UNK> of lens a moving surprising and haunting movie br br and it benefits of one of the best performances ever from kevin spacey very well by jeff bridges there isn't a false note in this tango it's a perfect dance perfect <UNK> the end br br what does the ending reveal well everything you want it to br br a movie one will want to see again maybe not right away maybe after a few days months years but it's something to go or come back to
<START> honestly how hard can it be to make a good remake obviously pretty hard i was <UNK> excited to see this because i loved the original and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks well i finally see it and i was <UNK> <UNK> ok the shower scene was more realistic that's why i gave it a 3 otherwise it did suck vince vaughn does a terrible job playing norman he's just too dense or something i don't know it was just terrible don't see it
<START> the story of <UNK> was one of the most successful shakespeare ever wrote this may be due to some features that place it close to the slasher genre murder murder kill kill <UNK> of blood a tense sexual relation between the main characters etc more than this the original play is very appealing taking into consideration the length it's only half the size of hamlet and the focus on <UNK> for whom we are <UNK> to care in spite of his bloody nature the play would seem ideal to base a movie on not so lengthy it gives the directors the possibility to explore it's many levels a good actor can play the role of his lifetime the film has deep meaning in any historical period unfortunately this has not been the case with <UNK> <UNK> version comes quite close but it insists too much on the medieval period welles' film is too personal with an interesting twist towards <UNK> the 1990 or so tv version is too shallow this 2006 movie is no exception it is very far from a shakespeare film but it is interesting to see how the director understood the story and where he places it in contemporary life no knights in shiny armor but gangsters in shiny cars a lot of drugs and <UNK> music replace the dread of night in the original play the idea of <UNK> is so simple that to take and <UNK> it in modern day life doesn't need shakespeare at all the worst part in the film are the lines most of the poignant scenes of the play such as the <UNK> scene are <UNK> so much they seem pointless replacing the knocks in the door with <UNK> and horses with cars seems funny if they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation they could have done it easily without shakespeare this <UNK> seems to be a <UNK> with a brain injury not a <UNK> warrior brave and ambitious that wants power so much he is prepared to to kill and who gets caught up in a net of fears and despair the movie doesn't make clear what drives lady <UNK> to madness it doesn't give a reason why some of the characters should fear <UNK> and his terror since there is no <UNK> <UNK> to the throne what with no throne and all and it places <UNK> in an awkward position since the <UNK> of a gang is as far from <UNK> as this whole movie is far from any shakespeare in conclusion we have two <UNK> ideas that never quite meet making this a film that's ultimately pointless stand not upon the order of your going but go
<START> it's probably a cultural thing somehow the natives of this country have been <UNK> to find this stuff funny i have experienced this phenomenon first hand during an open air cinema event where this film was shown before the feature most of the <UNK> audience laughed and no this wasn't in a <UNK> or a clinic for retarded children this was in a well to do area and the audience consisted mostly of educated adults br br so it must be possible somehow to find this amusing but honest to goodness i have no idea what it takes maybe it's in the air or the water prolonged exposure to which causes this condition something must cause it obviously the only thing i can say is that i am quite sure what doesn't cause it the movie itself br br there are no jokes in it it's brain dead stupid nonsensical unfunny lame it's in short a waste of time any tom and jerry is funnier heck even <UNK> are funnier br br just in case you have been fortunate enough not ever to have seen any of the <UNK> performances it's three guys behaving running even talking like retarded <UNK> causing all kinds of unfunny mayhem with no plot no real purpose and no real conclusion it's like ugly <UNK> without the cute costumes br br sitting in a crowd watching this garbage in this country can be quite <UNK> because you feel like you are at a party with a bunch of <UNK> and you are the only one who hasn't <UNK> anything br br so unless you are prepared to yourself to make this bearable or come <UNK> with whatever it is that makes people think watching three ugly old men behave like morons is funny my advice on this is stay way far away
<START> title dracula a d 1972 br br director alan gibson br br cast peter cushing christopher lee stephanie <UNK> br br review sometimes movies can be time <UNK> that transport you back to any given time in this case our time capsule is <UNK> dracula a d 1972 which <UNK> us back to a time in which austin powers would have felt right at home br br the story is about these group of kids were not a gang were a group that love to hang out at a <UNK> shop called the <UNK> one day johnny <UNK> hmm strange last name wait it spells dracula backwards a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks he offers them a night of black mass and black magic to which they also say sure why the hell not it could be fun so in no time flat the find themselves <UNK> count dracula from the <UNK> br br this movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich <UNK> home he knows non of the people at his party yet there they all are <UNK> the night away in his house doing drugs making out and dancing on top of tables the filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely <UNK> in whatever young people considered cool at that time everyone says words like way out and <UNK> and they finish many of their sentences saying all that jazz so yeah its pretty evident that this is the 70s to top it all off there's a band that sounds something like <UNK> airplane i mean you'll be drowned in all things 70s and as i watched this i kept asking myself how the heck is dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all this and thats exactly what happens old dracula feels out of place amidst all the <UNK> and the rock and roll and drugs many of the scenes in the film are great but sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings doesn't fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood of things something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud <UNK> and start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element that sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for me br br but all in all putting all the distracting 70s music aside an illness that satanic <UNK> of dracula also suffered the movie was pretty good but i will mention this the story was just a re <UNK> of what we had seen before in taste the blood of dracula in fact the story is damn near identical lets see a young <UNK> <UNK> ring and <UNK> check he then decides to bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting into check black mass to bring dracula back in a <UNK> church check the list of similarities goes on and on so this movie ain't very original if you ask me br br there are a few things that make this movie worth while though for example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining i kept <UNK> and laughing every time someone spoke in 70 <UNK> i couldn't believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove it made the movie fun for me but we are here to get <UNK> were here to see <UNK> kill a few <UNK> and take his revenge on the house of van <UNK> did we get any of that well yeah there's a few good sequences <UNK> in there to satisfy old school hammer fans first off there's the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is <UNK> that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment then there's actual <UNK> which ill admit was great from a visual standpoint some <UNK> comes out of grave and slowly but surely christopher <UNK> <UNK> and face emerge from the fog cool shot i loved it we have a cushing and lee face off at the end and i couldn't help to laugh at one point when dracula <UNK> a piece of furniture through the air i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of dracula its this hammer tradition where the characters start throwing candle sticks and <UNK> at each other and i think to myself aren't their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle stick at our hero oh well <UNK> demise in this one is very similar to all the other hammer before it vampire gets <UNK> and then we cut to a series of frames until there's only <UNK> left br br all in all an unintentionally funny hammer dracula film its trapped in the 70s and though that makes it a fun watch and its not as horrible as satanic <UNK> of dracula it still doesn't <UNK> well with the dracula universe we had come to expect from hammer br br rating 3 1 2 out of 5
<START> like the previous <UNK> on this film i too found myself in tears at times during this movie sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe inspiring awfulness comes into existence from the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his new york apartment from a dream of subway trains <UNK> with <UNK> horses what irish <UNK> hasn't had that one its clear we are in trouble and it doesn't get much better br br <UNK> back to 1950s ireland we enter a world where everybody speaks without <UNK> and exclusively on the topic of the irish civil war <UNK> go to school to learn about the civil war the <UNK> in the pub <UNK> themselves according to their civil war <UNK> are carried out for those who died in the civil war the town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget the civil war every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that <UNK> back to the civil war br br the <UNK> on the of broken <UNK> suggests that the film is a <UNK> of the troubles in modern ireland the only parallel which strikes me is that in present day <UNK> conversation is indeed dominated by one topic house <UNK> if its intention is to offer some sort of insight into <UNK> obsession with its past it fails miserably it is striking how few irish films have dealt with the irish civil war and its however it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the <UNK> psyche br br for those american viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of 1950s ireland it doesn't 1950s ireland was a horrible poverty stricken pit of sexual <UNK> and misery from which young people <UNK> in their <UNK> however there was more than one topic of conversation
<START> spoilers br br this movie was truly awful this woman <UNK> her <UNK> right from the start and then <UNK> proceeds to tear them apart at the end you see her making a profession out of the trade she'd learned from the father of her <UNK> i put <UNK> in quotes because the <UNK> never really seems to teach the child anything she seems to hate her and can't stand being near her i felt sorry for the little girl who simply wanted to be loved absent that it was understandable that she would say and do <UNK> things just to get attention but the viewer wasn't supposed to sympathize with the little girl the viewer was supposed to sympathize with the <UNK> who hated her <UNK> and manipulated and <UNK> her <UNK> i just couldn't do it this was not the story of a self made woman rather it was a window into the mind of one who uses others at every opportunity with no other thought for anyone outside of her own family i couldn't stand the <UNK> this was a really horrible movie i only paid one dollar to rent it but even that was too much
<START> as a fan of nearly any period drama and at that a huge jane austen fan i was horrified by this adaption as a fan of the 1999 version of <UNK> park i was constantly comparing the two and this fell far short it felt hugely rushed and very one dimensional so that it became boring very quickly there seemed to be no subtly to the relationships particularly that of <UNK> and edmund and little atmosphere despite being set in a beautiful location despite having looked forward to the jane austen season since christmas i turned this off after an hour and went to bed i will be interested to watch the adaptations of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of which i have no much loved version to see if they still manage to bore me in such a manner
<START> wow i've sure seen quite a bit of <UNK> this summer i didn't know this woman made so many <UNK> flicks in the past three years it's like seeing a future <UNK> star <UNK> in front of me much like michelle hall did a couple of years ago br br <UNK> peak is the third quality <UNK> flick i've seen <UNK> in with girl for girl and house of love being the others desire and deception was okay but it wasn't spectacular there's spoilers in this review so read only if you want to br br the story begins with christina <UNK> heading out of the big city and to the mountains she has inherited a house from her dear <UNK> grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain <UNK> before she can even set her things down some woman named kim uncredited in this film but quite the aggressive one begins <UNK> guests to stay there now she has to get the house into shape quickly in comes chip bobby <UNK> a childhood friend to the rescue chip helps her get the house in <UNK> condition she hires two local <UNK> to work in her <UNK> <UNK> sister bait samantha <UNK> and her sex buddy hank br br now the guests start coming the first to arrive are eric and linda flower two stereotypical money first lawyers linda and eric get into a huge argument during a dinner party halfway through the film which leads to their <UNK> sad stuff there next there's romance novelist sophia played by b movie <UNK> <UNK> parent she's using that silly <UNK> scarlet again and she's got a very professional look this time with blonde hair of course it wouldn't be <UNK> if she didn't have at least one scene where she plays with herself and she <UNK> during one of eric and <UNK> sex scenes br br james and lane yes the porn star lane show up for a little weekend <UNK> as well <UNK> to james and christina have quite a history james and christina used to date but christina broke it off to head to this mountain <UNK> james comes up to the <UNK> to get christina back but his plan <UNK> christina <UNK> the <UNK> to which causes to walk out on him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals ends up in the sleeping bag of the now single eric and they leave together bait realizes she wants something more than just sex with hank and christine finds true love with chip with sophia <UNK> it all in and writing it into her next romance novel br br in fact if you ask me this whole movie played out like a romance novel i don't know if the screenwriter was going for that effect but i sure got that impression sophia had some of the best lines in this film playing up the idea that this is a live action romance novel she seems to enjoy all the fighting and <UNK> going on br br now to the sex there was a fair amount of it and it was the usual <UNK> and <UNK> stuff <UNK> did her fair share of <UNK> in her two sex scenes this film was <UNK> and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in between the sex scenes br br women a <UNK> was simply <UNK> out of all the <UNK> actresses i've seen over the years she's the best at acting in my opinion she can really act and be sexy which is why she's holding on to the 1 position in my <UNK> top 10 <UNK> is better at doing <UNK> films than she is on the soap opera passions i don't know why she's not doing more of these flower was merely background scenery for the most part in a limited role samantha <UNK> continues to impress me and lane is yet another hardcore actress crossing over into the <UNK> realm and doing a halfway decent job at it br br sex b it was good but not awe inspiring spectacular plenty of <UNK> don't watch the r rated version trust me most of the good stuff is taken out my grade is for the uncut version br br story b a solid storyline which throws in a contrived <UNK> the building <UNK> gonna shut us down subplot toward the end which <UNK> up things the underlying story between christina and james was nice and <UNK> dialogue full of the <UNK> and imagery usually found in romance novels was a nice touch br br overall b i found this movie to be quite entertaining it's not a <UNK> <UNK> hall of like girl for girl is but it's a respectable addition to the <UNK> collection
<START> i saw this movie when it was first released in 1986 at the time i was young and enjoyed all the normal comedy available i e monty python jim belushi snl steve martin cheech chong so i believe that my judgment represents most sane individuals br br the absolute best part of this movie was the trailer played at the beginning of the movie for the new my little <UNK> movie that was coming out br br this movie was so atrocious that it was actually <UNK> from most theaters before the initial week run was completed br br i'm surprised that anyone would waste there corporate money to <UNK> this steaming pile of human waste br br don't waste your time or money to rent or watch this movie
<START> there is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around that 20 years later it wont hold the same magic as it did before i must admit i <UNK> expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a 12 year old this film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess it is engrossing it is acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there <UNK> many things that can do that john and <UNK> rolls in this film are 1st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now i urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me <UNK> 10 out of 10
<START> i first saw it at january 1 2009 and after a day i watched it again and i want to watch it again love everything well almost so 9 stars about it no color beautiful naive stories funny gangsters anna camera work music well sometimes you just want to listen little bit longer and the music just stops but this is not a musical after all i like <UNK> acting this naive wannabe gangster girl how she speaks holds the gun everything makes me smile no it's not that funny though i have laughed a bit at some moments it's just so subtle excellent work by samuel though 3d <UNK> seems weaker but they are also gangsters maybe even worse cause they are stealing ideas and the last scene is my favorite makes me feel so warm and romantic yes i would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such art movies and i don't agree with those comparing it to pulp fiction it's not about action and twisted story though all vignettes <UNK> it's calm and maybe too slow movie for most of the people it's about characters their feelings very subtle anyway probably this review won't be of much help to anyone my first just wanted to express my appreciation br br spoiler this movie doesn't have a goofs section wonder didn't anybody notice that hand in the 2 part when the <UNK> decided to go home looks like a part of crew <UNK> i know i should better post this in <UNK> but i don't agree with some <UNK> here
<START> well for a start i must say that here in russia a saga of of is known and loved a gifted writer or maybe even genius of some sort created one of the most realistic honest cynical and god d <UNK> well written fantasy worlds in a history of literature and when such amazing material gets in a right hands well see <UNK> game and you will understand what i am talking about br br is an excellent example of the opposite outcome br br lack of budget lack of directing lack of good script br br these three <UNK> of disgusting movie making <UNK> this movie ate it alive acting is good sometimes even more than good but for god sake it can not save this project br br i still have some faith though i still hope that someday a new movies will be created and entire world will see <UNK> and breathtaking <UNK> of books p s but before that a uwe boll must be eliminated just in case you know
<START> brown returned to his role from the year before in slaughter for this rough follow up film in the original he had <UNK> his parents' <UNK> by <UNK> out a huge mob organization in mexico here he is the one being pursued <UNK> against by a money portrayed by <UNK> when the first assassination attempt fails brown is back in action once more kicking gangster butt all over the place while trying to protect his new girlfriend <UNK> while the original film was overall a better and more coherent movie this one delivers all the exploitation aspects in far <UNK> doses making it more pleasing to fans of the genre aside from a fairly dreary opening on <UNK> and a downright deadly car ride down a city street at night this movie clips along at a very <UNK> pace every few minutes there appears one or more of the following drug use sex nudity <UNK> murder or some other action brown is his usual reliable <UNK> self helped by his amazing physical presence which goes a long way in <UNK> over any <UNK> in his acting <UNK> is a riot with <UNK> glasses and his hair <UNK> down the middle he is shown <UNK> out orders to his gang of thugs and is <UNK> making passionate love to his fur clad bimbo seeing johnny <UNK> sidekick in a role like this is a perverse thrill <UNK> makes an impression as an intense <UNK> <UNK> hit man while peters adds just a <UNK> of class as an <UNK> police detective who <UNK> <UNK> aid sadly no mention at all is made of <UNK> original <UNK> don gordon and stella stevens suddenly brown now has a girlfriend <UNK> who is likable enough but lacking in the <UNK> and personality that stevens had before williams does an outrageous turn as a <UNK> who can seemingly pick any girl out of a bar and make her an instant member of his <UNK> the cinematography and overall direction is less polished than the first film but this one does have a drive and a sense of danger that <UNK> the <UNK> feel the film spends a lot of time in the <UNK> of organized crime drugs prostitution and other <UNK> but it <UNK> interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the now startling lack of political correctness one odd note a key supporting player in the first film was shown getting shot to death but pops up here in a different role
<START> i <UNK> with imdb com just so i could comment about this movie my god what a steaming pile of horse crap this was it shouldn't even be <UNK> as a real movie this is very <UNK> this is a 15 year <UNK> film project at best the acting is terrible but even good actors could not save this the dialog is probably the worst part of this movie who the hell wrote this crap and that constant joke coming from the <UNK> lesbian about <UNK> being a damsel in distress got old real fast god i'd rather have a <UNK> take a wet dump in my ear than watch this crap again do not rent this movie if they gave you the movie for free do not watch it smash it with a hammer even if <UNK> this video caused you to lose your hollywood video or blockbuster video account it would be well worth it this is an abomination i suppose i have said all i can about this without being redundant any questions email me
<START> best in show is a often hilarious <UNK> that takes us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who prepare for the event the only thing that <UNK> this movie from real dog shows is that the dogs in best in show act more sane than their owners funny stuff from a top notch cast that includes eugene levy who co wrote the film catherine o'hara parker posey michael jennifer <UNK> jane lynch and christopher guest who co wrote with levy and directed they're all funny but fred <UNK> steals the movie with his <UNK> funny performance as the dog show <UNK> who says the most outrageous things plus the dogs are cute too best in show isn't exactly the laugh riot that i expected but there are laughs and it's worth seeing br br out of four
<START> the lone ranger was one of my childhood heroes and i never missed a chance to catch his adventures on saturday morning re runs during the mid 1950's somehow however this film got by me until i had a chance to catch it today courtesy of my local library i was struck by a number of elements during the story as right from the start you have a new lone ranger theme song before you hear the traditional opening used on the tv show the adventure uses <UNK> jay in a nicely expanded role even though he takes his share of <UNK> throughout getting beat up and shot more than once perhaps most interesting of all the ranger actually shoots to kill in a couple of situations putting his character at odds with the vision created for the tv series that he would never use his weapon to kill only to wound or to protect himself and others br br aside from that you have a fairly traditional western adventure the ranger and <UNK> come to the aid of an indian tribe whose members are being murdered by <UNK> <UNK> attempting to track down five that together form the key to a fabulous treasure interestingly the leader of the bad guys is an already wealthy woman <UNK> portrayed by <UNK> her top henchman is played by douglas kennedy and it was no surprise to see lane <UNK> as one of the baddies character was one of the men shot by the lone ranger which got me to thinking how many times that might have happened in the tv series a quick check revealed that he appeared in 'the lone <UNK> show fifteen times while kennedy appeared a total of six times br br what might be most interesting of all about the picture is it's attempt to portray indians in a <UNK> light at a time when tv and movie westerns were still largely portraying the red man as an illiterate savage the character of dr james <UNK> norman is the most revealing in that regard he's an indian who <UNK> an education and went on to become a doctor returning to the land of his tribe to tend to the needs of all it's citizens for purposes of the story he had to <UNK> a white man to be accepted by the local <UNK> this was the hardest thing for me to accept about the story line actually as dr <UNK> was the <UNK> of the elderly chief john <UNK> that no one in the story except lisa knew that he was really an indian was something of a stretch for me i suppose it was possible that he left the tribe at an early age but without that back story fleshed out it didn't make sense to me that no one else from the tribe would know who he was br br i don't know why i'm intrigued by this so much but after watching and reviewing over two hundred westerns on this site i've suddenly come across three films in the past month that <UNK> a <UNK> pull gimmick like the one performed by horse <UNK> in this picture roy <UNK> trigger did a similar stunt in son of <UNK> and i caught it again in the big country by a horse named old thunder in that flick it's done as a bit of comic relief in a situation that wouldn't normally come up for a horse and it now makes me curious when the bit might have been first done i'll have to keep watching more old time westerns not to be <UNK> silver had a chance to shine in the picture as well making the save of an indian baby that was about to be used as a hostage by bad guy brady br br speaking of gimmicks <UNK> moore borrowed a <UNK> from the tv series when he <UNK> a disguise as a southern gentleman to smoke out the villains posing as the <UNK> <UNK> whenever he would do so in the half hour format it was always clever enough to hide his real features usually with a beard as done here one of the more interesting episodes i recall had to do with the ranger <UNK> an actor in the <UNK> of abraham lincoln br br keep an eye out for a couple of goofs i spotted along the way in an early scene at the opening an indian is shot by one of the <UNK> <UNK> and in a close up there's blood on his shirt but no bullet hole later on in the story ross brady and wilson ride up on the indians after they've kidnapped one of the villains out of jail brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from <UNK> the <UNK> but is immediately shown about to make his <UNK> on <UNK> with wilson
<START> otto preminger was one of the great maverick film directors like john huston he was a character from one of his own movies like mr huston he was a wonderful ham who slipped in and out of performance at random but the final product of his <UNK> was <UNK> his own with a few exceptions films are now made by <UNK> not individuals and as a result are usually highly polished <UNK> a product in much the same way as a golf ball a tin of dog food or a <UNK> car is a product the involvement of human beings in the process is almost incidental such is the <UNK> for the product that there appears no end to the line of well finished glossy <UNK> entertaining but ultimately empty films that <UNK> the countless tv channels and movie <UNK> there is no time for a man like mr preminger to stand a little apart from the <UNK> of product and craft a personal work of art of course there has always been the art for <UNK> sake money for <UNK> sake <UNK> in film making but now has in all but name been <UNK> to <UNK> cutting room floor today otto preminger would be lucky to get a job delivering <UNK> in hollywood half a century ago having made the hugely influential laura where the sidewalk ends and the moon is blue he set about filming nelson controversial novel the man with the golden arm in his eccentric and <UNK> manner rather than take his camera out onto the streets he stayed in the studio and used <UNK> almost <UNK> sets quirky casting mr frank sinatra hot from his success in from here to eternity the young inexperienced but <UNK> beautiful miss kim novak and mr arnold a man whose <UNK> were after his own heart and a remarkable era defining score by elmer <UNK> featuring the cream of west coast an otto preminger film was always an all round experience to be considered as a whole rather than breaking it down into acting directing photography what appeared on the screen was <UNK> vision his creation and his interpretation of novel not a film of novel any one of twenty competent hollywood <UNK> have produced that from the first hi hat <UNK> beat that <UNK> <UNK> iconic title sequence we are drawn into <UNK> take on what is nowadays called the life in truth a murky area occupied by <UNK> <UNK> cops drug dealers stone <UNK> jazz musicians their women and <UNK> on the lines are <UNK> in the life and it's dog eats dog down there the inhabitants circle each other like sharks looking for a sign of weakness to be exploited frankie machine mr sinatra a professional card dealer ex <UNK> and aspiring jazz drummer is a born victim when things get tough he goes back to the <UNK> although he kicks the habit by going cold turkey there are absolutely no <UNK> that he won't go straight back on it further down the line mr sinatra's depiction of an addict in the <UNK> of <UNK> has divided the critics but the fact of the matter is that even fifty years later most of us have probably never seen such a thing in real life so we don't know how accurate the portrayal is when i first saw the film in the late 50s i was very impressed watching it recently on video it seemed to put it <UNK> hammy perhaps he is a victim of his own success as many actors subsequently doing cold turkey have with the passing of the years taken his performance and <UNK> it somewhat arnold is outstanding as pal <UNK> a performance he <UNK> only in it's a mad mad mad mad world try and watch it on the big screen and view it as the cinematic vision of a true auteur a giant amongst today's <UNK> otto preminger
<START> possible spoilers three young people on the wrong side of the law are given a chance to turn their lives around and become useful members of society by becoming undercover cops in the <UNK> squad ' a <UNK> of the hit television series of the directed by scott silver given their less than stellar backgrounds and because of who they are and the people they know julie barnes claire danes pete <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and lincoln hayes omar <UNK> can go places other cops can't so they are <UNK> by captain adam <UNK> dennis <UNK> to <UNK> a seedy night spot suspected of being a front for a prostitution ring for a start julie gets a job there as a waitress while pete and just hang <UNK> to find out what they may julie quickly becomes <UNK> with an old boyfriend billy <UNK> josh <UNK> who turns out to be involved with drugs which are tied in to the shady <UNK> going down at the bar before it's over the is in it up to their <UNK> while also running <UNK> of a bunch of wrong cops who are also involved with the drugs and consequently tied in with their investigation from the beginning of the movie there is a sense that you are coming in late as if it's that you know what's going on as far as the origin and <UNK> of the squad all you get here are brief <UNK> shot <UNK> of the three that give you nothing more than a glimpse into their past there's nothing about how this all actually came about the thinking was probably that by doing it this way it would lead into the story <UNK> get things moving along while this is true to a certain extent some added background would have made the <UNK> of the story a bit more interesting the way it was done here merely the credibility of the entire proceedings the plot is <UNK> to begin with and any time spent on character development would have been well worth the while what's delivered and quite <UNK> at that is a less than compelling story filled with one dimensional characters the performances are satisfactory but the actors get no help from the script nor apparently from silver danes <UNK> and <UNK> come close to <UNK> out julie pete and but given the time <UNK> them combined with the lack of support they still fall way short of giving these people life <UNK> a good actor who deserves better than what he gets here comes off as nothing more than a caricature of the good cop ' there's a feeling that everything was given the once over in this film some detail and nuance would have driven the stock up considerably on this one the supporting cast includes richard <UNK> detective steve harris <UNK> larry lionel mark smith <UNK> and sam <UNK> it's a shame to see the acting talent involved here wasted like this a lot more thought and planning should have gone into the making of this movie as it is it comes across as ill conceived and poorly executed danes <UNK> and <UNK> are like major <UNK> who got stuck playing for all the <UNK> at the local instead of getting a shot at the title they all got hung out to dry like terry says in on the <UNK> ' you was my brother charlie you <UNK> been looking out for me ' well it's obvious that there was no charlie to look out for them here and after the <UNK> squad ' they can all just hope for something better to come along the next time i rate this one 1 10
<START> i am not a big fan of the spielberg cruise version of this film and so i must throw in with the more humble version c thomas had more heart and more sympathy that cruise in the lead role at least in my opinion now this is hard to imagine until you strip away everything thing in the spielberg version that cost more than a thousand dollars there would be nothing left no special effects no sets no cruise because i doubt that anything cost more than a cool grand in the david michael version so comparing <UNK> to i guess i have to go with the at least it gives independent movies a shot at the epic science fiction disaster market
<START> this film had a couple of funny parts but for the most part made me want to go ahead and change dvd's and watch <UNK> instead which i had in my own collection at least i would know there was something funny coming up and give me something to look forward to br br i was disappointed in this very low budget film and i do not judge a movie by it's budget it just lacked originality and was too predictable i would not rent or even watch this film again and i am usually a repeat <UNK> of film the actors were forgettable the story was half thought out and it left me with an <UNK> urge to get my laugh on i ended up watching jamie <UNK> white boy gone <UNK> to have the comedy <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the plot a <UNK> kristofferson battles a corrupt sheriff <UNK> by getting his fellow <UNK> to band together and form an <UNK> <UNK> that stretches for miles and soon creates a national media frenzy br br the negative the film's setup is weak and the ending even weaker it has all the good <UNK> boy <UNK> clichés without adding anything new in the process it ends up making <UNK> and the <UNK> look brilliant and inspired kristofferson is much too laid back for a leading man role and cannot carry the picture <UNK> character is portrayed <UNK> at the start he is made to look like a real jerk of a sheriff who overacts to a minor <UNK> that starts the whole thing rolling then at the end he is made out to be a little more sympathetic and even secretly <UNK> with kristofferson which doesn't work at all in either case jackie <UNK> is a much better actor for this type of role the worst part about the movie though is director <UNK> attempts to throw in a <UNK> into this silly action flick that does nothing but slow it down and bomb in the process br br the positive the only good scene in the whole film is the fight sequence inside the truck stop restaurant director <UNK> puts a funny spin to his trademark <UNK> violence and the result is amusing unfortunately he starts putting all the action into slow motion during the rest of the picture until it eventually becomes <UNK> <UNK> is always a pleasure to look at but unfortunately she is given very little to say or do br br the <UNK> if you've read the synopsis than you have essentially the movie the song that this movie is based on is pretty good but the movie adds nothing to it and should never have been made this is all very uninspired stuff for such a maverick director br br the rating 3 out of 10
<START> this game is an action adventure with combat there are quite long periods with no combat but other times you have to get rid of various kinds of monsters the monsters are not like anything you would see in real life and they have to be gotten rid off in order to continue with your quest the whole game is a quest you play adam randall whose father contacts him from the beyond and asks him to come and save him the game is from the mid 1990's and has to be played in <UNK> i used and was able to play the game quite well the graphics are not as good as some games even of the time mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look quite <UNK> but others look <UNK> but don't let that put you off the game the game is very imaginative its long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere not for young kids who likely wouldn't be interested anyway but over 13 or 14 might like this game its a horror mystery action adventure combat combination i thought it was a great game its had to find now maybe ebay but remember its a <UNK> game and you would not be able to play it on todays faster computers would be hard to play on fast computers unless you use oh and the acting is very good too
<START> the <UNK> cast pulls the crowd in the theatre despite the ominous title jake <UNK> <UNK> on conan o'brien to promote the movie and explained that was a <UNK> for <UNK> information via torture since 9 11 allowed the <UNK> intelligence agency to <UNK> people without due process and use any means necessary in exchange for information br br <UNK> plays rookie cia <UNK> douglas freeman note the irony who is torn about his assignment which <UNK> him as a mere <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> proceedings at an underground <UNK> facility outside the us br br omar plays the suspected terrorist <UNK> el egyptian national and green card carrying <UNK> of american <UNK> fields el reese <UNK> <UNK> and her son wait for <UNK> to come home from a scientific <UNK> when he suddenly disappears from the <UNK> passenger <UNK> she seeks help from her college friend who works in government and learns that the head of intelligence <UNK> <UNK> meryl streep is behind it all br br rendition is directed by hollywood <UNK> <UNK> hood who is set to do x men origins <UNK> and begs the question of whether such is <UNK> in real life the movie was released <UNK> in the wake of the explosion bombing <UNK> and a pivotal scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public <UNK> so that must have sent chills up every <UNK> spine seeing the exploding <UNK> with a lone red and yellow sign on the upper right hand of the screen plus the effect of silence and slow moving images <UNK> the impact of the <UNK> real life coincidence br br there are lessons to learn from this movie and it all <UNK> down to personal decisions we make daily we all have choices we can exercise at will and we often do not always want to see how these affect others who may end up as hapless victims of <UNK> what 'the greater <UNK> is should not have to be a forced choice our leaders have to take if we each already decide correctly at the source now that's a <UNK> worth building
<START> german born turkish director faith akin captures in his film the endless variety of the different styles in music and songs in <UNK> a city that is a bridge between east and west a city that is uniquely located on both sides of the in europe and in asia <UNK> represented by who performs her own brand of <UNK> <UNK> music passionate and <UNK> we are introduced to <UNK> to who has been called the elvis of music sounds of music are heard everywhere in the city as faith akin takes us into underground <UNK> to the street performers and to recording sessions german <UNK> alexander who comes to <UNK> to play and to learn about turkish music quotes <UNK> to understand the place you have to listen to the music it plays <UNK> fine documentary does just that gives us 90 minutes of music that helps to cross the bridges for me watching the movie was especially interesting because i recently visited <UNK> as a part of my vacation and spent four days there the city fascinated me by its images colors crowds <UNK> and visual beauty now i can add the sounds of music to the ever changing portrait of <UNK>
<START> i thought maybe a film which <UNK> a cast including peter o'toole <UNK> york michael craig harry andrews might be worth watching alas i was wrong utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both o'toole and york overacting wildly i watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about i've a feeling o'toole plays the <UNK> of a scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes <UNK> childhood games with his sister york he is also <UNK> mad but apart from that your guess is as good as mine br br the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever i can only assume the cast and director were <UNK> into making this dreary unimaginative <UNK> <UNK> clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director <UNK>
<START> in the goofs section for this film there's a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where car is seen to be <UNK> in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene this is incorrect one of the views is from flat the other is from flat across the street the whole purpose of this segment is to show how and <UNK> who may be made for each other almost cross paths as happens several other times but never quite do so until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film and here there is the <UNK> that joseph has manipulated things so that <UNK> is on that ferry having <UNK> ticket to see which <UNK> she is <UNK> on
<START> after reading other reviews on this site we weren't sure if we were going to be able to critique this movie because it didn't sound bad enough however 2 minutes into the movie we knew we were in for another flop no summer is complete without ice cream but this movie served up a <UNK> sour broken <UNK> ice cream <UNK> you know the kind that leaves you <UNK> and dirty and looking for a wet <UNK> the biggest problem with this movie was the plot what was it it appeared to be a psychotic ice cream man driving around the neighborhood that's it nothing else happens first of all what are the <UNK> for becoming an ice cream man in this crap town 1 spend several years in the most ridiculous mental hospital known to man this hospital was plagued with <UNK> <UNK> fake plastic and <UNK> <UNK> to the head 2 have extremely poor <UNK> and a mutant face to scare the kids away 3 make sure your truck is <UNK> with severed body parts <UNK> and don't forget the eye whites br br the actors in this movie are pure b movie caliber mixed in with a bunch of <UNK> is who other than a trailer trash version of <UNK> culkin even his <UNK> charm couldn't save this kick in the pants there seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this movie the whole concept of the movie <UNK> who would kill an ice cream man in a drive by shooting gangsters <UNK> white who we are still struggling with this question br br whoever was in charge of the wardrobe for this movie should be immediately <UNK> from hollywood did they honestly think a <UNK> under a kid's shirt would make the audience believe that he was really fat did they forget about the arms face legs and all other body parts second of all this movie was made in 1995 yet the wardrobe seemed to be picked from a lame 80's movie <UNK> by the big brother's white <UNK> <UNK> high water pants br br while we were watching this <UNK> production we both developed severe cases of add we found ourselves leaving the room to walk around <UNK> at many points it the movie we found that staring at a blank wall behind the t v set was more entertaining than the actual movie we were stunned that this movie didn't make it to the bottom 100 afterwards we took the tape out of the vcr and left it on the black top to melt like a sub standard ice cream <UNK>

<START> ordinary decent criminal is sort of based on the exploits of martin <UNK> already the subject of john <UNK> 1998 film the general <UNK> had a rough upbringing in a <UNK> area and <UNK> from petty crime to armed robbery with <UNK> he justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity this is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently <UNK> the thousands of <UNK> <UNK> who don't turn to robbing post <UNK> and selling guns in order to make ends meet <UNK> made fools of the police and local authorities not to mention the ira which earned him a sort of folk hero status as well as making him many enemies however he was basically an amoral self serving thief br br my primary problem with is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable irish rogue kevin spacey does a good job portraying michael lynch with a blend of <UNK> charm and quiet menace but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero even an anti hero br br the film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast but what lets it down is the script writer gerard can't make up his mind is he writing an irish lock stock or a <UNK> treatment of martin <UNK> <UNK> career that's the problem when a writer <UNK> his central character on a real person br br it's also unfortunate that followed the cinema release of john <UNK> the general which was a more accurate portrayal of martin <UNK> story <UNK> was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity so it's not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatment br br what is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take <UNK> story and give it a happy hollywood style ending kevin <UNK> charismatic thief michael lynch gets to ride off into <UNK> on his motorcycle in in the real world martin <UNK> was executed by the ira just to prove that no one makes fools of an out dated and corrupt <UNK> military <UNK> and gets away with it br br the real <UNK> would never have walked away from his <UNK> because it <UNK> his man of the people self image having michael lynch give up everything to avoid death in is a cop out ending to a weak and shallow movie
<START> for me the <UNK> and its characters by which i mean the admirable ones are like old friends ever since i first began to experience the play through acting classes i played <UNK> i found myself immediately caught up in the fantastic world that shakespeare created i can distinctly remember one student deciding not to play <UNK> after all and so i took the stage and had the honor of playing opposite an excellent miranda br br one of the virtues that a great friend has is that you can never fully know them there is always something you can discover about their character a film production of the <UNK> of quality is thus like a visit to an old friend dear to one's heart each visit presents one with new perspective on the memory we had of the work with <UNK> books the ritual and the <UNK> of the play was <UNK> the <UNK> celebration of art within the art here we see a vision as <UNK> <UNK> with lovingly crafted interiors full of <UNK> and <UNK> on floors more <UNK> <UNK> than <UNK> <UNK> it also made me <UNK> why was it that <UNK> was cast out of <UNK> his magical power is so <UNK> in this production that it makes one wonder whether it was just politics that doomed <UNK> to <UNK> but rather the fact of his difference from his peers so in the real world he suffered was cast out <UNK> to change the wrong to the right all of the villains in this play whether they realize it or not act in <UNK> to creating a more pain filled hell of a world it is always in the interest of the to make life on earth closer to hell but <UNK> manages to bring these <UNK> villains into his island the realm where he has absolute <UNK> br br shakespeare brings his audience to the theater the realm where shakespeare <UNK> the events the words the <UNK> shakespeare is of course <UNK> but what this film adaptation does that really <UNK> the text is to make <UNK> so sympathetic such a figure of reason despite the fact that he is surrounded by what society calls irrational <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> symbols magical etc is it more rational to be a man of the cloth and murder or to be a <UNK> and work towards the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> for the reason he <UNK> his magic is not because the books will lose their value in <UNK> but because they are not necessary anymore the world itself has become the magic of the books br br in hamlet hamlet presents a play to his peers the play <UNK> his <UNK> of <UNK> against others for their own <UNK> the reaction of the audience <UNK> while <UNK> is puzzled <UNK> <UNK> with stunned shock this happens within the play and then shakespeare has this play performed for the men of his time did shakespeare watch for their reactions in the <UNK> <UNK> lives the play he is <UNK> and we live it with him how do we react do you react with simple delight at the happy ending are you upset and shocked by the <UNK> of this production which is entirely fitting given the source material do you feel sad at the fact that this little life the play is rounded with a sleep as <UNK> as it is eternal the tragedy is that shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for <UNK> life on earth but man is weak and unwilling to realize it in favor of petty power struggles we have br br like a good friend this film is not without its flaws i disagree with the choice to paint some scenes entirely in blue the dance of the is rather <UNK> but at the heart this is truly the <UNK> and one of its many faces
<START> i don't know why i even watched this film i think it was because i liked the idea of the scenery and was hoping the film would be as good very boring and pointless
<START> i first seen this movie like a year and a half ago and i loved it i decided to get the dvd last year for my birthday it has the right amount of suspense action and drama this movie is about <UNK> school called the <UNK> school and its packed with rebellious kids in which one kid william <UNK> sean <UNK> has a hard time <UNK> due to prior <UNK> from other schools cause they couldn't control his rebellious act and now at the <UNK> school committing more acts of a rebellion there school gets taken over by terrorists on a random day and which the real reason is because the leader luis andrew <UNK> father has been sent to prison and the leader will do anything including killing the students setting bombs and so forth in order to get his father back br br along side william <UNK> is his rebellious friends at the <UNK> school one in particular is joey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in which this guy holds a troubled past of living in a mafia family and being sent to the <UNK> school because of hating his father for who he is and which now he must deal with these terrorists taking over the school so william joey and there friends must band together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and <UNK> tactics br br this movie was really awesome and i believe people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say die hard and even though i would have to agree with them they need to recognize that toy soldiers was a good thriller it sure had my heart beating because the students are my age and i would be scared to confront terrorists like these if they took over our school but overall this movie is really worth a good <UNK> minutes of your time and if i had a decision to rent or buy it i would buy it i recommend it with a lot of hype 8 10
<START> by watching this film you will not only explore the turkish music but will also explore the city of <UNK> with wonderful pictures and scenes from all over the important <UNK> of the city there are lots of delightful conversations with all sorts of musicians and their thoughts about music culture there is also discussions about the mixture of east and west like <UNK> has how they make their music how do they see themselves comparing to other country's musicians it consists the music of <UNK> the turkish queen of music an important work of art
<START> ah the outer limits i love that show it was creepy or down right mysterious i loved all the genres of the show from horror to thriller to mystery whatever the genre it was good i guess i must have started watching way after it got canceled when sci fi showed it as re runs or played <UNK> of it it was a really good show i don't know all about the seasons and everything but i do remember that every time i saw the screen freak out and the voice on the tv say there is nothing wrong with your television do not attempt to <UNK> the picture i would <UNK> with delight it was a good show and i enjoy watching it if it would come on i give it a healthy 8 out of 10
<START> a research scientist is <UNK> with human <UNK> in an attempt to create the perfect human being his work has made it to the point where he can take a human <UNK> and <UNK> its growth to that of an adult within a few days his latest creation is a spoiler <UNK> but side effects from the process spoiler <UNK> according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br <UNK> opens by promising the film you are about to see is not all science fiction it is based upon medical technology which currently exists for <UNK> growth outside the <UNK> it could be a possibility or today according to dr charles m iii right and dr <UNK> brothers appears later at a party with <UNK> <UNK> br br first we see rock hudson as dr paul light a cigarette and drive <UNK> watch that <UNK> during a storm unfortunately he hits a dog mr hudson takes the wounded <UNK> home he learns it is pregnant and manages to save the life of one of the <UNK> due to his experimental knowledge of <UNK> growth what this really <UNK> down to is that hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the <UNK> so that it can survive outside the mother's <UNK> the dog number one grows to adult size rapidly and is passed off as its mother br br hudson lives with his sister in law diane <UNK> as martha douglas since his wife nicole also a doctor died in another car accident ms <UNK> seems more emotionally stable about <UNK> death than hudson who survived the crash that killed his wife things begin to get creepy when <UNK> dog shows an intelligence level far above any normal dog then hudson decides to use his <UNK> <UNK> growth on a human barbara <UNK> as victoria spencer br br hudson and the cast try their best but the <UNK> storyline is <UNK> absurd nonsense if you take away her silly opening and closing scenes ms <UNK> <UNK> characterization almost works she might have been a bigger star if offered better films than this the <UNK> ending suggests a sequel but happily the idea was <UNK>
<START> legendary cameron mitchell turkey about an actor makeup man who is burned by the head of a studio when a drink is tossed in his face as he is lighting up a cigarette reduced to a <UNK> mess and wearing an eye <UNK> mitchell works at the wax museum he also kidnaps and kills people using a solution which them so he can turn them into displays genuinely bizarre bad movie that defies description watch as the various wax figures try not to move watch as the entire <UNK> out put for several southern states is as things just get <UNK> and <UNK> its an awful train wreck of a movie and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen a classic bad movie that will <UNK> you even as it leaves permanent <UNK> on your psyche
<START> i agree that this is one of the very best episodes of the entire series my only <UNK> would be the somewhat jarring appearance of mark as the commander my reasoning is this if you were not around for the first run of this episode then you know mr as <UNK> father and for the 2nd generation <UNK> or <UNK> your <UNK> it takes you out of the scene at first yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well acted by all there are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war vs the price of peace and certainly does remind one of some of the best of the wwii and later era movies those are not my favorite genre but i certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that <UNK> you'll see it holds up i'll never understand why sci fi gets so little respect the best drama comes out of placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances
<START> the james dean story is introduced as a different kind of motion picture explaining the presence of the leading character in this film has been made possible by the use of existing motion picture material tape <UNK> of his voice and by means of a new technique dynamic exploration of the still photograph the only tape <UNK> of his voice noteworthy is one short recording mr dean make while visiting his family in indiana he wanted to record any family <UNK> of his great grandfather cal dean intrigued because he played a similarly named cal in east of <UNK> dean asks if cal dean was interested in art and learns the relative was an james dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family obviously that's the only 100 accurate revelation in this documentary james dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family br br an amazing screen test <UNK> from east of <UNK> appears near the film's end it's a black and white scene between dean as cal <UNK> and co star richard <UNK> as <UNK> dean is at his mesmerizing best if this scene appeared only here and no east of <UNK> film was completed this documentary would be an essential high rated film but the scene a perfect 10 in isolation should be considered an east of <UNK> extra <UNK> traffic safety film is also worth seeing br br there are the expected interviews with family and friends my favorites were the guy <UNK> going through a box of stuff dean left with him and <UNK> family there wasn't enough from aunt and the letter from dean to his little cousin was very nice more reading of <UNK> letters would have been welcome <UNK> <UNK> writer friend seemed to have a better <UNK> for the film filmmakers might have considered developing it as a main focus br br robert altman's direction of martin <UNK> reading of stewart script is dreadful what were they thinking perhaps filmmakers can be forgiven due to the <UNK> of <UNK> passing don't expect the james dean story at all this movie is more about <UNK> effect on people both the fans and filmmakers than the man it is very clearly an early piece of the james dean myth making legend tommy <UNK> sings let me be loved the narrative refers to dean as he with a god like air the shots of <UNK> family seeming to know the moment he dies are truly wretched br br the james dean story 8 13 <UNK> robert altman james dean martin <UNK> richard <UNK>
<START> this film directed by george who made so many excellent films is well up to his excellent standard it is crisp witty with some wonderful lines and has the <UNK> ronald colman in the romantic lead colman plays the <UNK> charming younger son of a wealthy english <UNK> he is <UNK> irresponsible spending for instance of his last <UNK> in the world on a cute little <UNK> whom he names george but open wildly generous <UNK> of <UNK> in the possible way and hopelessly sentimental he is so dashing that all the women fall in love with him his girlfriend is a star of the music <UNK> and hence in 1930 a <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> played with her typical narrow eyed by the youthful myrna loy was not a great user of closeups and <UNK> of that day had their faces half hidden with those awful <UNK> hats anyway so we do not get as good glimpses of the faces of the two <UNK> as we would like the director seems more interested in the charming colman anyway the romantic female lead is the youthful and fresh faced loretta young who had not yet become the <UNK> julie andrews we generally know her as but was still a <UNK> girl <UNK> all the <UNK> of a rose garden and laughing <UNK> and <UNK> the whole time it is obvious that a character with her terrific sense of humour was needed to appreciate the <UNK> <UNK> social <UNK> of the refreshing <UNK> character played by colman the plot barely matters as is so often the case with these light and amusing films this is just such fun
<START> <UNK> or glenda was edward d wood <UNK> first attempt at directing a feature film for this he chose a topic near and dear to his heart <UNK> the art of a man wanting to dress in women's clothes to his credit wood tried to deal with subject matter that was largely taboo in 1953 unfortunately wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the film br br the story opens with a prologue by bela lugosi that makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead <UNK> <UNK> glenda daniel davis aka ed wood inspector warren <UNK> <UNK> with the help of psychiatrist dr <UNK> timothy farrell tries to understand why a man would want to live and die this way br br <UNK> is engaged to barbara <UNK> fuller and is reluctant to tell her of his obsession and that's it we see endless stock footage shots of anything from <UNK> traffic to soldiers landing on the beach interspersed with shots of wood walking down the same street dressed as either <UNK> or glenda and looking <UNK> at women's clothes in a store window poor old bela who was down on his luck and <UNK> by wood keeps popping in throughout the story i'm not 100 sure but i think <UNK> scenes were added for his name value after the body of the movie was completed br br to add to the confusion of <UNK> narration farrell as dr <UNK> also provides off screen narration lugosi keeps saying take care take care as well as some <UNK> about snakes and <UNK> and puppy <UNK> <UNK> br br the story also deals with a <UNK> who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and <UNK> character s the dream sequences are laughable a wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors fully <UNK> but leaving little to the imagination <UNK> for 1953 br br this film along with <UNK> other classics were so bad that they became <UNK> by the public as cult classics over the years for that reason they have survived to this day
<START> the credits come from the sandy frank <UNK> job that was made to turn this movie into cave <UNK> for re release now that that's <UNK> up oh excruciating eye <UNK> pain blade master leaps shamelessly on the sword <UNK> <UNK> started by the conan flicks except the <UNK> never left the garage anyway as such this italian flick is a dud trying to rip off a box office dud with predictable results however this would give too little credit to the director and writers who make no effort whatsoever to maintain a coherent plot continuity any semblance of era accurate continuity miles <UNK> is no leading man now or forever tarzan the ape man proved that if <UNK> didn't just an unlikeable picture and a chore to watch
<START> may contain spoilers br br this historical movie was so refreshing although it may be the actual events it does show the heartless nature of emperor which he was later infamous for and there wasn't a single computer generated person in it i think it's great that china has produce such an epic film the costumes and the settings were beautiful the performances were also excellent dignity vs death is a major theme in this movie and i think it reflects the chinese history and culture i also enjoyed a little <UNK> to the warriors a 3d map <UNK> of the conquest of china with individual soldiers emperor of course later as <UNK> with his life size warriors br br i also enjoyed the scene with the dwarf he was a very interesting character even if he only had a small scene br br 9 10 br br
<START> i just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week what's the problem here folks admit that the performances are great i mean lange is stellar and that the film is good looking but it's got less than a i don't get it come on the not that bad br br having read a lot of <UNK> winning novels and having seen a lot of the films based on them i think a better than decent job was done in bringing the screenplay together i thought the <UNK> down of all the dialogue in the novel was executed almost perfectly this story had a pretty <UNK> amount of dialogue in it and the story really came through on the screen despite the fact that only a portion of it was used br br book spoiler part i was however a little disappointed in the <UNK> tries to kill rose being <UNK> i thought that was one of the more emotionally jarring parts of the book but it was probably a good bet to leave it out avid movie goers more than avid readers i think tend to be less <UNK> of protagonists pulling <UNK> stuff it's apt to confuse johnny and joe <UNK> br br if you loved the book you will like the movie if you hated the book you will likely hate the movie br br br br
<START> one of the best as being a fan of the civil war i was very pleased with the first installment of the north and south trilogy patrick <UNK> gives and extraordinary performance as well as james reed and leslie ann down in watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten the subjects of love passion grief shame harmony and cruelty come to life i was first introduced to this series when i was in the <UNK> grade being a young boy you would think that i wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap to be honest this story stole the hearts of every one in my class and this is just the first book i bought the novel and studied the likes and differences and it was awesome i am 17 now and still enjoy the story characters subject and remember the times of the civil war as a movie director of the future i will always enjoy north and south book one
<START> i just watched it for the second time today and i must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it and eric is <UNK> than ever to often in the movies first nations people are seen as other than everyday people we are always portrayed as <UNK> or medicine people hey we are just like everyone else and this movie showed just that we hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice it is really to bad that the big movie companies cant see that i cant wait till this comes out on dvd thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was
<START> we're living in sad times today in which it seems like every comedy movie and tv show is painfully unfunny and inflicted with cheap crude or poor humor most people don't know what it means to really laugh at a comedy and these people desperately need to watch throw <UNK> from the train i say with little <UNK> that this is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen from beginning to end the comedy is so unpredictable and twisted just enough to make us laugh out loud many times throughout don't be fooled by the murder plot the plot is not serious enough to make us care or worry about what's going to happen the story involves a young man danny <UNK> who wants to get rid of his annoying <UNK> mother anne <UNK> nominated for an oscar in a role that was completely flawless in my opinion and does so by killing off billy <UNK> wife whom crystal wanted dead for stealing his novel i don't want to spoil the jokes and gags in this film but all i can say is that you must see this film if you want to laugh fast paced and genuinely a real treat to comedy lovers and the type of film you just do not see today br br 1 2 out of
<START> people get a clue i mean the writers dont have one so i would expect you to this show is such a pale imitation of the show that you can laugh at it and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects and is in b w <UNK> <UNK> yet the mood and the writing on the old show is miles ahead of this drivel get hip kids if 98 degrees or <UNK> told you to watch it you would you know it just <UNK> them and tell all your friends you were <UNK> with the before it became too cool
<START> i supposed i was actually expecting a bollywood remake of the fog from the title but this is actually more of a bollywood remake of i know what you did last summer with some elements of scream kind of sort of and not a very good one either apart from a couple very entertaining song dance numbers this is pretty terrible it's obviously got a decent budget yet it's wasted on <UNK> <UNK> that weren't that tasty to begin with a young woman is threatened by a creepy guy to not enter a beauty contest because he wants his sister to win she thankfully doesn't look as creepy as her brother but she enters anyway and wins and of course the creepy guy comes after her and is killed after which comes a rousing game of hide the body of course the body disappears and no one seems to know why but someone knows and they're waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous plot twist interspersed with all this tired rehash are a few nifty dance numbers especially the <UNK> dance number at the party for the girl who won the beauty contest it's highly colorful it's well done downright fun and utterly wasted in this terrible film i would much rather watch an old <UNK> brothers movie than this piece of crap although someone has deemed that these don't need to be made available for the most part which is a crime in itself but not as big of a crime as this film i took one for the team watching this one so take my advice don't bother 2 out of 10
<START> is a movie which many will watch and enjoy until the end while others will stop watching it within five minutes it is a parody of detective movies with all the twists and turns the action takes place only at night in the dark <UNK> of a city which resembles <UNK> <UNK> city look carefully at the streets buildings the police car chasing the criminals etc it is also a parody of musicals with its really funny characters such as secretary and the actor playing assistant lover who do their best to sing albeit not very successfully br br the spaces occupied by the characters have their own presence in the film such as the <UNK> blue box there is a real club with this name in vienna where one can see a sailor hitting on a girl in the background apartment with the black paint <UNK> on the walls and the dirty kitchen <UNK> with the sweet picture of his assistant etc br br the humorous moments in the movie are many and include flat in the face type of humor such as <UNK> in his <UNK> face the prostitute <UNK> extra for <UNK> the ridiculous outfits of the female thugs of montana etc br br a legendary film from the 80's especially for those interested in <UNK> or german speaking cinema
<START> i watched a movie called dark <UNK> dated 1974 the credits to this movie are exactly the same as dark star so i'm going to presume it was an alternate title dark <UNK> was nowhere near as funny as everyone else here states the acting was lame the editing <UNK> and overall stupid at the beginning there's an annoying 1970's <UNK> song called benson arizona that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie basically the plot revolves around a small crew of an <UNK> <UNK> that goes around bombing places that are unstable the bombs are <UNK> and respond to people the obligatory disaster <UNK> communication between the bombs and the crew one of the <UNK> goes out and has an <UNK> idiotic existential conversation with the bomb that made no sense whatsoever the movie i saw was done in under an hour and a half with commercials thrown in so i suspect that dark <UNK> is an version of dark star br br the alien is an red beach ball <UNK> painted with a pair of monster hands that it walks on it was silly and unconvincing as an alien br br it's hard to believe that john carpenter had a hand in this his other movies were so much better
<START> if your a child of the 80's and have not seen this movie you have failed to be a true child of the 80's how can you not love those great <UNK> don't forget about the lines and songs years later i can still sing every word to every song the story line is great and much better then the films for kids today it's just pure fun and worth the rent even if your all grown up
<START> i agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull i found myself <UNK> the main character and the following actors actresses that came in the scenes the camera work was non pleasing itself random shots and shaky film scenes made me quite annoyed and i turned the film off i will make up my time by watching the 1999 adaption and hope that it fits <UNK> along with sense and sensibility emma becoming jane and pride and prejudice i've only a few others to watch besides these films but i believe they were done in great taste the music was kind of out of place with the film also reminding me of another show i had seen this year it was called <UNK> and a show from bbc i came across it one night on the web i rather liked the first season but the second season was dry and pulling things out of thin air that should of stayed with the clouds i found the main male character who was henry in this film out of place perhaps i just do not like his way of speaking or his stature well i would not recommend this film to anyone unless they were going to have it muted and they wanted to look at the fashion of the era or the way homes were kept at the time again i will watch the 1999 version and hope it is a better and does jane austen some justice to her writing
<START> there were at least a half dozen silent film versions of shakespeare's the <UNK> of <UNK> and there have been several television productions but no one has ever gotten around to making a big budget theatrical feature from the play until now given the nature of the play s most memorable character <UNK> the nasty jew it's a good guess that the little <UNK> that <UNK> in europe in the late 1930's and 1940's may have <UNK> <UNK> enthusiasm sure the main motivation for michael new film is to provide al pacino with a chance to shout <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and be tormented all of which he is quite good at like richard iii the role of <UNK> is a scenery dream it is ridiculous to call shakespeare an anti <UNK> since he never met a jew jews were banned from england from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad on some level jews might as well have been a <UNK> race to him but while shakespeare may not have been anti <UNK> his play certainly is pacino gives <UNK> a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of <UNK> unfortunately the result is a <UNK> century with the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> bear version begins with a crawl about the wretched of jews and then spot antonio jeremy <UNK> spitting on <UNK> pacino who's really just standing around <UNK> his own business will buy it when it comes out on dvd for sure <UNK> booker
<START> the wild life has an obvious resemblance to fast times at <UNK> high and the wild life comes up short br br br br some other stan wrote the above comment of course the wild life is no <UNK> <UNK> is the quintessential 80s however the wild life is enjoyable if you're not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place the little latino from scarface is in this movie and he's straight <UNK> i got <UNK> the colonel also makes an appearance <UNK> rip the colonel 1931 1997 br br this movie is no worse than a 6 in comparison to other genres btw it is no worse than a 7 in terms of other 80s teen comedies at that it does very much have the feel of a cameron <UNK> movie only gave it a 5
<START> when fellini committed 8 1 2 to film many commented that it was the most personal vision ever to find its perfect expression when <UNK> cast to the flames of his <UNK> passion many were <UNK> at the honest brutality of his <UNK> feelings for a younger woman when and a merry band of <UNK> talented and filmmakers from the <UNK> of movie making insanity band together during the course of two <UNK> weeks in december 2000 many commented that nothing more <UNK> had ever been committed much less on film br br well to the <UNK> out there watch this original piece and find out why the id is both a charming and powerful thing and if that doesn't roll over and rub one out it's probably time you did so br br kudos on a great piece of art
<START> honestly this show <UNK> my heart i watch it everyday on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before the characters are so well developed and their relationships are so real i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter the are super fast talking witty girls that will truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious but serious enough for it to be completely <UNK> it's an hour long which is a major plus because you can't ever get enough <UNK> even in one hour emily and richard <UNK> are kicks parents grandparents they're you're average rich parents emily president of the <UNK> and richard a well known lawyer and <UNK> <UNK> st <UNK> is following in the footsteps of her grandparents and this could not make them any happier of course mother is so very proud of her but her whole life has worked on ultimately <UNK> her parents and <UNK> going to <UNK> did not help her on that journey but believe me every episode she does get closer
<START> thank god that there are films out there that don't follow the same old hollywood crap formula i think the digital revolution and the dvd revolution is actually making it possible for more interesting work to get out there even if you have to dig harder to find it i love it when a film takes its time to draw you in deeper and deeper into its inner emotional reaches it really was like taking a trip through the soul of america and that soul is disturbed and confused what really blew my mind was the way they used martin <UNK> king's speeches about vietnam and references to his assassination in a way that hit me hard i found myself <UNK> up every time i heard his voice i've heard him speak before of course but the way they used the speeches here made me feel like i understood his message in a way i'd never thought about br br what can you say about a movie that has heavy <UNK> about war <UNK> and a <UNK> for compassion at the end of it where a credits crawl would usually be in fact there's no credits at all in the film you have to access them by <UNK> them in the features somehow that made me think a lot all in all i can't say enough about this dvd brilliant
<START> it became apparent in the first 25 mins of watching this that the writers really wanted to make a feature length film and they probably certainly enjoyed the whole process but then seemed to forget the fact that it needed a decent plot if the best they could do was have 3 of the <UNK> characters enter the real world and have <UNK> sorts of amusing then they should have left well alone i didn't laugh once and that whole adventures of baron <UNK> time <UNK> thing going on in the middle was very very poor contrived and very loose it just seemed like a <UNK> stop tour of anything they thought work just to drag it out to a feature br br full of holes <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> characters needed the writers to carry on writing in order to save them yet jeff managed to write himself into the sub story time filling william and mary and era if he could do this then why didn't they just carry on writing <UNK> themselves duh and <UNK> audition what was that for i mean what was the point he did it and we heard nothing else whatsoever about it br br my main point is that while i loved the series this was an ill thought out seemingly rushed project put it this way the plot was so poor that if we didn't already know the characters and as a fan i had a certain loyalty to carry on watching and we relied solely on the the story itself this would have fallen flat on its face at best it would have gone straight to video and at worst would never have been made in the first place or maybe that should be the other way round truly dreadful
<START> ok a film about a film that takes a crack at video movie making could be entertaining could be should be funny edgy even controversial or at least interesting and yet this film is the negative version of that <UNK> was entertaining as a <UNK> film producer shatner played crazy yet likable and had all the best lines the rest of the characters were boring predictable boring underdeveloped boring and boring the production value was lame you'll actually see the boom come down in one scene the sound was awful in some of the scenes hey i'm a big fan of <UNK> and of <UNK> now but their talents are wasted here at least the story had a clichéd ending
<START> william shakespeare probably didn't <UNK> as a gay doctor antonio as a <UNK> wife or as a with a but the <UNK> had worse done to his good work over time and might even enjoy the <UNK> <UNK> of life that is his <UNK> as re <UNK> by paul <UNK> and co writer leon br br this time <UNK> is philip john <UNK> a manhattan based architect tired of <UNK> atlantic city <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> especially after discovering <UNK> is carrying on an affair with <UNK> wife <UNK> gena rowlands along with daughter miranda molly <UNK> philip escapes to a remote greek island with miranda and his new mistress <UNK> susan sarandon a nice catholic girl who struggles with <UNK> <UNK> lifestyle will a sudden storm bring all right in the end br br here's a thought on the career of <UNK> how many other actors could make a film so confused into something so riveting a darling of film critics for his earlier work often with his real life wife rowlands he presents a central character who really suffers for his art here but seems to enjoy himself and makes us enjoy him too it's not <UNK> but something rich and strange that makes for a terrific sea change all his own br br it's all here he tells one of his faithful companions dog <UNK> beauty magic inspiration and <UNK> that it is <UNK> <UNK> london to 1982 manhattan and finds some nice in <UNK> <UNK> life show me the magic he calls out to a storm tossed city and version <UNK> by donald sterling cinematography of purple <UNK> and naturally sun greek landscapes does just that br br it's not a perfect movie by any means in fact the big finale which is the only part of the movie that follows shakespeare's storyline to any faithful extent is a mess <UNK> character is hard to care much for in this film and after meeting sarandon in all her glory it's hard to understand <UNK> continuing concern for his wife let alone his left field desire to make an unhappy sacrifice in order to <UNK> the natural order of things br br but there's a lot to love about <UNK> in addition to cassavetes there's <UNK> film debut as his loyal but restless daughter here as in the play an object of desire for the primitive <UNK> <UNK> julia <UNK> here is very much the same <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> that would inspire john hughes but with an emotional depth those later hughes films didn't delve into <UNK> and julia never got any oscar attention but they both would win golden <UNK> for their playful work here he tries to woo her in her island isolation with his tv reruns of <UNK> in greek tempted by her 15 year old body br br i want to you with my <UNK> johnny declares getting shoved aside but winning our sympathy anyway especially after performing new york new york with a chorus of <UNK> when <UNK> hit the screens julia was the <UNK> of broadway as the lead in nine br br it's show even if it feels at times that cassavetes is running things with <UNK> line <UNK> and emotional <UNK> <UNK> philip introduces himself to <UNK> by telling her i'm right in the middle of a nervous breakdown he plays his character as an <UNK> obsessive seeking to his happiness by building an theater in his otherwise <UNK> island br br adding to the enjoyment is rich performance as the other man who is as completely <UNK> as julia while telling a youth obsessed philip boys don't have half as much <UNK> as we have they're nervous and they make love in the back of an old sports car despite being overlong and pretentious in spots like so many art films <UNK> is entertaining in its <UNK> and a trip very much like shakespeare intended even if his dreams didn't involve smoking pot <UNK> at a go <UNK> concert
<START> seriously folks i was getting ready to actually write the <UNK> <UNK> and recommend this movie as <UNK> <UNK> for 2007 until i got on imdb com and realized its <UNK> date was 2006 and not 2007 seriously though this movie could have easily been a <UNK> <UNK> this movie sucked how in the world this piece of crap was overlooked even for a <UNK> nomination in 2006 is beyond me because it easily could have <UNK> with basically it stinks too for the 2006 <UNK> championship br br i rented this movie on the recommendation of a female neighbor of mine who told me oh my god after seeing this movie it's going to be a long long time before i ever stop at a rest stop ever again i couldn't believe how not scary and awful this movie was possible spoilers below not that you'll be missing out on anything br br ok first of all the problem the rest stop itself obviously the director of this piece of crap doesn't know the first thing about women the <UNK> in that rest stop were on the same level as the one in the movie <UNK> i don't claim to know everything there is to know about women but one thing i do know is that women for the most part are total and complete <UNK> neat freaks given the choice between taking a crap on either of those <UNK> and possibly catching something or <UNK> in the woods a woman is going to <UNK> for <UNK> in the woods i know because i've gone camping with them before and they have no problem <UNK> in the woods so right there major plot hole and br br second of all she comes out of the rest stop and her boyfriend who drove the car is nowhere to be found not him nor his car he just left she starts screaming his name wondering where he is <UNK> hello you're standing on wet mud did it ever occur to you to look down for some tire tracks i mean his car is gone it didn't just get up and fly away and actually that makes me think i actually was looking down at her feet and there weren't any <UNK> marks in the mud how exactly did that happen br br third the bible <UNK> mobile home family with the freak midget in the back taking <UNK> pictures wtf they made absolutely no sense at all and it's as if the director just threw them in to be weird for the sake of being weird they made no sense at all and had no place even being in the movie br br fourth oh my god this i mean finally near the end of the movie she finally sees the escape <UNK> on the ceiling inside the rest stop i'm like you dumb <UNK> h you've been locked up in this rest stop for all this time and you just now see the escape <UNK> on the ceiling i mean it's like they threw that in just because the killer tossed <UNK> on the floor through the window and was getting ready to light a match so she needs to get to higher ground to avoid being burned and oh look a perfect reason for her to get to higher ground an escape <UNK> on the ceiling it's like why didn't she go through that before most people in that situation would have seen that from the moment they were locked in that rest stop and gotten the f k out of dodge when they showed that escape <UNK> at the end of the movie i was like you have got to be kidding me br br fifth what was the deal with all the of people she encountered continuing to just disappear the girl in the <UNK> closet in the rest stop the dumb cop her at the end of the movie when she ended up in the <UNK> closet herself it was never explained personally when they did this i thought to myself oh christ on a cracker it's her she's the killer wonderful she killed all of those people doesn't remember doing it and the writers of this movie just ripped off a certain french horror flick that i can't mention on imdb com or i'll be <UNK> for giving away the ending that movie sucked by the way too people but it wasn't she wasn't the killer and the whole deal with the dead people disappearing was never ever explained oh for the love of god people stay away from this movie this movie sucked balls and i have now got a serious bone to pick with my neighbor it's on the 2 for 1 rack at family video don't even rent it if someone gives it to you for free
<START> i caught this on hbo under its category of guilty pleasures and i would agree that i felt guilty and <UNK> watching it one it's trash and really raunchy trash two the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn who did it you think so what however i must admit to being enough of a male <UNK> pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie if for no other reason than to see <UNK> wilson get completely naked a number of times do i feel dirty for having watched it yes am i sorry i watched it no so there's the <UNK> between being a lover of good movies and a lover of the female <UNK> even when in a poor movie sigh
<START> i was extremely excited for this movie my expectations were under control because i read the book first <UNK> i expected differences what i didn't expect were how great the differences were starting off by the characters physical appearances like <UNK> lack of <UNK> n amanda not being a brunette lol but i let that go the character developments were not there at all you didn't have time to love amanda character and you couldn't feel for her or for john when they first separated i thought the two weeks were rushed and i hated that she left first then him it took the emotional <UNK> away and why did they change tim from the book why did they make him a dad instead of a brother and why did they make him <UNK> old looking and the movie lacked that intense moment when they find out what happens at the end didnt want to spoil it lol but for those who watched it u know what i mean and did they change the ending in the book it was heartbreaking and emotional and it <UNK> on <UNK> character's decision did they twist it it just made it look like a rushed ending it was terrible thats what disappointed me the most the ending of the book should have been exactly the same
<START> a group of 7 gold <UNK> head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an <UNK> of course they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people this low budget 25 000 horror flick has a slight cult following and i'm not exactly sure why unless it is because it is so obscure i'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining but the hour getting there is pure torture lots of walking and talking and our titular <UNK> doesn't appear until 45 minutes in even in the extras co writer chris <UNK> admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring i would forgive them if they were strict amateurs but this group <UNK> from <UNK> so i would hope they know an exploitation film should be <UNK> anyway like i said the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool john carpenter like score i wanted to see more of the monster but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds br br even if the movie isn't the best code red dvd has given this great attention you have interviews and an audio commentary by director <UNK> anne phillips producer actor mark and co writer <UNK> the tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring like a cave set being built in a backyard even more interesting are and <UNK> student shorts which are actually all better than the feature production <UNK> was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else has worked <UNK> in hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy the film's vhs is kind of legendary for how dark it was and i'm sure this is much better however you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights <UNK> around in the <UNK> safe to say the original my bloody valentine is still horror film set in a mine <UNK>
<START> told in flashback the film opens in 1989 with charlie being given award for his role in the defeat of communism i must admit my heart <UNK> as at the thought of have to endure yet another earnest somewhat boring and overlong life story how wrong was i because that short scene is as close as the film ever gets to boring br br the film is full of entertaining amusing set ups and cracking dialogue in some of the most unexpected places the next scene after the awards ceremony is charlie in a hot <UNK> with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to <UNK> in a tv programme another rather amusing scene is about 3 quarters into the film <UNK> charlie a group of his rather sexy <UNK> phillip seymour cia man and a bottle of <UNK> as to dialogue what about this for a line the senator says he can teach us to type but can't teach us to grow tits ok school <UNK> i know but the film is laced with great lines br br as to performances well phillip seymour hoffman as usual steals every scene he's in hanks is ok but surprisingly to me anyway was julia roberts who is very good in the role of a rather eccentric texas oil br br charlie <UNK> war is one of the best non musician bio <UNK> in a long while as well as being that rare thing a film that entertains <UNK> as well as informs all in equal measure
<START> <UNK> blues is a touching story about <UNK> a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need it's told from the viewpoint of a boy taken in by <UNK> when his own mother isn't quite up to the task br br i have respect for this movie for three main reasons 1 it is touching but not sappy it's told in a very real fashion without a lot of the <UNK> hollywood storytelling <UNK> and the ending is quite good <UNK> but not over the top br br 2 although it's clearly an african american film being set in the post <UNK> black community of <UNK> new york it doesn't wear its <UNK> on its <UNK> the story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas and comedies surrounding their lives it's not preachy it's simply good br br 3 it has a great soundtrack can't beat old school r b and chicago blues br br generally the acting is strong but not universally so some of the performances simply don't hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray but considering it was a made for tv movie that's to be expected br br 8 out of 10 <UNK> but likable good film for a rainy day
<START> ignore the extreme votes about house of wax in no way is it either a 1 or a 10 i will try to be of help to anyone thinking about seeing house of wax or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated the trailer makes this movie look very promising which is what trailers are supposed to do there is only one thing for sure with trailers if the producers can't together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck fest but a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good it does not give you much idea about the total package here a little research can be valuable br br house of wax stars elisha <UNK> whose acting skills are closer to kathy ireland than to either her fellow canadian sarah or her <UNK> rose and was directed by a music video artist <UNK> known as in his feature debut these are not good signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of production designer grace walken who was responsible for the look of ghost ship once again <UNK> work is worth seeing so much so that it looks like 90 of the movie's 30 million budget went to production design the rest went to <UNK> to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film finger cut off lips glued shut tied up and lots of <UNK> around in <UNK> <UNK> stuff by the bye <UNK> looks considerably <UNK> than she did in the girl next door about one big pig out away from having a major weight problem br br which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew and judging from the what was on the screen this might actually be true it looks like everyone else <UNK> their time to get their first acting or crew credit unfortunately whether it was <UNK> or jealousy over the pay <UNK> the <UNK> of all these inexperienced incompetent <UNK> amount to less than zero br br inexperienced steven <UNK> work was about as awful as you are likely to see and working in league with an incompetent editor like joel insert pearl harbor here they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group rather than <UNK> over and showcase the sets window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky <UNK> <UNK> camera work <UNK> the problem with an insane number of <UNK> cuts poor lighting an add like camera and <UNK> cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design not what is needed when the movie's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets br br chan hayes did the screenplay and charles who wrote the original story is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity one saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody insert van <UNK> here the murders are played for laughs too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six the audience particularly <UNK> up when a certain high profile hotel <UNK> got her <UNK> face run through by an steel bar although her earlier half baked <UNK> was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film another comedy highlight was when <UNK> sticks her finger through a <UNK> and has it <UNK> off by the bad guy br br the good scenes take place in house of wax a <UNK> that has something to do with a closed sugar mill <UNK> twins and a lot of <UNK> which <UNK> gets to <UNK> in all this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural florida although from the many hills it sure looks like paul <UNK> country attention location <UNK> the <UNK> coast is not noted for it's rolling <UNK> the screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection bad pun between the two sets of twins but somewhere during production or post production most of the dialogue concerning this was <UNK> since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere you wonder why it wasn't also cut to <UNK> the boredom factor br br what is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic even with the existing cast what was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax because it is a <UNK> medium modern film is <UNK> <UNK> almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality here they had a ready made opportunity to give the <UNK> medium a theatrical element of extreme <UNK> like an <UNK> painting the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax <UNK> up close of course they would have had to find a <UNK> director and <UNK> to bring the thing off successfully but everything else was already in place for this to happen
<START> this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought i'd be able to stand it but i was wrong first the weird <UNK> it was like watching america's funniest home videos the damn parents i hated them so much the <UNK> typical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone i just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene <UNK> i must say it's so <UNK> bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once
<START> all the comments so far about this movie are negative but i have to say i found the net engaging few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat but this one did another plus for it is that most action suspense films are full of language but this one had little profanity i found it an enjoyable movie to watch i am slightly biased though being a big sandra <UNK> fan <UNK>
<START> after reading fool for love in a drama class of mine i was looking forward to seeing how sam <UNK> wonderful play would be translated to the screen much to my <UNK> it was nowhere near as entertaining as the play the film seemed to drag the music was inappropriate for the tone of the movie and all the raw energy of the play seemed to have been sucked out of this film version it's a shame to see this come out this way even with <UNK> involvement playing the role of eddie do yourselves a favor see the play next time it's being performed in your area or simply read the book instead
<START> can you capture the moment when first you hear rain on a roof some things are beyond the sum of their parts expressing the poetry of life the things that matter br br poet dylan thomas captured the seemingly <UNK> a good poem helps to <UNK> everyone's knowledge of himself and the world around him bob dylan named himself after him so why has it taken so long to make a film of the great dylan thomas a simple biopic could have missed the point writer <UNK> macdonald has taken a different better approach br br in the edge of love she creates the world of passions and <UNK> that fill the <UNK> so we can swim in them the lives of four friends dylan who <UNK> and loves to the full wife <UNK> <UNK> miller his <UNK> support war hero william cillian murphy who saves him from a street <UNK> and then there's his childhood sweetheart vera dear vera take your breath away vera she's <UNK> closest friend <UNK> wife and like a <UNK> the <UNK> in <UNK> dark sky br br it all kicks off in the 1940 london <UNK> with bomb <UNK> in the underground enter vera an impressive <UNK> knightley under <UNK> stage <UNK> she meets dylan for the first time again in years her heart is <UNK> their eyes shine through the smoke of the room the <UNK> of their former passion dylan native <UNK> <UNK> matthew rhys is no <UNK> <UNK> poet master of his <UNK> he must experience them all fully he introduces his beloved wife then continues to woo vera br br the edge of love is a visual treat the soundtrack leaves you wanting for more performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers as a lush love story it's pretty good as an insight into dylan thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives not bad at all and as a tribute to a great man inspiring br br the production has been at pains to project the spirit of dylan thomas without <UNK> historical accuracy too much dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed and it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of albert square br br <UNK> macdonald seemed aware of the <UNK> nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer <UNK> of the real william and vera think of all the things that you don't want me to write about she said because i have to have <UNK> <UNK> for macdonald the limits were if she should cause <UNK> to <UNK> memory but for many artists especially men the limits are those which wife and family could set on them a woman is not going to let <UNK> ideals <UNK> with practical common sense issues and will even put her children's interests before her own this occasionally happens the other way round as when <UNK> genius virginia <UNK> refused to let loving leonard bring her down to earth in the hours br br in spite of the tension between <UNK> and vera these two women become closest buddies it is one of the main and very beautiful themes of the film br br the film's colours tell a story in themselves in a drab wartime britain <UNK> and vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey shortly after meeting <UNK> lit up in lights stage persona we encounter <UNK> through her <UNK> blue eyes <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of <UNK> <UNK> on a beautiful <UNK> as she <UNK> with dylan but <UNK> <UNK> red <UNK> is less enduring for her marriage is second best even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband br br outstanding cinematography <UNK> to using montage to <UNK> images in a manner similar to <UNK> of unrelated words to create further meaning horrific war scenes in are <UNK> with screams of vera in <UNK> giving birth or is it abortion we are not told immediately pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day br br constant echoes of <UNK> poetry throughout the film lead us beyond <UNK> <UNK> it reminds me of marlon brando reading <UNK> <UNK> in apocalypse now a light beyond the horrors of the world a different way of seeing things i'll take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no one died  ever says dylan to vera as they walk along the beach elsewhere <UNK> recalls childhood with vera we're still innocent in dylan she says br br there's a time to leave your <UNK> at home or share a universal cigarette not literally perhaps a time to be inspired enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year
<START> bart the genius whilst not the first simpsons episode bart he genius more or less is the first typical episode there's no <UNK> or theme it's just your typical simpsons episode in set up it always seems to me that it's an episode that grows on you there are certain elements i don't care for largely the animation which can be forgiven but over time i take a liking to this story of it's <UNK> br br for example it'd be very hard for a live action sit com on a standard budget to do this episode due to the various different sets that show in this episode the computer <UNK> in ms class the opera and so on my point is with that the simpsons realises one of the biggest strengths in animation the sheer lack of visual limitations when compared to live action br br on a writing stand point it's also highly intelligent and fresh the concept is pretty unique and particularly the problems faced instead of the ol' fail safe that work was too hard it was simply <UNK> social isolation from his classmates that failed him although the exploding science experiment may prove otherwise which i also think is one of the best visual gags of the series the ending seems a little unoriginal largely because the bart running naked into his room to avoid homer was already done in the shorts but still funny for <UNK> and <UNK> short back and forth if for nothing else br br ultimately it's a very good episode with lots of interesting new point in the series though not exactly perfect br br oh and the now iconic name was of course unleashed onto the world
<START> <UNK> for title <UNK> after reading reviews and <UNK> my girlfriend and i confirmed that this movie is an utter piece of trash this movie lost her as one of those rare tarantino fans i wish it were made on <UNK> film and all the copies <UNK> neatly underneath a chain smoking tarantino <UNK> the literally needless violence the plot holes <UNK> table <UNK> sans drama and absent character development made this a thoroughly painful <UNK> montage br br what acting was there and how much of that was just because i was too busy reading the subtitles i watch my share of anime and kudos for the attempt at authenticity but it was overdone for an english language movie with the glaring historical <UNK> the constant reading killed what acting there was br br why pay money for a narrator who will have absolutely no tie to any of the characters plot themes setting or anything involved in the movie when the movie needs that sort of off hand explanation it's <UNK> the utter filth that follows br br historical research while it was <UNK> with interesting used the proper costumes and props for the soldiers this movie stretched the truth beyond belief even for historical fiction kudos on <UNK> <UNK> reference though using it as <UNK> was a bit much <UNK> <UNK> was executed by a firing squad not <UNK> in an isolated room this ruined any sense that the reference may have had br br other reviews mention more than half a dozen <UNK> to other artists in the first 15 minutes considering the audience all these and other references were completely lost on many who would bother to see this movie and all who would enjoy it br br i'm confused by his choices of when to start a scene end it and what needs to be included in a movie promoted as an action film why did it take nearly 20 minutes to set up any sort of <UNK> br br what i believe to be the message was trite the idea of rats and how we act on a primal nature against them and who is the rat were at best clichéd but at worst not realized mention of american camps for the japanese and german americans would have added <UNK> to this question to the moral high ground literally every character in the film that gets a speaking role was caught up in their own legend is that the world in which tarantino lives br br i'm glad i didn't pay to see this one i regret that i bothered to view it at all even with well meaning <UNK> there was a rich base of ideas to develop but none were realized
<START> this should be re named everybody loves sebastian the 1983 rural go nowhere town high school junior or senior they seemed to flip flop on that one with weird hair and leo like good looks has a big plate full of issues his step dad <UNK> definite plans to have a sex change operation upon which his mom calls the marriage <UNK> sebastian is called the f word by everyone and their mother all the while kissing around with various girls getting high on ready whip at a supermarket and saving a <UNK> prostitute from the <UNK> of her ruthless <UNK> br br <UNK> buddies make eddie look like a choir boy bad association doesn't get much worse sebastian seems to go for <UNK> suicide attempts record although he won't admit <UNK> for no apparent reason the genius level sat <UNK> sebastian must graduate a year early although he has no clue about the future nor does he want to attend college what gives with this nonsense br br this film is a look into a few weeks in the life of someone who is pretty messed up the final scene suggests that things will be alright although the how is left entirely up to the viewer br br the makers of this film seem to bank solely on the <UNK> appeal of the very attractive male lead the story leaves a lot to be desired looking for what will this gorgeous kid do next doesn't exactly satisfy the lackluster production values just don't measure up to other films independent or otherwise a low budget and weak story need more than a pretty face to carry it through the results of this project are forgettable and an insult to intelligent cinema fans
<START> i hate to say it but i really do think this one's overrated and i love <UNK> films it's got more plot behind it than usual but unfortunately though it has some great stuff i find it to be a bit slow all in all i say it's entertaining but not great
<START> the story isn't very strong don't expect a bourne identity kind of movie it started of strong tara speaking russian and it even sounded credible not that i'm the russian language expert <UNK> had that <UNK> depressing look what gave this movie potential i still believed in it to bad it only took about half an hour to see they really missed the spot with this one acting was poor maybe because the story itself was not very strong there is this part in the movie where gordon patrick nick <UNK> is having a conversation on the phone with the c i a like you're listening to a chinese w t f too bad the writer didn't even take little effort to give the main characters depth also bit of a cheap and easy ending br br plus point is almost every scene where tara reid is in not that she's acting that well in fact she doesn't but she really looks great in this movie overall it was a bit of a disappointment rental maybe
<START> from the <UNK> of the cultural globe four working class teenagers attempted to change the world through music and fashion it was the final attempt to do so last century and they failed before the dust had <UNK> band manager and sex shop <UNK> malcolm <UNK> spent the money the sex <UNK> had earned to make a <UNK> about his own role in their success the film was called the great rock <UNK> roll <UNK> take the hint and consists of very little footage of the sex <UNK> actually playing music and quite a lot of footage of <UNK> effectively calling the audience idiots br br <UNK> <UNK> nonsense in which <UNK> steve jones is a detective on <UNK> tail soon <UNK> so he and drummer paul cook can jet off to <UNK> and spend time with great train <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ready yourself for the spectacle of three very unappealing men dancing naked to a hideous irony free version of was a gas a song about killing jews for gold in <UNK> concentration camp and another song sung in <UNK> tone deaf <UNK> which includes the lyrics god save myra <UNK> god save ian brady lyrics that johnny rotten would have considered <UNK> the sid vicious scenes are few and idiotic jumping out of bed in a <UNK> with a <UNK> over the <UNK> to sing some bad boy biker song from the <UNK> playing into to the <UNK> a joke theme of the movie in an attempt to turn sid into james dean i'm surprised <UNK> doesn't take credit for death too the redeeming scenes are those of sid in paris and the infamous performance of my way the punk rock <UNK> right there mocking an <UNK> audience before shooting them all no need for an entire film just watch that clip on youtube br br from <UNK> <UNK> far superior and more enjoyable 2001 documentary <UNK> the filth and the fury we were given a more balanced honest view of what <UNK> in <UNK> but there were also a number of scenes that i would have liked to have seen in <UNK> as fury was basically a of the same material one was an animated sid complete with <UNK> voice acting you f <UNK> out alright or i'll slice you open a still of which appeared on the cover of the something else 7 inch a <UNK> was shown in fury but i don't know what context that originally appeared was it in original <UNK> but removed after <UNK> death was there more fury also shed light on the film who killed <UNK> which would have been the mock hard day's night movie <UNK> was originally <UNK> to make it starred <UNK> as a member of a gay new <UNK> group and looked a damn sight more entertaining than <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> if you must rent the filth and the fury and <UNK> in <UNK> failure as a world changing <UNK>
<START> probably one of his lesser known films it suffers from the same lack of exposure as <UNK> in that its actually one of his best br br written by and starring eric <UNK> talk radio tells the story of an <UNK> radio phone in host who <UNK> the wrong kind of <UNK> the film is important and has much to say on the issues of free speech and just how free it should be and you can easily tell that it started life as a stage play know what you're getting into before you sit down to watch it and you'll be fine br br there isn't much to the acting really as <UNK> pretty much steals the film he wrote and is given <UNK> to rant i couldn't take my eyes off him and that was part of the fascination many of the <UNK> had the people who hated him wouldn't turn off in case they missed something br br not for everyone but a very good drama and overall a very good film
<START> may contain spoilers br br the first time i saw this movie was when it was re released on video when i was around 8 years old now i am 17 and still watch it whenever i get a chance to the <UNK> was a cute heart warming film that i immediately fell in love with i loved the songs on it especially the one the <UNK> sing by the piano in fact i even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since i loved it that much all three <UNK> are so cute and their mother is one of the <UNK> cartoon cats i ever saw the ally cat had a great voice br br my favorite part of the movie is when the <UNK> are playing the piano that part is adorable i also enjoy their journey home it's incredible this is one of the best disney films i ever saw and one of my favorites everyone should see it i give this film 10 10 stars
<START> a really funny story idea with good actors but it misses somehow the actors are older but none of them looked particularly good they needed better make up photography or something it is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film i liked the cast but i think the performances were rather bland this is where the weakness of the director shows perhaps if mrs spielberg had mr spielberg directing it would have been a much better film
<START> this is a <UNK> in the hitchcock tradition you are kept in the dark as suspects come and go dennis quaid is <UNK> as <UNK> a man doomed to die and meg ryan excellent as his babe there is not much not to like in this little suspense and all the pieces fit neatly together the way they should you won't be sorry you watched this one if you like suspense
<START> suburban kids meet the forest <UNK> is better in this part he is more wicked and stronger as well nevertheless most part of the acting is bad as well like in the first one sometimes the characters say things to each other that do not make sense and are not convincing i made an error to watch this one sober you'll probably enjoy it more if you are not if you did not already stop loving <UNK> after the first movie you definitely will after the second br br problem kids and their <UNK> are on their way to a camp in the forest and what a coincidence their car broke right in the middle of a forest and at night that's just their luck they find a house and one got shot one of the <UNK> stays behind why i do not know and the rest eventually finds another house in that house a voodoo <UNK> lives but she is not responsible for the <UNK> of <UNK> who is it then well you better watch the movie and find out for yourselves
<START> i had high hopes for this one after reading the back of the dvd in the spirit of american pie and animal house after suffering through this i realized i just blew 2 50 to rent it this movie started out slow and just got slower brief and fleeting moments of <UNK> proved that it was in the spirit of american pie if you mean spirit as a dead thing not very entertaining or fun don't be fooled like i was and expect anything barely watchable because this movie will <UNK> you more than entertain you need to fill up three more lines for this stupid movie that doesn't deserve the effort what a stupid piece of ignorant <UNK> this movie <UNK> even the brief nudity sucked
<START> i saw this movie about 12 years ago and i can still remember it as if i just saw it recently that is how much this movie has affected me br br considering this is a movie from the 50's i think it was ahead of its time it surprised me as in how it maintains its integrity in this subject some might have considered taboo back then very realistic in showing the <UNK> and journey that an addict chooses to <UNK> on one can only imagine how the audiences were affected by the realism of this movie back in those days br br i personally think is was one of frank sinatra's top five performances in the big screen br br when others are discussing movies dealing with mental illness and or addiction i always recommend the man with the golden arm as one of the top five to watch
<START> whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in head which is always hidden under a cap covering almost half of his face all the time only hope this is first and the last as well for god's sake from to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has tried every thing to create an aura of his so called singing talent which is nothing but atrocious <UNK> of words like which completely kill the beauty of the terms so <UNK> used for love songs why does <UNK> not smile simple because he does not use close up <UNK> now there this friend of his <UNK> him around every where and this number one lawyer in the town who has to herself <UNK> <UNK> and try to seduce <UNK> of all the handsome german people she might have met earlier perhaps the male lawyers on this part of the world might be <UNK> their fate for destined to deal with the stiff unattractive lot every day the action scenes are so <UNK> shot like the event <UNK> attacked by the thief <UNK> riding over the cars so on and so forth the father of the bride seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her off that he flies to and <UNK> around most <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> love among people of the world as if they were <UNK> and on his back <UNK> gives a lecture to his daughter on these show business men when <UNK> is proved innocent he again <UNK> <UNK> the other guy as if it's a game of musical chair i didn't get to se the poor guy's face even did you in the role of <UNK> looks as if she is in need of an eye check up for strain in her eyes the fellow in the role of a friend is good who has acted quite naturally and should be in better movies like <UNK> <UNK> for example child artist in brief appearance is sweet but wasted it seems today's young generation has gone nuts since they prefer this kind of mockery of lyrics and musical scores and associate <UNK> with it for example if you sing <UNK> bar <UNK> the ghost would come this is a weird taste in music and rather funny i am surprised how such classic <UNK> like <UNK> have <UNK> for <UNK> of all the people to give music there is story in that a crow <UNK> so many <UNK> of a <UNK> to look beautiful and appeal to the birds but the <UNK> fall off ultimately and the real dark crow is revealed hope <UNK> takes a hint and <UNK> from <UNK> such meaningless stuff and wasting precious money which he has earned by <UNK> his short nose so much his friend does tell him if your nose is cut how will you sing thanks for showing us germany <UNK> at a reasonable cost of renting the dvd and correct those spelling mistakes will you an extra e in movie and no e in love there is also a famous number from the old film <UNK> <UNK> on which <UNK> once again but this time with <UNK> <UNK> at her and conveniently <UNK> his so called real love and his new bride is not around now that was very clever <UNK> at least one thing in this movie which you have done <UNK> to justify presence but doesn't she look a bit washed down
<START> i am deeply disturbed by some <UNK> i am reading on the message boards for this movie people saying it is actually a good movie just because this movie is uwe <UNK> best to date does not make it a good movie at all no way in hell far cry is a clichéd mess full of bad acting poor direction and an uninspired story with a shoddy script this is <UNK> first pure action movie and news flash people action movies aren't too hard to make because for a basic action flick all you need is explosions and gun battles scattered around a flimsy plot and hey mr boll succeeds in doing that house of the dead alone in the dark and <UNK> all horror games adapted into movies by boll are far worse than this they have no redeeming qualities far cry boasts two things which make it his best yet two good leads and a couple of well done action sequences <UNK> <UNK> is quite good as jack <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is a strong female lead the usually great <UNK> <UNK> is passable as the clichéd villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence which came as a shock considering boll was behind the camera br br unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel to it with bad cgi lame one liners and clichés around every corner oh and the worst lead up to a sex scene i think i have ever scene not only have the two only known each other for six hours but all it takes is for him to say he kept warm while in the army by <UNK> his fellow soldiers he already got her to take his clothes off by merely telling her to then he took his off and <UNK> into bed because he was afraid of <UNK> br br anyway to <UNK> this is a bad movie it is mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are totally bored one could probably do worse than popping this in and watching it but i'd personally say watch a classic action film like die hard or predator and stay away from this derivative mess br br <UNK> 5
<START> i first saw signs of life on <UNK> as an american <UNK> presentation it's a wonderfully written ensemble production with terrific performances by michael lewis as joey and vincent <UNK> as his brother <UNK> arthur kennedy in one of his last roles is also excellent as an aging <UNK> whose family business is about to close the rest of the cast which includes beau bridges kathy bates and mary louise parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters br br the direction is subtle and effective i've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it a beautiful piece of filmmaking
<START> note after writing this review i see that this listing is indeed about the tv series and not the original film my mistake i thought imdb for a <UNK> for movies not tv shows but since most people will look up this film under bagdad <UNK> and not out of which strangely is the name this film is listed under on imdb i'll leave this comment here br br maybe i missed something but when i read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the cbs series which must have been loosely based on this film i did not see the tv series and i might like it or not but one thing i am sure is that it is very different than this film this film is not like a tv show at all and <UNK> goldberg is not in it or any other famous hollywood stars other than jack palance who was very charming in his role br br this is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks outside the box it is not at all like a hollywood formula movie which is probably why the what's a nice word for idiots who decide to market movies or not decided not to market this one br br first of all this movie captured my heart and imagination from the get go from the music which is just part of the time so you can't really call it a musical to the cinematography to the really cool story br br a german or <UNK> woman very pretty and quite <UNK> gets in an argument with the other german or <UNK> man with whom she is traveling through the california desert with and parts ways with him he taking off in the car and she left to <UNK> for herself on a deserted and desert like highway out in the middle of nowhere br br she finds the small and <UNK> but charming bagdad <UNK> in bagdad california and <UNK> in the rest of the story is magic i don't want to try to describe this film because i want you to enjoy every surprise br br warning if you are a racist or have something against big women you will not like this movie as the main romantic lead is a big woman and characters of brown and red skin have large roles and are included as part of the mix without any racism involved br br i gave this film a 10 for <UNK> entertainment and sheer
<START> a chicago couple dillon and <UNK> are <UNK> accused of killing their daughter people begin to wonder if they did it the police investigate and find suspicious evidence the couple are <UNK> by the public and accused in the press the cops <UNK> that they are <UNK> and have murdered their own daughter they are charged and brought to trial they are represented by publicity seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for 100 000 the evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police <UNK> of sexual abuse are presented their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home <UNK> is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed verdict she didn't do it but he did he goes to the <UNK> with a sentence of 45 years br br in the last third of the movie with dillon in jail and <UNK> wondering what to do next we see people who have been <UNK> now slowly coming to the <UNK> defense witnesses admit to having <UNK> other facts are brought to light that finally result in <UNK> release the killer is never found though the movie gives us a <UNK> as a plausible <UNK> br br this is a <UNK> from beginning to end nothing seems to go right for the couple oh there are a few happy moment maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and <UNK> up with joy or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another but it's never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief usually a fade to block follows there isn't necessarily anything wrong with moving <UNK> although i can't imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer there's plenty of tragedy in shakespeare too i suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they're told oh but i am fool romeo cries after killing brother here we have <UNK> running in her <UNK> through a hospital <UNK> screaming where's my baby there isn't any ambiguity or irony in the story as i'm sure there must have been in the real life events on which it's based people are either good or bad here or else they're bad then they turn good br br the film isn't aimed at exploring human <UNK> or the way things work out it's aimed at wrenching tears from the audience the actors provide first rate role models i can't remember the last movie in which i saw so many tears there are of tears <UNK> of them of them a <UNK> <UNK> of them a lake of them br br well i'll give one example of the <UNK> with which the movie is crafted dillon and <UNK> hire a chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator ed <UNK> <UNK> is sympathetic to them but he doesn't really accomplish much he seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the <UNK> couple with a kind of philosophy learn to live with it which is okay and because he suffers from cancer so we can watch him take his medicine double over with pain and finally pass away br br what's frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple it <UNK> one of the more important issues that it raises the function of <UNK> in private lives br br <UNK> is a strange thing really if we call it <UNK> it's bad but if we call it public opinion it sounds acceptable at the very least of course we all have <UNK> about issues that may or may not be justified as i write michael jackson is once again being brought to court accused of <UNK> a young boy and i wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a <UNK> but <UNK> isn't all bad either it's like water when it's properly controlled it's a community asset we need <UNK> to keep each other in line it helps us to maintain public order but like water in a <UNK> or a <UNK> it is <UNK> to a village when it <UNK> out of control br br this is a movie that's okay if you're not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature it's done so cleverly that given its goal it's hard to argue with it
<START> this spanish italian co production tells an interesting and weird story about dr <UNK> a woman that not only has the best years behind her but also has a <UNK> face that makes her look like a freak but in <UNK> a professor she knows has <UNK> some experiments on animals with a substance which cells the experiments were successful but the animals became aggressive because the professor won't allow dr <UNK> to be the first human guinea pig she kills him and <UNK> the substance she becomes a beautiful young woman but also a vicious killer when it comes to keep her secret a secret br br the plot of the film is great fun but <UNK> had not enough skills and money to make a cool movie out of it also the film becomes boring after a good start and doesn't manage to regain a fast pace even though the film's running time doesn't <UNK> <UNK> minutes and as the setting changes to swiss city <UNK> for the last third of the film it sometimes even looks like a vacation movie as we see how beautiful <UNK> is which it is indeed but it doesn't help to push the plot forward so with a more talented director better actors and a bigger budget could have become an obscure italian classic but as it is it's just a <UNK> and boring crime film that isn't really worth looking for rating 3 out of 10
<START> it's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy charles bronson vehicle br br bronson is a good actor that can do more than <UNK> a gun and knock off bad guys he was quietly moving in the tv movie yes virginia there is a santa claus and showed a lot of class and style in the sean penn directed the indian runner br br in the evil that men do however bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with <UNK> knives and of course guns there's nothing here you haven't seen in the last five death wish flicks br br wait i take that back this has to be the most sadistic and <UNK> violent film bronson has ever had the <UNK> service of being in not just <UNK> in the scenes of torture or the <UNK> of torture but in the fact that these scenes were put in a film just to sell tickets and jose <UNK> what in blue <UNK> was he doing here i mean he won an oscar for crying out loud br br okay sorry about that <UNK> let me just say that the evil that men do has to be one of the worst movies i had ever seen that was based on a book yeah that's right i wonder if it was written with bronson in mind br br no stars watch death wish instead at least it was <UNK>
<START> with an opening segment that <UNK> the music and cinematography of todd <UNK> safe 1995 david lynch uses dream myth and <UNK> notions of reality to tell the <UNK> story of a failed bit part hollywood actress waitress diane <UNK> let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with <UNK> <UNK> who is engaged to <UNK> director adam br br the film effectively takes place in <UNK> drug <UNK> head we are witness to her crazy <UNK> her wish regrets <UNK> and fears using the dream narrative as a way of presenting two notions of reality in conflict lynch does not <UNK> the opposition between reality and fantasy but <UNK> them the last 45 minutes are as dream like as what came before and the <UNK> air of detached <UNK> ambiguity still <UNK> <UNK> the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreams br br lynch's film borrows from many films old and new but ultimately is a film unlike any other with the exception of the director's own lost highway and blue <UNK> it constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen not only <UNK> but intellectually yet it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined because lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous deeds an element that was missing in all of his other films except the straight story he does this by presenting <UNK> dream alter ego betty as a wholesome canadian farm girl destined for fame lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that <UNK> and <UNK> in equal measure are <UNK> and diane really lovers or just friends who is the blue lady what does she <UNK> who is the bum behind what is the significance of the rotting corpse at <UNK> <UNK> does aunt ruth really exist is an <UNK> of hell or perhaps a self <UNK> take on the film's status as fiction lynch isn't prepared to answer any question he poses choosing instead to present his love story in the city of dreams as a set of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br the acting is top rate especially <UNK> <UNK> as diane <UNK> betty who is yet to <UNK> this performance laura has the requisite <UNK> as <UNK> rita while adam <UNK> as adam brings an <UNK> arrogance and <UNK> paranoid <UNK> to his role it was <UNK> and a grave injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an academy award br br this is a film that demands to be seen and <UNK> closely the mystery at the heart of the film remains in lynch's hands but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the <UNK> of seeming <UNK> that he presents upon closer <UNK> there is a definite sense of a puzzle perhaps an <UNK> jigsaw that <UNK> us with closure but <UNK> the imaginary of narrative <UNK> ultimately this is lynch's key film
<START> diane keaton is a pathetic actress she is so boring and phony she is the same on and off screen i saw her in an interview with ellen <UNK> and she behaves exactly the same as she does in movies her foolish facial expressions make me want to change channels she has been in a couple of good movies but they would have been better had someone else been picked for the part steve martin doesn't add much to the movie either he over acts as well and also ruins an old favorite the ridiculous part martin short plays only adds more <UNK> to the movie i've tried to watch the movie twice but both times had to turn it off
<START> i was invited to view this film at a small art museum screening i had no clue what to expect i was initially optimistic in the opening credits to see judd nelson bill paxton wayne <UNK> james <UNK> rob lowe and lara flynn boyle listed however after some very disturbing <UNK> out scenes that did not add much to the story <UNK> this film quickly became a weapon of torture the gimmick of the <UNK> growing arm storyline is never really developed i <UNK> kept waiting for this film to cash in there was a small payoff in the end but having to <UNK> and sit through the the endless gross crude sexually perverted in your face screaming unfunny gore cost too much for me even for a free viewing what were these established actors doing in this awful film the art direction was very convincing and creepy at the very minimum it should only be a 75 minute film this is a film that dick <UNK> and donald <UNK> would embrace
<START> x is a beautiful adaption of herman <UNK> or the the comments on here surprise me it makes me wonder what has led to the <UNK> negative reaction br br the shock value is the least appealing thing about this film a minor detail that has been blown out of <UNK> the story is of downfall and the subsequent destruction of those around him which is overtly demonstrated in his features <UNK> and the dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other i have seen and turn a <UNK> traditional storyline with controversial twists into an <UNK> emotional epic br br i can't stress enough the importance of <UNK> everything you have heard about this film and watching as i did with an open mind you will i hope be rewarded in the same way that i was i felt on edge and nervous from around the half hour mark however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense it will leave you with 1 000 thoughts each of them at once <UNK> and thrilling i know i'm <UNK> here but i feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film it's the best i've seen all year
<START> i am part of my surroundings and i became separate from them and it's being able to make those clearly that lets us have an identity and what's inside our identity is everything that's ever happened to <UNK> in fires in the mirror br br pieces like <UNK> v used to <UNK> me i felt that if i accepted them than i would be <UNK> something what i thought before really isn't worth getting into i understand what <UNK> is trying to say i experienced a <UNK> and one that fell into existence <UNK> and one that's still alive that i still have to <UNK> with it's still working inside me br br the film wasn't sympathetic per se it doesn't need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing there are certainly wicked people whether or not they should die is for another film what <UNK> shows is that good beautiful people exists who kill other people when their society and primal <UNK> jack them up br br the of <UNK> is what has helped me to appreciate <UNK> v it's not worth the writing space to go into why i would not let myself before but i see now the worth in making art like this to people or perhaps to make people do something br br there's a method to compromise of his light much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect this should not be too strange of an idea after all how much of respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect i <UNK> when i say it but <UNK> seems so much more <UNK> and so much less <UNK> when i have the power to say to myself <UNK> ruin this process this natural process makes me want to buck the system ' br br i do not think <UNK> is painting a <UNK> portrait of humanity telling us to give up our <UNK> <UNK> and head to the woods instead i think that it is <UNK> <UNK> and experiments that we are of course free to ignore we can ignore it all we want if we want to give the more corpses to bury br br for surely despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy towards their characters' likely and <UNK> fate they are <UNK> by <UNK> and i do see the delightful risk in the hope that the audience will understand what's to be done with what they see as has been mentioned there's danger in the hopeless seeing their fate <UNK> in stone there's danger in the hopeful <UNK> the natural because it doesn't <UNK> to their world view br br and i don't think that the need be either wealthy or fortunate i have not seen it but it seems that the film american beauty proves the <UNK> of <UNK> as a <UNK> of vision or comfort there are as well as as well as <UNK> who wonder where within themselves their humanity is who <UNK> because they can't find anything that <UNK> them from their landscape br br landscapes can be <UNK> and beautifully portrayed but in reality landscapes do not <UNK> they change sure and dramatically but only by a large set of natural law which no one truly have power over but it cannot be changed itself
<START> i am a new <UNK> you might as well say i borrowed the dvds from my local library i have been interested in samurai since watching 'the last samurai ' my dad told me he used to watch <UNK> when he was a kid he said that it was pretty good we are up to series 3 i absolutely love it it takes a little to get used to the dubbed english voices over the characters speaking japanese but i really enjoy it all the same it is a little strange to watch the slight pauses when the ninja stars are thrown at characters and they stick into a tree or wall i was not used to this but i am now but i suppose that's the technology they had in the 60s i've noticed that <UNK> is kind friendly willing to help those in need he's very humble most of the time he doesn't big note himself he only says he is better than the enemy ninja i admire <UNK> for these qualities it's really interesting to watch the <UNK> that <UNK> has it is amazing this series is for anyone who are interested in samurai
<START> this movie had very few moments of real drama after the opening minutes the film <UNK> in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back viewing was pure <UNK> to say the least the acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times i couldn't stop laughing the continuity between some of the scenes was dire characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else surely this was a spoof of the exorcist the collection plate at the church must have been full of <UNK> the day mr russo signed up for this one do i speak latin et <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this was okay but really a bit disappointing because i expected more laughs considering the storyline and the lead actor bill murray it should have been a lot funnier than it turned out to be only part of this made me really laugh such as when murray lost control of his semi and was <UNK> down the road at a weird angle you have to see it to appreciate it br br the supporting cast was anything but likable people just look at a <UNK> of the names matthew <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and linda <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> role in here as tip tucker was just downright annoying he was the worst br br other that those people the movie had some charming moments but overall it is not recommended it's another disney flop
<START> about your terrible movie <UNK> <UNK> as a professional musician it's my duty to watch every movie made about any composer and <UNK> is one of my favorites when <UNK> and americans meet it's a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible you proved it in your terrible b movie the only thing that carries the movie is the music of course you didn't bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performances of the <UNK> but ok i have to admit that the performances at least have quality as contrast to the movie you've made it starts of with the dying deaf <UNK> who perfectly understands anna who is merely <UNK> <UNK> hearing during the movie <UNK> better by the minute but that must be because of some vague divine thing then there is the quite impossible semi pornographic eyes wide shut double <UNK> scene which is totally over the top with the <UNK> anna and the crying nephew in the end who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes my god what a performance and as <UNK> the rip off from <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> music to anna not in notes but in total nonsense which she understands perfectly but no one else in your audience even trained professional musicians will understand of course your reaction will be that negative response is a response at least but i can assure you that <UNK> himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason this so called homage is <UNK> and i am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made even though it's about my favorite subject ed harris and others you cannot comprehend the greatness of <UNK> in your <UNK> dreams and certainly not after a couple of lessons in <UNK> and <UNK> playing that's the trouble with you americans you think you can grasp everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work yeah we can do it anyway remember that a good product comes with hard labor talent devotion and <UNK> all these you creators of <UNK> <UNK> lack see you in <UNK>
<START> this dvd set is the complete widescreen 15 episode run of surface a television show made by universal in 2006 the full running time is 10 hours and <UNK> minutes plus a few bonus features deleted scenes cast interviews special effects <UNK> this was a relatively high budget show and much of the budget makes it to the screen in the form of quality production design and special effects br br unfortunately 10 hours is a lot of time and as typically happens with this type of stuff the overall quality begins to fall off in the later episodes i found the first 7 episodes <UNK> 1 and 2 extremely engaging and the remainder a disappointment surface was produced written and directed by josh and <UNK> <UNK> and it appears that they were surprised by the success of the series and unable to together enough good subsequent material as they rushed to fill the order for additional episodes it even looks like additional writers were brought in for the later episodes because the characters who were already the weakest part of the series lack <UNK> with the way they were played in the early episodes the series was canceled and although the last episode provides a conclusion of sorts there are still a lot of things left hanging br br it is basically a science fiction story about <UNK> created dragons sort of a television blend of jurassic park and et the story begins as a puzzle as a crew less navy sub is found <UNK> at sea <UNK> on a texas lake are sucked into <UNK> a <UNK> in africa is destroyed by a huge monster etc etc and as long as things stay this vague there is a fair amount of tension and suspense a human element is introduced in the form of three american families one on each coast and one on the <UNK> of mexico laura lake bell is a california marine <UNK> who discovers a strange creature rising from an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the ocean floor rich <UNK> jay r <UNK> is diving with his younger brother in the <UNK> when a similar creature drags his brother away never to be seen again br br miles bennett carter <UNK> is a <UNK> teenager who finds some strange eggs floating in the ocean he takes one home where it <UNK> into an et type dragon he will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and from the local authorities these dragons may look like <UNK> but they are more like <UNK> electric <UNK> firing <UNK> <UNK> causing lightning strikes <UNK> the sea of fish and <UNK> like a bunch of randy <UNK> when they find an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> water as long as it's uncertain whether or not they're intelligent <UNK> or harmless the premise is interesting once you begin to suspect their origin it all gets very tired and predictable br br jay r <UNK> a <UNK> bad actor in the tradition of david <UNK> essentially plays the richard dreyfuss character from close encounters of the third kind so you know that with a better actor and a better director it could have been an interesting character you will grow to hate this character more with each episode unfortunately what starts out as three parallel story lines is soon <UNK> into two as <UNK> and bell a low budget version of sandra <UNK> are soon paired up and involved in a series of moronic adventures almost as improbable as the stuff jason bourne gets himself into you expect plot holes and the need to suspend disbelief in this type of show that can even be part of the fun but their adventures are not just totally implausible they are utterly and completely boring there are three <UNK> episodes that feature <UNK> and bell together in a that will have you longing for the excitement of an all day <UNK> br br <UNK> miles is the strongest member of the cast and the segments with his pet dragon are inter cut often enough with the boring <UNK> bell stuff to keep you watching and these segments benefit from the presence of gorgeous <UNK> of recent <UNK> girl fame as his sister <UNK> apparently the producers picked up on the importance of this to their teenage boy target audience and the one positive thing they did with the later episodes of the series was to introduce <UNK> as a first love interest for miles so as screen time <UNK> is gradually <UNK> in br br in retrospect they needed a third storyline to keep viewers <UNK> engaged and it would have been better to limit the adult melodrama in favor of a second group of young actors br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> if you are an <UNK> and you cant get anything to get you to sleep i definitely recommend this movie if you are renting it for whatever other reason dont this movie is by far one of the most slow moving turtle motivated movies i have ever seen the only reason i rented it was because my brother wanted to for some odd and strange reason i cant even write about this movie anymore get it away from me
<START> i watched the first 10 minutes of this show i think i'm gonna <UNK> now one worst shows on tv it's not even funny it's so lame it's disgusting i gave it a second and third change couldn't even make it through five minutes don't waste the time this is one of the many shows that need to go bye bye speaking of regular night time shows that need to go all the shows on cbs all the shows on abc all the shows on fox and joe buck all the shows on the new <UNK> network all the shows on nbc accept the law and order series all the morning and afternoon talk shows all the court tv shows and every reality show out there every stupid game show period the end all the home improvement shows and all the media news all it is is a 24 hour loop of bad news yes i do have favorites monk the law orders thats it for me
<START> pink <UNK> was revolutionary for its time and even today it's still hard to watch not that i didn't enjoy the film it's hilarious but it's very repulsive and <UNK> waters pushes the <UNK> as far as it can go the story concerns <UNK> johnson <UNK> she's the <UNK> women alive she lives in a trailer with her son <UNK> and daughter <UNK> not to mention the overweight edie who's obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a <UNK> then there's connie and raymond <UNK> two filthy <UNK> who are jealous of <UNK> they long to <UNK> her in being the <UNK> person alive this means having their janitor <UNK> kidnapped women and selling the babies to lesbian couples flashing people in public and even sending <UNK> a turd in the mail <UNK> fights back to prove she's the most deranged person alive which even includes incest murder and eating dog crap and other sick sexual acts it's a film that's fun for the whole family well depending on where you live watch pink <UNK> but don't forget your <UNK> bag for more perverse weird sex and <UNK> functions also see sweet movie
<START> why can't a movie be rated a zero or even a negative number some movies such as plan nine from outer space are so bad they're fun to watch this is not one the <UNK> of horror might be the worst movie i've ever seen some of anyway i had to fast forward through a lot of it fortunately for the <UNK> of my youth and <UNK> of my <UNK> age there may be worse movies i've seen but thankfully i can't remember them the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with <UNK> of <UNK> paint the special effects looked like a fifth <UNK> c set in a <UNK> the movie contained unforgivable such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant he then immediately gets into a <UNK> with his escaping victim who takes his <UNK> and shoots him with it without the gun having been <UNK> this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits i guess no company or studio wanted to be though i guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn't needed this movie definitely ranks in my <UNK> of all time worst movies with such horrible as the <UNK> the worst movie i have ever seen with an actual one time hollywood leading man mickey rooney the only time i would recommend watching the <UNK> of <UNK> or the <UNK> for that matter would be if someone were to pay you i'm kind of cheap i'd have to have 7 or 8 bucks for <UNK> and at least ten for <UNK> phil the never out of the can cinematographer
<START> watched this flick on saturday afternoon cable man did it drag i got the <UNK> symbolism and all that stuff no i didn't care one way or another about the sexuality of the characters but the pacing of the story and the scripting almost put me to sleep br br that is until ruth marshall got naked if you're a breast man who is not <UNK> <UNK> you may want to rent it ruth has a lesbian sex scene that's pretty hot and then a <UNK> sex scene that is a notch higher than most standard movie fare her <UNK> d <UNK> made the film worth the watch br br the mighty <UNK>
<START> being advertised as the most expensive movie ever made in the czech republic it automatically makes the you think it will be over <UNK> and clichéd out of fear of the budget however with a budget of 8 million and half the movie in english it was not exactly a big budget high risk movie br br what we have a grand epic tale centered around the friendship of two people the younger <UNK> and the older <UNK> as pilots in the czech air force when the germans <UNK> before the beginning of world war ii they escape the country to england to joined the <UNK> br br their friendship becomes strained through the love of the same woman however there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond merely being friendly their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the czech people and their country remember they were not the winners the defeated the germans only to be <UNK> by the russians br br funny exciting intriguing beautiful sad and <UNK> this movie is one of my favourite war movies most of all i like the way they make fun of the british in a way that is amazingly <UNK> and gives an amazing insight into the way the british military fought wwii br br forget the recent american efforts <UNK> <UNK> saving private ryan this is the best wwii movie for a long time
<START> everyone's favorite trio of bumbling <UNK> run amok in a hospital in this incredibly <UNK> and often hysterically funny romp these guys are without a doubt the single most incompetent bunch of doctors to ever <UNK> their way across the screen comic highlights include the stooges constantly breaking a glass <UNK> in a door their encounter with a deranged patient who claims that rats used to come out of the of his shirt the stooges riding through the <UNK> on a giant <UNK> a huge horse and <UNK> race cars and our <UNK> stupid <UNK> accidentally leaving <UNK> inside a hapless <UNK> <UNK> after they finish operating on the poor fellow director ray <UNK> relates the frantic comic <UNK> at an appropriately <UNK> <UNK> pace and stages the broad slapstick gags with considerable gusto moe howard larry fine and curly howard are all in peak <UNK> form with sterling support from <UNK> henderson as long suffering hospital <UNK> dr graves <UNK> voiced <UNK> roberts as a <UNK> nurse the scene where the stooges do an absurd <UNK> group with this gal is absolutely <UNK> ruth as a <UNK> nurse billy gilbert as the <UNK> crazy patient and little billy <UNK> as a <UNK> tiny patient the spirited <UNK> never lets up for a minute thereby making this beautifully <UNK> baby one of the <UNK> best ever <UNK>
<START> when i watched this movie when i was a kid i didn't understand the premise of hitchcock movies and dark comedy now that i'm in my mid <UNK> it makes a lot more sense br br i think the reason i like this movie so much is that the comedy duo of billy crystal and danny <UNK> make for some interesting comedy both slapstick the <UNK> pan and car scenes and verbal the arguments conversations over murder and writing br br the story revolves around larry <UNK> crystal a struggling writer who has his masterpiece stolen from him by his wife margaret played by a surprisingly <UNK> kate <UNK> aka capt <UNK> from star trek voyager br br while he shifts between writer's block and teaching creative writing class he meets with student owen lifts <UNK> an aspiring writer and <UNK> <UNK> boy who sadly still acts like a kid he has toy train tracks need i say more think of failure to launch only matt <UNK> is short fat and bald br br owen is stuck in his own life with a demanding evil mother anne <UNK> who he can't stand he seeks <UNK> advice on how to get out of it and when he says to go see a hitchcock film owen gets the wrong idea that if he kills <UNK> wife he'll return the favor and kill his mom for him hilarity ensues while the two try to deal with each other's problem owen goes to extremes to kill margaret while larry who refuses to agree to do his part of the plan is driven nuts by <UNK> mother br br throughout the film larry and owen slowly but surely form a bond of friendship that is rare in dark comedy nowadays one part of the movie i really loved was where owen shows larry his <UNK> collection and lets just say its more a sentimental collection than anything br br the two main stars aside the late anne <UNK> is hilarious as mama and deadly with that <UNK> of hers she's a lot more comedic <UNK> and physically in this as opposed to her role as mama <UNK> from the <UNK> so she <UNK> like a sailor and <UNK> her son at every turn but thats what makes her character so vivid she makes her character the kind of person you love to hate br br another treat in this movie is the music of jazz great <UNK> who plays <UNK> neighbor and friend lester there is a great moment in the movie where he plays jazz for larry who is depressed and needs some good tunes to <UNK> the pain jazz can do that br br in closing i wish billy crystal and danny <UNK> would do another good movie together but their kinda getting too old for the game i'm sad to say this is one of those rare movies where both stars shine in their own subtle ways <UNK> childish comedy and <UNK> sharp wit made this movie for me 5 star comedy
<START> yeah that's what the station <UNK> states after the commercials for this show some scenes may be disturbing to some viewers br br it is beyond disturbing the <UNK> of this whole display of ego framing and <UNK> is in the fact it is on the comedy channel yes a comedy true and true a joke to see these go through their rigid <UNK> really spells out what is wrong with society especially the meat market bar scene both sides the male and female are equally as weak and desperate to be among this superficial atmosphere the club is obviously one of those cigarette corporation <UNK> plastic coke scenes these people do have a choice and that is what makes it even more of a joke br br these slick try too hard they <UNK> with their own groove grease that's ok it's a lesson on video tape for the new generation of how not to focus on a potential heart interest hopefully that <UNK> will <UNK> along with the bush <UNK> <UNK> problem is who's <UNK> up after these characters fade the bastard children of the one night stands
<START> pulling in 2 6 million viewers one has to wonder what everyone's opinions on the storyline plot is br br reading the run down over at lifetime i was led to believe that this would be an edge of your seat thriller about a single mother being stalked and finally confronting the stalker sadly i was mistaken while the main plot is interesting enough single mother run off road one night then is stalked by same guy the reasoning behind the stalking left nothing but a really bad taste in my mouth br br laura <UNK> plays the victim and she does it well whether it was all those years on <UNK> place or not she does well in this movie playing a mother who would do anything to protect her son from harm and she's looking pretty good too these days br br <UNK> is really the only good thing about this movie i think many people will identify with the main character after discovering why the stalker is stalking it will be a view only once type of movie
<START> i agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly i saw it on showtime late at night as a teenager and again in college i thought it was funny and there are boobs everywhere it seems like in the late 70s and 80s there were loads of this type of film made from r rated films like <UNK> to soft core <UNK> pair girls it's a shame they seem to have fallen by the <UNK> in terms of popularity the thing that made <UNK> great was that like the previous two films it's a hell of a lot of fun <UNK> is like a girl power version of animal house with the girls <UNK> a <UNK> of sorts and engaging in campus <UNK> on a side note whoever designed the <UNK> girls outfits must certainly have seen this film
<START> movie based on <UNK> best selling novel it's about robin stone john phillip law a ruthless tv anchorman who <UNK> his way to the top it details his love life <UNK> on amanda <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> cannon it also shows his total inability to commit to anyone and instead sleeps with any woman he can get br br the novel is no work of art it's not even good literature but it's a quick silly trashy read but this movie makes it seem like gone with the wind this is a <UNK> example of how not to do a movie adaptation first they <UNK> the novel terribly in the book <UNK> inability to commit is dealt with and it's revealed why here it's brought up and ignored also there's a truly revolting scene in which a woman is brutally beaten it's in the book but there is a reason totally left out of the movie and the book dealt with three women not two don't even get me started on the <UNK> br br adaptation aside the acting is pretty terrible law is just horrendous as stone very wooden and boring you seriously wonder why all these women are after him to be fair to law another actor was cast but had a very bad accident before shooting began and law stepped in at the last minute <UNK> is terrible as amanda maureen arthur is truly <UNK> bad as <UNK> evans <UNK> greene is unbearable as christie lane only three performances stand out david <UNK> having a great time camps it up as a gay photographer cannon is actually very good and robert ryan is just great also <UNK> <UNK> sings the catchy opening song he's moving on br br it is bad but i watched the whole thing and it is in a silly sort of way a lot of fun i'm giving it a 3 br br also <UNK> <UNK> has a cameo as a <UNK>
<START> a lot of <UNK> <UNK> books have made it onto the big screen some of them the guns of fear is the key where <UNK> dare have been translated rather well some pass ice station <UNK> the secret ways have been passable enough a few river of death bear island the way to dusty death have been pretty rotten <UNK> to is another movie based on one of <UNK> popular <UNK> but alas this is yet another that deserves adding to the rotten list <UNK> by uninteresting characters who get into uninteresting situations and <UNK> <UNK> to is an absolute failure both as a thriller and an entertainment its only semi redeeming qualities are a that it is filmed on very attractive <UNK> locations and b charlotte <UNK> looks utterly ravishing with fully nude scenes to boot as the main female character br br <UNK> american drifter neil <UNK> david <UNK> is travelling <UNK> through france when he meets british photographer <UNK> charlotte <UNK> they decide to <UNK> each other and during their <UNK> make the <UNK> of mysterious <UNK> <UNK> de michel the <UNK> <UNK> the pair to aid him in protecting and <UNK> hungarian scientist michael <UNK> who is sought by various shady parties because of some information that he is carrying in his head kept secret from <UNK> and <UNK> is the fact that has discovered a secret formula for using <UNK> power as cheap <UNK> energy the hungarian needs desperately to get his formula to new york but hired guns have been put on his trail to capture him  presumably so that he can be taken back to some ruthless criminal lord and tortured into revealing his priceless secret which they can then sell on to the highest <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> find themselves and their terrified fugitive on the run in the french countryside from their deadly <UNK> br br the film seems terribly cheap and amateurish almost like an ultra low budget independent film made by a non professional cast and crew yet a fair sum of money was actually thrown at the film and all those involved have at various points in their careers done much better work therefore one has to assume that the film is bad simply because it has been written acted and directed with a distinct lack of care and interest the pacing is deadly slow and the plot points become so <UNK> that the viewer has to put in too much effort to keep up with the story performance is <UNK> and <UNK> only creates a stir due to her nude scenes  the character itself is an absolute bore and the actress looks rightly bored by it for those who manage to stick with the film right to the very end there is an unusual scene featuring some deadly <UNK> <UNK> and a fierce bull which while not particularly exciting or well executed is at least different to the norm <UNK> to is a very disappointing film in most respects and once more a strong novel by the prolific author has suffered during its transition onto the screen
<START> my mom always told me to sit down and to actually watch this movie because it's one of her favorites i never did for years until i caught one night on tv this movie was great i don't even know how to explain it not only is the cast excellent julia roberts <UNK> sutherland kevin bacon william baldwin and oliver <UNK> but the story is awesome it's freaky but not too scary and it makes you think i was left speechless after this film and amazed of how good of actors and actress all five of these people really are where did william baldwin go he's great this film is a must see for anyone if you haven't seen it go rent it you will not be sorry amazing
<START> ugh pretty awful br br <UNK> <UNK> gets top billing but her character doesn't have a big part who is her character supposed to be anyway the little boy's aunt another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene while there was a shower scene in the movie it was a head and shoulders shot perhaps there are some alternate versions of this movie br br <UNK> does have a bigger part than john carradine cameron mitchell and <UNK> stevens though carradine shows up briefly in a <UNK> <UNK> vague dialog no other characters are in the scene with him though he's sort of <UNK> in or else there are over the shoulder shots <UNK> <UNK> to someone else there's also a really bad photo of him in a cameo it looks like a bad and a decent picture of him in a family bible he <UNK> up jack o originally or something like that br br cameron mitchell briefly shows up on a tv as a tv horror host <UNK> stevens is in the movie he's showing the <UNK> in which she runs around a cemetery in a <UNK> evidently there's more of the <UNK> footage as a bonus feature on the <UNK> dvd double feature mark of the witch the brides wore blood br br jack o what's it about darn if i know a little boy is told a story about a <UNK> headed demon killer and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason she follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for halloween put your hand through a hole and feel <UNK> that are actually <UNK> etc the <UNK> headed killer shows up several times to hold onto <UNK> while he watches people or hold his <UNK> in front of the camera and pose with it for a while sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things and actually kills people br br there are also some flashbacks to a western or <UNK> family with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too <UNK> of his i think i think they figure into jack <UNK> but i'm not sure how br br the little boy is ostensibly the main character but we don't really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses has nightmares and will fight bullies even if he'll get beat up in the process more time should have been spent establishing his character i couldn't have cared less if he died br br not recommended not even for halloween
<START> connery climbs aboard the moore <UNK> train in this stinker of a movie <UNK> away everything that made bond successful in the first place this movie further <UNK> the bond character throwing him into the category of inspector gadget get smart this ain't there is no style here only second rate actors performing on cheap sets it's a shame that connery couldn't lend an element of class here but it doesn't come across everything here <UNK> of mediocrity including <UNK> bad <UNK> perhaps if i was <UNK> in and given the choice between watching never say never again and howard the duck i would choose the former if you want the real james bond pick up any ian <UNK> novel
<START> i mean come on now my <UNK> have started to make westerns is it not enough that our cinema sucks already now you need to <UNK> english language movies with polish acting and no sense whatsoever please stay away from this movie do not waste your eyes on it a 5 year old baby could make a movie that makes more sense i am from <UNK> and i am ashamed this title might actually be watched by you please i am begging you do not watch this movie and if you do do not judge polish people and polish movies based on what you see there we had some good movies in our history and we had some bad ones but this one it is like nothing worse that i have seen in my entire life keep away
<START> chris <UNK> <UNK> eye tv series had always generated a large number of complaints both from the audience and from the people taking part but nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this the 2001 <UNK> eye special before the hugely overrated jerry springer opera arrived the <UNK> eye special held the record for the most complaints received about any tv program ever aired br br the sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the <UNK> eye special was unbelievable many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program the subject that the program handled turned many heads but the message was widely <UNK> the message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program this was not a show that <UNK> the subject of <UNK> the show was purely about the media and it's presentation of the subject morris is and always will be a media <UNK> the notion that the program <UNK> <UNK> of and children who have been abused is completely laughable morris never attempts to do either such thing he merely draws our attention to the overwhelming and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject br br using many of his established <UNK> <UNK> characters such as ted <UNK> and others morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up and the result is as funny if not funnier than anything morris has done previously using his tried and tested formula morris manages to trick several <UNK> celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary in <UNK> they are made to look like exactly what they are <UNK> br br all in all the <UNK> eye special needs to be seen to be believed and with one opening line morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001 welcome to
<START> paul jeffrey <UNK> family values wrote this <UNK> tale of a mild mannered school teacher kevin kline who is <UNK> on the academy awards by a former student turned actor matt dillon the rest of the film deals with the <UNK> revolving around this setup the effect on the town his <UNK> joan cusack himself and <UNK> with an everybody loves everybody finale br br if you're an angry gay rights <UNK> or a naive youth looking for an accurate portrayal of a man's struggle to come out or a <UNK> depiction of gay life then save yourself the trouble and rent something else maybe beautiful thing or read a book <UNK> room if you are able to understand that this film was inspired by the of tom <UNK> speech on the academy awards when he won for philadelphia and <UNK> fun at hollywood culture and small town ignorance and you have a <UNK> for <UNK> screwball comedy bringing up baby holiday the palm beach story then enjoy far from being a biting satire the film tries for the <UNK> of a preston <UNK> farce and comes damn close no it's not <UNK> or neither were <UNK> michelle 9 to 5 or young frankenstein and it doesn't pretend to be it keeps it's tongue firmly in cheek it gets too preachy and <UNK> for its own good toward the end and sure some of the jokes are a bit stale there's also a locker room scene that could have been cut but after sitting through countless comedies that misfire it's like a breath of fresh air br br kevin kline and tom <UNK> are wonderfully game while debbie reynolds and <UNK> <UNK> add fine support the excellent joan <UNK> award winning performance is stellar and the great bob <UNK> is well bob <UNK> br br the fact that many have been offended by in out is as absurd as the mentality of the <UNK> it <UNK> fun at personally i was more offended by philadelphia i'll take harmless fluff over <UNK> anytime
<START> i'm czech and soldiers not only pilots who escaped <UNK> after <UNK> invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and <UNK> men in our history for me this movie from director of academy award winner <UNK> 1996 is a tribute to these men it's first big screen movie about wwii soldiers since 1968 i think dark blue world is a good movie good acting good special effects nice music etc movie is half in english and some actors are <UNK> but greatest thing about this movie is it's pure existence it's great chance to show people all around the world and to many people in czech republic too that role in wwii was not only as occupied country but as an active member of allied campaign br br leading characters are older and <UNK> <UNK> and young <UNK> they escaped together from <UNK> they are flying in the same <UNK> and they fell in love with the same woman maybe it's a cliché but fortunately this storyline is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes including great <UNK> i don't want to compare dark blue world with pearl harbor someone will like <UNK> more and someone will like but if you like happy ends is not for you so i think it's very good movie for everyone who likes this type of stories and very good movie who wants to get to know something about this chapter of history br br btw main theme dark blue world is from czech 30's and 40's composer he wrote this theme when he lost his eyes
<START> spoilers br br i hate this one but it is better than the others after this they just keep getting worse i hope gibson has the <UNK> to stay out of the next one a lot of the same with humor ie the toilet kids etc how much <UNK> can we watch their relationship <UNK> drugs bad guys why south africa i found that unbelievable maybe south american some country in the golden triangle would have made the script better it seems the late <UNK> early 90's had the blond bad guys ie die hard the mighty <UNK> play ice land gary busey in the last weapon etc hollywood repeats itself over this one with a similar story has to go over the top the attacking the police the beach <UNK> scene and the fight at the end and way over the top <UNK> girlfriend killed by the <UNK> attack were too much like many part <UNK> they get worse and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill 3 10
<START> this is my favorite love story it has every element that a good love story should have poetry jazz friendships the ups and downs in a relationships finally a movie that shows positive aspects of the black community <UNK> <UNK> was great i can't picture anyone else playing the role of darius he <UNK> that poem like he had written it himself and meant every word i own this movie and if i had the time i would watch it everyday it always makes me feel better and that's what a good movie should do also the character could not had been any better dealing with the subject of marriage we would all like to find a darius out there but most of us just settle for watching this movie my vote is 10 10
<START> <UNK> drama about a <UNK> marriage which is threatened by a younger third party which interests the wife of the house watson <UNK> plays the role very well as the troubled husband who cant control his wife's cheating and deals with the issue i also like rupert everett a lot in his role as william the man that watson has the affair with although i think emily watson is a great actress i had a bit of a problem with the way her character was written did not make her too likable i know a <UNK> is not supposed to be likable but some of her actions and things she did had no reasoning behind them the screenplay was perhaps the weak part of this drama although <UNK> direction was good and the performances were also quite good this film is better than <UNK> but not a masterpiece by any means imdb rating 6 7 my rating 8 10
<START> spoilers spoilers what's going on here br br barbara <UNK> looking decidedly <UNK> as if she'd stolen her <UNK> spare wig puts in an unconvincing performance as a woman who kills the wife of a man she has had an affair with <UNK> self <UNK> after hitting her forty odd times with an axe br br like <UNK> <UNK> she is <UNK> but after the most unconvincing argument ever presented to a jury by the representative of a supposedly <UNK> i have ever seen br br <UNK> <UNK> took an axe and gave her father forty <UNK> when she saw what she'd done she <UNK> self <UNK> br br i don't think so br br i find the <UNK> guilty of screening an unconvincing portrayal and have no alternative but to award this film a sentence of 4 out of 10 which would have been lower but for the previous good behaviour of some of those involved br br
<START> this film is just another waste of time the plot is ridiculous forced usa drama the characters were all really weak especially the <UNK> <UNK> and the bad interpretation of <UNK> who only was alright in his classic interpretation when acting as french ally br br just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film i guess it was no a low budget film definitely not recommended maybe the director's should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money maybe they do not bother as they have <UNK> before <UNK> them in the cinema br br no more hope in cinema
<START> i think south park is hilarious and i have no problem w them taking shots at people on the left but you'd think that after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities for <UNK> their careers taking on an illegal war and then being gasp right along they would have the sense to start giving w and the <UNK> ruining the country a shot or two bush seems to get a pretty free run from these guys for as stupid and messed up as he is br br gore is fair game but please what do the <UNK> have to do how bad do they have to f k up the country before these guys finally act like maybe they aren't just trying to do the best they can and that they have done some true <UNK> up or maybe just go after rush <UNK> hes a good target or even just make fun of <UNK> <UNK> gap teeth
<START> when i watch a short like boy next door i find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling on the one hand i'm happy i'm watching something that has been well thought out <UNK> executed and just daring enough to be interesting on the other hand i find myself <UNK> the level of comedy generally produced tv and films are so consistently packed with easy condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity then you see someone like davis who without the benefit of studio notes or substantial budget can create a really cool little comic gem producers and network suits need to turn to the travis <UNK> out there for material and stop <UNK> deals to people simply because their resume or agent may demand they should boy next door has hopefully gained the attention of the right people to <UNK> more work from davis it's really fun and very well done
<START> this is yet another gem from the pen of <UNK> thompson in fact that same year 1999 she wrote and directed la the first of three writer director credits so far belle <UNK> is first of all <UNK> whatever that means which is of course different things to different folks the premise is simple at the <UNK> where he is marrying <UNK> the <UNK> vincent <UNK> gets his first glimpse of her mother catherine <UNK> and suffers what the french call a coup de <UNK> which we know as love at first sight in theory the story is either 1 over right then and there assuming he called the wedding off or else 2 just the beginning as he goes through with the wedding and thus lives a lie until it is resolved one way or the other thompson <UNK> towards 2 but not without hitting us with the odd subplot along the way like for example <UNK> <UNK> smoking lesbian mother line in real life if anyone cares is in a long term relationship with <UNK> who co stars here and throws in a brilliant set piece in a <UNK> <UNK> men's room at the wedding reception which takes the form of a hilarious song and dance <UNK> writer that she is thompson also the comedy with drama like the brilliant climactic scene where vincent finally <UNK> out his feelings for <UNK> at a family gathering whilst simultaneously <UNK> the joint this is one to <UNK> again and again
<START> this movie is great i really enjoyed it br br this movie is about a cat mom named <UNK> and her 3 <UNK> t <UNK> and the <UNK> love music they have to practice the piano everyday but the butler named edgar tries to kidnap <UNK> and her <UNK> he tries to make them sleep but he fails them <UNK> meets a cat named thomas o thomas falls in love with <UNK> the cats break into song with the song everybody wants to be a cat thomas gets to love music like the other cats thomas and <UNK> really like each other br br i loved this movie and i like the cats to
<START> the ealing comedies <UNK> their own specific sub genre in the history of film they were <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on british life in the late forties and early fifties they are always amusing but i feel it is misleading to <UNK> them as comedies they are <UNK> and good <UNK> rather than laugh out loud funny however the best of them are laced with understated satire and shot through with an occasional dark streak kind hearts and <UNK> and the <UNK> br br i have an affection for all of them but the <UNK> hill mob is probably the one i have most difficulty with compared to the others it seems somewhat <UNK> to me it is an outline sketch for a movie but one that needed to spend a lot more time in development before it was ready to go before the cameras br br everything about it is a bit <UNK> for example nobody is given any real context or background henry is simply a <UNK> <UNK> whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions go <UNK> while albert is a frustrated artist forced to prostitute his talent by making gift shop trash for a living this <UNK> a motive for their crime but nothing that subsequently happens is a consequence either of their characters or their plan br br other characters are introduced but play no real part in the story the elderly resident in <UNK> guest house could with her love of detective stories have been made an <UNK> thorn in his side but is merely used as background similarly the various policemen who pop in and out of the action are simply there to keep the plot <UNK> along br br as a result the movie is driven entirely by its contrived plot devices which i find both frustrating and <UNK> irritating the not very ingenious robbery is accomplished with minimal problems despite albert being prevented from carrying out his part in the plan by sidney <UNK> the gold is then <UNK> to france without <UNK> everything would have gone smoothly if it wasn't for a minor <UNK> <UNK> based on the french <UNK> of the letter <UNK> which results in six of the gold <UNK> towers being accidentally sold to some english <UNK> br br this leads to a series of frantic chases as henry and albert seek to retrieve them these scenes are well executed but at each point the <UNK> are frustrated in their pursuit of the <UNK> by a series of wholly <UNK> it is as if god is deliberately <UNK> to give them a hard time this kind of plotting always has me <UNK> my teeth br br when they finally track the last <UNK> tower to a police academy <UNK> and snatch it from under the nose of john police inspector why is he there anyway all <UNK> of plot logic are abandoned the final car chases are then simply filling up screen time until we are returned to the framing device with which the picture began br br the movie doesn't even bother to tell us the fate of albert stanley <UNK> sid james and <UNK> <UNK> bass br br this <UNK> little caper has the <UNK> of the ealing team behind it so it is far from being a bad movie i suspect most viewers will find it considerably more enjoyable than i do and why shouldn't they but i cannot help thinking there was a much better movie waiting to be made if only more time and effort had been <UNK> on <UNK> out both the characters and the story br br by the standards established by ealing <UNK> hill mob is a missed opportunity br br ps one curious <UNK> is that audrey hepburn gets a credit for her single line early on but <UNK> <UNK> remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution i guess she just had a better agent
<START> mom should really be given a different title to <UNK> it from all the other movies out there called mom or with the word mom in the title br br this is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets <UNK> out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out there br br it is so different and refreshing it almost defies br br the kind old lady who takes in a creepy <UNK> who just happens to be a flesh eater who then <UNK> the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie or <UNK> quite which exactly is not defined br br there is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified attempts to help her by <UNK> <UNK> i shall say no more about that for fear of <UNK> a spoiler it is one of those movies as opposed to guns <UNK> explosions raging car chases etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans whilst also <UNK> sadness into the story along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so called <UNK> movies br br there is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and looks so but what she becomes oh my br br a gem of a movie and even if not your thing should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan
<START> this forth film in the angel guts saga which at only a few minutes above an hour it just feels much longer is also the <UNK> which is perhaps just as well as it's also the most <UNK> of the series <UNK> a department store clerk is interested in another part time job her fellow worker at the department store introduces her to <UNK> for a porn <UNK> called <UNK> but when her other <UNK> found out about her naughty pictures they decide to fire her and she gets some <UNK> admirer oh <UNK> and she likes to <UNK> alot using various household items the wall to wall masks a lack of discernible plot and pushes this one far too much into exploitation territory not <UNK> though given that the director of this one is <UNK> evil dead trap beautiful prey perhaps his sensibilities just weren't suited for an angel guts film br br my grade d br br dvd extras commentary by <UNK> sharp bio <UNK> a <UNK> minute interview with <UNK> original <UNK> art and trailers for this and 4 other angel guts films high school co ed red <UNK> red vertigo red porno all available in box set but for some reason the <UNK> film angel guts red flash is not in the set
<START> in reality that happened the royal mother in law and father in law with the couple the day after the wedding and gave her the money in public this troubled young <UNK> so much that she never forgot the issue we must remember she was only 16 she was so embarrassed that she kept a fear for sex all her life perhaps this began to appear as a trauma also the constant <UNK> of her aunt and mother in law as you say she kept all her children away from her <UNK> her teeth and manners which she considered inappropriate for an <UNK> and when <UNK> finally went to <UNK> with her husband and children her <UNK> daughter died and the mother in law blamed her for that unfortunate and <UNK> death she never <UNK>
<START> this movie is a warning to all people sat surfing the internet on a typical day at the office my warning is do not reveal too much about yourself 2 be careful who you cross there are spies on this internet thing i thought that it was so scary what that man and woman combination did to poor angela bennett i did not realise that somebody could take ones life away in one click of this mouse angela i thought did a sterling job of jack and that awful girl my question is why does that computer make that noise when it works like a <UNK> sound mine does not do this or this one this film also tells you that there is fraud on this internet also why couldn't angela do the virus <UNK> programme at a i also thought that like all computers the transfer rate to <UNK> was slow that is correctly portrayed in this film when you save the programme to your <UNK> <UNK> the bar only moved slowly i quite liked <UNK> house at the beginning of the film as well why did no one believe angela
<START> it just so happens that <UNK> the terrible parts i and ii both had entries in the 50 worst movies book by harry <UNK> now i do think that <UNK> they are among the worst movies ever is an <UNK> though they are still both pretty poor films particularly the first one as it featured more eye rolling and <UNK> eyed looks than i have ever seen before director <UNK> and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film artsy and profound and since i am <UNK> sane i must say that i hated this first film the second while still very <UNK> looking is a vast improvement as eye rolling is minimal though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1 while part 2 looks pretty <UNK> and needed at least another hour especially since it never gets to insane behavior later in life like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger since both parts 1 and 2 were <UNK> by <UNK> to both excuse his own murderous reign and <UNK> him it's no surprise that life story is left very <UNK> even without all the truly awful <UNK> of <UNK> apparently the <UNK> evil <UNK> still didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a huge waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing <UNK> as a crazy guy just like <UNK> br br by the way there was one segment of this tedious film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 without it a 2 and that's the scene with prince <UNK> at the <UNK> it is well done and pretty funny in a dark way and the scene was done in a russian version of 2 color technicolor this is very odd by the way because by the mid 1930s a vastly improved true color process was developed by technicolor that no longer made everything look all red and <UNK> blue so this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film very odd indeed for the 1940s
<START> the first few minutes of this movie don't do it justice for me its not funny until they board the sub and those hilarious characters begin to <UNK> i was born and raised in <UNK> virginia and met my share of different sailors i even married one most of my favorite movies are just funny not <UNK> not <UNK> on sex or violence and funny every time i see them <UNK> day bruce almighty and down <UNK> are still funny even after i know the dialog by heart <UNK> <UNK> with his god i love this job was sincere genuine and lovable rob schneider is hysterical as the crew gets back at him for being annoying i am still amazed at the size of that fishing boat next to a sub i can see why folks who live this life would notice the uh but its not a documentary after all its a comedy and i just love it
<START> the movie is great for <UNK> <UNK> birds birds and more birds only 1 <UNK> nice scenery the only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race the end when <UNK> is a definite hollywood prop there is no definite storyline it goes from <UNK> scenery to a rip off of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter going crazy for some reason who gets it in the end a very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with <UNK> of <UNK> william smith is a very talented actor that has made some very good movies like all actors they all need to have at least one bad film don't waste the 5 00 on the dvd
<START> like the previous two <UNK> <UNK> films <UNK> max beyond is not exception to the violence and strange plot mad max is in a post war society where he must destroy master <UNK> and get the children to <UNK> <UNK> this is generally a <UNK> film with peter pan references and tina turner <UNK> pigs and odd characters i got very bored by watching it all and it offered nothing to me i did not feel inspired after watching this film the only decent thing about this film were the extremely odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film it's too weird for me and it was much too dull
<START> a family is traveling through the mid west there's widower ben charles <UNK> his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> and ben's little daughter k t then hit a town named where everyone acts more than a little strangely their car breaks down and they're forced to stay they soon find out a witches <UNK> has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil br br the story is not that good people just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end also there are a lot of <UNK> left <UNK> at the end the acting is pretty poor too <UNK> and <UNK> are bland and everybody else is about the same only old pros martin and l q jones give good performances still this movie does work it <UNK> blood and gore there's some but this is pg and <UNK> to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere the acting <UNK> a lot of it but it still works martin especially <UNK> the scenery in his role i can't explain exactly why i sort of like this movie but it did work on me it's a quiet kind of horror that isn't made anymore hardly a <UNK> but this deserves to be <UNK> a 7
<START> a funny and <UNK> critique of russian society and culture during the transition from communism v also shows the west in an light a group of russians living in st <UNK> a k a peter the window on the west find a magic <UNK> that instantly <UNK> them to paris film is truly hilarious and just weird enough constantly keep even the jaded film viewer on his <UNK> the songs the dream sequences and the deliciously disgusting <UNK> of society from both cultures <UNK> to create a memorable and meaningful film anyone trying to understand the shift in russian cultural sentiments since the fall of the <UNK> should begin here
<START> as i write this user comment tim <UNK> interpretation of the <UNK> todd tale is making big money at the box office and the film even earned a couple of oscar nominations if i'm not mistaken i haven't seen it yet but i sincerely hope burton didn't look for inspiration and or stylish <UNK> in good old andy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> yes even though the title <UNK> mentions <UNK> the main characters in the plot are a <UNK> the infamous <UNK> todd and a female baker together they form a vile alliance where he kills the customers in his shop and she <UNK> the bodies into her famous london meat <UNK> in other words an andy <UNK> premise at his most typical derivative delirious and amateurish i think the imdb rating for this film speaks for itself although the actual story definitely isn't the worst i've ever seen <UNK> somehow inexplicably <UNK> sheer <UNK> the production is one gigantic mess with an incoherent narrative structure truly hideous photography poor lighting lousy acting and directing laughable gore and <UNK> tension or atmosphere more than half of the footage is pure padding and words fail to describe how boring the film is even with a running time of a mere 80 minutes ed wood ted v <UNK> and bruno mattei you guys need not fear as none other than andy <UNK> is  hands down  the worst director ever but i don't think he cared maybe if you <UNK> of a really high level of tolerance <UNK> <UNK> is worth one viewing
<START> we arrived at the theater too late to see rendition which was our intention and 'the was the only film that hadn't already started i had an <UNK> of how bad a film it was after reading the short <UNK> at the ticket counter the theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film started br br the screenwriters and director threw every imaginable sports cliché at the audience without creating a single laugh not one during the entire movie think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how <UNK> it is to be <UNK> or <UNK> if you add texas to the mix you ought to come up with the sports version of <UNK> miss <UNK> not a big yawn br br the first film that came to mind as we <UNK> the theater was stop the <UNK> by comparison this was stop the <UNK> without bruce <UNK> valerie <UNK> or the village people br br if the film had a single grace note it was seeing matthew lawrence grown up
<START> one of the best film i ever saw br br the performance of louis <UNK> is fantastic he really his part and this is wonderful he's such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to take his part br br and both <UNK> and bernard <UNK> are good as standard french people trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder br br the story is breathtaking and well built you can feel the ambiance of paris for that period which is about 1930 40 between two wars the <UNK> the old little buildings the neighbors br br all those things contribute to make a great movie
<START> this is easily the worst adaptation of greek mythology i've ever seen it utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth <UNK> silly plot twists and <UNK> the 12 <UNK> to 3 or 4 i think it makes up utterly needless things to try to <UNK> other <UNK> in clumsy ways which bring into question the <UNK> having ever read the <UNK> like changing birds to <UNK> lions to the <UNK> of to and <UNK> to a <UNK> version of even <UNK> aspects never seen outside of sam <UNK> entertaining series concerning his first marriage to a woman with the co <UNK> name of one of the <UNK> so it sounds appropriate to the period br br i could accept much of that but it also fails completely in pure film standards most painful is the dialogue <UNK> <UNK> pseudo shakespearean tripe it is a poor re interpretation of the <UNK> making a sad attempt at the kind of post modern <UNK> that <UNK> the 13th warrior attempted in regards to the beowulf legend while still including the strictly <UNK> elements such as clear <UNK> from the gods and magical super strength a sad sad failure of an entertainment experience who i'm sure many of the quality actors involved regret deeply
<START> as a fan of the old series i must say that this is at best a parody of a much beloved series first the old series would at least attempt to follow some military structure i know in this p c world it is not the thing to do but hey don't turn it into the care bears in the old series was a soldier now he is a teenage mutant turtle another thing is the flying tank ok it flies out of the <UNK> base and <UNK> off the <UNK> and they are both ok lets face it if the next one is not better this could spell the end of g i joe
<START> this is quite a bad movie but oh well this movie is at least not as lame as the third <UNK> movie br br yes this is a bad movie in terms of its writing directing acting and basically everything in between it has such a weak simple and <UNK> story that besides has little to do with the previous <UNK> movie entries it tries to connect the movie with the first movie <UNK> from 1985 but then on the other hand if they really wanted to connect this movie with its predecessors then were are the <UNK> in this movie instead now we are having some small people played by tony cox and <UNK> <UNK> dressed up as demons not that the <UNK> from the previous movies were any classic characters but they were nevertheless the heart and soul of the movie and also provided the movies with a certain amount of fun it's like having a <UNK> movie without the <UNK> br br the movie is not really interesting to watch because it lacks any tension good humor intriguing characters and basically everything else you can think off because it got put together by persons who obviously aren't the most talented ones within their business just like at director's jim <UNK> resume with movies such as the witches of and its sequel <UNK> jones and the <UNK> <UNK> house on hill scream queen hot <UNK> party the bare <UNK> project and the sequels the bare <UNK> project 2 scared topless and the bare <UNK> project 3 <UNK> of mystery mountain and the da <UNK> <UNK> on it br br yeah the movie is quite silly and campy but this is not really enough to boost this movie and gives it some more entertainment value you know it's the kind of cheap looking movie with some lame special effects costumes make up and actors nobody has heard of ever since br br still it isn't the worst movie out of the series because of the reason that <UNK> iii <UNK> go to college is by far a more worse movie since that one had some horrible lame attempts at humor this movie at least still does some attempts to be serious and professional one even though the end result is far from perfect br br bad movie making and perhaps only watchable for those who have seen the previous <UNK> entries br br 3 10
<START> i always hated this retarded show i liked the shows of cartoon network like <UNK> laboratory or <UNK> <UNK> but i never liked this piece of turd basically because it have stupid characters the good or the villains all seems to be mentally retarded they have stupid voices specially <UNK> she is supposed to be the cute character of the show but she is incredibly annoying the story lines are very very stupid some episodes could have been interesting but almost always the show turns childish and corny there wasn't any likable character the music was horrible and the animation is the worst that i've seen five year old boy could draw better i don't see why all the world seems to love this piece of garbage the <UNK> girls seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made fortunately foster home for the imaginary friends from the same creator was far away better
<START> one of <UNK> longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who <UNK> for an orange the dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a <UNK> nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters with the help of a stuffed cat the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible death the <UNK> features new techniques i have not yet seen in <UNK> films the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop motion animation makes for a new twist on <UNK> old style of <UNK> live scenes of moving cars and people's feet walking by as a puppet sits on the <UNK> sidewalk is impressive and fresh the <UNK> of cars and cries of street <UNK> is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were <UNK> and <UNK> of the new technology seems like old hat new puppet characters in this film are frightening <UNK> to the devil's club scene and newspaper <UNK> come to life <UNK> of dead birds lay eggs which <UNK> <UNK> chicks characters come flying in from all over on <UNK> and pans and <UNK> horses a new editing technique uses quick <UNK> which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene overall <UNK> is able to update his style of film making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work
<START> we all know bits and pieces of <UNK> travels tiny people yeah sure giants too some of us may recall some might remember the word <UNK> comes from here that's were it stops for most people br br <UNK> book is <UNK> in school <UNK> that's were i first read it and there's were a lot of people read it for the last time it is <UNK> lightly written like many of the old adventure books children can read it still it's dripping with satire black and <UNK> that's something i think most screen writers forget when they adapt this movie br br this movie remembers however our hero ted <UNK> gives a credible and serious performance as the world <UNK> man who's thrown to mysterious countries so like our own <UNK> travels <UNK> everything scientists government <UNK> humanity itself few are <UNK> and most of the satire is just as fresh today br br while very faithful to the story the movie also <UNK> adding new angles all which work very well the screen writer deserves all credit for managing to balance so well between time and activity it's not boring that is br br production values are way beyond a tv movie with some marketing this movie would have done well at the box office all of the fantastic worlds <UNK> visits are well made explained in detail and often very funny much like <UNK> book br br actors are all pros since this is a british production mary <UNK> stands out along with james <UNK> dr bates the <UNK> cruel doctor who much like nurse only wants the <UNK> best br br so a modest <UNK> if you ever get the chance to get this movie do so it's a real treat
<START> there was nothing else on tv yesterday afternoon so i thought okay let's watch this i didn't know the plot and i had no expectation whatsoever i was thinking in a few minutes or so i will channel surf again but then story started to unfold and the characters played beautifully by the two boys the story did have unrealistic parts and scenes but overall it was a real good movie very well worth watching
<START> as talk shows go larry king live is not bad and since he occasionally gets good guests it's a show to turn on once in awhile but not <UNK> when bill <UNK> carl <UNK> a former president or other <UNK> guests sit across from him it's not too bad other times he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and <UNK> a largely <UNK> public that wants to hear the latest <UNK> about movie and tv stars during the <UNK> simpson trial it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case but is this really <UNK> or the national <UNK> on the tube sometimes it comes off a little bit like trash television jerry springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience br br on the other side king's show is definitely much better than bill <UNK> whose show is nothing more than a political platform of the rush <UNK> variety that said larry king is not a bad <UNK> but alas he is not a great one king does not always come off like he completely when intellectual material is being presented especially if it is by a <UNK> or <UNK> with a new book on subtle aspects of politics always seems like the minute king can't quite deal with the issue at hand that's when he turns to the phone calls maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has he might interview someone like david but may not have read any of his books sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script br br when it's an entertainment celebrity no problem he can come off like he's thoroughly <UNK> since the material is not that <UNK> anyway talking to elizabeth taylor about her relationship with richard burton is not exactly rocket science and i notice he usually has seen the <UNK> latest movie watching a movie takes much less time and <UNK> than reading a book however if it's the likes of john dean or bob <UNK> king comes off a little like he didn't quite finish his <UNK> so off to the phones br br if you are looking for real in depth <UNK> terry gross of <UNK> is probably the best <UNK> in the united states she reads and or <UNK> everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas i don't see king quite doing that granted he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than terry gross which may say more about the american audience than king in short larry is better than bill but not as good as terry
<START> i've seen various <UNK> and i've taught the play as i watch <UNK> i'm tempted to think that he's every bit as intelligent as hamlet himself so alive is he to every nuance of this character's wit he <UNK> rather than <UNK> every puzzle regarding <UNK> character he <UNK> line after line word after word shining light into this <UNK> mind at the same time however we cringe at the horror hamlet feels at his betrayal far more than with any other actor because <UNK> feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else and we <UNK> at <UNK> own <UNK> because <UNK> is not afraid of the <UNK> to which hamlet can <UNK> in short <UNK> gives us hamlet in full and hamlet in full is the greatest character in literature that's why i'm satisfied that <UNK> hamlet is the finest performance i've seen by an actor
<START> the core message is strong the cast has given it their best shot the <UNK> is excellent but the screenplay is seriously over <UNK> and every cliche in the book on women's suffering in india has been over used to the max
<START> not a <UNK> but a good movie to see once or twice bill macy shows he can do more than just act his writing was pretty darn good great supporting cast especially jamie <UNK> as the <UNK> private eye br br the movie's greatest strength is the work of macy who reminds us of his jerry role from <UNK> he has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy <UNK> and <UNK> character it's enjoyable to watch him be a <UNK> and for a while i was happy that things were turning out well for him out of four
<START> the violent men is pretty good western that certainly benefits from its excellent cast br br edward g robinson is the big <UNK> trying to squeeze out the smaller <UNK> one of whom is glenn ford ford is ready to sell to <UNK> his <UNK> may <UNK> until <UNK> ambitious brother brian keith murders one of ford's hands then you know what happens next br br barbara stanwyck is along as <UNK> scheming wife the kind of role in which she <UNK> <UNK> foster plays their daughter who comes to admire ford br br the violent men is nothing more than a b plot with an a movie cast but it is very well done
<START> if you're a north american looking for a here it is was this <UNK> spaces visits <UNK> there were way too many stereotypes little attention was given to character and plot development yawn highlight of the film the flag throwing poor guy i thought he was going to loose an eye
<START> this film was a new direction for natalie portman a much more adult role though she comes to it from the <UNK> of a child in the movie itself ann portman and susan sarandon who plays her newly divorced mother adele travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to beverly hills there these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as <UNK> character grows up <UNK> at first to adele she grows up and becomes a better mother for it br br ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress or so she thinks adele uses that <UNK> every time there are problems in their lives we see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone having left their old lives behind br br the acting is top notch from both of them they seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes you can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie br br though this movie really doesn't take us to any new ground in these types of films the fact that the acting is well done and the story isn't too flawed let's me recommend it br br i will say however it will probably go away soon i don't believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge christmas season of movies starting in a week or so see it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses
<START> the dead truly is a work of art clearly john huston meant to show that he was still in the full glory of some passion by making it even as his body was failing him this movie is <UNK> affecting and <UNK> in the mind long after it is done reading the <UNK> short story certainly adds more depth to the characters especially <UNK> inner turmoil but the essence is all there in this film as a statement by an artist of his love of life and his craft the dead stands alone
<START> here's what's good about the slaughter rule br br ryan <UNK> <UNK> duvall and david morse all give great performances <UNK> is as always pretty darn outstanding the locales are often breathtaking br br here's what's bad about the slaughter rule br br everything else the script is horribly muddled and while i can certainly appreciate a non feel good movie this movie is just boring great performances can't make up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is filled with throw away lines that often don't even make it sense just getting through the first hour became a chore br br i stuck with it because of <UNK> but eventually i did myself a favor and changed the channel spoilers on here <UNK> the ending to me i didn't miss much do yourself a favor if you want a good <UNK> flick check out the believer br br my score 2 out of 10
<START> this is the best movie ever but that is my opinion some say it's cheesy but i think it is truly a beautiful film the chemistry between jennifer grey and patrick <UNK> it's like no other i have ever seen and that is what makes the film so perfect i always wonder what would have been of this film if these two actors never existed because not just one them did it for me they both did if you have never seen this film when you do you will understand what i mean dirty dancing looks like it was done from the heart and it feels so real for some reason like magic and the soundtrack love it besides the 2 lead actors the soundtrack makes the film the beauty that it is as you can tell i am in love with this film and i know you will be too
<START> i'm bout it 1997 br br developed published by no limit films br br pros absolutely none br br cons i don't even know where to begin br br plot summary master p plays a drug dealer that looks talks and acts more like a live action cartoon character that's all the plot i got out of this movie br br review i remember back when i was in the <UNK> grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called master p this movie is so bad it's not even funny all the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes the audio is only <UNK> when music plays and the movie looks like it was <UNK> off a public access channel luckily i didn't buy this film like all my other inner city <UNK> classmates br br my rating 1 out of 10 br br my verdict avoid this video like its a sexually <UNK> disease
<START> years ago sara a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered now as an adult she suffers from various mental <UNK> did i mention she has an imaginary friend this film <UNK> the viewer not into a sense of tension mind you but rather a sense of <UNK> <UNK> boring i found it hard to sit through as i could feel my <UNK> growing <UNK> and <UNK> with each endless minute of mindless <UNK> and supposed <UNK> is sara going crazy or is it the <UNK> a better question would be who cares and the answer to that no one no one at all skip this film save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasks br br my grade d
<START> i recently got the movie and all i can say it is a good movie there's a lot of famous rome <UNK> and historical locations it is from the same writer and director from the da <UNK> code tom hanks stars along with ewan <UNK> and the movie starts out with the space and time experiment in sweden until one of the <UNK> is stolen by the <UNK> most hated enemy the the plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything its a race all of rome following the trail to get to the secret meeting place while racing against time to find the path of the over all its a movie worth seeing hell i watched it 3 times and i still like it so in the end go buy it it is a lot better than the movie <UNK> and the ending has one awesome plot twist
<START> fun bad movie which should <UNK> one of joan <UNK> last performances as the driven successful editor vs all those young beautiful eager <UNK> fresh out of the elite seven sister <UNK> great <UNK> ambiance of new york wonderful period costumes and <UNK> terrific art direction trite story but <UNK> interesting cameo by robert evans as a rich <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a <UNK> in los angeles the fact is that there are no <UNK> in los angeles this movie should not be filmed in los angeles it should be filmed in <UNK> hawaii hawaii has <UNK> which is a real fact that this movie should be made in <UNK> state capital this movie should be filmed in hawaii because this is the real idea and not in los angeles there are <UNK> in los angeles but there are no <UNK> to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a <UNK> in los angeles is nothing but nonsense
<START> i purchased a dvd of this film for a dollar at the big <UNK> store that's probably the best and <UNK> comment i have to offer on it at least it didn't cheat me out of the cost of lunch br br the problem with <UNK> is craven's problem as a director the man has his <UNK> who claim his traveling papers prove he's a really smart guy and all around sharp but it's no secret that as a director he has never possessed one <UNK> of the visual and story telling sense of a hitchcock as <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> he's much closer to that legendary flat foot gordon lewis what craven lacks as a director is the main <UNK> that would lift him from director for hire to a higher plane of film making br br let's be specific the <UNK> moments of this film are <UNK> the establishing shots give it the feel of a quality production the film looks <UNK> put together in the way a film shot by a tv commercial director would a thought the films only visual distinction these transitions that at least look <UNK> handled may very well be the work of some second unit directors it's the parts between the bridges and smooth transitions the drama that fall flat br br the core of the proceedings are <UNK> <UNK> handled the critical shots after say the <UNK> car drives into the well <UNK> camera then we cut to the night exterior of a hospital then to the waiting area and <UNK> then to the phone booth in the corner that will figure in the next bit of action are quickly <UNK> so we can hurry up and get to the next part craven never comes anywhere close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment the net result of all this misplaced attention to the least important parts and the <UNK> rush to keep things moving is a film that feels like the work of the <UNK> art student who <UNK> all his <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> and lighting set up <UNK> all his stretches and <UNK> his <UNK> and then has nothing to say craven like the art student never gets to the meat of the exercise br br for craven <UNK> who will point out that this film was made for tv i will point to spielberg's duel and say no more
<START> latter days br br aspect ratio 1 85 1 br br sound format <UNK> br br trouble <UNK> when an la party boy wes <UNK> falls in love with a handsome mormon <UNK> steve br br a huge hit on the festival circuit and on limited theatrical release this likable movie the feature debut of screenwriter c jay cox sweet home <UNK> is an exercise in in which <UNK> shallow minded character is changed forever after falling hard for vulnerable beauty who is <UNK> by the <UNK> of his religious <UNK> here the path of true love is <UNK> with <UNK> not least of which is the reaction of fellow <UNK> to his <UNK> sexuality which results in his <UNK> from the church and the wrath of his <UNK> parents mary kay place has a small but devastating cameo as the boy's <UNK> mother but <UNK> script focuses <UNK> on <UNK> path to redemption as his <UNK> lifestyle is thrown into <UNK> by influence and by the <UNK> which emerge as a consequence of his developing maturity he <UNK> as an <UNK> <UNK> delivering food to aids patients living at home leading to an unexpected friendship with former party boy <UNK> <UNK> tv's er whose illness provides <UNK> with a much needed wake up call br br <UNK> script is laced with <UNK> one liners and various <UNK> of wisdom on <UNK> your church doesn't like alcohol or <UNK> well i'm definitely not joining i can't imagine heaven without both and the characters are surprisingly complex and well drawn <UNK> has the <UNK> role he's first seen doing something rude to a willing <UNK> but it's who has become something of a gay icon with his sensitive portrayal of a sweet natured innocent whose journey from darkness into light leads to a startling revelation about his place in the world around him he and <UNK> are well matched and their inevitable sex scene brief but memorable is followed by a compelling sequence in which <UNK> describes a childhood trauma which has defined his life to date br br filmed on hi <UNK> video and transferred to <UNK> for theatrical <UNK> the movie's <UNK> budget places limitations on the scope and <UNK> of <UNK> ambitions though the characters and situations are strong enough to survive this minor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shines as a <UNK> wise <UNK> at the diner where <UNK> waits tables for a living and joseph gordon <UNK> third rock from the sun steals everyone's thunder as fellow mormon opposed to his friend's relationship with <UNK> on religious principle but only on principle though a little stilted in places the movie with romantic longing and deserves <UNK> for its honesty and compassion best seen with a crowd of like minded viewers preferably with a loved one by your side
<START> this event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that i believe is not <UNK> today the colorful characters in their stereotypical <UNK> brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and <UNK> wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then a kid could watch it without watching an episode of jerry springer br br looking back now i was 5 at the time although i loved both warrior and hogan i think i enjoyed warrior more because of his <UNK> hogan was the <UNK> hero who an impressive public image the ultimate warrior on the other hand was a masked man of few words an out of the <UNK> hero for a different audience br br this rivalry was so exciting as a kid because of this <UNK> in me <UNK> it out for each <UNK> i had a place for both of them because there was bloodshed too in this long heavy battle the stakes were high at least to me as a kid on a similar note because of <UNK> defeat this made him more human i remember feeling kind of sorry for him br br all of these emotions at play in the juvenile boy's soap opera made <UNK> <UNK> such a great time to witness this game
<START> it's not often i feel strongly enough to post something about a film this was however simply the worst movie i have ever seen the performances were laughable at best at worst they were well there's no other word for it awful especially the lead female who's random sexual come <UNK> have to be seen and heard to be believed honestly the plot is nonsensical the dialogue appalling and the characterisation there is none i'm surprised it's not an alan <UNK> film i can't stress this strongly enough avoid at all costs how do movies like this ever get made this is no budget film making at its very very worst
<START> this starts out interestingly as there's a carnival right next to someone's house with an oil <UNK> right there too and some kind of store front church across the street with a <UNK> jesus saves sign all right in one tiny area now that's pretty dazzling if improbable and then we go right into the movie which takes improbable to new levels of course this is a lame remake of the 1979 thriller starring carol kane as the babysitter jill johnson now jill is some chick that ran her cell phone minutes up so high her evil parents are <UNK> her by making her work it off probably something that the audience this movie targets can identify with jill is taken to this huge and fancy house on a lake in the middle of nowhere of course by her dad to <UNK> for the family the children are already <UNK> all <UNK> in their <UNK> when jill arrives and the <UNK> is still there huh she couldn't <UNK> of course despite the remote location one of <UNK> friends pops by one whom with which she apparently has issues as in boyfriend stealing or something anyway of course the alarm in the house goes off for no reason and then calls from someone start coming in calls from someone that wants to kill her of course jill calls the cops and since there hasn't been any actual threat on her life they blow her off but tell her to call back if there's anything else they can do for her check out the scene with jill calling her friends at the high school <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or whatever it's supposed to be it looks like some kind of burning man festival there's all kind of contrived scares in this including the cool cat <UNK> who of course pops up here and there one of the horror movie clichés there is i will admit that i <UNK> off at some point during this and did i miss anything hard to tell or care really this is one of those films that makes me wonder how bad the remakes of <UNK> horror house of wax or the fog could have been anyway from reading online reviews it seems like the folks that were the most scared by this were 12 year old girls and i can only assume that from statements like it made me pee pee my pants well one can only hope that this will put an end to hollywood remakes of films that weren't exactly stellar to begin with but don't bet on it 2 out of 10 and i'm being overly generous
<START> tale of two sisters has to be one of the <UNK> films i've seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly <UNK> and possibly <UNK> polar stepmother who <UNK> out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and <UNK> tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was <UNK> enough to let her die much about the <UNK> of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a <UNK> hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen it's a hell of a <UNK>
<START> if you want to see a movie with nudity sex drugs alcohol brutal beating of a woman and child rape this movie will satisfy you if you want to see a man <UNK> exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him this movie has it you've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going the surprise is that in a story of violence action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence without a <UNK> speech which transforms the movie look for a final scene that is an unexpected evidence of a wounded person healing perhaps we who wonder why we <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> will learn that love can be located above the <UNK> in the heart from the <UNK> <UNK> follow the rhythm to where where love is sacred
<START> i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill <UNK> wasn't involved with this movie an american <UNK> <UNK> list of <UNK> to <UNK> with a distinct of <UNK> in hell <UNK> and karl marx didn't make an appearance in hell but ronald reagan is in the same room with hitler perhaps we'll have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher <UNK> for them to show all of their pet <UNK> political figures br br cheap shots at religion right wing politicians <UNK> and their fox news even <UNK> all the radical <UNK> talking points were too completely covered while <UNK> <UNK> references to <UNK> from the other side of the <UNK> to not have been a conscious effort the <UNK> exception i noticed in the hour and a half is <UNK> has to have sex with marilyn monroe for eternity the token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing non <UNK>
<START> and i for one think that is a good thing i've just never been a <UNK> russell fan although the original was my favorite <UNK> movie but i love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this br br as for the rest of the production i think it was slightly less than the original movie one of my favorite minor characters in the original was with her <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> voice <UNK> out hey it takes a lot more than no talent to be a and although i missed it i was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a <UNK> copy br br i also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre not just at the movies br br i think the other thing i liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less <UNK> of the song let me entertain you which becomes completely annoying after about the <UNK> time you hear it
<START> it's hard to believe that with a cast as strong as this one has that this movie can be such a dud it's such an incredibly horrible film how was it ever made how did so many good actors wind up in such a terrible film don't waste your life don't watch even one moment of this film
<START> when i first saw the trailer for this film i really wanted to see it i thought some of the director's other works were quite good but i must say i was disappointed the plot involves a young woman who lives with a widowed father and two his two sons they move into a well <UNK> community yet all is not as it seems a sort of twin peaks the woman begins to see or not see things an people during the first reel i had a <UNK> and thought this can't be the whole reason well the ending lived up or better down and gave us what i felt was a truly weak final act the sound mixing and quality is excellent saw it in a <UNK> <UNK> theatre and was impressed by the audio and only the audio the picture is missing substance
<START> well there's a few things about this movie everyone should see it you see the nation of iraq like you've never seen it covered by the media and shot from a perspective that is hardly considered by most americans where the movie has its main audience however all that glorious stuff in mind lets take a look at a few other facts of the movie there were 150 cameras handed out to the <UNK> people most all of which view the war and <UNK> of the <UNK> forces as a growing pain for the <UNK> of their nation and in comparison to <UNK> it is simply a feeble scratching at the skin also netflix as its main <UNK> advertised it before the fun election we just had by sending out a mass e mail to its entire <UNK> to see the film many of the what should be labeled as opinions played out as facts listed off by the interviewed <UNK> are wrong if one is to review the red records of abu <UNK> <UNK> it wasn't henchmen who were being tortured it was a fine mix of a 80 90 innocent civilians and 10 20 rightfully <UNK> people never was it <UNK> that any of that 10 20 were henchmen or <UNK> <UNK> in addition the arab world really has never listed as one of their opponents more correctly it is the <UNK> 6 billion dollars a year to our military <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and our interest in oil i agree that the media is a complete <UNK> but this film shows that same <UNK> i'm afraid that the <UNK> people that this film represents have been edited to speak with a <UNK> voice yes its true that <UNK> is a <UNK> and that his <UNK> many see for the best its true that some <UNK> actually get paid a good <UNK> just as its true that no <UNK> people have control of their most <UNK> oil and us <UNK> do nor does it mention that 20 000 civilians have died due exclusively to us <UNK> still 15 of the country which once had running water and now does not nor does it mention that from 1993 2003 un <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> by the usa government killed over 200 000 <UNK> civilians nor does it mention that democracy in when people decide the government not a massive war machine that sends the message <UNK> killed or i am afraid that the cutting room floor must have quite a bit of <UNK> that aren't so happy with the <UNK> just as the vast majority of the world was not for the war in fact the america <UNK> spain and the rest of them are not <UNK> of democracy they turned their back to it when they saw how full their <UNK> could be <UNK> <UNK> is out of power but i'm afraid that no <UNK> is yet in power <UNK> are in power the media is in power read do your own research and don't let them <UNK> you
<START> the direction by wong is perhaps the all time worst in film history i've ever seen this film makes my all time worst film of 2000 <UNK> and dragons by <UNK> looked like an oscar winner the flaws in this movie is beyond explanation the biggest one is the lack of depth every scene does not develop fully as if the editing room doesn't know how to do their job correctly its a shame that with such an all star cast of talents and a famous popular traditional story can be destroyed by this lack of vision br br i am so disgusted and hope that some great director like john woo or ang lee decide to remake this film and do some justice i'm not even sure if i can rate 0 10
<START> i think that this is a disappointing sequel i miss a lot of the old characters king <UNK> anne marie etc and i don't like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters a lot of personality was lost in charlie and the villain red is not even half as bad as carface was in the first one if you're a big <UNK> fan like i am it's worth seeing just to see how the story is continued but don't count on it being 5 stars in your book
<START> spoilers br br i love the simpsons and i have seen every single episode that had ever come out i must admit season one is by far the most underrated season and this is the most underrated episode in season one the episode begins with the family playing a game of <UNK> to get bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school he says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it but he needs to he spells out a word that <UNK> homer and he chases bart around the house the next day mrs <UNK> the class that the test isn't part of their grade just a test that would tell them what their future would be like bart can't answer one question he thinks fast he quickly switches test with martin prince the <UNK> one in class later that day <UNK> and homer are called to go to the <UNK> office to discuss <UNK> behavior suddenly out of nowhere the school psychologist comes and tells <UNK> and homer and <UNK> that bart is a genius and should go to a special school for the gifted bart agrees to go since he wouldn't need to do any <UNK> the next day homer drives bart to the new school he is introduced to everyone and everything <UNK> his day isn't very good the smart students take his lunch <UNK> he can't read any comic books but he does anyway and he is criticized by his fellow students luckily for bart he and homer start to have a great time together but <UNK> bought tickets to an opera they go to the opera and make fun of it the next day he goes to his old school but is made fun of by his friends they call him a point <UNK> while at his new school bart is told to do a chemistry experiment he does it wrong and blows up the school leaving himself green bart is told by the psychologist to tell him why he did it instead bart tells him he wants to go undercover and go back to his old school to observe other kids the psychologist is intrigued and he asks bart to explain it on a piece of paper he finds it too hard and instead writes a confession that he really isn't a genius he gives it to the psychologist all he cares about is that he spelled the word confession wrong that night homer <UNK> bart and bart tells him that he really isn't a genius and that he cheated on the test homer gets angry and chases bart around the house as lisa and <UNK> look at them casually br br overall this is a very underrated season one episode br br 8 10
<START> this show is not in my opinion good then again i have not enjoyed any cartoon from disney channel except for the proud family because that so is about a normal female teen this show is very similar to the way i feel about <UNK> and the series it was a mistake turning the movie into a cartoon because the movie was excellent the cartoon is terrible disney channel was doing just fine before adding all these stupid cartoons such as dave the barbarian <UNK> and mr <UNK> <UNK> and the series american dragon jake long and where it all started kim possible the shows would have been better had they come to <UNK> disney as for this particular show will never get out of school just as dave the parents will never return home and as <UNK> and mr <UNK> will never get out of the jungle
<START> although the figures are higher in <UNK> to other areas of society i don't object to the extremely high <UNK> for many of today's <UNK> and <UNK> br br a rod or brady all have deals either well with 8 figures or the low 9 area ray <UNK> and jerry seinfeld could actually become <UNK> from their shows huge <UNK> and <UNK> they currently demand even their cast members and all of the friends group reached near or over 7 figures per episode <UNK> <UNK> for one show could solve most people's financial problems and a week or <UNK> take care of many for life br br but all of these are based upon sound supply demand principals and the financial benefits they bring to their <UNK> and all perform their <UNK> <UNK> br br but then comes along someone like rachel ray who reaches a level of <UNK> far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill i find her shrill annoying and with a forced <UNK> that's as phony as the proverbial 3 dollar bill br br a friend of mine is responsible for special <UNK> events and convention plans for her firm and its one of the major talent sources has hundreds of <UNK> available from the 5 level to a handful who get and up per appearance this area includes <UNK> seinfeld lance armstrong robin williams and no kidding larry the cable guy br br there are a greater number in the 100 <UNK> 200 000 range list included the likes of bill <UNK> steve martin and even cable guy <UNK> <UNK> jeff <UNK> br br this category includes <UNK> ray i suppose i have to admit there may be sufficient demand for her talent and offerings to justify her talk show and there may be some out there <UNK> pay more than <UNK> first class air hotel <UNK> all <UNK> and <UNK> door to door for just a couple of hours of her whiny <UNK> at their <UNK> event br br i just can't figure how in the hell this could be possible
<START> another entry in the pacino as mentor sub genre you know the <UNK> young <UNK> with <UNK> flaw in this case matthew <UNK> trying to jump start a <UNK> career by <UNK> onto <UNK> <UNK> hey it worked for keanu and colin didn't it is discovered by glamorous and delightfully corrupt father figure pacino <UNK> young <UNK> learns from father figure all the ins and outs of a <UNK> yet <UNK> career this time it's football father figure <UNK> young <UNK> with money and <UNK> and power but we all know that this <UNK> state of affairs is on a <UNK> course with <UNK> and despair that is until the young <UNK> finds his moral center by <UNK> the father figure and all or almost all that he stands for clearly <UNK> wall street pretty much set the ground rules for the pacino as mentor sub genre br br we are also meant to take these latter day pacino films as a parallel to reality again you know the <UNK> living legend actor demonstrates his <UNK> <UNK> as compared to an inferior young actor the latter may bear and grin through the process but he must recognize that he isn't going to get any of the good lines much less get a chance to chew major scenery before the denouement now it must be said that there are actually two good movies in the pacino as mentor <UNK> <UNK> of a woman and <UNK> <UNK> in the former case it was a one man show anyway in the latter case pacino had met his match as a scene <UNK> in the person of johnny <UNK> however those two movies were serious minded not merely an exercise in <UNK> for sake pacino has made damn certain that his younger co stars in the films since <UNK> are nowhere near as charismatic as <UNK> by the way none of this speaks very well about the living legend actor like his contemporary de niro pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years <UNK> on his <UNK> two for the money is the worst example yet worse even than devil's <UNK> which at least had the virtues of featuring a naked connie <UNK> and being <UNK> prior to this movie well this is what happens when you're <UNK> king too damn early just ask marlon brando frankly i've seen one too many al pacino films with the same plot and the same overacting from the star to be <UNK> any longer did i say none of this speaks well actually it's <UNK> for everyone involved including the paying audience no one's going to <UNK> matthew <UNK> of being a shakespearean actor but even he doesn't deserve the role of second <UNK> to this <UNK> old show off with the added <UNK> that he <UNK> will never measure up to the greatness that is al br br i've not wasted space on the plot <UNK> if you want a synopsis imdb provides a no nonsense summary though i think i laid out a fairly <UNK> summary in my opening paragraph basically you've seen this movie before many times the particular <UNK> in two for the money is the seedy world underworld really of sports pacino runs an office of bet <UNK> that is between you and your <UNK> and even has a cable tv show co <UNK> with several of his top guys one thing the movie got right was the <UNK> of these type of shows but one detail they got dead wrong was the constant use of the words <UNK> and gambling if you've ever seen or other shows of similar <UNK> you'll never never hear jim <UNK> and his <UNK> say the word <UNK> they ask you to call their 1 <UNK> number to get their picks but if you were from say mars you'd have no idea what you were supposed to do with those picks <UNK> is the f word on sports tv shows strictly <UNK> br br gambling is against the law you know br br 1 star out of 10
<START> this is a great movie all 3 were the last one was not as good as the first 2 but it was made along time after and it was pulling at <UNK> but you want to watch it cause it tells the end of the story just not how we might think it should end br br these movies made me want to be there to be in all the <UNK> love tears and laughter that the people in this movie go threw it is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it no matter how many times that is br br there are some parts in the movie that the little kids wont understand and the older ones be old enough to watch but it is a great movie <UNK> over 20 years
<START> <UNK> was one of the first comic books to <UNK> a change in the genre in spite of being a very well made superhero comic book this is the first series ever that added a real psychological depth to the main character had complex moral issue round characters and also <UNK> social and political issues in other words <UNK> was the comic <UNK> coming of age this tv series lacks all of those <UNK> it's just a straightforward good buy bad guy tv series suffering from obvious <UNK> that make the action scene moderately exciting <UNK> is about as convincing as the cardboard rocks in star trek nicholas <UNK> is way too old for the role at that point in time i think he was well into his thirties <UNK> spider man was really teenager at the time for some <UNK> reason the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book which again just resulted in the tension between characters basically disappearing
<START> one of the best lesser known occult oriented horror movies of the seventies it's gritty exciting scary <UNK> here and there and at moments even very smart which can't be said about many of the movies this kind i can't help seeing some <UNK> symbolic and <UNK> points at the seventies society and generation stuff of the time this movie was done the scriptwriter has obviously been cooking while delivering also some good old from the crypt kind of scenes with a job well done from a creative director the result is entertaining and thought provoking the simple yet effective ending specially shows how these things are treated right by those who can br br the excellent cast were mostly unknown to me except l q jones as the moody but funny sheriff and martin as the town doctor martin not surprisingly always ends up stealing the movie with that voice and skill he is one of the greatest <UNK> in movies for me anyway what an actor br br so it is a little bit of mystery to me why this movie has not gathered far greater recognition i think it would deserve almost equal place in the occult horror <UNK> alongside rosemary's baby and the exorcist one <UNK> movie
<START> and the worst part is that it could have been good but something horribly wrong first thing first they should not have cast amitabh bachchan in this film at all he is too much of an icon to tackle such a delicate and controversial topic let alone the role itself br br secondly ram <UNK> <UNK> ought to be ashamed of himself for taking the classic story of <UNK> and turning it into a pathetic predictable slut fest his <UNK> is named <UNK> played by newcomer khan and when we meet her she is devoid of any <UNK> of stolen innocence or that delicate <UNK> that one would normally associate with the complicated tale of the original <UNK> who in the original story gradually becomes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is already a whore with her eye on the prize even even before the camera meets her and he <UNK> no <UNK> in the way his films his leading <UNK> from constant <UNK> shots of her <UNK> to on her vulgar gestures and mannerisms mr <UNK> makes sure he has left not one person in the audience less than uncomfortable with his <UNK> <UNK> camera angles br br oh and let's not talk about the non existent chemistry between <UNK> and her so called friend <UNK> <UNK> character's daughter these girls are supposed to be best friends yet look like worst enemies even before anything goes wrong between them nothing they do together is believable until they become enemies maybe mr <UNK> should have worked on that aspect of his script rather than focusing on destroying any credibility amitabh bachchan might have had left as an actor br br the worst part of the movie is perhaps the <UNK> portrayal of the character of <UNK> character's wife her role was so <UNK> and ridiculously wooden that it's impossible to actually feel any pity or concern for her i actually felt like reaching into the screen <UNK> her for not <UNK> like any normal woman would instead she just stood there looking irritated and helpless as i imagine much of the viewers of this film might feel after watching this train wreck of a film watch at your own risk
<START> this is the greatest movie ever if you have written it off with out ever seeing it you must give it a second try
<START> this film was full of suspense and was well directed the black and white effect made it a great mystery fay <UNK> <UNK> who was married twice to the famous musician henderson and also the son of elliott <UNK> son fell <UNK> in love with <UNK> scott <UNK> mason <UNK> <UNK> wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture even <UNK> freeman anne and <UNK> marriage whenever he can <UNK> <UNK> dr jane <UNK> famous radio and tv actress in the 30's and 40's played mostly small town mom's warned the ladies about <UNK> <UNK> sick mind and the abusive childhood he had when growing up which caused his love hate relationship with women fay <UNK> and <UNK> scott would have been greater stars with more rewarding roles but their lives were short lived in real life this film is beyond it is a <UNK> great 1945 film classic for many generations to view and enjoy
<START> this is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like joel <UNK> could make i suppose a group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes upon revival they discover that their sins have <UNK> themselves somehow or other as some of the characters are visited by dead people and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty it's not quite clear exactly what the connection is but the visions do all seem to look like sixth form art films why the students treat their experiment as some kind of grand journey that'll make them famous is a bit of a mystery as the results are completely and as the movie mentions several times have been documented plenty of times before still it's nice to see <UNK> <UNK> for his batman <UNK> with a bit of the old <UNK> paint and <UNK> and william baldwin is a <UNK>
<START> this movie is so bad they wouldn't buy it back at my local used cd dvd store i only own it because it came in a box set which i bought for the masterpiece <UNK> the store bought back the other two movies i was selling from the four disc set but they wouldn't buy back underworld and those other two movies <UNK> rank so what does that say about this movie so i tried to sell it back to another store that even bought back budget dvds that you could buy for a dollar at a local store but they wouldn't buy back underworld either this movie is bad on every level and is one of those that came out in the post tarantino clone <UNK> of the mid 90's the only slightly <UNK> element is dennis <UNK> telling joe <UNK> that he's a <UNK> friend and calls him mister <UNK> friend that line is so delightfully horrible that i can't help but quote it at least once a week when describing a <UNK> friend but now that i've <UNK> you with that quote you don't have to go thru the pain of watching this movie
<START> i noted that the official imdb review refers to <UNK> as a <UNK> i believe that this <UNK> is <UNK> and profoundly incorrect br br this is a movie about sadness and about the ability of one particular teenage boy to see sadness in daily life as it lies in wait around every corner in advance of the unfolding of the lives that it <UNK> a <UNK> is a person who cannot empathize with others and who while understanding the difference between right and wrong does not care about this difference a <UNK> is a subject who places himself or herself at the center of that <UNK> universe with total disregard for the impact that the <UNK> actions have for those around him or her one of the defining characteristics of a <UNK> is that a true <UNK> lacks the ability to feel empathy lacks the ability to feel that which others feel and does not changes in the <UNK> of others as the result of that <UNK> actions with those actions a <UNK> cannot feel the pain of others or understand that the pain of others is the result of the <UNK> own actions a <UNK> is a person who is not completely formed a vital <UNK> is missing from the psychological and emotional makeup of a true <UNK> rendering the <UNK> <UNK> to talking therapy and other treatment that involve human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings <UNK> is devastating even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment aimed at containing the damage that the <UNK> can do to others many <UNK> function more or less normally and never raise a <UNK> on the radar of the criminal justice system although they tend to leave a trail of emotional <UNK> in their wakes br br <UNK> fitzgerald is no <UNK> he is a person who is blessed or cursed with the ability to <UNK> what he considers to be the inevitable consequences and <UNK> of human interactions <UNK> literally sees sadness written into the eyes and faces of people around him as he slowly <UNK> and <UNK> the philosophy that life is about loss and that people slowly <UNK> to the inevitable and <UNK> fact that for want of a better metaphor things fall apart people who fall in love and who kiss and <UNK> today turn into pathetic elderly couples the electricity in the eyes of mother a wealthy new york <UNK> who loves <UNK> and who invites him into the home that she shares with her family when he arrives in new york city alone and determined to remain in the city at the age of 12 fades as she explains to him on the last of his visits to new york city that she learned that her husband had been cheating on her all the time that she got a divorce that having one's heart broken happens to everybody and that such loss is an inevitable part of growing up her eyes still reflect light but the electricity that once <UNK> them is gone this scene this explanation late is it is in coming is crucial to understanding why <UNK> commits a seemingly savage senseless crime killing the retarded younger brother of his ex girlfriend <UNK> knows what lies ahead for this little boy a lifetime of <UNK> goals of being taught only words that <UNK> danger of never knowing the love of another human being of never feeling such love and of never connecting with another person more than any other character in this movie this little boy <UNK> everything that <UNK> sees as being inevitable and horrifying about the world act killing this little boy is for <UNK> an act of mercy committed because this was the one thing that he could do in a world in which actions cannot change <UNK> whereas a true <UNK> knows that actions can and do change <UNK> but does not care about the harm inflicted on others by those actions <UNK> does care what most people view as a <UNK> and horrifying act is in eyes the only decent thing that he can do to <UNK> the suffering of just one person br br it would be <UNK> to be able to present this as an explanation of actions <UNK> but <UNK> for in the end blame for actions lies elsewhere as is so often the case there are no easy explanations and no <UNK> to apply to the <UNK> soul why did <UNK> not learn something that even the most <UNK> people usually acknowledge that sometimes just sometimes people do remain in love and that relationships do succeed and that even the saddest lives are transformed for <UNK> there is no middle ground no inner core to which he can <UNK> and <UNK> there is only pain and sadness one is tempted to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father the brilliant writer played by kevin spacey for not being there at critical times during development but given this man's <UNK> <UNK> that may have been a <UNK> br br in the end this viewer was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness why was <UNK> doomed to view the world through a <UNK> of <UNK> and depression there is a maturity to character present for example when he repeatedly insists that nobody was to blame for his girlfriend breaking up with him that is both stoic and heartbreaking stoic in that it is absolutely genuine notwithstanding the <UNK> of teacher but heartbreaking in that it is born not so much of understanding as of despair indifference to his fate is merely a reflection of the utter <UNK> of his belief that nothing really matters nothing that he does can change his fate br br this is not <UNK> on display this is if anything its polar opposite
<START> sean <UNK> pulls off another amazing performance in toy soldiers he plays the highly intelligent <UNK> billy <UNK> along with <UNK> <UNK> and keith <UNK> who play his best friends joey <UNK> and jonathan during a regular day at saint school for boys a group of dangerous terrorists take all the boys and teachers as <UNK> and threatens to blow up the school if the leader luis <UNK> andrew father isn't released from the american prison but these aren't just ordinary boys that are taken hostage most of these kids are the sons of very powerful people in america and half of them were <UNK> from other schools before they came to saint they're mouths and actions just may get them killed when the government is desperately trying to figure out a way to help billy joey and some more boys decide to take matters into their own hands
<START> for a while when i was in between jobs i had a habit of watching all the late night talk shows for a while i had a good selection conan leno <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br until i reached the 1 30 a m time <UNK> the time between conan and x files on scifi and the only show on at that time was and curiously still is carson <UNK> br br his show intrigued me at first <UNK> casually dressed and with the hip <UNK> of an mtv host i thought carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late night i couldn't have been more wrong br br he has no comedic timing his jokes are <UNK> unfunny and his monologue a painful affair of self conscious <UNK> i began to think he simply wasn't capable of delivering comedy and i am right he isn't but it became obvious over time that the writers on the show must have had it in for him the writing was idiotic and much too <UNK> and the skits <UNK> bad and towards the end of the show being in studio the writers had carson drinking alcohol on the set with gusto on every show an oblivious carson <UNK> from <UNK> cheek to <UNK> cheek as he <UNK> his way through interviews br br zero interview skills none he tries to be friendly <UNK> but ends up being <UNK> and rude he talks too much he cuts off his guests he asks them rude or embarrassing questions if he can find a question to ask them at all and as someone had already pointed out the guests literally stare at him or <UNK> in their seats clearly uncomfortable br br now the show has left the studio and looks as though it were shot on one handy <UNK> even still carson refuses to take the hint from nbc at one point carson didn't even get a camera man he had to film himself for an episode wake up carson that <UNK> is all over the wall br br i see the show is produced by carson i can only imagine that is the reason it is still on the air he pays for it himself
<START> i recently was lucky enough to see the <UNK> runner in a small theater surrounded by seasoned movie goers who knew how to enjoy a masterpiece of such sophistication with all the controversy surrounding this film's central scene these days i was expecting a piece both crude and violent but the way mr <UNK> handled the delicate subject was touching and really deeply moving even though the film's credits <UNK> china as the main location for the shoot i could have <UNK> i was seeing <UNK> throughout the scenes which are meant to be taking place in afghanistan the acting by non professionals as well as professional actors is excellent and the casting is magnificent so this is a movie i would see again and again because though it is undeniably sad in its subject the masterful way it has been made <UNK> a whole new hope in modern cinema
<START> with all of its technical flash the 1993 <UNK> movie is very disappointing before watching it i had read non fiction accounts of the <UNK> campaign and had seen a lot of documentary footage and photographs of the actual battle and its participants i don't think that any movie can really succeed in depicting the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred but i still wanted to see what a relatively recent german movie production would be like while there are a few good elements of this movie overall it is a failure to me the worst aspect is that it includes substantial <UNK> and also some very contrived and clichéd elements most <UNK> in some encounters between a german officer and a soviet woman br br also there are some <UNK> elements in the movie which result in very distorted <UNK> including what amounts to a caricature of a german <UNK> some overblown class <UNK> messages and <UNK> depictions of good vs bad germans certainly the german armed forces of world war ii included men who were able to maintain some decency throughout the war and others who did very bad things but the attempts in the movie to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish i give <UNK> credit in the sense that it doesn't completely portray german troops in the simple demonic quality which is the stereotype that many people now have yet the movie includes stereotypes of its own such as an almost too good to be true <UNK> who has attitudes more akin to the 1990's than the 1940's and two completely evil <UNK> and a rear <UNK> officer br br some recent movies such as <UNK> and saving private ryan are frequently praised for their authenticity in depicting graphic scenes of combat yet these same movies are deeply flawed and distorted in their depictions of the attitudes values and <UNK> of 1940's soldiers and civilians <UNK> and s p r have major and minor characters who lack the <UNK> that was common among regular people during the world war ii period certainly soldiers throughout history have been notorious for their frequent <UNK> and occasional cynicism yet the self absorbed talky and <UNK> <UNK> characters in both of these movies are something else and are much more prevalent in our world of today than they were in the 1940's while many people these days like to <UNK> war movies from the 40's and 50's which present more patriotic messages and aren't as graphic about combat many of those earlier movies such as <UNK> are much more accurate in their depictions of typical <UNK> attitudes and they are often successful in showing the horrible effects of war in more <UNK> ways br br one well done part of <UNK> is a battle between german <UNK> and soviet tanks which does a reasonable job of capturing some of the horror and confusion in such combat br br <UNK> does a poor job though of showing the common look of the <UNK> soldier part of this might be due to the difficulty in finding thin <UNK> looking extras in our <UNK> and well fed america and western europe of today also too many of the german troops in the movie don't wear their uniforms and equipment properly and don't display the professional bearing that was common in the german <UNK> even during the years of german defeat if you want to get a good idea of how the actual german troops looked i recommend the following documentaries which contain footage of the <UNK> campaign the world at war war of the century and <UNK> war also the books operation <UNK> in photographs by paul carell <UNK> by geoffrey and <UNK> by paul carell contain a great many helpful photos books written about the battle by <UNK> and william craig are recommended also and the latter one is especially good about the common soldiers and civilians on both sides br br relatively recent movies which in my opinion are much better than <UNK> and saving private ryan in depicting attitudes and characters of persons during world war ii and the general feel look horror and <UNK> of that war are der <UNK> the downfall and the winter war while a bridge too far and the longest day cover events on the western front rather than in the east they are also excellent war movies and stick very close to factual accounts the latter two movies lack some of the <UNK> that is more prevalent in more recent films but they compensate for that lack with their other strengths including <UNK>
<START> down at the movie gallery i saw a flick i just had to see it looked like a fun low budget horror action western that i could get into yeah i knew it would suck but i rented it anyway hoping for laughs only a few laughs were to be found this was an extremely stupid movie it begins with a bounty hunter our protagonist who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film he looks acts like he could take on chuck norris but he can't his dialogue sucks too anyway he goes into a village shoots some zombies you could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where he takes 3 5 minutes to <UNK> or watch some zombies at least the zombies look cool so anyway some people get shot some zombies die and in the end everyone is dead except our main character who should have died at the beginning when he was shot down by four people
<START> what a script what a story what a mess
<START> this is the second addition to frank personally produced trilogy of oz films it's essentially the same <UNK> as in the other two pictures although i consider it <UNK> to the others because it's shorter as in the other films there are performers in animal costumes an adult woman pretends to be a boy and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera work is static this time at the centre is a magic cloak that <UNK> wishes and the boy played by a woman is made a king br br most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning <UNK> are represented by multiple exposure photography and there's a man in the moon that looks just like those made by georges years before most <UNK> in voyage <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading <UNK> of early cinema and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this <UNK> oz series
<START> admittedly you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it sci fi and thats enough to get me interested so if you are like that black horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it the best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a <UNK> launch br br the movie plays like the naked gun series <UNK> cop dramas with bad clichés and bad acting unfortunately i don't think they meant to be funny the actors really are made of cardboard the dialog really does suck so well just have to laugh at them and not with them br br on a side note it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space half on earth and doesn't mix in the expected <UNK> and supernatural events i really do <UNK> for more realistic drama based on our space <UNK>
<START> i will just start with some quotes from other reviewers that describes it the best br br this is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and probably the worst film tarantino has ever done the only good thing in this movie was the performance of mr <UNK> br br so i was really disappointed and seeing this movie on place 40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this that leaves me with my mouth opened now for more details go and read hated it reviews br br one thing i hate about a movie is when it treats audience as bunch of dumb people spoiler ahead now i know <UNK> style is based on fantasy and <UNK> plots but come on <UNK> hitler and 200 top nazis officers will be in <UNK> of a movie <UNK> in occupied france and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the surroundings where also an american african walks around <UNK> with steel <UNK> <UNK> doors and setting fire these 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 heroes to <UNK> hitler at point blank with around 100 rounds very dumb at least challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared <UNK> of all time go watch <UNK> besides mike myers <UNK> of a british general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing hitler just picture that br br what ruined it further is that the only smart and powerful character which nailed everyone in the movie with his psychological and mind <UNK> <UNK> ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie br br after watching the movie i was <UNK> with nazis who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our <UNK> imagine that br br my <UNK> if you have insomnia <UNK> 33 min to waste or you want to give your mind a break go watch this movie
<START> i have recently watched this film and have decided to comment on it br br the best way to watch this film is to not expect what you have seen in the past by miyazaki miyazaki is well known for his work on on spirited away and <UNK> moving castle well for western viewers anyway both of them films were kind of similar to each other but at the same time completely different however is a whole different type of story and animation all together br br the story follows a fish that has the face a girl after runs away from her home at the bottom of the sea she find a whole new world she never knew was out there and new trouble as well when she almost caught by a fishing boat she was rescued by a five year old boy known as br br the story then follows the two of them and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish can really stay with forever br br i feel the movie was inspired by the little mermaid and at the same time similar to no <UNK> br br the movie is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie but the characters a fish and a little boy so how much are you expecting to learn about them the film is set over about what seems to be 3 days i think this is why the movie is so short br br i really enjoyed watching this movie and i hope you all enjoy this movie as well
<START> not even the beatles could write songs everyone liked and although walter hill is no <UNK> top he's second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies the nineties came and social <UNK> were changing in music and film the <UNK> of the <UNK> turned movie star was in full swing the acting took a back seat to each man's <UNK> <UNK> accent and transparent acting this was one of the many ice t movies i saw as a kid and loved only to watch them later and cringe bill paxton and william <UNK> are <UNK> with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold <UNK> i hand it to walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location but i fault everyone involved for turning out lame o performances ice t and cube must have been red hot at this time and while i've enjoyed both their careers as <UNK> in my opinion they fell flat in this movie it's about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief now this is a movie its not a documentary so i wont waste my time <UNK> all the stupid plot twists in this movie but there were many and they led nowhere i got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was of confused and just playing things off the <UNK> there are two things i still enjoy about it one involves a scene with a <UNK> and the other is huge 45 pistol bottom line this movie is like <UNK> pizza yeah ill eat it if i'm hungry and i don't feel like cooking but i'm well aware it tastes like crap 3 stars <UNK>
<START> i feel the heat i feel your beat something ain't right theme song written by b j cook from david <UNK> old band and wife she also wrote the memorable theme from <UNK> <UNK> oh night heat what a program well written well acted and totally classic crime and a good team and a dash of humour at the end i'd like to think this is really what detectives do did was a real favourite on a canadian tip i learned every canadian actor's name and style from guest spots done on night heat everyone passed through the night heat set and like law order it was story driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama
<START> this was made in that beloved age known as the 80s and shot in my hometown of new york city actually this has become one of my favorite b sci fi movies oh sure it really stinks to high hell but there's so much to make fun of laugh and enjoy that it becomes more tolerable after every viewing br br such as br br try to find the similarities between this and well ok there is nothing similarly bad as this well except castle of br br <UNK> puppets can be dangerous to your health br br create by describing through voice over rather than showing any imagery br br have leading <UNK> <UNK> played wonderfully by deliver some of the most riveting lines ever br br lots of men and women in post apocalyptic fashion aka leather <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and dead animal fur br br do be horrified by the end br br i'm off to have a <UNK>
<START> the title is a reference to the destruction of the <UNK> of a <UNK> like rice <UNK> by <UNK> who burn them creating fires on the <UNK> this is a bleak tale of the destruction of the japanese soldier br br the story is set in the closing days of the <UNK> campaign as a soldier with <UNK> who returns from a hospital because since he can walk they have no room for him his superior officers don't want him around since he's really too sick to work or fight abused by his officer he's sent back to the hospital with orders to either be admitted or kill himself they still won't take him and he's soon left to wander across the war <UNK> landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food its a bleak journey with no hope in sight and only death and man's <UNK> to man at every turn br br billed as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war this is also a very funny movie this isn't to say its not horrifying it is at times but its also darkly comic how could it not be here is a film where madness and insanity run rampant people are constantly trying to <UNK> <UNK> leaves for food trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes trying to remain a japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by <UNK> constantly but never getting anywhere and you can't help but laugh to be sure things go darker as it becomes clear that <UNK> maybe literally and <UNK> the only way to survive but at the same time there is something <UNK> funny about the human comedy br br <UNK> as a great anti war film its stark <UNK> style makes clear the insanity of war even as it <UNK> our eye with its beauty here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the <UNK> set amid fields <UNK> and trees that would otherwise be and to some extent still are quite beautiful its a jarring sensation br br what intriguing is that i read that this is based on a novel about the <UNK> power of christianity the director removed all over the religious references to hope and salvation and instead used it as to show that life stinks war stinks worse and that there is ultimately no hope br br intellectually i admire the film emotionally i don't part of it is a <UNK> downbeat score which for me over <UNK> what we are seeing on the screen its almost <UNK> the lily since the imagery is so strong it doesn't really need to have the music force you into feeling one way or another br br is it a great film thats for you to decide for certain its unlike any other war film bloody horrific and real in ways that big budgeted films claim to be but never are this is not for those <UNK> to blood and gore since its here in <UNK> br br definitely worth a look
<START> i always liked this movie i have seen it so many times but i always enjoyed it the story is interesting and special but the only thing i have to disagree with is that i don't think max lived in a romanian monastery or what was that p they don't look that way in romania anyway back to the story played pretty well but as someone said before me his english needs to improve br br and there were some funny moments and some <UNK> sad parts too it <UNK> being seen i thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love i recommended to you all it's not the best movie ever but it was nice
<START> firstly the title has no relevance whatsoever to the movie it started off fine with good development but got annoying when he couldn't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him even his attempt to tell the police failed which just added to the annoyance value there were too many pregnant pauses in the movie that seemed more like filler than anything worthwhile the plot never revealed who did this crime to him although a good plot would have allowed <UNK> the ending was nothing short of hey we've run out of budget let's stop it here now if i'd written a novel that ended this way i'd top myself trash trash trash
<START> i of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other <UNK> gate <UNK> so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing and it is to a point a young college student sarah is finding <UNK> all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them and in doing so she's <UNK> becoming involved in some game now that's fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer like myself will most likely become frustrated characters appear with little introduction and you're not really sure who they are or why sarah knows them or is hanging out with them all of this has something to do with this woman who tried to <UNK> a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that it's all part of the design in reality it's all part of the very <UNK> script and when the film is over you'll find yourself feeling that you've lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more <UNK> uses of your time like cleaning the bathroom for instance 4 out of 10
<START> that was a waste of 9 dollars the movie was terrible all the scary parts were pointless and sadly repetitive seemingly all of the tense parts could be completely predicted and did not seem to hold any bit of the audiences attention also the plot line didn't advance at all during the entire movie and it was all just a big setup for the grudge 3 when it seemed like the movie was about to make a big plot <UNK> it turned out just to be a pointless scene these directors need to follow hitchcock's example every scene has a point 90 of the scenes in this movie could have been left out with no change of the plot final opinion don't waste your time energy or money
<START> everything this film tried to do is done better and superbly in run lola run the red haired hip <UNK> the critical <UNK> s the lover in <UNK> and the crime pays sometimes message but unlike lola it just isn't believable or well put together it is a <UNK> knock off that might have worked for me if i had seen it before lola but it <UNK> in comparison yes the falling beetle was nice but that was about the only surprise in the film do yourself a favor and see the real mccoy and the real hip red head in run lola run
<START> the dvd version released by crash cinema was very poorly done the <UNK> engineer must have been either drunk asleep or not even in the room while it was being done it looks like it was <UNK> from about a <UNK> generation copy and about halfway through the film the audio <UNK> disappears the dialog is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the audio if you're thinking about <UNK> this dvd please save your money i remember seeing this film at the theater back in 1973 also the vhs copy of this film under the title of when <UNK> strikes looks better than the dvd but the remaining several minutes of the movie are missing where is the original camera negative
<START> <UNK> remains one of the best hollywood message movies because unlike the admirably <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which it beat to theatres by a few months it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an <UNK> star constantly saying it's because i'm jewish isn't it it's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than <UNK> somewhat <UNK> the brief <UNK> on the <UNK> dvd doesn't mention that novelist richard brooks <UNK> the film over the shift from a <UNK> murder to an anti <UNK> one but it's interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish there's little doubt in sam <UNK> performance that the character is in fact also gay  not a <UNK> caricature but there's definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george <UNK> confused soldier there's not much of a mystery to who the murderer is even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows the body language of the killer is instantly <UNK> but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy br br there's an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers <UNK> together to get their buddy out of a fix you could almost see that aspect as a <UNK> for <UNK> and cry but the atmosphere is pure rko noir set over one long <UNK> night the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward more time to work with the actors and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script a laid back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum robert <UNK> like detective gloria <UNK> tramp and the <UNK> creepy paul kelly as her <UNK> liar admirer a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties but the lasting impression is of robert <UNK> excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row a big surprise hit in 1946 as a reward and producer adrian scott found themselves <UNK> by the <UNK> which itself had a notable tendency to target jews so much for
<START> i love comedies and i love independent films but this was much too slow and the humor was extremely <UNK> i guess it would have been better if the main characters were likeable but they were just typical gen x <UNK> types just like the people that have been causing trouble in high schools for forty years i can understand high praise for a young indie film maker when it is deserving but this is an extremely average film
<START> the beginning might be a spoiler br br the eye 2 is the sequel to the eye it's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her br br the sound effects scared the hell out of me though <UNK> but that's the only scary thing some of the scenes from the prequel are <UNK> similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have <UNK> br br the eye has quite a frightening and <UNK> impression whereas the eye 2 is a forgettable horror <UNK> drama film <UNK> watching this watching the eye is good enough
<START> i generally loved the carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful there are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced there is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others june <UNK> kenneth williams <UNK> and peter <UNK> are fine but barbara <UNK> looks tired and sid james is just tacky joan <UNK> comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful charles <UNK> its just plain sad when you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch the <UNK> of the movie is nasty and its a very unpleasant experience the set looks cheap and unlike other movies in the series the movie is very clearly set in england the sea side looks cold and there is little attempt to create any <UNK> here it looks like a cheap production you will be surprised at how miserable you become watching this especially if you loved the series
<START> in the <UNK> summer of 1958 the <UNK> a gang of brooklyn <UNK> find their <UNK> threatened when the leader of a rival gang the <UNK> is released from prison leon stephen <UNK> the leader tries to guide his boys through bloody <UNK> to keep the <UNK> out but when his brother brad falls into a <UNK> and dangerous relationship with annie <UNK> <UNK> the sister of a <UNK> and his own girlfriend is brutally attacked leon and his gang are <UNK> into an all out war to save his brother his girl and his neighborhood according to the dvd <UNK> description this is definitely no basketball <UNK> br br think of it as west side story getting hit over the head with baseball bats and steel <UNK> having left brooklyn with the <UNK> <UNK> wild has some cool hollywood sets 1950s cars and soundtrack songs and much of it is nicely photographed by john a <UNK> the story and direction never get beyond these strengths which <UNK> the film to peak during its opening minutes and proceed downhill the cast looks good when you read the credits but <UNK> into an <UNK> <UNK> mess of phony blood and and one fright wig a sense of sadness and regret <UNK> the production br br <UNK> wild 5 3 <UNK> scott stephen <UNK> brad <UNK> <UNK> frankie
<START> the first feature length adventure of jim <UNK> beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as <UNK> the frog leaves his <UNK> <UNK> surroundings for the bright lights <UNK> on by stranded hollywood agent dom <UNK> who <UNK> him singing on the way he meets <UNK> bear a pitiful stand up comedian at james <UNK> el <UNK> who has telly <UNK> for a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> the piano playing dog <UNK> <UNK> drummer animal and his laid back funky band <UNK> beauty queen miss <UNK> in a ceremony <UNK> over by elliott <UNK> and edgar <UNK> etc all the while <UNK> et al are pursued by <UNK> <UNK> charles <UNK> and reluctant <UNK> austin <UNK> sold cars ice cream and <UNK> to by respectively <UNK> <UNK> bob hope and richard <UNK> served food by <UNK> <UNK> steve martin nearly <UNK> by mad german scientist mel brooks and finally land an audition in the <UNK> of movie <UNK> orson welles who has <UNK> <UNK> for a secretary the pleasant song score comes courtesy of paul williams who also makes an appearance as the resident <UNK> at el for the record i have recently acquired four of the subsequent muppet movies and should be watching them in the weeks to come when their turn falls due
<START> this is not direct <UNK> as a matter of fact it is its opposite second installment of filmmaker gypsy trilogy this french work produced by <UNK> ray <UNK> is a film masterpiece not pure documentary no fiction by any means instead has chosen different locations of the route from india to spain wherever the <UNK> people have a strong presence and with the help of art directors he has staged several musical numbers that tell us how the <UNK> live sing dance struggle and have survived the movie may have strong opposition from those who question the <UNK> that the <UNK> tribe is of indian origin mostly challenged by those who see a direct link with the <UNK> so in a way it comes as no surprise that they were also <UNK> by the nazis but above any <UNK> argument this is a work of great beauty strong colors and wonderful singing and dancing
<START> it must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened br br the is <UNK> by such a miserable <UNK> amoral <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> group of characters as can be imagined everyone is stabbing someone in the back everyone is attempting to commit adultery everyone is trying to cheat someone that or they are being stabbed <UNK> or <UNK> nobody is cheerful nobody laughs nobody has a <UNK> stroke of luck or a really nice day it's hell with cockney accents br br i suspect this programme must be <UNK> by the it's perfect viewing for the depressed it doesn't cheer them up what it does do is present a whole community of such <UNK> <UNK> sad <UNK> that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse they might be living in br br apart from the above as a representation of <UNK> east end it is pure <UNK> the programme makers have evidently never been across town the first thing you encounter on the mile end road is a <UNK> <UNK> and this pretty well <UNK> the racial majority of the population white british <UNK> are a <UNK> and rapidly <UNK> minority a large <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> near the bow road and <UNK> by tower <UNK> health care boasts that out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more ten healthy smiling faces <UNK> down at the <UNK> in <UNK> eight of them are dark skinned br br what's more i used to work with a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> dare i say <UNK> a few years ago and i can tell you that a more <UNK> racist experience i've never had each day was like an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they couldn't pass 5 minutes without <UNK> some other race or <UNK> than their own and in terms that were repulsive and obscene and were the small change of conversation in fact their entire and extremely limited stock of <UNK> <UNK> upon sex organs and their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was a <UNK> of liberal virtue in comparison br br any programme that <UNK> to represent <UNK> native east end <UNK> in their true nature would be completely <UNK> for broadcast even after the 9 o clock <UNK> imagine a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> script written by quentin tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark but when they weren't being <UNK> <UNK> they were at least extremely cheerful br br i don't know how such a soap opera came to be this imaginary <UNK> island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever and if you're of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it will quickly <UNK> you to tears of grief <UNK> ordinary actors pretending to be <UNK> ordinary <UNK> with cockney accents what's the point of that br br dull dreary <UNK> and <UNK> preposterous the most popular programme of an apparently <UNK> and dying nation br br avoid it like the plague
<START> having seen other bollywood flicks with salman khan in them i can say this is my favorite of the more recent ones the songs are all quite fun especially <UNK> <UNK> o which seems to have a nice mix of beatles indian music and dare i say this a bit of prince the love stories are a bit more believable than say <UNK> mere <UNK> the occasional focus on use of alcohol is at times <UNK> as it doesn't really seem to make sense to me but it's played well by khan although his voice does become <UNK> when he's portraying <UNK>
<START> i never thought i would <UNK> hate an arnold <UNK> film but this is is dreadful from the get go there <UNK> one <UNK> scene in the entire <UNK> long minutes an absolute waste of time br br thank <UNK> br br jay harris
<START> some time ago i saw this when hbo was showing it and from what i saw of it it seemed like a good movie so i'm in blockbuster today and i see it there with the dvd's and i decide what the hell so i rent it after i finished watching it i was in shock of how good it was br br this movie just touched my heart everything in it was so amazing the stories the actors the dark humor the music oh don't get me started on the music in this film <UNK> is one of the <UNK> definitely the best thing to come out since quentin tarantino a god br br after i finished the first viewing i watched it again with <UNK> commentary i was <UNK> on how such a cool guy he is br br anybody who is interested in movies at all should watch this movie if they haven't already anderson is obviously a film lover in the movie he rips off so many other directors such as the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water obviously ripped off from i am cuba but i have no <UNK> what so ever with that the film is very respectable with it's br br i <UNK> this film to anybody who can deal with some of the content of the film porn br br 10 10
<START> the idea behind this movie was great the story of a little girl facing abuse both emotional and physical and trying to deal with it and survive what makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and the corny dialog the actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again also there is very tedious almost funny <UNK> of <UNK> in the voice overs the high point is the acting of the little girl nice try but this one's a stinker
<START> this film is much the same as cannibal holocaust if it weren't for the needless animal killing in the name of <UNK> <UNK> look at us we're hardcore we've added real death to our films these films would make their way onto my dusty classics shelf i'm a huge fan of cannibal films and zombies but as it stands it's another example of shock horror <UNK> at the last <UNK> of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor film generate more hype to sum up a <UNK> gore flick with limited appeal a fan of 70's gore should give this a try but anyone with modern <UNK> and tastes should pick something a little better written for their popcorn fest
<START> william <UNK> that c s i guy has a small uncredited role but it's the best part of the movie his character comes across smart ass and tough and it's a fun surprise to see him in this he has a range that allows him to play just about anything after his 5 minutes it goes from looking cool to just nothing much it leaves you hoping that his character will <UNK> in the movie but after 20 minutes you give up hope the movie itself is pretty poor worth a watch on or a pick up at the library but not much more too much of it reminds you of l a <UNK> except that where that movie starts to get complicated upon itself this one is so loose it <UNK> everywhere but where it should 2 out of 5 stars
<START> it is a nice comedy it has the great features of the childhood lying or trying to get away from own generated troubles the casting is great great acting and the special effects well some stunts are really impressive watch it
<START> the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show but as a movie it doesn't work in the same way br br don't get me wrong this is a very funny movie full of biting witty dialogue that caricatures the modern british wonderfully well whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious if unrealistic story br br one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant or it's embarrassing to watch when i say embarrassing i don't mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras but rather you'll wish they hadn't included it in the final cut one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended to the tune of this is how we do it whenever i watch the film i stop the dvd when it says the end and leave it at that br br overall ali g is a good film worth watching a couple of times the script is enjoyable to an extent and there are no issues as far as acting goes however <UNK> is the key word here br br ali g is a better television programme <UNK> is a better film
<START> of so many excellent and so on in one particularly <UNK> <UNK> out of them all <UNK> me so thoroughly that it ends up being the terrific moment of the movie for me br br or at least the one that tends to drive <UNK> people to see the film <UNK> the disc in hand for emphasis br br the existing vague abstract <UNK> of the fairly simple and <UNK> guilt involved in the guilty pleasure of this may truly <UNK> and <UNK> me into paying the intellectual bill eventually br br till then br br the demise of the <UNK> was so right on
<START> the <UNK> is a strange work among clint eastwood's <UNK> by 1971 he had become well known as the star of action movies not only westerns the genre in which he first made his name but also war films such as where <UNK> dare and cop thrillers such as <UNK> <UNK> yet although the <UNK> takes place during wartime the american civil war and was made by don <UNK> who had earlier directed eastwood in <UNK> <UNK> and was later the same year to direct him in dirty harry it is not an action film in the traditional sense in most of his previous films eastwood had played an active role but here his role is largely passive his character sergeant john is a wounded fugitive forced to rely upon the charity of women in order to survive even while serving with his unit played no active part in the conflict he is a whose religious principles <UNK> him to bear arms and was serving with the union forces as a medical <UNK> br br the film is set in <UNK> towards the end of the war and starts with the injured being discovered by a young girl named amy and brought back to her <UNK> school the school is a small one with only two teachers and a handful of girls although some of the girls are <UNK> supporters of the <UNK> cause and want to hand him over to the authorities the <UNK> martha farnsworth decides to shelter him and tend him <UNK> that his <UNK> are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the <UNK> harsh prison camps br br although <UNK> follows the <UNK> of his religion as regards <UNK> he is not so <UNK> when it comes to following its <UNK> on the sin of <UNK> and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls and he wins the affections of number of them including miss farnsworth her assistant <UNK> and carol one of the older girls even twelve year old amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him in the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred and miss farnsworth rejected in favour of the <UNK> carol plots a terrible revenge interestingly the one female to resist <UNK> is <UNK> miss <UNK> black slave even though he tries to win her round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her br br the <UNK> has been described as an anti war film but this seems to me to be a <UNK> the film is not really about the rights and <UNK> of the civil war or of war in general the only acts of violence we see are <UNK> by non <UNK> and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge not by <UNK> for the <UNK> cause it would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological <UNK> that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war br br at the beginning the school set in a beautiful old <UNK> mansion seems like an island of peace amid the war the building is in the classical style associated with order harmony and restraint but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder passion and violence qualities associated with the gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the <UNK> of <UNK> the film can be seen as falling within what has been called the southern gothic tradition in american film and literature br br the film was not a great hit at the box office possibly because eastwood was cast so much against type it is not perhaps his best film but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes in play misty for me his first film as director made the following year he was again to play a passive character in danger from a <UNK> female there are some very good performances from the female members of the cast particularly <UNK> page as martha farnsworth <UNK> a respectable middle aged <UNK> but <UNK> a woman of strong passions there are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother there are also good <UNK> from elizabeth <UNK> as the shy repressed <UNK> who falls in love with and rejects the idea of revenge and from young <UNK> <UNK> as amy amy is an animal lover a key moment in the film comes when kills her pet turtle so it is interesting that in later life <UNK> became an animal rights <UNK> the one character i was less keen on was jo ann <UNK> carol who seemed too modern like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the <UNK> the film is notable for the emotionally intense <UNK> atmosphere which <UNK> brings to it this will not be a film which is to everyone's taste some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic and some have found it misogynistic <UNK> called it a film for woman <UNK> and <UNK> others however may find it a compelling psychological drama 7 10
<START> after all the hype i had heard about the jane austin novel and different film versions of the book i found myself very disappointed with the movie i had expected a classic drama but that was not the case first of all let me <UNK> my review with the fact that i love old movies particularly mysteries and dramas but not female oriented movies this probably makes a huge difference so take my review with a large grain of salt i thought the acting was a bit over the top but that is very common in movies of this era june <UNK> was good as jo but i found every sister to be stereotypical and form driven there were no surprises or overly dramatic moments i hate writing negative reviews but the movie left me very cold it has always been my intention to read the book but after this that seem unlikely the only warming story line was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister that was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience again there are others who love this movie i'm just not one of them
<START> one of our all time family favorites when we need a laugh we just put this one in and laugh all way thru like it is the first time we've seen it this film has good clean family humor <UNK> shore is brilliant with no plans for the <UNK> holiday crawl shore is invited to spend the holiday with a conservative <UNK> crawl being a big city boy must <UNK> to the farm life if he is to fall in love with but crawl isn't the only one who is learning new things crawl teaches and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accepting others this is fun for viewers of all ages
<START> i rented this because i couldn't pass up the chance to see pre hollywood fame clive owen and catherine zeta jones together but it definitely wasn't worth it the only reason i give it two stars instead of one is for the novelty of seeing them before they made it big across the pond br br zeta jones who is usually fun to watch even if she isn't the greatest <UNK> in the world is awful owen seems really uncomfortable to be in such a turkey plus he wears a ridiculous ill fitting <UNK> length wig at least i hope that's a wig and not his real hair and the scene where he dances a country <UNK> with zeta jones just makes you embarrassed for him joan <UNK> walks around in a <UNK> the whole movie she's probably wondering how she got herself into such a mess br br the actress who plays clive <UNK> wife isn't terrible but just about everyone else is oh and the writing stinks too
<START> although the acting was excellent i spent the whole movie waiting for the nasty boy who caused so much grief to so many of the characters get his final nemesis and instead everyone else suffered except him and he gets the job of the husband whose wife's death he causes by running away from his friends wins the girl he gave an <UNK> to and tried to rape even his friend gives money to his father but the <UNK> effect completely fails to return to its cause br br this is a very dark film as each character that gets affected suffers never ending depression none of the normal <UNK> for relief seem to be effective and the only thing the authorities seem to do is give out <UNK> of stress <UNK> br br if this is normal behaviour in <UNK> now i'm never going to go back just in case i am affected by such an amoral <UNK> and end up as destroyed as the characters in this film were
<START> perhaps this movie was meant to be nothing but funny maybe it was meant to get teenage boys excited at all the nudity in it but what i got out of it was actually something that many people believe in and that is nice guys finish last br br there is a line in angel heart from lisa <UNK> character that says it takes a bad ass to make a girls heart beat faster true most likely women always say that they want the flowers and the candy and <UNK> and whatever but at least at an early age they end up going for the good looking slimy <UNK> <UNK> guy the one they know they can't <UNK> to their beliefs and that is part of the attraction after all what is exciting about a guy that is already the way you want him to be i believe this may have happened to <UNK> <UNK> and what he has to say in this film that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything else that teens can relate to is that you will get your heart broken it happens to everyone and it will happen to you and that is a strong final statement in the film but having said all that the movie is fun it is funny and it shows the antics of <UNK> quite well br br this is a rare film that is enough to please the teenage crowd it <UNK> to but also intelligent and poignant enough to show what it s like to get your heart broken no <UNK> film has ever done this better like i said i think the writers must have experienced a situation like this first hand maybe we all have br br this is an old film but if you ever come across it gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night pick it up you may be surprised it is a hell of a lot better than never been <UNK>
<START> truly awful nonsensical garbage this movie does everything wrong except make the running time under an hour the gore fx defy gravity logic there are no scares the acting is abysmal with everyone appearing to be reading their lines there's a surprise ending that's just silly where we find out that things we saw happen didn't even happen boy do i hate cop out endings they pad this thing out with long drawn out shots of people doing nothing interesting like putting on make up or talking for what seems like forever they have to pad out a movie that's under an hour long ridiculous the story itself is pretty <UNK> thin i mean it's just a variation of the movie april <UNK> day if i remember that movie correctly and that film wasn't all that great either the only good thing i can say is it seems to have been shot well too bad nothing happens that's very exciting
<START> as a longtime admirer of the 2001 film <UNK> <UNK> and a more recent admirer of jean <UNK> film making i knew that i'd inevitably watch his french <UNK> sooner or later the movie tells a <UNK> story of the opening of the <UNK> <UNK> nightclub the <UNK> jean <UNK> tries to turn <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into a <UNK> star without <UNK> the wrath of his <UNK> mistress the belly dancing lola maria felix this is just one of several love <UNK> in french <UNK> true to stereotype these french <UNK> folk are always falling in love br br <UNK> directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful <UNK> song <UNK> featured in the movie <UNK> perfectly the aging french playboy hero is a cute <UNK> who holds her own in the dance numbers except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously used br br french <UNK> is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage etc only one character ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation the actor who plays him <UNK> clay is fun to watch a really tall skinny young man who sings dances and does <UNK> br br the movie ends with a long <UNK> sequence as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together the dancing is much more <UNK> lit and <UNK> edited than in <UNK> <UNK> in fact if i have one complaint about french <UNK> it's that the whole thing is a little too technicolor even when experiences <UNK> or someone sings a melancholy song the lighting is bright and flat no shadows <UNK> yes the result is a cheerful and <UNK> musical comedy it's just that i can't help thinking that things weren't ever this colorful and innocent in real life
<START> i really loved this original screenplay and the different places it took me emotionally <UNK> and just plain silly stuff i didn't get caught up in believability in the screenplay or the actors and didn't even think about it until reading the reviews listed here in imdb for the movie listening to michael talk at the q a about his idea of the film wanting to see how crazy people or up people as he put it fall in love is really interesting i identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing <UNK> at it's best i like watching david in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now i believe this is some of his best work and say to anyone just see this film to watch an amazing young actor i agree that <UNK> <UNK> really was a scene <UNK> and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in commitment i laughed and cried both in this movie and was disappointed that it didn't win any awards at the festival i question why that didn't happen i gave max and grace a ten because these interesting unique creative indie films deserve an audience technically watching this film it's really beautifully done  the colors are amazing and lastly it's one of the best <UNK> i have heard in a film in awhile
<START> <UNK> incident has to be one of the strangest westerns i've ever seen not good but definitely strange br br a driver less <UNK> rides into the town of christian <UNK> with all passengers killed it's <UNK> to go on but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the on the <UNK> out there but linda <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and ward bond each have their reasons for going on and <UNK> robertson who killed john <UNK> in a <UNK> after <UNK> and skip shot and left him for dead in the desert is so anxious to go he's willing to drive the team br br of course the attack the <UNK> group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover who will live and who will die is the remainder of the film br br <UNK> incident came at the very end of republic pictures before herbert j <UNK> pulled the plug on his little studio westerns were their <UNK> but normally of the kind roy rogers made this would not have been a rogers product br br in fact it's beyond belief the characters aren't ground in any kind of reality <UNK> <UNK> is taking back <UNK> <UNK> from his claim but robertson discovers it's iron <UNK> gold <UNK> is a guitar playing <UNK> who goes mad from <UNK> <UNK> is after a cheating manager of <UNK> but really doesn't know what to do when she finds him <UNK> is looking to bring in robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for but has to bring him in alive for that he'd require help but doesn't have any br br but the worst is ward bond who's a united states senator on his own peace mission to the in real life bond was a most right wing individual and i'm not sure this wasn't some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal he's really quite the <UNK> fool but i think that might have attracted him to the role br br i tried to get into <UNK> incident but couldn't and the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least br br give it three stars for the cast involved
<START> in his <UNK> of <UNK> card <UNK> in hollywood <UNK> a vacation in <UNK> he never took and free <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> by columbia pictures br br it sounds <UNK> but <UNK> gray possibly because of his unusual personality <UNK> the audience in laughs at himself perhaps because he did not take the hollywood thing oh so seriously and gets us to care br br this monologue is not just about the killing fields or swimming to cambodia it is more a <UNK> of events as he sees them some of the lines are classic as when gray meets with the <UNK> talent agents at the <UNK> table is full of them <UNK> healthy fresh from drinking blue green <UNK> from an <UNK> lake there are no drugs now in hollywood br br this was before the tragedy occurred many of us will miss his off balance humor 9 10
<START> this movie is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse the daughters perfectly express their <UNK> emotions of affection and betrayal the on location scenery is authentic and the soundtrack is <UNK> yet moving this film is a graduate level course in a reality that's too little recognized in american society personally i'm freaked out by the names of the characters <UNK> character is <UNK> cook smith my name is connie cook smith and my mom is cook the youngest daughter is caroline cook which is my sister's name and the father is larry cook my <UNK> name but sex abuse was not in our immediate family
<START> this film is terrible honestly the acting is terrible the script made me cringe the effects are completely lousy which i usually don't mind for older films but this was made just two years ago and everything about it just <UNK> me a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son of course before that it has the cliché you really believe that ha ha ha it's just a story routine dragged out for a while the <UNK> cannibal son was made a <UNK> i don't know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy but this film failed at both it has minimal gore and no nudity which made a bad film even worse heck the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene and even that could of been better br br honestly don't even waste your time watching it on cable and certainly don't consider buying or renting this else you'll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more <UNK> or entertaining
<START> it starts out looking like it may be going somewhere then quickly leads the main characters into a three ring circus of remarkable stupidity which <UNK> destroys any <UNK> of the characters i'm a huge collector of <UNK> movies but this is something i would not consider a valid addition <UNK> water is trash from the very deepest <UNK> of the <UNK> and i wouldn't be caught dead with this on my shelf i'm actually convinced this movie was created by a <UNK> for a drug free america if you're a jack black fan then i would say that you may think 5 minutes of the movies is ok because jack black continues his legacy of singing songs for <UNK> i really can't say enough bad things about this movie
<START> after the failure of <UNK> iii hell on earth the chapter that served as a kind of <UNK> to the franchise another embarrassing <UNK> cash in did not come as a surprise an abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of <UNK> and the puzzle box covering literally centuries of history in a film that runs under 90 minutes on display is sub par to wretched acting par to wretched b movie special effects and a ludicrous and insulting attempt at dark humour while still attempting to keep the whole project completely serious i'm wondering how many freaking directors did this thing have poor <UNK> has so much screen time that every bit of mystery and menace that this iconic character possessed is completely lost after an hour of hearing long <UNK> speeches and dramatic <UNK> we simply want to tell the guy to shut up mildly entertaining in spots especially in the first segment this mess begins to look and feel like a cheap ugly made for tv splatter flick after a while and ends in the most ridiculous way imaginable <UNK> along with his pet dog killing a bunch of idiots in outer space i'm sorry but any true fan of the first two films in the series that gave this abortion of a film more than 3 stars should be ashamed on a side note the film that follows <UNK> <UNK> is actually a surprisingly intelligent and <UNK> made film noir piece that brilliantly as a master of illusion and cruelty and brings back the concept of the inherent evil in human kind that was the <UNK> of the original film and the whole point of the story for any serious horror fan see <UNK> i ii skip the lousy iii this one and continue with ' you won't miss a thing by skipping this garbage
<START> i'm the first to recognize that chan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is exceptionally well made but spending over two hours with <UNK> ok <UNK> kim is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time sang <UNK> ho song is a priest <UNK> to <UNK> for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to <UNK> <UNK> concerning a specific virus which kills <UNK> instead of <UNK> dying becomes a vampire always yearning for the blood gives for him to fight off an <UNK> disease which returns causing the <UNK> which flat <UNK> him to begin with <UNK> <UNK> and the body <UNK> blood <UNK> as is known in the vampire genre causes <UNK> death if exposed to for a length of time falls in lust with <UNK> the wife of <UNK> childhood friend <UNK> woo ha <UNK> shin <UNK> was taken in by mrs <UNK> <UNK> kim regarded as a puppy and practically used as a domestic animal to be ordered around <UNK> is miserable in this situation and begins a <UNK> affair she with soon <UNK> him into perhaps killing <UNK> woo by having him believe she's a victim of abuse his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into the relationship with <UNK> soon a willing <UNK> in killing <UNK> woo this incident which <UNK> woo contributed to using a boat in the middle of a lake both <UNK> to <UNK> him underwater <UNK> woo keeping him <UNK> woo from re <UNK> as he attempted to re enter will haunt both as circumstances <UNK> with <UNK> woo missing got rid of him where police would not find his corpse soon mrs <UNK> suffers a stroke though one finger and the ability to blink her eyes contribute <UNK> as the story progresses showing that she more aware than they are led to believe and gives <UNK> a special birthday gift <UNK> in doing so has created a monster <UNK> admits though a slip of the tongue that in fact <UNK> woo never hurt her and as she for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesn't bother her morally or psychologically <UNK> becomes such a hand full has to take desperate <UNK> if he is to stop such a menace to society himself included br br i will say that <UNK> is one of the best horror films i've seen regarding 2009 it's a <UNK> approach park takes and we are led down a dark road with and <UNK> as they commit terrible deeds with nothing positive ever to come from their <UNK> union innocent people die because of love what once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the end for <UNK> and it will <UNK> to end if he doesn't make a painful choice we see inside their heads their souls and it isn't always pretty 2 hours with them can be quite <UNK> but credit to the director for pulling no punches in regards to <UNK> behavior and how the powers of <UNK> can be given to the wrong people seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening accepts hell for <UNK> so one could look at <UNK> as a unique love story but not exactly a healthy one br br in regards to the violence while park does have a tendency to pull away from extremely graphic details there's enough <UNK> involved to perhaps turn the stomach a bit at the very least the way the violence is carried out may be certain to leave a lasting impact the sexual situations between and <UNK> can be pretty <UNK> and erotic while also <UNK> and morally <UNK> the movie i think is still quite a complex examination of the <UNK> one will go to remain attached to an object of affection lust
<START> not to be confused with the 1943 george <UNK> movie the mad <UNK> the mad monster is a film that <UNK> appeared in the year before in this fairly paint by numbers affair <UNK> <UNK> a way to turn his dim witted <UNK> into a wolf man hybrid by means of <UNK> blood <UNK> and then wastes little time in sending the transformed <UNK> to <UNK> the former colleagues who had <UNK> at his experiments it is a very simple plot really and an extremely low budget production glenn strange who plays the man wolf here would soon achieve greater fame playing the <UNK> monster in films such as house of frankenstein 1944 and <UNK> and <UNK> meet frankenstein 1948 the makeup job on him here is pretty lame and only succeeds in making him look like a <UNK> with bad teeth like the one in <UNK> teenage monster the sets in this film in addition are fairly nonexistent and the denouement is abrupt and unconvincing i have given the movie a very generous 4 stars in part because i have an <UNK> love for 1940s horror films but truth to tell most objective viewers would probably <UNK> it laughable crap and i suppose it is it's certainly no well crafted universal affair or val <UNK> masterpiece that's for sure still <UNK> is always fun to watch even in <UNK> <UNK> such as this if you can spare <UNK> minutes of your life i suppose you could do worse than the mad monster not too much worse of course oh one other thing this dvd is from <UNK> video and you know what that means fuzzy images lousy sound indeed the worst sound of any <UNK> video dvd i've encountered so far and no extras you've been warned
<START> this is undoubtedly the most harrowing black and white war film that i've watched as a matter of fact the only western director during this time to remotely approach its level of intensity and sheer visceral power in his work was samuel fuller by the way i had attended a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> national film theatre in september 2002 but only managed to catch some of his work made between 1960 and 1973 br br the film is certainly as depressing as it's <UNK> to be however it also displays welcome touches of black humor throughout the <UNK> man who wakes up to answer a soldier and promptly again the deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence a <UNK> eccentric telling the hero which part of the body he should eat etc incidentally the script was written by a woman <UNK> the director's own wife br br <UNK> is a versatile and prolific film maker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during his peak years 1956 <UNK> but his direction here is often striking the startling pre credits sequence the hero is violently <UNK> by his superior officer for being <UNK> from hospital earlier than expected the death of a <UNK> japanese at the hands of a gun <UNK> <UNK> woman the bombing of a hospital with the medical staff running away to save themselves leaving the wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the shack at their own limited pace the <UNK> march in the rain of the <UNK> soldiers which also involves the <UNK> mentioned business with the shoes that actually recalls a similar scene in all quiet on the western front 1930 a hill <UNK> with the bodies of soldiers attempting to climb it the finale etc surely one of the film's major <UNK> is the stunning cinematography of the <UNK> and desolate <UNK> landscape br br the film is notorious for treating the taboo subject of <UNK> almost 10 years before it became a <UNK> of horror movies but approach is not only subtle but highly effective the flesh is actually referred to as monkey meat while the hero is seen <UNK> only once and promptly <UNK> out the piece along with most of his <UNK> teeth <UNK> when the weak <UNK> soldier played by mickey curtis who despite his name was a japanese pop idol of the time <UNK> <UNK> the ground nearby is <UNK> with blood br br in the <UNK> <UNK> remembers that method practicing lead actor whose portrayal is unforgettable by the way arrived on the set at <UNK> point with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until he donald <UNK> <UNK> interview <UNK> the <UNK> of the film over the underlying <UNK> behind such gut wrenching recent hollywood fare as saving private ryan 1998 br br fires on the plain is universally considered to be one of its director's top efforts and out of the several films of <UNK> i've watched the closest to it in spirit are the <UNK> <UNK> 1956 another character driven war film but with a spiritual tone and which is also available on dvd from <UNK> and aka <UNK> 1958 which was actually given a limited theatrical showing <UNK> as part of a foreign film week a couple of years ago personally i also have a particular soft spot for the director's stunningly stylized color <UNK> an actor's revenge 1963 which i've actually caught twice at the in 1999 and the <UNK> mentioned 2002 <UNK>
<START> i really liked this movie br br everyone has something to be blamed for everyone is real no heroes or cold <UNK> know all characters br br i read many others viewers here complaining about anne morality and about james will to maintain his love for her despite her cheating on him but i don't agree br br i found anne emily watson absolutely wonderful and i felt love for her br br she was a heavily repressed woman her actions were not planned once she started to break free she was in confusion and did many errors but so it's in real life when you gain freedom you are likely to do errors at the start point br br was she a little too <UNK> maybe but we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time she knows that james after all is a good man maybe a little too stiff serious and work centered but she also feels the urge to live the life as herself br br is she to blame more than him i think no br br but the turn happening into their lives <UNK> some changes br br james instead of letting his wife go out of his life as other viewers suggested as the right choice bites the bullet and waits hoping for the better he starts to understand that what he <UNK> though was ok his marriage in reality was a control game played by him on his wife br br this is not a story with characters having over emotional and <UNK> nature i e the usual <UNK> latin american or italian jealous guys this is a story of men and women that use both heart and brain br br it can be very painful but if you really love a person women or man and if you are not a terribly unstable nature you are likely to forgive his her cheating and let him her go unless you are a jealous <UNK> crime of passion inclined <UNK> and mentally individual br br a really good movie the last scene when james despite all the things happened before goes with anne to the train station is really moving she is free and he understood what freedom means for a person br br <UNK>
<START> a tremendous action movie that i have ever seen it was the first expression that i <UNK> after watching it twice on the local tv in my country <UNK> a combination between a constant shooting and a great fighting choreography played well by david <UNK> he was good here besides american samurai his skill in martial art was performed above average he succeeded to make the fighting scenes nice to watch not only <UNK> and kicking like what most of martial artists show in their movies david <UNK> could <UNK> all the martial arts techniques such as throwing <UNK> and kicking very recommended for action fans i have tried to look for the dvd but i still cannot get it particularly in my town anyone could help me
<START> now before i tell you the synopsis this is a non spoiler review bone eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year i don't know how these movies even get onto dvd if i saw this in theaters i would get extremely upset bone eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find some bones it's the <UNK> and the more bones he eats the more powerful he gets br br first of all i thought okay well the dvd artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy when i rented it and looked at the dvd label it looked scary but then when i played it in i could agree on one thing the title <UNK> is better than the movie itself tell me what's more stupid a bone eater that just attacks by throwing a bone ate you and you disappear don't worry that's not a spoiler you see that happen in the first 5 minutes or is it more stupid that <UNK> has a horse you know what i think is the stupidest the whole movie br br the cgi is awful yeah i thought the idea of <UNK> was creepy but once you see the actual thing you think this is some kind of action movie or just a cruel mean joke the film felt longer than titanic and this was half an hour once the film actually has its moments of suspense it just stops i admit the acting was not the best but actually decent and that the violence wasn't over the top but everything else is a stinker br br overall bone eater is a film you can skip if you like interesting movies with great creatures great cgi and suspense <UNK> is a film to skip if you like bad movies no matter how cheesy they are then <UNK> will satisfy
<START> like some people here i love loved <UNK> in <UNK> it got aired a lot later that also means that we are in the episode <UNK> that's right i have to say that i really love <UNK> it can make me cry laugh smile and so on i think i'm going to die the day we reach episode number <UNK> <UNK> might be the on series except from <UNK> <UNK> that i really watch the actors are amazing especially <UNK> i think she is one of the best access we have i know he is not like super known but she is really a great actress <UNK> makes me want to be a cop i love it br br p s do you know if you can buy the episodes
<START> fellow noir <UNK> be not <UNK> this is a stinker poorly filmed poorly acted and there is nothing nothing here for the film buff looking for yet another solid b movie from the <UNK> of the 40's 50's era of classics i gave it a try based on the relatively high rating on imdb there's no <UNK> for taste but i found nothing in this movie to recommend to other imdb members this is a classic example of having watched a movie and feeling like you have been cheated out of x number of minutes that it took the movie to get to its thankful demise to have alan <UNK> on the cover of the dvd tape is nearly fraud he is on camera less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue this isn't this gun for hire folks it is a classic in the lousy sense of the studios <UNK> out fodder on no budget we all search for the great ones save your time on gangs inc paper bullets it is lousy
<START> lord this sucked there's a particular sort of sexual revolution flick from the 60s that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual <UNK> this film is an example i lost track of how many times women are slapped hit whipped or <UNK> in the film and then there are all the times that women in the film <UNK> about being slapped hit whipped or <UNK> you know they want it right sometimes it is ostensibly part of safe fetish play acting other times it <UNK> isn't but you will wait in vain to see the heroine report to authorities that she has just been raped instead we get to hear her being <UNK> by her rapist about her inability to let go br br every scene of this film <UNK> of <UNK> speaking as a straight white married man in his late 30's not a teenage lesbian women's studies major with a chip on her shoulder <UNK> you get the wrong idea br br perhaps the one good thing about this film is that it provides a stark reminder of just how bad things really were for women only a few short decades ago
<START> some plot spoilers ahead br br the <UNK> <UNK> so called <UNK> as the first network for men is a complete disappointment as was its block of adult cartoons the new <UNK> and <UNK> was just plain awful gary the rat mediocre at best and pretty unwatchable this cartoon is mostly boring if <UNK> and <UNK> suffered from gross out <UNK> lacked any decent shock gags funny witless gags clever gags or gags period the concept is bad to begin with pamela anderson a stripper <UNK> <UNK> saves the city from an assortment of goofy <UNK> this cartoon seems like an homage to superior wacky superhero spoofs like <UNK> duck and the <UNK> but without those wit and good writing or even good agent tries to <UNK> between being goofy and sexy but she is neither and this <UNK> failure to make her one or the other brings this series down br br watch your taped episodes of the <UNK> and see what a real superhero spoof cartoon is like
<START> conrad <UNK> <UNK> a hammy cult icon dies from a heart <UNK> not before <UNK> of an <UNK> assistant and tv commercial director both of whom <UNK> him with <UNK> of insults his body is removed from his <UNK> by some film students they wish to invite him to dinner they are quite big fans what these kids including a young jeffrey combs don't expect is that will be <UNK> by a medium to <UNK> havoc on those who removed him from his place of rest br br the list of violent acts include pulling one guy's tongue out setting a woman on fire <UNK> a <UNK> which <UNK> a woman's face <UNK> one fellow and another guy alive in a coffin a really weird soundtrack and <UNK> fog <UNK> around <UNK> activities br br silly <UNK> from troma is limited by a very very low budget and <UNK> pace the film feels a lot longer than it is the film isn't really that gory and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark at times is an ominous presence yet at other times he just looks real silly
<START> this amusing sometimes poignant look at the hollywood detective genre of the 1940's and 1950's stars robert as an <UNK> former cop who <UNK> uses his life <UNK> to pay for plastic surgery to <UNK> his image into that of his idol <UNK> bogart then sets up shop as a private eye under the name sam <UNK> robert <UNK> incidentally is one of the rare few bogart <UNK> who got the <UNK> exactly right more to the point the body and facial language are there for awhile sam 's only client is his <UNK> who wants him to find her <UNK> boyfriend and his only <UNK> foil is his secretary simply called <UNK> misty <UNK> who in his own words looked like marilyn monroe and made about as much sense as <UNK> allen and has a passion for banana <UNK> then he encounters elsa olivia <UNK> the plain sweet <UNK> daughter of a retired props master who has been murdered for no discernible reason in the process of investigating the murder sam shortly runs across the gene tierney <UNK> daughter michelle phillips of an <UNK> <UNK> wealthy greek <UNK> <UNK> victor <UNK> turning in a <UNK> sidney <UNK> his hapless long suffering second wife <UNK> <UNK> who manages to play a variety of put upon emotions without saying a word his two smarmy henchmen herbert <UNK> <UNK> peter lorre and jay robinson doing a reasonably accurate lionel <UNK> and vicious amoral middle eastern <UNK> franco <UNK> who comes complete with a and <UNK> loyal mistress <UNK> <UNK> all of whom would give anything to <UNK> the eyes of alexander two huge perfectly matched star when elsa is murdered interest in solving the case becomes personal and he sets out through a <UNK> of los angeles <UNK> including the hollywood bowl the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of hollywood <UNK> and santa <UNK> island in pursuit of the rocks determined to get at them before either of the two wealthy <UNK> throw in cameos by mike <UNK> and <UNK> others the traditional dumb but sympathetic ally on the police force and a <UNK> of nicely drawn character turns that provide dimension to practically all players and despite an unfortunate title song you have to my mind a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience

<START> i watched this mini in the early eighties sam <UNK> proved himself to be a great actor in fact when he began law and order i was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills i wish i could find a copy of this rare series and review it it is both factual and entertaining everyone should see it to know what really happened i was so moved i purchased and read the book of worlds and saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight if you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance mr <UNK> can really provide an audience enjoy the movies
<START> most christmas movies have a redemption theme but most are a variation on a very similar plot this movie is wacky and has an unusual plot you may need to hang in there for the first half where events may seem hard to believe for a movie but not as unbelievable as real life scott adams the creator of <UNK> says he's never made up anything in any of his cartoons they're all based on real life stories told to him by his fans the second half starts to fit the plot together i enjoyed it br br btw one reviewer noted that the idea of someone not having cash available is not credible in these days of but it's perfectly credible if you've lost your <UNK> who carries <UNK> cards anywhere else while on a business trip
<START> i was looking forward to the guardian but when i walked into the theater i wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time it's kind of like the <UNK> garden i like it but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it br br i'm not exactly sure what was <UNK> my spirit the trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin <UNK> movie that dealt with the subject <UNK> plus despite the promise <UNK> <UNK> showed in the <UNK> effect i'm still not completely sold on him something about the guy just <UNK> me probably has to do with his <UNK> features br br it took approximately two minutes for my fears to <UNK> and for my <UNK> to slip away the movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission and i was <UNK> <UNK> than kenny <UNK> orange face lift my concerns briefly at initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious <UNK> a tough guy <UNK> in his mouth and a <UNK> <UNK> make george clooney proud yeah we get it i was totally ready to hate him br br but then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to <UNK> my <UNK> br br darn you ape man <UNK> mixing tense exciting rescue scenes drama humor and solid acting the guardian is easily a film that i dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy you can <UNK> about its clichés predictability and rare moments of <UNK> <UNK> but none of that takes away from the entertainment value br br i had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when <UNK> started training the young guys but on the contrary the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue <UNK> are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under appreciated group br br do you have what it takes to be a rescue <UNK> just think about it you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a lack of <UNK> all while trying to help stranded <UNK> people who are depending on you for their survival and if all that isn't bad enough sometimes you can't save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies br br man who wants all that responsibility not me i had no idea what it was really like for these guys and who would have thought i'd have an <UNK> <UNK> kevin <UNK> movie to thank for the education br br not only does the guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers br br the <UNK> br br <UNK> wanting an inside look at what it's like to <UNK> on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance i saw it for free but had i paid i would've felt i had gotten my <UNK> worth
<START> this movie was on the pay channels today and i had nothing to do so i had it on this has to be the worst football movie ever made this has to be one of the worst movies period the <UNK> service on the cable system has a rating system and they gave 2 stars out of 4 this movie isn't even a half a star bad acting scott <UNK> sinks as usual larry miller <UNK> couldn't act if he tried rob <UNK> one liners completely <UNK> fred thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie the only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see kathy ireland nude in the shower not even close a complete waste of time and of film if we could give a negative number minus 9
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> are both beautiful films but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down they got too carried away with stock footage and photography so little content the executive producer puts his own image in the film its just pretentious maybe if they had more than 3 million to spend maybe it would have been something i actually thought steven soderbergh directed it because it was so bad but <UNK> the director of <UNK> and <UNK> directed this i'll have to assume that they just didn't have the budget to make a decent film you would think that francis ford coppola would have wanted to be a part of this film and help get more money together
<START> this show was so <UNK> to watch and there's only two numbers drowned world substitute for love and paradise not for me were you can sit down and just contemplate it all the opening of this show will go down in history as the most visually thrilling as madonna enters the stage via a gigantic crystal ball that comes down from the ceiling and the huge screens from behind it show images of horses <UNK> horses play a role in this show due to madonna falling off one the infamous scene of madonna on the <UNK> is in this show as a huge screen counts to 12 million the number of how many african children are <UNK> due to aids at the end a website address comes up for anyone interested in <UNK> we then go into the theme of the environment and again images of politics and religion are shown there's an <UNK> and then the show starts again to the music of i love new york and ray of light this part of the show is one of my favorites with the dancers doing there funny hand movements towards the end there's the music number with the song disco <UNK> mixed in with the song and the dancers make more of there presence known the ending again is full of energy as the show <UNK> up to the tunes of lucky star and hung up and hundreds of golden <UNK> fall from the ceiling at the end the message have you <UNK> comes up the dvd is worth buying and when it came out the soundtrack for the show was added as a bonus <UNK> did a great job with the footage for this show keeping it consistent with the style of the tour
<START> this was a pathetic movie the alien was decent but the movie itself gave a new meaning to pitiful the plot is something that's been done over and over again however this one does it the worst the acting was c p the scenes were often too dark to get what was going on no one developed any concern for the main character the movie was far too slow paced and the murder scenes that there were were <UNK> crafted and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the movie there are some movies which suck but can still be enjoyed because of there total <UNK> but this doesn't even have that whoever made this film thought that they could make something good and they failed miserably there is nothing this movie has to offer except a headache avoid it
<START> this film appears to be an <UNK> of the current trend towards <UNK> and in the wine industry around the world are more and more either joining large the american producer in the case of this film or paying high <UNK> experts to help them make the perfect wine and as a result are becoming very standard and predictable to some this is a good thing especially since few can afford to pay 50 or more for an everyday wine and to others this is horrible as the <UNK> of smaller is disappearing i truly can understand the concerns of both sides and don't think there is a villain or hero in this business sure good and cheaper wine is a nice thing but like what's happened with beers with giants like and <UNK> food <UNK> shopping european shopping <UNK> are almost <UNK> from american ones and mega stores like <UNK> <UNK> are taking away much of the <UNK> of the little guys so i definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers however with a product that is almost two and a half hours long and a general lack of focus the film simply became too big a chore to watch and i lost interest an 80 90 minute focused film would have been much more effective especially since the average viewer is not an that's the high brow word for a wine <UNK> br br on the very positive side the film makers are smart not to do much talking at all and simply let those on both sides of the issue do the talking plus the topic is so relevant and <UNK> however despite choosing a good style of documentary making the film simply goes on way way way too long and ended up making a very dull film
<START> i have to <UNK> from the other comments posted amid <UNK> funny moments there are a lot of actors trying too hard to be funny the strain shows i watched this with two friends on another friend's recommendation none of us were thrilled
<START> the first reviewer is right in this movie we see ourselves up to the majority being <UNK> trying to stay out of trouble just trying to live our lives and we see how easily these very human traits so fundamental to the <UNK> of society can lead us to become <UNK> in a great evil br br the story is set during world war ii with the radio <UNK> and movies reminding us of hitler's attacks on jews to <UNK> the irony of the same kind of violent anti <UNK> taking place in america at times that seemed a little heavy handed to me br br it feels more like a play than a movie but it's so thought provoking that such <UNK> mean little perhaps less trivial is the fact that the entire plot <UNK> one one little fact that struck me as rather implausible larry has lived an <UNK> life until middle age yet all it takes is his beginning to wear a pair of <UNK> for everyone everyone to at the first glance take him for a jew i willingly suspended disbelief because the plot kept me moving forward but the <UNK> did bother me throughout the film and quite frankly i didn't understand why his wife was also taken for a jew larry seemed to think so because her name was hart and later when he married her i don't know why his <UNK> assumed she was jewish for the first part of the film i wondered if there were going to be elements of fantasy <UNK> seemed exaggerated almost to the point of the grotesque why not call the police on seeing the rape even if the <UNK> was a <UNK> and i thought the lighting seemed to suggest something slightly unreal the red of the houses seemed too red entrance seemed deliberately <UNK> generally the colours were almost <UNK> like in their intensity br br in the credits i see that it was filmed on campbell <UNK> and wallace <UNK> in toronto so i plan to drive down there near today to check out the colours really it was good to be reminded that the <UNK> at that time were often leading the evil of racism remember how the <UNK> refused to speak out against hitler seeking only to get protection for the church it was the same <UNK> by the way who when rome was about to be <UNK> by american troops <UNK> that the first soldiers to enter the city not be black check your history i don't recall ever hearing of this movie before that's a shame it certainly is of great interest to every thinking person to everyone interested in american history or racism it's one of the <UNK> <UNK> i've ever seen of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> do not go with a crowd to do evil
<START> so tell me what serious <UNK> drinks <UNK> how many <UNK> obsessed <UNK> house a fully <UNK> and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire bachelor pad bar would be proud to <UNK> and what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 <UNK> from his hungry mouth so that the <UNK> generally <UNK> all over his face not to mention wasting good <UNK> by <UNK> your <UNK> tits with it just so the cinema audience can get a good <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br cage seems to be portraying the most attention seeking look at me alcoholic ever to have <UNK> the screen while <UNK> looks more like a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it for a summer than some seasoned street walker she is <UNK> and <UNK> as often as possible in this revolting movie with <UNK> skin <UNK> <UNK> rape and graphic verbal abuse all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly <UNK> state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichéd sentimental sexual fantasy of the with a <UNK> br br still i did watch it to the end by which time i was actually laughing out loud as <UNK> tough street hooker chopped <UNK> in the kitchen <UNK> smiling while cage all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road <UNK> in an <UNK> and <UNK> his way through the final half hour
<START> i have been a huge rush fan ever since moving pictures and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why rush is so popular they completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet and despite the rain in a soccer <UNK> they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish a real example of this is during the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner in perfect they really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful lust that rarely happens anymore you get the best seat in the house for one of their best <UNK> given the second dvd is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in brazil and shows you a lot of the <UNK> things going on and it allows you to see them not just a musicians but as actual people in their everyday life this dvd gift set is a must for any rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your dvd collection their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music this dvd is worth it
<START> <UNK> this is exactly the sort of pre code film that could <UNK> convince the viewer that films from this time period are lousy and they are not it's just that this particular film is horrid horrid because while the film tries very hard to be hip and adult it also is so hopelessly old fashioned dull and hokey that i was torn between laughing at the film or just falling asleep this is a unique combination to say the least br br so why exactly did i hate it so much well the film is incredibly sleazy but has no style and the film is meant to shock but lacks subtlety and takes too many ridiculous turns to be believable the film begins with a cliché a hooker with a heart of gold dorothy is a prostitute and she appears to accidentally kill a man shortly after making her escape she meets up with an old boyfriend who insists on marrying her he doesn't realize her profession seeing this man's <UNK> goodness she <UNK> to change her life and stop living the wild life this is tough when she hides out on a fictional <UNK> island here alone and waiting for her man to return there is nothing to do and the place is <UNK> with super horny and totally unappealing men in fact this portion of the movie is so dull that the audience might have a hard time staying focused the men on the island are so by the presence of that they <UNK> seem on the verge of <UNK> her only to be <UNK> because she isn't that sort of girl any more frankly i got very tired of all these <UNK> scenes there is simply too much eye rolling and tongue <UNK> to make it seem anything other than a very bad film and looking at all these ugly horn dogs was just annoying and stupid br br but wait it gets a lot worse the man she thought she killed shows up on this tiny island what are the odds and he tries to rape her as well however he's not to be <UNK> and she ends up shooting to save her new found virtue while the jury on the island is about to <UNK> her she rushes back into court and lies telling them she meant to kill the man and it was <UNK> because even if she's <UNK> she knows the evil <UNK> will have his way with her when she is sent to jail for a gun possession charge given that the <UNK> himself gave her the gun to set her up her <UNK> into the court and saying she was guilty seemed really really silly why didn't she just tell them the twisted plan supposedly she did this in order to <UNK> her virtue but to admit to killing someone so people will think you are a virgin so in order to avoid a short jail sentence and once again the threat of rape she doesn't consider telling the court that he is trying to force her into a sexually <UNK> situation the <UNK> has promised to rape her when she is locked up and just before she is taken to the <UNK> in order to avoid the rape the boyfriend shows up in time for her to send him off and the credits roll br br impossible situation and <UNK> abound coming so often that the film is just dumb combining this with all the sexual innuendo this makes for a bad and sleazy mess of a film which will only appeal to the most die hard fans of pre code films all others beware this is very <UNK> and silly from start to finish
<START> i was fortunate enough to see the last stop here where i live at the moving pictures film festival for those of you that don't know the moving pictures film festival is a tour of canadian made film in canada i was told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was on the verge of getting an american distribution deal which added to my excitement br br i'm a big horror movie fan and yes i love the scream trilogy as well so when i found out that rose was doing a ten little indians type of movie i knew that i was in for a treat rose was the biggest name actor actress at the entire festival br br the best way i can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that it's not quite like scream and it certainly is worth seeing it's set in the middle of a <UNK> it was filmed in <UNK> b c canada at a motel which adds to the suspense rose puts in a great performance as the girl next door along with the rest of the cast and as for what happens at the end well the only thing i'll say is that you'll never guess the ending br br sadly it probably won't make it into mainstream north american theatres because the only decent money maker in it is rose but if you get the chance to see it i would recommend you do and if worse comes to worst there's always video br br i gave it a 9 out of 10
<START> i've been looking forward to watching since having happened across <UNK> fall unfortunately i found <UNK> to be a wandering <UNK> boring bunch of <UNK> <UNK> together with what apparently is <UNK> signature a mix of story narration and poetry the film <UNK> the sexual and other experiences of a manhattan man about to be married through self narrated flashbacks like <UNK> on a string <UNK> apparently has strung together every little sexual life experience while <UNK> to tend to the beauty of the <UNK> the result is a disjointed rambling story about a boy growing up which fails to <UNK> empathy and leaves the viewer <UNK> <UNK> and with a bad after taste which <UNK> the mechanical feel good ending a mediocre indie and a step <UNK> for <UNK>
<START> alright a sci fi horror action b hybrid directed by jim <UNK> and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a metal head killing off multiple people as with any <UNK> flick he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere but storm <UNK> is more like a two movies for the price of one kind of deal on the one hand we got the drama thriller part as such the film opens with carol <UNK> killing her incredibly annoying <UNK> husband a plot that simply leads to nowhere and on the other hand we got the cyborg on a part night of the living dead style with carol and the cyborg being the ones trapped inside the house and a bunch of special <UNK> bounty hunters playing the role of the zombies trying to break into the house needless to say this flick is not up there with the greatest <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> fame especially is painfully bad and corey <UNK> in a small supporting roll is once again completely wasted on this movie <UNK> even rips off one of his own movies here since i am 99 sure he used some stock footage of his previous film evil ii the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle yes it's so not good and so much fun this is strictly for <UNK> fans only and i am one of them in case you didn't know already
<START> the most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time garbo talked in a motion picture aside from that if you want to call it that this is a movie that doesn't go beyond <UNK> melodrama with garbo trying her best not to fall asleep br br the plot involves greta garbo returning to her father after 15 years abroad her father who is a captain on a <UNK> is happy to see her even though she's acting a bit <UNK> she soon falls in love with a <UNK> <UNK> who also notices that something a <UNK> if you will is holding her back br br anyways the two <UNK> don't particularly like each other and soon come to blows over garbo when she <UNK> the situation by revealing her big secret which is no surprise to us if you've read the video box damn you mgm garbo is nothing but arms in this movie she acts and acts <UNK> her arms about and gets grating quickly the two male leads are alright probably the best performance comes from the classic silent actress marie <UNK> who plays the drunken <UNK> even girlfriend what a performance it's too bad the <UNK> couldn't have read <UNK> talks
<START> this movie brought together some of the old spinal crew for another <UNK> film this time revolving around the world of the dog show how their owners prepare and train for the show before moving on to the show itself br br we meet several teams as they hope to win the top prize the cookie who seems to have slept with every man ever and <UNK> who tries to cope with his wife's old <UNK> and the fact that he literally has two left feet <UNK> whose dog talks to him and enjoys the who have taken far too much coffee and scream at each other and the gay couple and <UNK> and <UNK> who have won the last two years fred <UNK> on the show and is very funny as always funny scenes include the <UNK> at me ' scene and any with levy unfortunately some of the best scenes were deleted or filmed later <UNK> <UNK> leslie <UNK> and the alternative <UNK> with <UNK> is one of the funniest things i have ever seen if these had been included i would give the film an extra mark but br br 7 out of 10
<START> two actors play rival gangsters in three films the final of which is a sci fi film that <UNK> strangely to william s <UNK> philip k dick and anime all at once the robots are actually called a reference to <UNK> blade runner several visual <UNK> to the film can be found as well and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with <UNK> <UNK> through use of a <UNK> drug for <UNK> love is fleeting and homosexual love is eternal martial arts fights ensue a first for the dead or alive films the hilarious climax involves the two leads <UNK> into a <UNK> robot with a gigantic <UNK> for a head who <UNK> destruction which has been the path of both characters thus far their individual minds and later literal heads <UNK> as something like <UNK> the film ends with the mayor f ing his free jazz playing boy <UNK> as the robot apparently tears down a wall around them the last words of the mayor oh f followed by a quick fade to black part of me felt cheated part of me confused but mostly i was just laughing a lot of the film is quite boring though the best scenes <UNK> the film while the rest is far too slow takashi miike has always <UNK> the sexual <UNK> beneath male violence in action films and this film with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> this theme more than any other sex and violence are two pretty basic themes but like who the jazz <UNK> may be a homage to ala naked lunch miike is able to show where the two connect to hilarious an oddly cohesive effect
<START> will smith is perfectly endearing as the relationship doctor here to <UNK> all your relationship <UNK> br br i expected this to be a standard <UNK> with little to <UNK> i'm happy to report that i was wrong will smith is delightful and unexpectedly fresh in this andy <UNK> vehicle surrounded by a great supporting cast an interesting story and fed with witty dialog i was thoroughly engaged br br we found this one cute quirky and inspirational without being preachy br br it rates a 7 4 10 from br br the fiend
<START> it might be a stretch saying this as a die hard <UNK> fan but the material both written and as performed in it's bad for ya is some of the best late era material yet at 70 <UNK> <UNK> back from the level of despair and some of the stumbles in the act itself from life is worth losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful or as much as the old f can get and is continuously <UNK> funny and funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching back in town or the first time the material even if sounding at times a <UNK> of the previously done i e the whole bit on children in school and camp like the children segment in <UNK> is always fresh and with such a <UNK> of truth to everything that it the mind while here goes <UNK> the funny bone br br going from the topic of death how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book six weeks unless if on the computer the <UNK> of communication looking down from heaven spots of god naturally kids and just <UNK> gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have rights make up the bulk of the special centered around the premise that what's bad for you plain and simple is <UNK> total complete <UNK> which as we also learn or if you've really learned it you're like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off not quite randomly by the parent holds the country together <UNK> isn't necessarily angry though even if disdain seems to <UNK> out at most turns even just to observe how horrifying children's teeth coming in look it's <UNK> <UNK> with the feeling that everything is not going to be fine br br what it comes down to is this <UNK> is to dirty witty <UNK> stand up comedy what <UNK> is to <UNK> everywhere which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get any at the least we get classic <UNK> outrageous lines and bits from the man's 13th or is it <UNK> comedy special including as far as an <UNK> raising observation on people who play <UNK> music during a birth
<START> after the wife of a plastic surgeon dies he gets his <UNK> assistant to help him bring her back to life with various parts of other <UNK> young girls this film wants to be a gordon lewis type romp but fails miserably the acting is beyond bad the gore effects atrocious no not in the good way the plot almost none existent and no fun to be had skip it you want to know how incompetent it is at one point you can actually see a movie quite obviously br br eye candy candy gets topless and again in a flashback br br my grade f br br dvd extras commentary with jeffrey <UNK> and <UNK> a second feature how to make a doll alternate title sequence with gordon lewis intro 2 shorts quest of the perfect woman and maniac hospital cover art gallery with music by the dead trailers for dr black mr hyde boots and the preacher the doctor and the the gruesome <UNK> wizard of gore awful dr wacky world of doctor <UNK> lust monstrosity <UNK> hill meets dr and i marquis br br <UNK> eggs theatrical trailer a scene from just for the hell of it and a trailer for axe
<START> unlike terms of <UNK> and steel i left the movie theater feeling very disappointed i started to get into the characters and their complex mother daughter and father daughter relationships at the beginning i even cried but i had no sympathy for the characters with the ending the final act did not seem in line with the mother's character at all so although the acting was pretty good i thought the movie on a whole was disappointing
<START> in my review just <UNK> i referred to the young actress lead as when it should have been <UNK> i was so involved with character and the action i guess that i wasn't that concerned with names anyway she and the film are brilliant as i said the cinematography and the director's use of montage are worthy of <UNK> and his cameraman the production design is top notch the placement of actors in the <UNK> middle ground and background within any given <UNK> en scene is worthy of study stunning memorable camera movement and an ending that has an emotional punch that leaves hollywood films far behind gee heroic self sacrifice instead of walking into the <UNK> thanks again john hart
<START> i was stunned by this film afterwards i didn't even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison br br for many it may be the worst of antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line <UNK> <UNK> of human emotions and interactions and the worst of <UNK> <UNK> confused it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by <UNK> typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness so it doesn't produce the temporary oblivion of <UNK> cinema br br but for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is <UNK> a single poetic image that stretches across the film <UNK> and antonioni create a <UNK> between their segments that seeks out the heart of things br br
<START> well i have to say this movie was probably the funniest movie i have seen all year and i don't exactly mean that in a good way this is probably the most pathetic movie i have seen in a while and yet that's what makes it so hilarious you can tell these people are really trying to act unfortunately for them they aren't doing such a good job making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny aaron carter is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic this movie is one of those movies where everything that is supposed to sound serious comes out really funny and all the things that are supposed to be funny are just so stupid and corny that you have to laugh because you know how hard they are trying this movie is so bad it's actually good i would definitely recommend it if your in the mood for a good laugh
<START> i see alot of movies at the cinema <UNK> so far this year and i have to say that this is by far and away the best film i have seen this year even though it was released back in 1954 br br i sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that i had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print br br the best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist pure quality br br although really dark in places it is <UNK> with the dry humour br br not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort br br if you ever get a chance to see this movie please do not hesitate it's a classic br br
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen if i wasn't watching it for free i would have never finished it the creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves it seems like this is supposed to be a film in the vein of scary movie and date movie a terrible movie but <UNK> better than this one but failed miserably the only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick a guy falls down someone gets hit by a bus etc none of the ideas are clever basically the worst premise for a movie ever the plot or lack thereof is completely retarded the plot seems to center around the coach and his family however there are so many other things going on in the movie it is completely ridiculous terrible terrible movie
<START> cheaply made poorly acted and <UNK> directed flight to mars still is entertaining despite what its has going against it a flight to mars is planned with five people three older gentleman cameron mitchell as a <UNK> and one female scientist obvious love interest the ship the spaceship gets there and finds that very human like martians live there and have technological advances that would make earth <UNK> but all is not <UNK> in the <UNK> cities of the martians here shown as some <UNK> and a few rooms the martians are a dying planet and one <UNK> wants the <UNK> to fix the ship only to take it away at the last moment and then for an attack on earth and another <UNK> wants to talk peace and see if they cannot <UNK> earth to give them living space the special effects here are pretty lame even for 50's sci fi standards complete with slow moving rocket ship <UNK> <UNK> alien <UNK> where the women wear shorts that would make many <UNK> except the men of course and little less offered cameron mitchell is the journalist and is <UNK> if nothing else <UNK> <UNK> is beautiful in very short shorts but adds little acting range the rest of the cast is filled with some older sci fi veterans like arthur <UNK> and morris doing <UNK> jobs this isn't a premiere sci fi film from the golden age by any standard but it is very watchable and <UNK> by at fast pace
<START> this movie came out about the same time as pretty woman while the general theme is the same wealthy man meets and learns to love a poor working class woman the characters of and juliette are much more lovable and worthy of our time with them i have never forgotten them and consider the movie superior to pretty woman in so many ways juliette is a remarkable woman and the clever ways she helps her boss overcome his problems will make you cheer the final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy the efforts makes to win the love of juliette <UNK> the <UNK> climbing scene of pretty woman a hundred times over see this movie it will warm your heart
<START> the movie inhabited is about a family of four moving into a new house not knowing that dangers are lurking the daughter befriends the dangerous creatures as they gain her trust when they do they use it against her a man who use to live there as a child or a teen knows about the creatures and <UNK> to warn them the creatures steel and take shiny objects to make new stuff out of them mostly weapons they has a cat and it <UNK> disappeared the man that tried to warn the little sister was tricked by them and end up into a <UNK> ward she then help them defeat the creatures and destroy the man one after they do they leave for good with nothing but each other and something happens to the doctor
<START> i absolutely love this movie evil dead has nothing on this film night of the demons 2 and 3 are a total bore fest but this one is a classic it's super cheesy and the acting is alright at best but what more could you want from an 80's horror movie <UNK> has some of the best one liners to ever hit the screen in this one he's my favorite character a lot of people talk about the <UNK> scene in this movie but my personal favorite is the ending sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters when the old man eats his left over halloween <UNK> in a pie and his throat is <UNK> from the inside out the sound track is awesome the scene with angela dancing is totally creepy especially after the <UNK> light comes on and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera <UNK> click on the song that's playing the make up effects in this movie are pretty sweet angela gave me nightmares as a kid if you're the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience you might want to give this one a pass but if you're like me and you really dig the whole halloween haunted house with the demons cliché than this one is definitely a must own
<START> this has to be one of the worst films i have ever had the misfortune to see the general idea of a mass <UNK> hitting the planet earth with em <UNK> is fair enough but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a <UNK> the acting was so terrible i got the feeling that the casting agents simply grabbed a handful of people off of santa monica <UNK> and threw them in front of the camera in all honesty i have seen less wooden acting from my <UNK> board sorry but this film was poor poor poor
<START> this one is about a homicide detective who battles a couple of young rich kids who have nothing better to do than plan an intricate murder and cover it up they seem to <UNK> the police force seemingly at will they <UNK> the detective by <UNK> clues and leading them off on a wild <UNK> chase this one has a decent plot with a few good twists at the end of the movie sandra <UNK> does a fine job in this one as a woman on the edge not sure of herself and battling her inner demons she can't seem to keep a man in her life especially partners they seem to keep leaving her for some reason altogether this isn't a bad film it keeps you guessing all the way the very shocking ending
<START> this is the worst movie that i have ever seen at first i thought that it was going to be good because i'm interested in the <UNK> triangle but instead it was terrible all it did was offer a bunch of lame that didn't make sense if time moves differently there how come the woman didn't age and her son aged rapidly and have a horrible sappy ending next time the guys who made this go to <UNK> they should take all copies of this movie with them please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list
<START> directed by michael <UNK> four daughters is about four <UNK> gifted sisters their <UNK> and their father a minor conductor playing <UNK> quick talking mickey <UNK> is john garfield in the role that made him an instant star the movie also stars claude <UNK> as adam and the lane sisters lola <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> page as his spirited daughters its definitive scene takes place in the living room cigarette hanging from his lips <UNK> is playing one of his own compositions <UNK> <UNK> ann tells him the piece is beautiful but he says it stinks he continues it hasn't got a beginning or an end only a middle ann <UNK> him to create a beginning and an end <UNK> replies what for the <UNK> are against me they tossed a <UNK> heads i'm poor <UNK> i'm rich but they tossed a two headed <UNK> audiences loved the way garfield in his tough city voice said it stinks that scene created <UNK> screen persona as the eternal <UNK> four daughters is a slice of <UNK> with garfield in a compelling performance <UNK> more than a hint of darkness br br
<START> robert <UNK> <UNK> is one of the director's finest shorts although the circus based setting may evoke hideous memories of <UNK> dreadful <UNK> top <UNK> <UNK> is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty <UNK> bugs bunny against a <UNK> lion <UNK> is fresh and funny from the outset not to mention extremely attractive to look at there's a classic scene in which bugs takes a <UNK> elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion in a brilliant disney parody he <UNK> down the <UNK> throat this brilliant opening is a sign of things to come there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the <UNK> cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of <UNK> clown which as a child i used to <UNK> regularly all this <UNK> in a short <UNK> sequence which gives the cartoon its name i've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but <UNK> breaks from the <UNK> and the result is an funny short which stands amongst <UNK> best
<START> maybe the target audience of this disney channel tv movie will be pleased with it but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters they will clearly see that <UNK> out is written all over this production obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie but rather this was <UNK> in a board room somewhere then produced with cold <UNK> there is some talent among the cast but actors like <UNK> coleman and jay thomas don't get much of a chance to showcase their talent the <UNK> cute <UNK> <UNK> is engaging as the first daughter but will is stuck once again playing another dumb character though he's not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his boy meets world role the background for this movie is washington d c and the white house but there is no real presidential feel to the film and the secret service is made out to be little better than the <UNK> <UNK> when it come to doing their duty the disney channel presents a lot of original tv movies and most of them are better than this
<START> there's a sign on the lost highway that says br br major spoilers ahead br br but you already knew that didn't you br br since there's a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie i'd like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense as others have pointed out one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient if you have the dvd of <UNK> you can cheat by looking at david lynch's top 10 hints to <UNK> <UNK> but only upon second or third viewing please br br first of all <UNK> drive is downright brilliant a masterpiece this is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head not often are the comments on the dvds very accurate but it gets inside your head and stays there really hit the mark br br david lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it cinematography wise has great acting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a haunting soundtrack by <UNK> and a very dream like quality to it but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before after all when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn't leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about regardless of whether they liked it or hated it br br <UNK> enough about all that it's time to justify those statements br br most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion a dream sequence br br of course that's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting traditional methods in which the story is laid out in a <UNK> logic and linear manner for the viewer but for those expecting that i urge you to check the name of the director and come back again br br <UNK> is the story of the sad demise of diane <UNK> a wannabe actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor <UNK> due to <UNK> lack of talent she is constantly struggling to advance her career and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents' expectations upon realizing that <UNK> will never be hers c becomes engaged with adam the director she hires a <UNK> to get rid of her and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces br br the movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller which is some 50s dance <UNK> contest in which we can see the main character betty giving a great performance we also see an elderly couple which we will see twice more throughout the movie together with her and <UNK> her br br no wait this is what most people see the first time they view it there's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits the camera moving into an object although <UNK> and the scene quickly <UNK> out if you look closely the object is actually a <UNK> revealing that what follows is a dream br br the main characters seen in the first half of the movie br br betty diane imaginary self used in the first half of the movie that <UNK> the dream sequence a positive portrayal of a successful aspiring young actor the complete opposite of diane was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at notice that in the dream version the name is br br rita the fantasy version of <UNK> <UNK> that through <UNK> dream and with the help of an imaginary car accident is turned into an <UNK> this makes her vulnerable and <UNK> on <UNK> love she is then conveniently placed in betty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> home which betty has been allowed to stay in br br <UNK> in real life <UNK> mother in the dream part the woman in charge of the apartment complex that betty stays in she's mainly a strong authority figure as can be witnessed in both parts of the film br br adam the director we know from the second half that he gets engaged with <UNK> his sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a <UNK> bag for betty diane since she develops such hatred towards him br br aunt ruth <UNK> real aunt but instead of being out of town she is actually dead diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for murder br br mr roach a typical <UNK> character not real appears only in <UNK> dream sequence he's a mysterious influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair he serves much of the same function as the backwards talking dwarf which he also plays in twin peaks br br the <UNK> the person that murders <UNK> this character is basically the same in both parts of the movie although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence more on that below br br now having established the various versions of the characters in the movie we can begin to delve into the plot of course i will not go into every little detail neither will i lay it out <UNK> but i will try to explain some of the important scenes in relation to hint sheet br br as i mentioned above <UNK> was re produced as an <UNK> through her improbable survival of a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie which left her completely vulnerable what i found very intriguing with <UNK> is that lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn't i've already mentioned the camera moving into the <UNK> but notice how there's two cars riding in each lane approaching the <UNK> br br only one of the cars actually hit the <UNK> what about the other even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves wouldn't they try to help the others or at least call for help my theory is that since this is a dream the presence of the other car is just set aside and forgotten about since as ebert so <UNK> puts it like real dreams it does not explain does not complete its sequences <UNK> over what it finds fascinating <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br shortly after rita <UNK> down from the crash site at <UNK> dr and makes her way down the <UNK> and <UNK> into aunt <UNK> apartment betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away staring <UNK> at each other and <UNK> at themselves and the camera this is the first indication that what we're seeing is a nightmare br br although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to betty i think they're actually her parents since they were <UNK> her at the <UNK> contest perhaps she didn't know them all that well and didn't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream they also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder and <UNK> sense of <UNK> regarding her <UNK> goals in her life br br a rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the <UNK> diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept part in the movie from <UNK> party in the second half of the movie and he therefore <UNK> a major part of her dream because of her feelings of guilt and <UNK> towards the murder of <UNK> a part of her wants him to miss so she turns him into a dumb criminal br br this scene i think is also lynch's attempt at totally <UNK> his audience over since they're given a false <UNK> in which to view the movie br br gotta love that <UNK> just bit me <UNK> line though br br the next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at <UNK> who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they're sitting in after a little talk they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene br br when reaching the corner a bum like character with a <UNK> face appears out from behind the corner <UNK> the living crap out of the man having the nightmare this nightmare exists only in <UNK> mind she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder so in short her translate into that poor guy's nightmares the bum also <UNK> <UNK> evil side as can be witnessed later in the movie br br the cowboy <UNK> along with the dwarf one of the strange characters that are always present in the <UNK> landscape diane only saw him for a short while at <UNK> party but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams so can he be awarded an important part in her dream we are also given further clues during his scenes that what we're seeing is not real his sudden disappearance etc br br the cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director when he meets up with him at the odd location the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he adam does good or two more times if he does bad throughout the movie he appears two more times <UNK> to diane that she did bad he is also the one to wake her up to reality that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her <UNK> of him appearing twice and shortly thereafter she commits suicide br br the <UNK> scene with the brothers where we can see <UNK> the composer as <UNK> is probably a result of the fact that diane was having an <UNK> just before <UNK> and adam made their <UNK> at <UNK> party in the second half it could at the same time also be a statement from lynch br br during the scene in which they enter <UNK> apartment the body lying in the bed is <UNK> but notice how she's assumed <UNK> sleeping position diane is seeing herself in her own dream but the face is not hers although it had the same wounds on the face as diane would have after shooting herself this scene is also filled with some genuine <UNK> creepiness since diane did not know where or when the <UNK> would get to <UNK> and finish her off she just put her into her own home br br in real life <UNK> audition for the movie part was bad in her dream she delivers a perfect audition leaving the whole crew <UNK> about her performance br br also interesting is the fact that the money that in real life was used to pay for murder now appears in rita purse this is part of <UNK> <UNK> of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back as the murder now hasn't taken place br br when her neighbor arrives to get her piano shaped <UNK> another hint is given she takes the <UNK> from her table and leaves yet later when <UNK> and betty have their encounter on the couch we see the <UNK> appear again when the camera pans over the table suggesting that <UNK> encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy br br the catch phrase of the movie adam is <UNK> actresses for is she is the girl which are the exact same words that diane uses when giving the <UNK> photo resume br br the blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed there's much symbolism going on here the box may represent <UNK> future it's empty or it may be a sort of a <UNK> box the <UNK> laughs when she asks him what the key will open either way it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place the box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the <UNK> bum br br club is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s he is viewing is not real it also <UNK> that diane is about to wake up to her reality her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from even in her dreams br br during the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple <UNK> diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears br br anyway that is my 0 <UNK> hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it 'the worst movie <UNK> or something to that effect without realizing the plot br br as usual lynch is all about creating irrational fears and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well br br 10 out of 10
<START> this is a disaster movie in both meanings of the word every character every role every conversation every twist everything in this movie stinks big time it's a shame to see dennis <UNK> talent wasted in this dreadful movie i can give you of examples but see for yourself br br or rather don't
<START> i saw this on a cheap dvd release with the title the <UNK> force since i enjoy cheesy 80's horror films i thought i was in for a real treat sadly the film is mostly boring and you're constantly waiting for something to happen it does eventually get somewhat interesting but this is in the last quarter of the film it's a case of too little too late when the action does happen it's not that great what we get are dead corpses along the ground and chasing after the girls in the <UNK> it's not the absolute worst i've seen but you can do a lot better i would only recommend this to die hard <UNK> of cheesy 80's horror
<START> this movie was <UNK> good it was hilarious there are so many jokes that you can just watch the movie over and over and not get tired of it john <UNK> and tim blake nelson were awesome as pete and <UNK> i love those guys i love the adventures they went on too i definitely recommend this movie br br also the music in this movie is terrific i love singing along with all of the songs
<START> this is my all time favourite movie ever br br i remember seeing this when i was younger and since then i have been in love with it i used to rent it so often from this one video store that used to carry it and when we moved i couldn't find it any where so i <UNK> going back <UNK> he far away store just so i could watch the movie again br br finally i found it for sale and i bought it and watched it over and over again great movie br br since then though it was my very first dvd that i got after i got my dvd player ok well i got them at the same time the quality on the dvd is way better i couldn't believe it you gotta see this one
<START> i don't need to say much about how good this documentary is it's truly an amazing piece of true narrative the story is simple enough a white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in florida and the boy who is arrested is <UNK> and put on trial with only the public <UNK> and his family on his side it's very enthralling and the public <UNK> is a joy to watch in all his human ways you can't help but pull for the triumph of justice and the ending <UNK> more than could be expected of a true story br br it's a shame more people haven't seen this documentary but hopefully you will find a way to watch it for those interested in race relations in the united states and the actual <UNK> of law <UNK> and the legal process it's well worth your time and effort to find this documentary i give it a 10
<START> hilarious film about divine <UNK> camera work stinks shot on digital video and looks like early mtv videos turn the other cheek by looking past the visual and concentrate on the story laughs <UNK> for those with a well developed sense of irony
<START> two years after this short the last our gang short was made after seeing this you wonder how it even lasted that much longer the quality of our gang <UNK> soon after moving from hal roach to mgm and this short is a perfect example the gags are all very unfunny and last line of this being the <UNK> day of his life paints a bad picture in your mind of what it's like for him the rest of the time a very poor example of film making
<START> highly flawed but just about watchable <UNK> that runs like a <UNK> brothers reject the most criminal thing about it though is the casting i couldn't for one minute believe jerry o and jake busey in the role of who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat nor could i believe the very beautiful shannon elizabeth as a <UNK> tough cop story is predictable but does manage to raise a <UNK> on a few occasions although the gross <UNK> meant to be shock scenes one involving an <UNK> <UNK> and another set in a <UNK> bank are just plain awful if this film is on tv then its probably worth watching if you are extremely bored but please don't waste your money renting it
<START> we're in a not so distant future <UNK> seems to have reached a high point languages mixes with each other although english <UNK> over the rest races have <UNK> human is a fact and all the territory seems to have been divided in two <UNK> the one for the valid and the one for the non valid a brave new world in <UNK> style in which people are <UNK> <UNK> and blood relationships are strictly forbidden for health reasons the code <UNK> of the title in such environment two souls that are destined not to meet fall in love with each other br br <UNK> had an important story with quite a big potential a nice recipe that he ruins giving it a so slow rhythm <UNK> it in a so weary way <UNK> any emotions <UNK> that's all code <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and boredom not even the presence of samantha <UNK> and tim robbins both <UNK> play their roles wonderfully nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the movie what a pity br br code <UNK> what could have been and never was br br my rate 4 10
<START> a very well directed version of eric stage play well worth checking out for great characters and for anyone who wants to see how to bring a play to the movies correctly
<START> i had never heard about this movie when it was given to me to translate so i didn't know what to expect i checked it out on imdb and got curious it didn't take long to realize that this was a gem outstanding performances great story and it's both well directed and well written it's hard to compare it to other movies but stand by me comes to mind although it has as many differences from the cure as similarities the tale of an extraordinary friendship between young boys plus the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this movie and stand by me other than that the cure is a fine movie in its own right well worth a wider recognition it's dramatic but also adventurous sad but also humorous i can't think of a single thing that bothers me about it having said that i don't want to give the impression that it is a perfect movie whatever that means but rather that i enjoyed it immensely was very moved by it and wouldn't change a thing in it i won't go into a detailed description of the story plot partly because it would be either too general or too revealing and partly because you can find that information elsewhere on the site in closing i can only say wonderful movie see it if you get the chance
<START> in many ways the perfect movie the incredible journey and <UNK> <UNK> tale come together for a positive spin on the usually depressing subject of <UNK> in essence the <UNK> of the muppets <UNK> down to the finale song of the movie life's like a movie write your own ending keep believing keep pretending they create their own reality which has all the <UNK> of every epic tale a <UNK> goal at the end of what is necessarily a <UNK> laden journey an ever increasing group of like minded individuals for <UNK> a nasty set of <UNK> who are not beyond all redemption and a big budget hollywood ending because darn it all they can br br only jim <UNK> could pull this off he walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without too long or too hard into either of course it seems odd that <UNK> such weight into a film starring puppets but in the end perhaps they are the perfect uh puppet to make these points the movie's atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the hollywood dream the happy ending unnecessary cameos and <UNK> into song at the drop of a hat usually these aspects are <UNK> to quality in film but the self <UNK> manner under which the story is delivered makes for guilt free viewing one of the few films that can truly be called suitable for all ages br br the other muppet related films including the empire strikes back while <UNK> do not touch the simple grace of this film take for instance the musical number hope that something better comes along the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> amusing in its <UNK> <UNK> yet makes a <UNK> crucial point about the motivations behind life choices brilliant
<START> 2 <UNK> is an intense and fascinating drama which has some similarities in tone and subject with films like bully elephant and kids although by my point of view 2 <UNK> is a superior film to those three ones before watching this movie my expectations were neutral but i ended up taking a very good impression thanks to the intelligent screenplay k perfect direction and the excellent performances from a group of young actors br br the <UNK> instances of school violence around the world have inspired many movies tv <UNK> and books which pretend to find and predict the <UNK> or internal reasons of those <UNK> expressions of <UNK> <UNK> and specially madness some people may say that 2 <UNK> arrives too late to that artistic movement however i do not think like that because that <UNK> <UNK> the movie to make a more artistic analysis focusing on the situation with more <UNK> and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish which <UNK> other movies with similar stories br br on the characters from 2 <UNK> we can find clichés from the juvenile cinema from director and screenwriter john hughes rip 's movies to the teen horror films the beautiful princess the clumsy nerd the <UNK> etc it would have been very easy to make them become in hollow caricatures defined by their function in the screenplay but it is something admirable that the screenplay <UNK> the stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems which in more or less degree any person can find on his her road to maturity br br 2 <UNK> is an excellent movie whose only fail is that the ending feels a bit affected but which <UNK> that with a lot of positive elements it will be very interesting to see next projects since he has had a great debut with this movie
<START> there was broadcast news and what a good thing it was this one just plain stands up and sounds its <UNK> in a manner that <UNK> two decades later br br there are moments especially with respect to the <UNK> score when this film becomes a bit too eighties or a bit too <UNK> in seattle fortunately they're few and far between br br one third social satire one third romantic comedy one third drama with three flawed but endearing people at its core it's smart and moving and almost <UNK> funny holly hunter in particular may never have been more fun to watch in a comedic role and yes i'm including raising arizona her other star turn from that era in this <UNK> br br a legitimate classic
<START> i'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film how sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience br br i had major problems with jennifer <UNK> and her character i found alex extremely <UNK> face is so young sweet and innocent and this very <UNK> with <UNK> very disturbing <UNK> especially in that disgusting restaurant scene she also has the temper <UNK> of a <UNK> it is very difficult to believe that nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent <UNK> and <UNK> especially after she opens the door of a moving car and <UNK> a <UNK> at him <UNK> rather to walk home in the middle of the road with only one shoe and what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet in fact the whole romance was very disturbing the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16 <UNK> br br as for the dancing i'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated what on earth was that tv dance sequence about in the club who was supposed to be dancing i wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag and even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company the camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing and what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the <UNK> pointing at them and as many other comments have pointed out she would never get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not the closure is the fact that she <UNK> her fear in the end of the i actually thought the best sequence <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> penny in dirty dancing you could see that she was a real dancer and her <UNK> were very impressive this is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup br br there were two good bits in this film the ballet dancers <UNK> when alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition they look so lovely and classy and at least this helps to <UNK> the difference between her current dance career and the one she <UNK> to the other good scene was the break dancing in the street i also liked the ice parents they were funny br br some other random points who was <UNK> and how did alex get to know her what was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone how did she afford that lovely <UNK> and all the furniture where were her family was that scene in the <UNK> club really necessary the person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a disney film needs their head examined and anyway what happened to the ice <UNK> br br many people said the film was poor but they liked the message don't give up hope keep on trying and your dreams will come true watch the little mermaid instead
<START> if you had a mother that described you like that you just might be looking to <UNK> her off yourself it's how danny <UNK> feels about anne <UNK> it's just how to put the plan in action br br and his creative writing class taught by professor billy crystal gives him the idea that and a viewing of alfred hitchcock's classic strangers on a train which gives <UNK> the idea to switch murders with crystal who hates his wife kate <UNK> who not only is cheating him out of an idea for a book he wanted to write but is also carrying on with hunky tony br br throw <UNK> from the train plays out kind of like strangers on a train as <UNK> seems to have carried out his end of the murder scheme but <UNK> having a bit of a problem putting <UNK> down even with <UNK> help that woman might need killing but she's going to take a lot of it br br the only academy recognition that throw <UNK> from the train got was an academy award nomination for anne <UNK> for best supporting actress <UNK> lost to olympia dukakis for moonstruck but the film turned out to be her finest hour <UNK> already had the throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year but look at the list of credits she managed to even after throw <UNK> from the train she worked right up to the end br br i've seen interviews with both of the stars of throw <UNK> from the train billy crystal and danny <UNK> and both have gladly <UNK> that anne <UNK> performance as the mother from hell both made the film the success it was and stole it out from under them their <UNK> of <UNK> talent and performance is the best possible tribute br br if marion <UNK> in strangers on a train had been anything like anne <UNK> here <UNK> granger would gladly have joined robert walker in <UNK> of her throw <UNK> from a train is one of the best black comedies out there should not be missed
<START> i've been on a bad run of films this is a <UNK> about an <UNK> plot and a psychopath tom <UNK> whom i really enjoy was pretty young here he is a <UNK> with a passion but he has a partner whose profit motive includes over <UNK> and burning into the mix comes an agent who is drowned his daughter and her nut case boyfriend james mason plays the insurance investigator any idiot given a little warning would know something was rotten in the nation of australia still they <UNK> their way the most interesting thing to me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built never got beyond being a bunch of sticks low budget i guess the plot could have been interesting maybe they should have hired a film editor the did half the time you don't know where the characters are but i guarantee a five million dollar payoff would have probably made a close watch on the structure mandatory it doesn't work although there is lots of neat fire
<START> i watched 40 minutes and couldn't bear it any longer  the television went off and i returned to some light reading <UNK> for <UNK> br br it was hard to say what aspect of this production was most <UNK> dialogue made up entirely of sound <UNK> or the acting by numbers br br it was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place there were throw away references to lord nelson and slavery but edmund the <UNK> to be played by blake was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century the other bright young things had make up and costumes more appropriate to a 21st century fancy dress party the <UNK> blonde <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> being the least credible character br br uk commercial television obviously believes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lips and deep meaningful looks make a good story fortunately jane austen had other ideas br br if you want to find out the story of <UNK> park buy the 1983 mini series dvd
<START> is almost as bad as a science fiction film can go br br i can hardly find something good to say about this film the premises are completely wrong a <UNK> is supposed to hit the moon and cause <UNK> damage to earth but nobody believes the scientist who <UNK> this a whole underground city plus a <UNK> pad for nuclear armed rockets is build in the california mountains without anybody <UNK> when the <UNK> <UNK> earth the news make it to the tv and <UNK> hardly a day before the event and so on and so on br br neither does any kind of emotion make it to the screen is the genius who discovers the <UNK> and builds the underground city a <UNK> of humanity or a beast the director or dennis hooper who is playing the role did not seem to decide until the film was done and actually it does not make any difference because acting and directing is so confusing that you end by wondering what does this film try to say the special effects are so cheap that not only that they cannot be convincing in the era of computer effects but they could not have been convincing even in the 50s four decades before this film was made br br a total waste of time
<START> another first this french movie is my introduction to the world eric rohmer perhaps i'm a bit <UNK> when i say that this is probably my last rohmer movie but i was immediately turned off by the way rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point there is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that i thought was never going to end honestly no matter how much i tried i couldn't understand why rohmer is so highly regarded among <UNK> he struck me as being one of those <UNK> <UNK> people who are filled with hot air if this is a <UNK> of what his movies are about i'm not interested i don't care much for french cinema usually <UNK> and <UNK> to a fault so maybe i'm biased
<START> intense funny witty and more than anything social comedy on the ways of adult dating and it's results be it good or bad <UNK> and nicholson are engaged couple two months away from a wedding date when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces nicholson to re think the relationship and start to date other people so she won't feel so <UNK> when it comes to sexual experience this leads to a disaster of events following <UNK> nicholson and their <UNK> very intelligent and needed in this time of clumsy condescending comedy while containing your usual variety of comedic sexual and frustrated characters especially charles as a sexually frustrated sex fiend very annoying who even they seem to get the right feel to this heart felt commentary br br the film goes the way films should go these days showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals most of the male characters are the <UNK> straight forward eyes while the woman are the fresh faced street who will stop at nothing to get pleasure guys will be <UNK> of the message made for guys with self respect however it is easy to assume that most males who do see this film will use it's message of male sensitivity cover up any flaw or <UNK> that a female might find <UNK> still the writing formula uses this as a tool to <UNK> the way for it's male leads particularly those of <UNK> <UNK> and finding the director in a cameo as a sales man br br the females are by far the most <UNK> as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to with someone else they have <UNK> traits though even though they are covered by the image of sex driven <UNK> very funny stuff br br on another level the film follows some of it's ensemble into different relationship work <UNK> meets up with a <UNK> <UNK> a very remarkable and noteworthy performance by the always reliable helen slater named penelope who is divorced with a son who hates her for splitting with his father as the two go deeper into a relationship human interest is revealed and both the comedy and tragedy of divorce and starting <UNK> are studied br br by the end of the film <UNK> and nicholson have become way to deep over the heads to see what's coming next and it is up to what they have learned about each other and themselves to decide what will come next it becomes appropriate and dramatic at just the right time br br direction is <UNK> very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened with the right ending br br all in all this film should have been released <UNK> and i should hope that it is up for some academy awards maybe helen slater can finally get the recognition she deserves <UNK> this film is a no hits miss give it all you got romantic sex farce displayed very <UNK> and <UNK> br br great film
<START> oz is a great series one of <UNK> underrated shows it has a certain relationship to soap opera in that something evil is always happening and it is the unfolding of each instance of evil that <UNK> from my discussions with people who are actually in prison it rings true every interaction has some <UNK> working in the background behind every action there lies a scheme a plot to do someone else in i like this series so much that it is one of the few tv shows i have bought completely on dvd br br and yes i agree with the writer before me who commented that there are elements of satire in it the character in the wheelchair who offers his <UNK> view of life does so with a certain bit of ironic humor
<START> warning possible spoilers br br <UNK> <UNK> is one of the solid rock movies i have ever seen the original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period he is not only playing their music to the note but also living the life of his <UNK> when his friends in the tribute band <UNK> him in search of some originality the destiny plays him a good turn and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the <UNK> band a dream came true well almost while starting to live the life of the famous including the drug and sex <UNK> of the rock scene of the 80s he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band br br i liked the film one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack the overall idea is original and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner acting is quite good with mark <UNK> better than in most of the other action <UNK> i saw him lately and jennifer aniston in tune with the nice girl who knows a lot about life role more <UNK> is the ending which is quite conventional and may disappoint it looks like the main character after <UNK> the big and famous band has found his own creative path however in an <UNK> twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie br br 8 10 on my personal scale worth seeing however expect exposure to a high dose of metal if you do not like this kind of music you may chose to avoid this film
<START> spoilers br br i don't care what anyone says this movie is <UNK> hilarious this is the sequel to jack frost a movie about a killer snowman the snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber but the truck crashes with a truck carrying <UNK> manipulation <UNK> that make human <UNK> bond with dirt or in this case snow the first movie was just boring and eventually the snowman is destroyed by <UNK> <UNK> on him br br or so they thought br br this movie takes place about a year after the second some scientists <UNK> jack frost by mixing the <UNK> with <UNK> no explanation is ever given for why they do this they just do meanwhile the who arrested frost in the first is going to the <UNK> unfortunately the snowman comes with him br br this movie has it all it has talking <UNK> that can stand up ice <UNK> that explode when you stick them in your mouth and killer <UNK> yes killer <UNK> they even say <UNK> like babies i'll have to give the makers of this credit the <UNK> are some of the <UNK> little things ever <UNK> up i wish that i could get one as a pet frost finally <UNK> the island as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather <UNK> br br then there's the actors there's manners the fbi agent from the first movie except here he's wearing an <UNK> <UNK> me <UNK> i be an fbi agent and then there's the stereotypical british <UNK> and the stereotypical black <UNK> with <UNK> and finally captain fun the man on the face of the planet bar none br br this movie isn't scary but is is hilarious i laughed my butt off the whole way through and i recommend this for anyone who likes a good bad movie br br out
<START> i just saw wing i do not really know why this movie was made what is the message of this story nevertheless i liked it there are some exciting scenes in it i appreciate a strong performance by martin sheen harvey keitel is less convincing
<START> a <UNK> to the old fashioned westerns of the 30s and 40s such as dodge city dallas has a number of things going for it gary cooper at his coolest blazing technicolor photography by ernest gone with the wind and a pulse <UNK> max <UNK> king kong <UNK> dodge city et al score in addition there is a <UNK> mistaken identity a <UNK> death and more hair breath escapes than a republic serial as always cooper <UNK> what it is to be a man under pressure forget the 50s angst western this is pure entertainment
<START> this miniseries is a reasonable sequel to the original gone with the wind if one views this on its own merit and not immediately following the original it comes out pretty good i am sure that most viewers will question the performances of scarlett and <UNK> but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better many of the characters here are new to this storyline so comparison in those cases mother uncle henry hamilton will is not a problem no one will every be <UNK> leigh or clark gable br br the best part of the whole production is the beautiful scenery of <UNK> <UNK> and ireland watch it for that alone obviously this was a high budget tv miniseries it follows the book for a while then has a totally new plot when scarlett goes to ireland br br the acting is credible if nothing special kind of the way i feel about roger moore following sean connery for james bond
<START> i was a <UNK> in college when this movie came out and i had never actually seen it until last night i finally decided to watch it because i like good dancing and because the movie had such cultural impact after seeing the movie i am completely <UNK> by how it had any effect other than putting people to sleep br br the story is pretty preposterous when you think about it does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer joint full of <UNK> old steel workers and <UNK> could keep their <UNK> with the high concept dances that those girls were doing they would have all been over to faster than you can say performance art can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre tv watching no theater dance thing that she did please br br it seems plausible to me that there could be a woman that worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer after all both are physically demanding jobs but i didn't buy for a second that that girl worked in a steel yard and i didn't buy for a second that i was looking at a real steel yard steel work is dangerous you don't keep your work area looking like a junk yard and not end up <UNK> a <UNK> i love some of the inane shots like when two <UNK> are sitting in the big <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> what the hell are they doing in there or when she is cutting six <UNK> off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch she was obviously board and just started cutting random things up br br but story holes like that can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least stimulating in some way <UNK> doesn't offer anything to balance it however br br the dancing horrible it is the <UNK> <UNK> and pose style that ruined american musicals until well are we really over it yet the <UNK> that the movie tries for is ruined by jennifer complete lack of personality i mean i am a <UNK> year old male and when she was supposed to be eating <UNK> my only reaction was to think that she should get a <UNK> <UNK> br br you can't really get behind alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow the dog had more going on than she did br br the love affair is flat it comes across as nothing more than a boss with the <UNK> for one of his workers zero passion br br even the final scene where she dances for <UNK> and some other <UNK> is unsatisfying because the <UNK> reaction is so unbelievable what serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes at <UNK> lame <UNK> routine in short the movie had nothing but leg <UNK> and large oh yeah there is a good <UNK> of nudity when alex <UNK> her friend from being a useless erotic dancer a laughable bit of <UNK> other than that the movie is a waste of time i wish that the mst3k crew were still in business this would make good fodder for them
<START> it's not unusual that hollywood likes to <UNK> out crappy films occasionally a handful of good films come out of them while the majority just sucks major ass it's also not surprising that those bad films are <UNK> of old tv <UNK> occasionally a surprise pops up with the fugitive who saw that best picture oscar <UNK> coming but for every fugitive there's a navy or some other wholly unoriginal film devoid of any plot or interest the <UNK> squad in my opinion goes into my top ten of truly lousy films in which hollywood should get it's sorry ass beaten for producing what could've been a good movie we're <UNK> right <UNK> <UNK> in the middle of a story that just doesn't seem to make sense it wastes the talent and the dialogue is just bad we don't actually know who the hell these characters are and we could give a flying f k about what they are instead you're expected to automatically know who they are and what they're going to do there's one particularly bad riff about the i'm too old for this s t line that's just plain stupid something my friend <UNK> noted when we were <UNK> for the movie to just end it's just an insult to hollywood cinema grade f
<START> i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap if you look at <UNK> pictures posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers <UNK> kissing or something to do with friendships whereas <UNK> pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap when i watch it i feel like i'm watching a police version of <UNK> street or something similar i have to say i still like the bill as i'm interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over br br as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill most of the great characters are gone now although a few still remain i think and i'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't its just that they lack the tough looks personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble br br overall being one of the only police programs on television these days the bill will always be a <UNK> interesting thing to watch but like i say it has lost a lot of its <UNK> if thats the right spelling and would now be <UNK> as a terrible unreal television soap br br recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved 2 10
<START> this is <UNK> one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br the only reason i gave it 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the gorgeous <UNK> in some of the scenes despite her <UNK> years she is an amazing woman in every aspect her nude scene in the bathroom with <UNK> <UNK> is as hot as hell br br anyway about the movie well nothing really interesting to say a and a turkish gang fight over berlin in scenes that include people open firing on the street in daylight and inside a club where 30 40 people fire at each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and amazingly after some hours of firing just three die and ten are injured lol br br while the gangs fight over berlin a serial killer is killing young children and then <UNK> them painted white on various places around town br br <UNK> <UNK> appears as the turkish detective who although now working for the police was an ex leader for the turkish gang and now is up to solve the serial killer crimes br br the movie is obviously a very bad rip off of the classic m movie the killing of the children the involvement of the underworld the character of the serial killer and the ending scene with the trial of the serial killer are more than influenced from this classic movie br br the acting is terrible the script just stupid the production of the lowest standards possible and in general this was a great waste of time and money br br don't even bother renting this one
<START> i just saw this early this morning on the fox channel quite by accident my dog woke me up i had seen it years ago and thought i remembered it fairly well as a kid i had enjoyed it but now as another poster commented several of the <UNK> were out of order and while it was <UNK> at first and bizarre it seemed to fit the production what was just awful became surreal and amusing musical numbers for what i think was the big <UNK> show you're in show business i'm in show business most of the kids are in show business let's put on a show come out of nowhere before all the talk about putting on a show and then fade without applause to totally unrelated straight scenes the leading man's girlfriend shows up <UNK> out lines and lines of dialogue then disappears i was half awake and loved every insane minute of it
<START> three of the things you can say about <UNK> gray are he certainly <UNK> to the beat of his own drummer he was never at a loss for words and he obviously felt that those watching and listening to him would be interested in every aspect of his life experiences and thoughts no matter how trivial at times br br most of us are not quite as far off the wall as he was most of us aren't as interested in sharing the most minute parts of ourselves with others even one on one or in small groups let alone on stage br br but that doesn't make it any less interesting to watch and listen to this <UNK> unusual man and after seeing one of his performances on reflection we can find many of his <UNK> <UNK> were perhaps more relevant to our own lives and thoughts than we may have first thought br br granted he was a new york avant garde type of personality and undeniably a bit strange there are those who would maintain describing someone as new york and strange was being unnecessarily redundant br br i give him a 10 for the talent he presents in this genre which is his <UNK>
<START> an american werewolf in london had some funny parts but this one isn't so good the computer werewolves are just awful the perspective is all off it's like seeing them through a <UNK> mirror the writers step on the throat of many of their gags american boy says to <UNK> girl is there a around here instead of just leaving it at that they have to have the girl sigh and respond this is paris
<START> <UNK> minutes nope this thing is <UNK> minutes tops br br if you cannot guess the killer in this movie you had better throw your tv out the window because you ain't learned nothing in 20 years of cinematic slasher history br br and how come the plain star who never gets naked is always the one you want to get naked
<START> insanely well crafted mini series br br i recall seeing most of it twice when shown on american <UNK> on <UNK> was heavily promoted at the time i believe it might have been one of the very early mini series showing on <UNK> outside of the masterpiece theater series br br the full length production was shown i believe only once during its first broadcast was 6 8 hours total this length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours cut some interesting but slow scenes br br i am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and <UNK> a complete not edited version to dvd not worth creating a vhs version at this point br br would fit in very well in the mini series or dramatic history genre
<START> two escaped <UNK> step out of the woods and shoot two <UNK> in the head that's the first scene and it made me <UNK> <UNK> what was in store but by the end of the first half hour i was all swept up in the <UNK> of images not because i cared in the least about any of the characters but because i was <UNK> at how <UNK> the film was and was curious to see how truly low it could sink br br frank <UNK> and red are the ex inmates after murdering the two innocent <UNK> they <UNK> through the woods and <UNK> their way into the isolated cabin of dean <UNK> and his two sons the attorney keith and the estranged homosexual <UNK> the <UNK> at first pretend their car has broken down and they need to use the phone but they gradually reveal their identities br br well it looks like familiar territory so far desperate hours or funny games maybe but hang on the gay son is in <UNK> with the two it seems that <UNK> upon discovering his son in <UNK> <UNK> with another man named billy kicked billy around and threw him out billy went on to die and <UNK> now blames his dad for the death and indeed dad is something of a <UNK> when it comes to the fact that he was just found <UNK> with a secretary notwithstanding br br the grief stricken <UNK> just searched and searched looking for someone else who had known billy someone with whom he could share his despair it turned out to be one of the <UNK> and now <UNK> is determined to see them to their freedom br br it gets all twisted after that people talk they talk and talk they talk continually and not about the two mad killers who just can't wait to put one between their eyes no the dialog goes something like you were just so scared of something inside yourself that you even drove away your own son that's <UNK> the young gay guy talking to <UNK> it's as if an afternoon domestic drama had had its <UNK> mixed with a killer thriller in some kind of <UNK> device or cocktail <UNK> br br the only real performance is given by james <UNK> as the more <UNK> and ominous of the two <UNK> and that's mainly because of his gruff but fluid <UNK> which sounds like lance and his wide <UNK> like lips he's easy on the eyes and ears br br dean <UNK> has given decent performances including his <UNK> turn in blue <UNK> in which he was my supporting player but here <UNK> <UNK> years or slack direction has shaped his every move and every <UNK> into a stereotype it's as if he were reading stage directions look surprised and shout <UNK> and following them literally there's not a surprise in a br br if the gay son jason <UNK> ever <UNK> it must have been while i was <UNK> at the same time because i missed it he has a long neck and just one expression in his <UNK> as the secondary villain fades into the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the attorney son is robert <UNK> keith i hope he didn't quit his day job br br the direction is pedestrian the staging <UNK> without being in the least innovative sometimes it's confusing i lost track of where everyone was supposed to be as the killers are <UNK> around on the <UNK> and the family has locked itself inside with a shotgun i also couldn't understand how <UNK> could put a blast through the door hit <UNK> and knock him in a back flip off the <UNK> and then <UNK> could simply stand up dust himself off and come up with a <UNK> <UNK> like okay two can play that game but why go on see it if you must
<START> like many i first saw the water babies as a child young teen in the late seventies early eighties it has remained with me since then with its catchy tunes memorable portrayals less then successful animation and a story full of heart <UNK> and ultimately good <UNK> evil recently i sat down and saw it again after at least two decades passing and i noticed this time around its striking similarities to the wizard of oz no these aren't blatant but hear me out in this one we have a boy and his dog having personal problems at home running away from something and in the scene right after they run away changing the substance of their appearance in this one the boy and dog become animated in the wizard of oz dorothy and <UNK> are in color in this one the boy and dog are told they must find the water babies for answers and then ultimately the for <UNK> and he has the ability to let tom go home if he shows he has courage etc in the wizard of oz dorothy must also find an <UNK> figure that <UNK> her before he will allow her to return home in the water babies tom meets three characters that will help him on his journey to the water babies dorothy has three <UNK> as well when each <UNK> is met we are entertained with a rendering of hi hi hi hi hi we're on our way in the wizard it is we're off to see the wizard dorothy has a good witch sort of look after her tom has a woman with many roles <UNK> <UNK> do the same if you look closely at the two there are many other that being said the water babies is not a <UNK> in any way i was just commenting on the eerie likes between the two this film has some solid performances from bad guys bernard <UNK> and the always fascinating james mason the kids playing tom and ella are good the supporting cast of joan <UNK> love her voice david <UNK> and the vocal talents of john pertwee and lance <UNK> add greatly to the mix i must confess that the animation is less than sterling even for its time but is adequate enough to the challenge the three animated characters that help tom get home are all likable i always have trouble picking my favorite between the french <UNK> and the john mr <UNK> like the scene where we hear this <UNK> <UNK> laugh from a <UNK> <UNK> only to see a with a huge <UNK> <UNK> bow tie bob out always has me rolling the water babies is a lot of fun sure it is more of a children's film but it has and always shall have a fond place in my heart the bulk of the credit for what <UNK> the film does have must go to director lionel <UNK> <UNK> is a wonderful comedic actor and his sense of humor is clearly evident throughout
<START> as an avid cinema go er i felt that whilst i was <UNK> my favourite movies i felt it only fair to rank my most hated films br br i'm afraid i really have nothing positive to say about this movie it is in fact one of only two films that i have ever walked out on in fairness i went back and watched the movie again to give it another chance and sat through it only to wish that i should have stayed away br br the sad thing is the movie has a really decent cast and crew but then even the <UNK> stars in hollywood cant bring a dead duck of a script to life br br stay away save yourself from this truly <UNK> <UNK> 1 10
<START> my first question is not about the horrible acting not about the horrendous writing it is the directing the choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions i have ever seen why does every single bad guy have to die in slow motion i was about to beat myself with a rubber <UNK> the camera shots make it so that you can't see whats going on i was just about to turn the movie off because of <UNK> accent when it made it to the sex scene so i thought it might get better well it did not if you rate special effects on an a b c rating scale i would have to put it around a w or so and did i mention the acting wow was it bad and the worst part of the entire expect to die experience is the blatant <UNK> of the phrase on the cover which is the matrix just got <UNK> comparing this movie to the matrix is easily the worst comparison i have ever seen if you haven't seen this movie don't unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall
<START> i had to see this on the british <UNK> plane it was terribly bad acting and a dumb story not even a kid would enjoy this something to switch off if possible
<START> the movie is apparently based on a popular french horror novel by arthur from <UNK> not that i had ever heard about it before but has been a popular subject before for movies and mini series the first movie got released way back in <UNK> simultaneously with the novel arthur was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously the character is one of his best known creations br br once upon a time sophie was a promising new european actress who would <UNK> hollywood she has now however dropped back again to movies like this one nothing wrong with playing in french quality movies since it's the country she <UNK> from but this movie is just <UNK> br br problem is mostly that the movie relies on its special effects to make the movie good and scary well horror and special effects never really have been a good combination though with some exceptions here and there it's not like the special effects are bad in this one especially for an european movie it is simply good but it s just misplaced since the movie gave the feeling it could had easily done without its effect it would had actually made the movie a better and scarier one to watch no doubt about that really br br the movie is just not ever tense or engaging to watch also since the movie seems to have difficulties picking the right approach at times the movie picks a light and just less serious approach while at others it clearly attempts to be a good scary horror movie this is mostly the reason why the movie just doesn't work out on any level you can say that the movie is even a bit boring it all also definitely gets worse toward the ending after a while you just stop caring about this movie and its story and you start wishing you had decided to watch something else instead br br the editing seems totally off it uses too fast cuts without much style while the fast editing was obviously intended to give the movie a good modern style also the time line is just plain messed up at times as if some sequences got edited in the wrong order br br the musical score is also really annoying and at times doesn't even sounds to fit the movie as if it all long got scored before the movie finished shooting i can't believe composer bruno <UNK> is an oscar nominated composer the musical score is almost just as annoying as the movie its sound effects br br the movie is filled with many characters which you however just couldn't care less about it also just seems very unlikely that a woman like sophie would ever fall for a man such as the movie also features julie christie which is nice but just doesn't add much to the movie br br a horrible watch br br 3 10
<START> warning if the <UNK> brothers or david lynch define your taste in film disregard this review and move on br br yes i borrowed the one line summary from the book about president ronald reagan but among other virtues this movie <UNK> the role that character plays in the lives of honorable human beings this film is full of honest decent people and they have integrity to spare in a word they have character br br a small <UNK> unless you know the history of <UNK> ii you probably don't know that from captain <UNK> arrival on the island to the fall of <UNK> 3 and one half years have passed the average viewer might think the romance was of the <UNK> variety that is not so the romance develops slowly which gives it both dignity and meaning the film's deliberate pace may be the director's way of <UNK> time br br some reviews have criticized <UNK> italian accent the italian speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is quite good br br the history was right on the mark yes the germans turned against their italian allies who for the most part were reluctant allies from the start if you find that shocking keep in mind that the french <UNK> fleet was blown up by the british in 1940 just after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it fall in the hands of the <UNK> government or worse the nazis br br the depiction of the italians as educated and <UNK> was a compliment to an educated and <UNK> civilization br br this film was beautifully photographed and its story was lyrical the script was not thought provoking nor was it clever but here was a situation where confusion and <UNK> were not needed nor would they have been appropriate br br the story is tender and the message is uplifting the characters are honest brave earnest sympathetic and likeable it's a nice little film 8 10 br br br br
<START> the performances rate better than the rating i've given this work simply because i will not support a movie which shows any child or mentally challenged person how to obtain cook and <UNK> <UNK> into their bodies br br this is a disgusting film which serves no purpose in the world but to <UNK> and attempt to <UNK> the <UNK> lifestyle it bears convincing performances which add to my disgust what were these people thinking i could not enjoy a movie such as this it's enough to make someone who has never done drugs think about it and those who have and have redeemed themselves consider <UNK> i'm surprised it doesn't make every clean <UNK> who sees it fall off the <UNK> br br there's nothing good about this movie which stands more as a how to get strung out <UNK> drama this is the epitome of what's wrong with hollywood br br utterly disgusting br br it rates a 1 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i do think tom hanks is a good actor i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little i was very disappointed in the movie one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of <UNK> on a <UNK> there is a totally unnecessary train roller coaster scene there are some characters and scenes that seem scary for little children for whom this movie was made the north pole scenes with santa and the <UNK> could have been cute and charming there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters it usually doesn't work to make a short children's book into a feature film this movie totally <UNK> on my nerves
<START> if you have seen this movie then you will know that it is one of the worst bollywood movies ever made bollywood is known to copy hollywood movies who would of known that they will copy terminator 2 the difference between both film <UNK> are hollywood spends millions and bollywood spends 100 thousands average thats the problem with this film if you want to make a <UNK> style movie then do it properly the director added a bogus fantasy storyline about a <UNK> snake who finds his long lost girl in the previous birth dead by 2 guys but the blame goes to 10 people she suddenly <UNK> into a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people they blame for her death not to mention the <UNK> snake guy or villain has some kind of super powers he can <UNK> into anything he can fly disappear fire power wind power you name it he has it he even gets and survives the style you are probably wondering how he survives its best not to ask and its best not to waste time and money on this movie its best just to forget this film even came out i think its a shame to use a big for this outrageous movie with a nonsense storyline
<START> if you feel like wasting <UNK> minutes on a film that makes no sense is badly written with a bad plot and bad acting then this little gem is for you recommended for those who are about to fall asleep major annoyance will be felt by the awake viewer do not pay to see this movie
<START> it is hard for a lover of the novel <UNK> <UNK> to sit through this bbc adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the tv screen in fact if jane austen herself were to see this she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out maggie adaptation has made <UNK> <UNK> into what it <UNK> the gothic novel and the readers of gothic novels br br the role of catherine <UNK> in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to <UNK> catherine a open hearted generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her but the henry of the novel is not a snuff taking <UNK> wielding sappy line making hero of a gothic novel he is a <UNK> a nearly handsome man with a messy room and a living that's right henry is a <UNK> a charm that is completely dropped from the script some of the best scenes from novel when henry completely deadpan outrageously <UNK> the literally minded catherine on <UNK> <UNK> mrs <UNK> etc are not portrayed in the adaptation a large section of <UNK> personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted besides peter <UNK> appearance is not accurate henry is supposed to be 24 or 25 dark hair and a brown skin not 35 or 40 and blond br br there are so many other <UNK> within the adaptation that <UNK> surprise and disgust who is the and what is she doing in the story why is john less of a <UNK> and more of a <UNK> why is <UNK> <UNK> a castle catherine of the novel with her romantic visions expects hidden <UNK> and dark <UNK> but is very disappointed to discover that <UNK> <UNK> is actually a comfortable modern house another element of satire why portray general as a drunk why does catherine have those strange visions of mrs allen <UNK> her finger etc <UNK> imagination only runs away with her at <UNK> with henry there to correct her gently and lastly why are so many facts concerning the family and mrs death altered unnecessarily to make the story more horrible ' all of these <UNK> and more simply are too strange to be overlooked br br
<START> this is definitely the worst vampire flicks of all times i started to watch this right after interview with the vampire and i was thoroughly disappointed not only did this movie's script have as big as the grand canyon the movie seemed to jump from one scene to another leaving the viewers thoroughly puzzled the vampire <UNK> played by stuart <UNK> was terrible having a good body does not make you an actor the end of the queen was too easy and sudden insulting the viewers intelligence i'll give this one star because <UNK> actually tried her best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good other than that i would advice anne rice to take an <UNK> and start <UNK> those who destroyed her brilliant story
<START> i'll be brief i normally hate films like this but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go granted there are some major flaws in it some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end br br but what are they well it's got a cool little plot by no means is it original but it is better presented than other films of its kind the three main stars <UNK> johnson long put in fairly decent performances that more than make up for the distinct lack of quality from the supporting cast the fat cop and coach quinn really <UNK> me and the scripting is slick and witty even if it is poor in places br br the bottom line is though this film is so cute i <UNK> all the way through it and it has a place in my video collection purely because it could cheer up anybody you really have to be some kind of <UNK> bore not to like this i dare somebody to sit through this without <UNK> br br i do recommend this one if you want a simple fun and above all enjoyable watch you won't regret it br br top

<START> if they gave out awards for the most <UNK> and messed up movies in the world japanese cinema would clean up their exploitation cinema <UNK> the floor with most other <UNK> the most extreme examples being absolutely jaw dropping <UNK> in bad taste nauseating gore <UNK> weirdness and misogynistic sex br br guts of a beauty is a prime example of such whacked out filth offering <UNK> viewers just over an hour of full on <UNK> and gratuitous violence topped off with some very insane j splatter goodness br br the film opens with a young woman named whose search for her missing sister has led her into the hands of some nasty <UNK> who proceed to rape her and shoot her full of strong <UNK> called angel rain after the gangsters have finished having their fun with the poor woman she manages to escape and <UNK> to a nearby hospital where sexy psychologist <UNK> attempts to help however the <UNK> and confused ends up throwing herself off the hospital roof turning into a water <UNK> as she hits the ground at least that what it looked like to me br br seeking to avenge death <UNK> a member of the <UNK> to her office and whilst <UNK> him off him into attacking his fellow gang members after goes slash happy with a knife in the <UNK> <UNK> he is severely beaten and stabbed forced to tell of his meeting with and then <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> pieces br br the psychologist is then captured by the gang subjected to a spot of forced <UNK> whilst simultaneously being forced to give head to a <UNK> slut and <UNK> with angel which she promptly it the gangsters then <UNK> her body in the boot of their car along with the remains of ready for <UNK> br br before they can <UNK> the corpses however the super <UNK> has an unexpected effect on she returns from the dead as a monster with a <UNK> penis and a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> on revenge sets about killing the <UNK> one by one this leads to some memorable scenes of outrageously gory splatter including a messy head a man being <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a woman being screwed to death by its giant <UNK> <UNK> br br as you can most likely tell from the above synopsis this is some crazy screwed up stuff and probably not to the taste of most sane people but for those <UNK> who have long tired of mainstream cinema and are already well <UNK> in asian excess guts of a beauty should prove to be delightfully <UNK> and <UNK> fun br br 7 5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for imdb
<START> i watched it last night and again this morning that's how much i liked it there is something about this movie when the movie was almost over i was about to cry i would strongly recommend latter days to my friends it's definitely worth seeing i agree with those who say that some parts of the movie do not look very realistic for example both main characters are totally cute and in perfect physical shape although round is also a type of shape i rarely meet people like this as <UNK> and i have never met any in couples other parts of the movie including all those <UNK> do not look very realistic as well but after all it is a movie not a life story
<START> yes this film has many gay characters it also has straight characters characters who are not sure about their sexuality people who are searching for some truth about their existence br br this is not a film about sexual <UNK> it's about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cleverly <UNK> the various <UNK> of the relationships and the <UNK> constantly shifting relationships the serial killer element is a bit less successful it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and unlike the rest of the film is <UNK> heavy handed br br thomas gibson centers and grounds the film it's a quiet performance but behind the handsome arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him the supporting cast is strong especially <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> friend a dom for hire with powers her role is more metaphor than a literal <UNK> strangely innocent and <UNK> at the same time she represents the light and dark of the characters' sexual consciousness br br the film's involving and often surprises in its character development the effect is somewhat like robert altman directing a david mamet script the dialogue doesn't shrink from some <UNK> observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning often in our search for love and a conventional relationship we ignore the love that already exists around us in our friends family those who are able to see us as we are <UNK> and the writer brad <UNK> make some <UNK> observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways br br this film is a rewarding experience it may not be for <UNK> who can't get past the sexual <UNK> of some of the characters to see the greater <UNK> message of hope and redemption loneliness is a universal experience a film like this that <UNK> to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and <UNK> eye deserves applause and an open minded approach
<START> the role of buddy <UNK> is no stretch for kevin spacey he's played version of that character many times other better films this is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain <UNK> without which buddy would be as flat and <UNK> as all of the other characters in this pointless little farce the script leaves little time for plot or character development resembling a porn flick in its rush to get to the good stuff the difference is that here the good stuff isn't people <UNK> each other but <UNK> pain making it appropriate viewing for young adults br br of course there's nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to watch people having sex and i guess there's nothing wrong with swimming with sharks if you want to watch people <UNK> physical emotional and psychological torture but if you're looking for <UNK> satire interesting characters or anything else that even attempts to engage more than your <UNK> passions you should probably look elsewhere
<START> i <UNK> to watch this film for one reason and one reason alone samuel l jackson i happen to like him a lot i had seen no previews or trailers for this overlooked film so went into it with no real expectations br br jackson didn't disappoint as <UNK> a down on his luck blues man in the deep south and delivered perhaps his most powerful performance ever including playing and singing a number of excellent blues tunes but the real surprise here was christina <UNK> at best a vapid <UNK> in real life who took the role of the sexually abused town tramp <UNK> and made her a believable almost even likable character watching the decidedly non sexual relationship <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> was simply amazing br br justin timberlake pop star turned wanna be actor should go back to causing wardrobe <UNK> and <UNK> around a pop stage his mostly forced performance was distracting at best from the real story here br br this movie is raw gritty and at times quite in your face not everyone will like it those that do however will be quickly moving it to the top of their favorites list

<START> first of all the whole idea of <UNK> a classic such as psycho is nothing short of ludicrous a lot of time and effort was wasted here i am sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve on the original so they must have had a tribute to alfred hitchcock on their minds however the idea that began as a well <UNK> tribute results in being a slap in the face to the horror master this movie is poorly produced poorly acted and unnecessary to begin with the original classic stands well on it's own even after 40 years the event of <UNK> returning from the grave and coming after the people responsible for this piece of trash is unlikely but if i were them i would sleep with one eye open just in case don't waste your time
<START> disney's <UNK> <UNK> pictures presents a wonderfully told fact based sports drama directed by actor bill paxton photography is superb but story sometimes <UNK> along this film is about the 20 year old amateur <UNK> francis <UNK> <UNK> and his competition in the <UNK> u s open what a story a once in a lifetime chance for a supposedly incapable young man to play along side the best <UNK> of the time including british <UNK> harry stephen and ted ray stephen marcus a <UNK> ending leaves a <UNK> in the throat the cast also includes peter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> robin <UNK> and possibly stealing the show is josh <UNK> who plays eddie <UNK> <UNK> and best friend

<START> this looks so good on paper matt damon lawrence <UNK> jean reno nice right and a heist with <UNK> million sounds like a kick ass crime movie br br big disappointment i <UNK> the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousy br br but more than that it the pseudo <UNK> dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong it's very much made for tv stuff br br all in all hugely disappointing it score points for being what it is but loses them <UNK> for being <UNK> not very interesting at all
<START> this might have a spoiler br br when i first started watching this movie i thought it was ok the music was good and that <UNK> dream sequence i was willing to forgive but the lack of looks in the main character and all of the other characters for that matter made me <UNK> in watching the rest of this film i know totally vain the music at the beginning was spirited and fitting i thought for a mock gothic novel but come on <UNK> music for an early 19th century film it totally didn't fit this movie was totally boring and if you're looking to watch a good period film or an austen don't rent <UNK> <UNK> i give it a 30 30 a failing grade

<START> ok lets get one thing straight i love dinosaur movies even the bad ones so with this in mind lets proceed <UNK> is a truly awful film in fact its not even a film in its own right as it is <UNK> together from bits of <UNK> <UNK> 2 primal species <UNK> 3 there is some new footage with eric roberts as a sheriff and his <UNK> sidekick running around looking confused frightened or whatever it is there trying to convey badly on the emotional scale but then how can they react to something that was filmed several years earlier the producers yes roger corman i'm talking about you even went to the <UNK> of hiring 2 people from <UNK> to play bit parts so there grisly death scenes can be <UNK> so this film is the <UNK> of the cheap watch the 3 original movies there no oscar winners but they have some and entertainment value but avoid <UNK> oh it also has the most pointless sex scene that runs for nearly 10 minutes do you think they were trying to pad out the running time
<START> has a very unique story and i will never look at <UNK> the same way again not really spine <UNK> horror this film has a dark <UNK> acid trip feel to it during certain parts was it just me or did you see <UNK> visuals the camera shots are interesting and the movie lets your imagination run wild the bizarre supernatural feel of this film draws you in just as the title suggests acting is done well and the town setting itself seems wrong with to begin with br br this may take a few viewings for it to sink in a great <UNK> film
<START> this is the ultimate and i mean the ultimate adventure classic the plot is good versus evil there have always been an abundance of films that depict gray areas and not enough on the basic good against evil to account for the real cases of good against evil in the real world only recently have film makers tried to even the odds in real life well over half of situations are black and white but only a <UNK> of movies make it seem that way this movie is the best example of a back and white look it is best seen in black and white the hero is in the worst situation he is in the territory of a man who wants to murder him and among various enemies the movie gives the feel that he is hopelessly <UNK> and can't count on help his enemy the count has numerous resources the <UNK> wife was forced into marriage with him and she knows from his past history that sooner or later he will kill her as he does all his wives she and the hero become allies and fall in love in away that could win over anyone watching unless that person just wants to be a contrary brat anyone who helps them is killed they have no escape the situation is hopeless so will they survive in the end you won't guess unless you've read spoilers the movie also has a lot of great atmosphere adventure and intrigue along with <UNK> <UNK> as a bad guy and boris karloff in his best role ever as a decent guy usually cast as a bad guy karloff was at his best when presented with more complex roles such as this one <UNK> was rarely given a complex role although he his stuff in a few movies such as of mice and men this is little more than a cameo for him still the tension never stops there is suspense and danger throughout perfectly written perfectly cast and perfectly directed this is what a movie should be pure escape pure adventure
<START> it'll soon be 10 <UNK> since this movie was released still makes me laugh if u enjoy this film try the new <UNK> <UNK> as hilarious and my favourite bit of the film must be when salman realises that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point and he actually says it out loud u just wanna bash him but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing fantastic film 10 10
<START> very intelligent language usage of ali which you <UNK> miss in one word sentence wicked so keep it real and pass it on
<START> a very mediocre film based on a superb series of stories and novels i hope somebody someday will be able to film it the right way in the meantime look for the books by a a very <UNK> fantasy by now there should be a translation in english there <UNK> in german for sure
<START> i knew nothing about this film until i watched it my brother in fact suggested i take a look normally his <UNK> aren't much cop however but i was stuck for something to watch so i watched it br br well to cut a long story short i give it 10 10 br br the film centers around two people that meet whilst <UNK> at the same place one is initially very <UNK> upon the institution around him the other is a rebel one does what he likes the other as he's told br br from the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building and see how they rub off a little on each other it's a remarkable piece of work that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist people <UNK> out of bath <UNK> or <UNK> coming to save the day br br there's a fair amount of <UNK> and reality in there not everything can ever go just right not all can ever be <UNK> and this film delightfully shows the lot br br if you watch this film and are not impressed i'd suggest that you don't watch anything again
<START> now don't get me wrong i love seeing half naked chicks <UNK> around it's part of the fun of a <UNK> restaurant <UNK> the belly dancers but it doesn't make much of a plot br br my first major problem is the music i have the feeling that when ann rice wrote the vampire <UNK> the cure was more the style of the music he would have liked though i could be wrong i know relating to current <UNK> music might have seemed like a good idea but they did a horrific job <UNK> it <UNK> was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking br br second and someone else said it <UNK> two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea <UNK> could have been a movie in it's own right and a damn good one if done right i honestly don't think queen of the damned lends itself to a movie very well though i would love to see a movie that <UNK> a creation story there's too much how to word this <UNK> in the book for it to be a very interesting movie and the retelling they did <UNK> it pretty badly now mind you it's been a long time since i've read it i always thought <UNK> tale of the body thief and the devil were much more action packed and would have made better movies br br i know a lot of people hey myself included who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture i tend to agree with them there <UNK> had a nice body though
<START> <UNK> <UNK> like novel 'a way through the <UNK> has been adapted by julian <UNK> who also directs this drawing room suspense piece it is a film whose effect relies on the cast portraying the <UNK> <UNK> characters and it is here that <UNK> directorial choices are superb the story has a linear line that is easy to follow but the beauty of the film is the <UNK> of each player as a single incident <UNK> a <UNK> of disasters br br james <UNK> tom <UNK> is a successful business obsessed <UNK> in london married to anne emily watson who needs more in her life the couple being <UNK> live in the country in a beautiful estate <UNK> by their long term maggie linda <UNK> they attend social <UNK> and meet among others william rupert everett the <UNK> lazy wealthy neighbor anne decides they should entertain their neighbors and against gruff <UNK> anne proceeds with planning james <UNK> to <UNK> attend due to <UNK> on the night of the party there is a hit and run accident in which <UNK> husband is accidentally killed by someone in a range <UNK> she observed when james returns home he sees a scratch on <UNK> range <UNK> and suspects william to be the <UNK> anne <UNK> james from going to the police with the information <UNK> possible good can it do but ruin <UNK> life as a <UNK> and father and son of an important <UNK> ' from this first the virus <UNK> james confronts bill who talks james out of going to the police anne <UNK> it was she who was driving <UNK> <UNK> and is the one responsible james convinces anne to keep it quiet because it would ruin his reputation anne <UNK> she is having an affair with bill and the three of them <UNK> that they will stick together on their big lie for the sake of the greater good anne eventually <UNK> to the guilt of not telling her beloved maggie that she is the one responsible and maggie herself guilty of a previous <UNK> whose life was saved by <UNK> mercy to hire her anyway is the agent who draws the story to its surprising conclusion lies <UNK> lies that <UNK> lies et <UNK> br br the major impact of this intrigue is the manner in which the isolated tragedy <UNK> each of the characters involved each changes in a dramatic way <UNK> <UNK> gives the finest performance of a career filled with brilliant performances he is able to say more with his <UNK> and facial expressions than about any actor before the audience today likewise the gifted emily watson adds yet another fine role to her <UNK> as does the surprisingly smarmy rupert everett who despite being yet another wealthy british gives us a man both <UNK> of spirit and yet ultimately <UNK> and the always fine linda <UNK> takes a small role and it making her character quietly central to the chaotic web of lies br br the cinematography by tony pierce roberts and the musical score by add <UNK> to the multiple <UNK> the story encounters this is ensemble playing at its finest which always means that the director julian <UNK> has a fine grasp on the piece the interplay of these fine people makes the dodgy story work very well indeed grady <UNK>
<START> dreadful a friend of mine who obviously thought i had an abysmal sense of humour recommended this br br it's <UNK> i almost switched it off it is only my <UNK> desire to not leave things unfinished that prevented me doing so br br this was evidently a british attempt to make a movie with a bunch of also ran tv actors using some lame script from their mate in the business i struggle to think of anything even approaching the <UNK> of this movie less funny than global warming br br i'm not normally so <UNK> but i watched this well over ten years ago and thought that i wasted an hour or so of my life on it is destructive br br <UNK> plot less useless <UNK> br br i'd rather eat my feet than watch it again
<START> focus is another great movie starring william h macy i first discovered macy in <UNK> and i've seen a few of his films and he hasn't yet <UNK> me macy is the <UNK> nice guy with something to hide in focus he plays the role of lawrence newman a loyal and hard working stiff who <UNK> his handicapped mother at home the scene is set after world war ii at the height of <UNK> newman is the head of human resources for a company which is basically anti <UNK> after he accidentally hires a woman of jewish descent he is asked to buy a pair of glasses to improve his failing <UNK> br br unbelievably the simple act of buying glasses has great <UNK> on his life and that of <UNK> hart his wife played by a great laura dern as the film <UNK> newman will begin to see a whole different world where being jewish is akin to being an animal br br the movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal the chilling thought is that in some places it probably still is
<START> yes this movie was just bad in every way in things like cast effects boredom excitement and of course being fantastic and we all know the four heroes in this one were a bit more colourful compared to the new ones but it still has to go a fantastic bore like this really was just silly trash which i knew nobody would like when i saw it i mean surely with that budget about 3 or 4 good movies could have been made but no i am just glad that the new version made this year totally showed everyone how the fantastic four should have been made with good story great cast like jessica alba one of my favourite actresses otherwise it would have been totally forgotten but thankfully no the new one was excellent when i saw it with my mates at the cinema but this old fantastic bore has gotta go
<START> it is so refreshing to see a movie like this with actual mood and personality instead of just a bunch of cgi cartoon gimmicks this is a great horror spoof that has genuine chills along side some really great sets and performances its laughs are subtle but <UNK> because there is very little if any cgi there is no need to violently shake the camera around to hide the crappy effects this makes the movie immensely watchable compared to the other camera man must be sh ing his pants films of this genre that have come out in the last decade or so br br far more enjoyable than the big budget re made garbage being released by hollywood today br br see it
<START> this is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist michael cain is called upon to an autobiography of a colorful <UNK> hollywood star mickey rooney at times silliness becomes obnoxious this is not cain at his best rooney is way over the top notable support from <UNK> scott lionel and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> not easy to watch
<START> this concert is the type of concert that only comes around every twenty years or so <UNK> <UNK> on a dance floor era will certainly be remembered as one of the high points of her career she's 48 and she looks simply divine she keeps up with the dancers that are almost twenty years her junior i am also very glad to report that all the songs were sung live which is good because she actually sounds better live each song was so unique the visuals where stunning the performance of <UNK> to <UNK> was fantastic and had me <UNK> was exotic and gorgeous and was rich with political symbolism the <UNK> horn the american eagle set free i particularly liked the performance of 'i love new <UNK> i almost stood up in my <UNK> room and <UNK> when she told her critics to suck george <UNK> and then again i was impressed by the 70's inspired music <UNK> <UNK> this spectacular concert made a fan out of me br br verdict highly recommended with a capital h
<START> a truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict the movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being or being around a heroin addict really is good movie which will never truly be outdated excellent performances by all involved and the <UNK> set is <UNK> way of showing how bleak a world can become worth a look an education of sorts the golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a <UNK> lives in
<START> the digital effects were done on the cheap and the action sequences lack suspense this was essentially made for tv and it shows david <UNK> looks bored and <UNK> looks down right embarrassed and as for robert dick van dyke london accent no comment if you want to pass away an hour or two when you've nothing on then it will do if your going to buy the dvd wait a few weeks and pick it up in the bargain bin at <UNK> <UNK> thats where its heading if the budget was bigger and richard <UNK> book followed more closely then it could have been something special but as it stands its a bit poor watch the trailer instead or read the book and see what could have been
<START> i don't even know where to start i did not like it it did not behave like a story and so much was <UNK> into the movie the pot the son was gay the murder was justified what possible reason could there be in the script for linda aka penelope to exist that was never explained it was all fluid <UNK> on a table and left dripping off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor br br why did vanessa redgrave make a five second cameo why did diane <UNK> use her bullets over broadway character without the camp fun why was jane <UNK> in the storyline to begin with the list is endless the movie ended and we all looked at each other like did you understand any of this br br i tell ya one thing if i watched my long lost dad get murdered i certainly wouldn't be <UNK> the murderer tell ya another thing if bob broke up with bob what purpose did hiding the son in the closet have was bob going to have sex with bob in front of the son how did the murderer contact the son so easily br br if this review sounds confused it is because this was a waste of film talent and time what the heck did the dead shrink have to do with anything br br this is one of the worst films i have ever seen because it should have could have been better stronger and it should have made some kind of sense any sense instead we are given a watered down <UNK> the film from the 70s complete with a murder and tired performances reading boring words from a script that is completely insane br br by pass it folks or maybe me and the rest of the people who reviewed this film are too stupid to understand it all i mean after all it is a french film
<START> this is one of those movies which get better with each viewing i watched it three times and actually <UNK> on imdb because i wanted to comment on it movies about food have been done before some of them are really good as for instance a certain japanese comedy which <UNK> of asian cinema will know anyway but this one really is in its own league at its core is a <UNK> christian <UNK> <UNK> the ideal of kindness but far from being <UNK> it also <UNK> the good in each and every of us regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof there is a <UNK> understatement and <UNK> in <UNK> feast but this makes the message of the movie if anything stronger not at all weaker if you cannot attend the extraordinary physical <UNK> offered by <UNK> you're still welcome to this feast of the soul highly recommended
<START> this is another notorious mexican horror film however while the original spanish language version is quite tame all sorts of gore and nudity were inserted for the english dubbed <UNK> prepared by who did similar duties on the curious dr 1967 <UNK> and like the u s version of that film had previously been available on dvd through something weird image br br i watched the original first and while no great shakes it was fairly engaging especially with a plot as familiar as this one was a doctor goes beyond the call of duty in attempting to save the life of his <UNK> ill son he even has a <UNK> game <UNK> assistant played by carlos lopez who had <UNK> a strikingly similar role though in a more sinister vein in the curse of the crying woman <UNK> i know that several mexican films <UNK> horror with the <UNK> wrestling genre but i had never watched one myself this element is present here in fact the heroine is a wrestler but the two styles are perhaps thankfully kept apart that said the wrestling sequences are competently done with some of the moves proving highly amusing br br the doctor's son is transformed into a monster looking like the incredible hulk with mud <UNK> over his face after having had an heart <UNK> into him but then when this is replaced with that of a <UNK> female wrestler he stays this way and grows a pair of <UNK> to boot shouldn't he realistically have turned into a <UNK> though i guess that wouldn't have been very interesting the climactic <UNK> sequence in which the monster kidnaps a child and meets his demise at the hands of the police is reminiscent of the ghost of frankenstein 1942 my favorite unintentionally funny moments in the film however occur when the doctor trying to comfort his son tells him that he'll soon be <UNK> only to turn his back soon after on the verge of tears and also the <UNK> look he gives his crippled assistant as the latter <UNK> slowly into the car when they're about to chase the monster who has escaped from the lab br br the alternate nude scenes work for the film these were actually done by <UNK> himself for a mexican version entitled horror y <UNK> but its reputation is largely based on the added material showing over the top violence such as an <UNK> being <UNK> out of its <UNK> a and even a person's head being torn off there are also several graphic operation <UNK> which however give rise to a goof while it's made clear that only two people are involved in the operation we see a third pair of hands constantly holding an <UNK> mask to the <UNK> face br br the film is also said to be a loose remake of own black and white horror film doctor of doom <UNK> but since i haven't watched that one i can't say how much of it was actually <UNK> for night of the bloody apes
<START> a talented high school <UNK> senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all star high school football game when he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a <UNK> <UNK> if he plays well br br all too often these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen full matt certainly fits this profile but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager both over confident and vulnerable optimistic and cynical by turns influenced by amy matt grows into a man of character and heart he in turn forms friendships with his <UNK> which influences his growth as an <UNK> and as a team player br br full ride has all the elements we love to see in a movie great acting admirable characters exciting sports scenes poignant drama and a love story still while one may have seen these elements in other films full ride is <UNK> by performances that are sincere and occasionally even moving perhaps what's most impressive about full ride is its sense of reality although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree clearly a disgruntled student who for quite obvious reasons received a poor grade in his film class director mark grounds the film in a believable situation and location and does a great job of getting down to the <UNK> of what life is like in a small town these characters are real people <UNK> in realistic situations which often create the most compelling entertainment on one level it is a love story on another it is a character study and yet another it is a simple football film all of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle
<START> i just got done watching the edge of love by the way this is one of the worst titles so far this year and it felt like a chore watching <UNK> <UNK> unlikable <UNK> looking character made me cringe even more throughout the coarse of the film br br it took me four nights to watch this it was so boring the only good thing about it was cillian murphy he's always good believable and is severely under looked in many films this however was just not good enough for him br br apart from the unlikable characters boring storyline the plot was also emotionally unsatisfying i felt like i spent my time watching this for nothing which i did i should have done the smart thing and turned it off but i kept it on out of respect for cillian murphy and the great cinematography
<START> from 2002 on dutch cinema finally got better again this movie is still part and a example of the bad period of dutch cinema br br the story is needlessly told in flashback style all of the <UNK> sequences set in france are completely redundant and add nothing to the story emotions or power for some reason european filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not <UNK> i never understood why or what the appeal of it is br br the story self also isn't exactly the greatest it isn't always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell the story of a young <UNK> boy falling in love with a wild young girl who later turns out to be quite psychotic might sound good enough on paper and even shows some parallels to paul verhoeven's <UNK> fruit to which this movie often was compared to before and at the time of its release however the end result is far from comparable the story fails to capture the right emotions which is also due to the unimaginative performances from the actors the way the story is told also makes the movie far from always interesting or compelling i lost interest for this movie at about 40 minutes through the movie br br at the time this movie was made both and angela were promising rising stars with great potential and ambitions but both their careers have pretty much <UNK> up by now angela seems to give her family more attention than her career that is not a bad thing of course while tried to start a career in hollywood he never got any further than playing some small bit parts in 2 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to be honest i'm not surprised it's not that he is a bad actor and he certainly has got the right looks but his english just isn't good enough to put it mildly just listen to him speaking english in the beginning of this movie and you'll understand what i mean they are really not bad actors but for some reason it doesn't show in this movie it's probably also due to the poor dialog i still kind of liked beau van he's been criticized a lot but his acting seems very natural he always keeps the characters close to who he self is br br it by no means is one of the worst movies ever made but it's not exactly one i would recommend either bad and uninteresting storytelling makes this a bad movie br br 4 10
<START> why oh why did they have to try and make a sequel to one of the greatest christmas movies of all time the movie is a train wreck on every level and should have never been made randy <UNK> portrayal of cousin eddie is an over the top caricature of his previous <UNK> as cousin eddie also the eddie character is not interesting enough to carry an entire movie even eye candy sung hi lee could not redeem this hunk of holiday crap please do not waste your time on this move just watch the original again
<START> this film <UNK> on channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of comedies from hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s in fact to the tune of the jolly fat policeman they had a montage of scenes from the films to introduce the series of people laughing including one of gary cooper when watching a film in a movie house a sequence from this film br br it all begins <UNK> enough when cooper a millionaire goes into a fancy department store in france to buy <UNK> but he only likes to sleep in the tops the clerk tyler brooke insists that he cannot sell half a pair of <UNK> as cooper wants <UNK> <UNK> hears the argument and offers to help she only likes to sleep in <UNK> what if brooke sells them each half brooke has never had such an offer before so he goes to the floor walker <UNK> <UNK> and asks him if this can be done he is disturbed too the request is quite unconventional eventually they contact the <UNK> owner charles <UNK> <UNK> is in bed and gets out his skinny frame supporting only a top if a suitably long one for the sake of censorship can they sell the two customers one set of <UNK> half for each properly horrified <UNK> answers no of course not that is communism so the sale is not allowed apparently nobody thinks that cooper can buy the total pair and sell half to <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> wife has had a reputation of falling flat most viewers not liking it because of a <UNK> of <UNK> character she is seen as quite <UNK> towards cooper selling herself to him on her terms br br actually <UNK> character is the <UNK> as he is rich and figures that everything has a price he is correct most of the time look at the way <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a father edward everett <UNK> sees his new son in law as a golden <UNK> he can use <UNK> <UNK> to marry <UNK> somehow includes an <UNK> that if he is <UNK> or chooses to not marry her he has to pay <UNK> <UNK> when he realizes this takes out a watch and in a most <UNK> voice says to cooper take your time my boy to come to a decision later we see <UNK> wardrobe has gotten more modern and <UNK> br br the film script by billy wilder and charles <UNK> <UNK> well with their script for mitchell <UNK> midnight also with <UNK> but with don <UNK> and john barrymore there <UNK> is willing to sell herself for a money marriage to to francis <UNK> but it is complicated by a <UNK> marriage to <UNK> she really loves <UNK> a taxi driver but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents married for love but poverty made them grow to hate each other this is not found in <UNK> wife where <UNK> does not have a background like that she is after all the daughter of a marquis her <UNK> plotting is to teach cooper a lesson about his standards br br the film has some nice work by the supporting staff including herman bing as a private eye who turns out to be hiding things that <UNK> learns about and a young david niven who has a set of choice moments as a stand in <UNK> bag and as a willing ear to cooper coop tells niven about his problems with <UNK> and how she is so <UNK> niven <UNK> <UNK> at the end cooper is touched by his <UNK> to hear what he had to say albert how much do i pay you cooper asks him niven thinks and says thirty five <UNK> a week sir cooper looks deeply into his soul and says shaking his head that's fair
<START> bad <UNK> sound lots of <UNK> <UNK> pointless scenes <UNK> guy sees interesting woman in <UNK> manages to stay there and watch her under the <UNK> of waiting for the building <UNK> to get a package says nothing stares <UNK> more <UNK> and other irritating <UNK> noise wait wait wait guy says nothing woman looks frightened or at least slightly disturbed about it and rightly so manager comes back with package guy goes up to the apartment with the package br br another example the guy and his host sit around watching bad tv more <UNK> noise and <UNK> wait wait wait wait guy wanders off to bed if you can stand to sit through any more of this movie you get to watch them watch tv again later br br if you want a story any dialogue entertainment or a well crafted film look elsewhere
<START> when <UNK> these events that took place some years ago hard to believe this actually happened i thought well there is a basis for an interesting story here many secrets were never <UNK> the horse never found the main <UNK> never captured etc br br however this film seems to be distracted by character study and very little attention <UNK> to the plot some other questions are raised though like why on earth would mickey rourke be in this film its good to see career has taken off again but he must cringe at the mention of this rubbish br br if the subject matter interests you do an internet search on the topic you'll be more educated and dare i say more entertained avoid this
<START> not having any idea what this film was about but based on the fact that john <UNK> was appearing in it we decided to watch it well it turned out not to be the <UNK> decision in fact as another commentary in this forum puts it we felt embarrassed for the actors that <UNK> in this movie br br while the film is by no means horrible it doesn't make sense at all the over the top performance by william baldwin doesn't help the situation either john <UNK> is a multi talented actor who deserved better the basic problem it seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy and the people in charge ran out of ideas along the way the result is an uneven film
<START> so where's my <UNK> <UNK> i seriously expected a <UNK> and <UNK> to drop from my ceiling for watching a full 30 minutes of that crap comedy central is truly dropping the ball lately trying to fill the void left by with multiple seasons of a retarded man <UNK> retarded men <UNK> duh <UNK> if you pay attention to the show you'll notice that when <UNK> isn't <UNK> over <UNK> and laughing at his own skits he only makes exaggerated observations which seem to lack any sense of humor you ever notice how people in drive really slow it's like <UNK> duh <UNK> not even the <UNK> and half naked hot chicks manage to distract from <UNK> distinct lack of talent furthermore <UNK> isn't even a as he constantly and <UNK> <UNK> he is which makes him a fraud on top of it all br br if anything good could be said about <UNK> it's his effort the man clearly has no talent but like a wounded in the mouth of a hungry alligator god knows he's trying
<START> if you love the book as i do stop watching the video after jean and joe meet in australia up to that point it is a fairly faithful rendition of the book and the visuals are great 10 out of 10 to that point and i've enjoyed it many times after that the story is seriously <UNK> and <UNK> in ways that really destroy the key part of the book i e how jean creates a town like alice springs in the early part the major change is to make a 40 something bachelor instead of a <UNK> year old widower this rather <UNK> this love story especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and <UNK> such as in the book he to joe at the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him in australia but in the video he gives joe no clue about <UNK> or intentions the last hour of the 5 hour video and <UNK> the last third of the book i see no reason why they threw in a fight between joe and jean it is quite out of character and seems to be just an aussie dig at <UNK> for telling them what to do then they bring on for the wedding instead of some three years later and have him read the <UNK> very strange especially in the context of the relationship between jean and <UNK> as cast in the video the whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters these <UNK> take up time in the last hour which was already not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how jean <UNK> as a place where she and joe can both be happy
<START> there are few movies that have the massive amount of non stop ninja action as ninja iii the <UNK> this is a story of love redemption and revenge however this is mainly a story about flipping out and killing people for no reason at all if you've been searching for a movie where a ninja goes absolutely nuts and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because he's a ninja and he can do it this is the movie for you i can't think of any movies to compare this to because no movie is this awesome wait oh have you ever seen the thing with two heads there is a part in that where the titular thing is riding around on a motorcycle and about a million cop cars are chasing it them around but they keep crashing and what not because you can't catch the thing with two heads well that is kind of what ninja iii is like i highly recommend this film especially if you like the following things ninjas swords <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> and <UNK> 2 electric <UNK> video games about being a <UNK> in a bar ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or good ninjas
<START> while it would be easy and accurate to go into why is at its heart <UNK> of many <UNK> oriented <UNK> in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms the real truth is that the show is repetitive full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows and the lead star is completely out of her element while i'm sure ms mcintire can sing and has a fan base that supports that being in a sitcom shooting out <UNK> and calling her the next lucille ball is far far removed from reality br br <UNK> herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put upon woman of which her entire family is centered yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character i could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be <UNK> <UNK> mcintire has no screen presence and to make a show around her seems very short <UNK> and <UNK> of most <UNK> <UNK> programming to push a sitcom full of men stupid women do everything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who can't afford cable br br the show is a waste of time the only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard <UNK> ripoff just
<START> while he was great in boogie nights i think that this was burt <UNK> best performance he's also a great director and has made a tough violent movie that doesn't hold back a <UNK> death by 12 <UNK> and is an excellent detective story with some great actors brian keith <UNK> <UNK> etc and an outstanding jazz soundtrack 10 out of 10
<START> every time i by pass this show on tv i absolutely and <UNK> want to claw my eyes out and rip my ears off it's so unbelievably horrible the jokes aren't funny the acting is completely terrible and the whole entire show is one major disappointment i hate charlotte <UNK> guts and i just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time i hear her talk she is a no talent low iq big waste on society and i think she would be doing the world a favor if she just <UNK> the f <UNK> up and went away for a long time please i say this with all my heart do not even watch one episode of this show it's not even worth 30 minutes of your life and there are thousands of better things to do including killing yourself than watch this show for half an hour
<START> is a foreign intrigue drama set on the title <UNK> island which involves a retired sea captain and bar owner scott and a cia field <UNK> <UNK> the film has numerous bad guys foreign agents and thugs <UNK> about the pair of protagonists all something scott has which they want and are prepared to kill for a <UNK> low budget tv flick is <UNK> up with a couple of babes and use some carnival street <UNK> as window dressing little more than fodder for the bored couch <UNK> c
<START> reading some of the other reviews of this film i was reminded of both good and not so good aspects of it but overall i have to say it is one of the better films i have seen from any number of genres or countries recently more than anything else it avoided many of the typical traps of more recent international cinema like taking nice pictures of landscapes or being <UNK> <UNK> or imitating american films like pulp fiction the film is unique in many ways for one thing it is a film about relationships in which sex plays no role unusual especially for foreign films it is also a film about two men's relationship to each other also unusual not a <UNK> <UNK> no homosexual tension no ego <UNK> competition it uses little dialogue but <UNK> a tremendous amount it is a simple story yet full of complex details which are easily understood by any human being and universal in their relevance i did not find the film dark or depressing everything would seem this way if you watch hollywood happy ending films all the time but rather a true reflection of human emotions for instance in the scene where realizes his cousin is gone is you see both his feeling of relief that the cousin is gone and yet regret that he pushed him away who has not felt such <UNK> when losing a friend or lover or in some other situation it's rare to get these kinds of real human emotions displayed on film in a non cliché way as far as culture is concerned or this being a turkish film i feel it strikes the very difficult balance between being a film about realities which more apply to that place the greater struggle to make it in a turkish city versus a european one the greater contrast between country and city and a universal human story which didn't necessarily have to be set in turkey in this day and age where people around the world are <UNK> culture and it this film does not try to <UNK> us as nor does it try to communicate it as a <UNK> or <UNK> how turkey <UNK> <UNK> and yet the cultural elements are there i think the comparison to <UNK> in <UNK> that somebody made is quite good everyone at least in the us was raving about that film i personally thought it was mediocre at best it was well put by someone as a vague story which supposedly was supposed to deal with that happens to people living or traveling overseas even if the film was supposed to be humorous the characters and their motivations or <UNK> were never clear even for a film or comedy this is necessary and i found myself being treated to a typically story of the <UNK> <UNK> overseas going back to as for the idea that this is bad acting or too slow or has no plot i'm sorry but people who say this know nothing about film making and maybe nothing about being human no offense you do not have to be a film <UNK> or cultural <UNK> to appreciate this film this film will be two hours of your time well spent
<START> i tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch i was immediately sucked in by the characters br br robin <UNK> is nothing less than spectacular in this film her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100 believable really this sort of thing is not easy to do she pulls it off fantastically br br we know early on this film is going to end <UNK> but you cannot take your eyes off of it the characters do stupid things but unlike most hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters br br this is just a great example of film making imho great writing great acting great directing a film for people who think film can be more than mindless entertainment
<START> one of the classic low budget 70's movies this film was found in a bargain video shop in london for only interestingly the package lists the star of the film as <UNK> who sounds like a porn star but once the credits role it's obvious that the picture is <UNK> to far the right of the tv screen so that all the cast members have the last letter missing from their names br br from the moment the narrator <UNK> introduces us to the situation that the desperate <UNK> of a <UNK> new york city apartment block you know you're in for a <UNK> ride of <UNK> the direction is from the <UNK> wood one <UNK> school if one or two extras were looking at the camera crew then what the hell br br the films finishes with a plot twist that puts the usual suspects to shame buy it now
<START> so as far as i gather this episode is trying to make a statement about how real life villains are very bad people and this is just as scary as the <UNK> the <UNK> imagery associated with the villain <UNK> is purely symbolic he's actually just a normal human being br br the problem is that i just don't buy it <UNK> is simply not scarier than the <UNK> he's not even that scary at all as a guy who seems confused and weird rather than <UNK> likes dead girls and hair and has only newly become a murderer he's significantly less disturbing than most well known real life serial killers <UNK> he's like a very watered down version of ed <UNK> which is why horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and nails cut off something not too different from a normal personal <UNK> routine before anybody has even been killed or hurt at all is completely out of character she sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly <UNK> br br so as comic book guy says worst episode ever
<START> i am a huge fan of the first four <UNK> on projects i own them and watch them every few months i lend them to co workers and friends just so they can get a good scare from quality japanese film making i think takashi <UNK> created a great story and presented it very effectively in these four <UNK> br br i was somewhat excited about the grudge 2 opening in theaters i saw the first american grudge before watching the four originals the grudge was actually pretty good of course the originals are better but i got a good halloween scare from the 2004 american grudge br br the grudge 2 started off badly and went down from there i kept waiting for it to get better to make sense to show <UNK> talent nothing like this happened the thing that's great about <UNK> <UNK> on work is the story true it's usually told in a disjointed style that you have to think about to connect its <UNK> but it is still a great story there was no story in the grudge 2 it was a series of gratuitous deaths from characters that you never had time to even start to care about br br the editing was atrocious disjointed as in the japanese originals is one thing but the complete <UNK> of scene sequence was <UNK> i just kept thinking this is so stupid and no he didn't really sell out this much did he it made me want to walk out of the theater run home and watch the original work simply to <UNK> myself that <UNK> has not always made this <UNK> down generic boring non <UNK> thrown together tripe br br if you really have your heart set on seeing this movie i suggest you wait the 2 months to rent it really two of the five people in the theater with me walked out about 45 minutes into it i <UNK> on whether to do that myself going home and cleaning the house actually sounded like a better way to spend my time at that point br br i am truly shocked at how bad this movie was let's pray sam <UNK> doesn't put out more cash to make the grudge 3 it's just not worth it anymore sigh
<START> this is a very dark movie somewhat better than the average asylum film it was a lot better than i thought it would be is a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror film br br the voice on the <UNK> is really creepy this voice without a face this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the film since we never see the killer face is left to the imagination of the <UNK> br br the action and suspense never <UNK> and after the first half of the film it becomes <UNK> there is not much gore in this film just enough to serve the story and also the director does a good job at holding your attention br br i gave this movie a 8 10 because some clichés
<START> just plain terrible nick and michael are way better actors than this a c rated flick at best the plot was weak and the characters totally undeveloped even the film and sound quality was terrible i suppose that these were all young actors at the time and this script just filled a job
<START> i rented this film because i enjoy watching things with lauren graham in them well she was the highlight everyone else seemed complete separated from the picture you kept looking around you at those watching the film with you going what however she provided some clarity as she was the only normal character in the picture which actually isn't saying much for the film personally it was too far fetched for me however i am glad i rented despite the fact i would never want to own it i still feel that lauren graham proved to be a strong actress and even thought she was not the main character she seemed to steal the movie my husband and i were happier and cared more about her character ending up with <UNK> character than we were about the two main characters

<START> when i was in <UNK> grade back in 1977 i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came out a year later br br <UNK> was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job she carries the movie well br br esther <UNK> is fantastic as the domestic who appears to be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara <UNK> as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow <UNK> <UNK> in twin peaks as the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the <UNK> affection bruce <UNK> is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the title br br the best performance however belongs to michael <UNK> it is truly powerful and <UNK> more recognition than it got at the time the <UNK> and <UNK> he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter <UNK> gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations br br the film <UNK> from the book only in some small ways it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd br br
<START> there is so much wrong with this movie <UNK> with a girls wig old man scientist time machine <UNK> tough guy jones who stays behind with a shotgun that has three rounds spider people with <UNK> hands and bad teeth etc the make up was so bad and they only had a few visible spider people on screen at one time aliens cameron technique could have been used instead they chose to dress every spider person the same way badly the nice thing about <UNK> acting is that he <UNK> his had at every <UNK> as if he is counting how many words he gets to speak in the script it <UNK> me that with all of the information out there on dvd <UNK> people like this still exist who make movies this movie could have been worse how i don't know oh and one last thing i am going on a sci fi movie hunt down the people running that channel should not be allowed to <UNK> to further continue the <UNK> that exist in film and television
<START> i was a hippie age 22 in 1965 have seen the play 5 times have 2 versions of the music and have read the script many times maybe taken as an separate thing the movie is ok but as an <UNK> of the play it's terrible br br first the good the songs are sung well and the production values are pretty good the homosexual <UNK> in black boys white boys is cute the claude <UNK> switch was interesting hair is a fluid production and constant changes in it are inherent provided the basic spirit of it is <UNK> br br but the basic spirit was very much distorted it seemed like all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs and fit the story line to them regardless of what that did to the original intent of the play br br claude sheila and <UNK> were presented as a selfish <UNK> who could care less about anyone outside their tribe claude destroyed <UNK> parents party it's hard to believe that she <UNK> while her parents were being hurt and repeatedly stole cars sheila stole the <UNK> clothes and car then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly <UNK> badly probably be <UNK> in rank and could likely die on that lonely <UNK> road good fun and <UNK> found it fine to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex this is not what hippies were like not what the play described and is directly opposite to a love generation br br i've never seen a hippie beg for money the point was to be self sufficient outside the <UNK> system not beg from it br br after <UNK> is thrown in jail for ruining <UNK> party and claude offers to <UNK> some out <UNK> insists on being <UNK> instead with no better plan for the rest that hitting on <UNK> parents and then hitting on his own <UNK> br br be in has always been a very spiritual point but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around even if this is part of his trip it ruins a beautiful song i know they're <UNK> floating in space with the army but again it totally ruins a beautiful song br br while sheila and claude are skinny <UNK> <UNK> steals their clothes laughing it was fun man even after he could see both were very annoyed then a little later <UNK> does one thing that no hippie ever does he hits claude terrible br br then they have the perfect opportunity to sing at night in some beautiful sf spot with the stars <UNK> down maybe working into an inventive <UNK> instead the whole tribe sings it in the blazing sun <UNK> down the road in a <UNK> stolen of course br br i was vastly disappointed with the movie in 1979 and i like it even less now i think it would have been possible to do a reasonably close <UNK> of the show but this ain't it
<START> this review contains a partial spoiler br br shallow from the outset <UNK> o a ' at least starts as if it might be a slick entertaining piece of nonsense like <UNK> 'the <UNK> it's central character dennis quaid suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that appear to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller but the plot <UNK> along at too great a pace leading to a dramatic twist not half way through when the character learns that he has been <UNK> and has only 1 2 days to live and this simply is too big a twist to add casually to a story once this has happened the film's only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal indeed its only subject matter but <UNK> o a ' continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller the problem is two <UNK> firstly <UNK> actions don't convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do and secondly even if they did convince it's hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been <UNK> resolved the rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort but made more tedious than usual by the character's slightly treated <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> the events the film is interested in dennis quaid in the lead role doesn't convince either as a burnt out professor or as a man who is destined to die meg ryan is as often <UNK> and annoying another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack watch 'the <UNK> instead which from similar roots remains tight and character driven whereas <UNK> o a ' <UNK> into developments that only <UNK> its own premise as the premise is itself quite intriguing it's a shame to see it drowned in a <UNK> of over <UNK> plot
<START> i've been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80's i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff a genre i'm not particularly interested in the dialogue is and philosophical making sense no doubt only to it's franco italian producers and the plot completely <UNK> what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful <UNK> soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old <UNK> and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile
<START> this is such a great movie to watch and all the actors put together a great film which would be enjoyed by everyone it is very emotional in parts so when you watch it grab a box of <UNK> to keep you company this movie doesn't deserve a rating below 10 10
<START> so this guy goes into a <UNK> office for his first <UNK> after the <UNK> is done the psychiatrist says i'm going to show you <UNK> <UNK> tell me what you see in them well says the patient looking at the first one i see a man and a woman having sex on seeing the second one he says i see two women having sex on seeing the third he says i see two men having sex on seeing the next one he says i see two men and two women having sex the psychiatrist puts down the the so he says we'll start by discussing your my says the guy and you with all these dirty pictures that's how this movie strikes me
<START> hunt for justice is a canadian television drama that has made it to dvd and that is reason for <UNK> for those who <UNK> for educational dramas that inform us about facts of current history that somehow get buried in the media the film is not a hollywood production it relies heavily on footage from court files but it also introduces to many of us the act of <UNK> of louise in bringing about the trial of <UNK> president <UNK> <UNK> br br louise veteran canadian actor wendy <UNK> is a canadian judge <UNK> by <UNK> as the chief war crimes <UNK> at the international criminal <UNK> in the <UNK> the film begins in 1996 when travels to the <UNK> to face the political obstacles that are <UNK> the <UNK> to bringing to justice the war criminals in the war <UNK> has been <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a war that has gross evidence of crimes against humanity in the form of <UNK> <UNK> camps and other <UNK> <UNK> the progress toward bringing the criminals to justice is <UNK> by <UNK> including one played by william hurt who fear a major world war if <UNK> against same are upon with the keen help of her <UNK> her staff including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the unexpected assistance from british capt john <UNK> john corbett <UNK> ahead focusing the impossible task of bringing all responsible parties to justice on three specific events two of the three top suspects are captured but during their trials each meets his end this leaves only <UNK> <UNK> himself and and her colleagues are successful in bringing the war criminal to justice in 1999 br br there are several touching side plots employed in the telling of this well documented tale stories that make the point in history more personal some may find the film footage of corpses and prisoners and death camps too strong to watch but they are necessary to bring home the purpose of the film wendy <UNK> carries the power to drive the message home the message that war crimes must never go <UNK> there is much current history to be learned from this film writers ian adams <UNK> adams and m a have <UNK> the information and made it dramatic as well director charles <UNK> the <UNK> with the story progress never forgetting that he has a tale of intrigue to tell as well hunt for justice is worth watching grady <UNK>
<START> this movie is so bad but its so bad that i was laughing my ass off for people that like movies do not watch this one for people who like movies good and bad i recommend this one the story lines shaky the script is horrible the acting is horrible to mediocre the soundtrack throughout the movie was corny but i loved it the cool <UNK> were a plus tho ha ha if it can bleed it can die the fight scenes <UNK> me up it seemed to me like they spent more time on those parts than any other <UNK> the fight scenes for the most part were pretty clean i almost feel like this movie could have been good if it weren't for the f x no it would have still been a the eye thing was corny and how the chick was eating the guys stomach in the kitchen they <UNK> done something where shed be actually eating something or at least put more of the fake blood on her face and the <UNK> explosion disappointed me i thought they might have gotten real fire instead of crappy computer <UNK> stuff and the ending was so predictable which surprised me when they actually did what i though they might do so overall id say this is a classic as far as crappy movies go its in my bottom 5
<START> the book while not particularly great was decent but this movie completely changes it a lot of the elements of the story are consistent between the book and the movie but dr <UNK> character goes from a <UNK> written character who lives for money and ends up causing the <UNK> <UNK> with her greed to a heart on her <UNK> damsel in distress who won't do anything if she even catches the slightest hint that it might be less than noble when movies change the book that much but keep the same name it should be a crime
<START> thankfully you don't need a lot of book to understand where this <UNK> going obviously a poverty row cash in on <UNK> big hit the wolf man which was made just one year earlier this finds the always watchable george <UNK> in another of his <UNK> mad doctor roles as brilliant vengeance minded scientist <UNK> cameron cameron who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what i'm <UNK> is the <UNK> <UNK> is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both <UNK> him and forced him to <UNK> from his previous job you see they <UNK> at his claims of being able to mix man with beast to create an <UNK> army of <UNK> creatures that would come in handy during war time thankfully cameron has found the ideal test subject for his wolf blood <UNK> a <UNK> child like half wit named glenn strange is pretty clueless as to what's going on doesn't ask too many question and lets the doc <UNK> him down to a table and shoot him up with whatever happens to be in his <UNK> this results in a time <UNK> change of man turning into a werewolf cameron lets him out of the mansion using a secret <UNK> so you basically get a big guy strange was dressed in <UNK> with a <UNK> beard hairy <UNK> and a set of over sized plastic teeth running around in the woods the majority of the time after an <UNK> sees the beast and a little girl is killed the locals grab their <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> to hunt it down dr cameron who can control the beast with a whip and also has a handy <UNK> to reverse the effect also drags along to the big city to try to track down the <UNK> who had made a mockery of his original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process also hanging around the house is <UNK> daughter anne as well as <UNK> reporter boyfriend tom johnny downs whose first <UNK> is that they're dealing with an <UNK> walking <UNK> creature br br though a typically <UNK> <UNK> flick in many ways with unimpressive sets cinematography and make ups as well as a fairly bland supporting cast it remains watchable thanks to the <UNK> of star george <UNK> i have no clue why downs received top billing he shows up half an hour in and really doesn't have a whole lot to do nor is he all that impressive doing it this is show all the way and he's great <UNK> and raving talking to himself while <UNK> that he's talking to his peers i'm not interested in your <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in and out of sanity strange seems to have <UNK> his performance as the hilariously naive and slow talking semi retarded country <UNK> around the entire <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> jr from his turn as <UNK> in of mice and men to his performance as the aforementioned wolf man in any case strange and <UNK> do a fairly good job playing off one another my favorite part is when <UNK> calls him his guinea pig in front of a colleague while just sits there <UNK> and staring at a <UNK> some of the <UNK> swamp scenes are pretty atmospheric too
<START> this movie has inspired me to be a better person in life you don't know who you will run across and sometimes our prejudice will cause us to a person wrongly i have learned to give a person the benefit of the doubt because of this movie i also learned that tough love can build a stronger person now i want to know where to find the movie soundtrack there are songs in this soundtrack i have been trying to get for years may i comment on the acting for a second jamie fox was outstanding the man has <UNK> to be the actor of actors also the performance of <UNK> king was awesome if i can get a woman to look at me the way she looked at ray i can only dream i <UNK> down 18 00 for this movie and i don't have a lot of money but i am willing to see this movie again and again this movie touched me
<START> but perhaps you have to have grown up in the 80's to truly appreciate this movie if you love the early 80's this is definitely a must see also one of the best <UNK> ever
<START> <UNK> raj films are so funny whatever works they follow it yet they are called the best production house br br seeing <UNK> films working they copied the formula bikini and everything plus casting low actors like and br br the film is so horrible it makes you cringe br br the jokes are so bad and horny it makes you slap them resembles a gay plus a monkey br br resembles an idiot br br the director thinks we all are idiots <UNK> takes the audience for granted music is saving grace camera work is good br br <UNK> <UNK> like an idiot looks like <UNK> in <UNK> if <UNK> was annoying der then is worse the rest are okay
<START> i had never paid much attention to this flick until i learned that <UNK> author of the brilliant network was the scriptwriter his work there had <UNK> me as to his genius so when appeared on <UNK> i was anxious to see it i was not disappointed looking at both this film and network it would seem that his big theme is the absurdity <UNK> and sheer <UNK> of large human <UNK> e g <UNK> networks against the <UNK> of individual experience and the human spirit and all of it delivered with a knife edge sense of utterly black humor hospital is as black of a comedy as network is and the excellent cast led by the <UNK> scott does his work full justice this is a keeper definitely not to miss
<START> i am very impressed with the acting in <UNK> moon before i started watching this i wasn't expecting it to be as good as <UNK> <UNK> i couldn't believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters it blew my mind how well they played each role this was in my opinion almost as good as <UNK> <UNK> its hard to compare any film to <UNK> <UNK> if you don't make that comparison i would give this a thumbs up it was very entertaining i don't post many comments on this site but i just felt i had to get my opinion out there amazing i don't want to go off <UNK> every actor who was brilliant because i would probably have to list every single one my favorite was steve he hit the nail on the head playing captain gus his mannerisms were perfect
<START> no the melancholy of might at a first glance make you think that this is just another animated school comedy drama well it's not the setting just happen to be a school environment this is a comedy alright but a very smart one with a lot of sarcasm and the characters does have a psychological which is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of <UNK> bergman the episodes is aired as it seems out of order i e the pilot is in fact episode 11 this makes it possible to present small clues to upcoming episodes the show is an adaption of popular novel series about br br what about the story then like in all the episodes does the story revolves who tries to ease her own boredom by <UNK> in adventures her self has no interest in ordinary humans and <UNK> <UNK> for aliens time <UNK> and persons with supernatural forces to find this sort of people she has formed a club which she calls the <UNK> <UNK> save the world by it with fun <UNK> except for the other members of the <UNK> <UNK> is he is the real protagonist of the show it's <UNK> his point of view that we follow the story he just happen to sit in front in class when came up with the idea to form the <UNK> <UNK> he is quite <UNK> to most club activities and <UNK> along just to ensure that don't go to much to the extremes and he is the only one in the class that likes to talk with another member is <UNK> which is the <UNK> silent member and is also the only remaining member of the literature club which room the <UNK> <UNK> has occupied in the quest for a free club room she doesn't mind that the <UNK> <UNK> uses her as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books she also participate in the <UNK> activities was <UNK> arrested by because the club needed a <UNK> like <UNK> for anything suspicious to happen she often act as the <UNK> maid the last member is the always smiling who happens to be the mysterious transfer student meaning he <UNK> two months in to the <UNK> which finds to qualifies as mysterious br br thinks that all members but are some random picked people in school but the do indeed have their own interest in her
<START> i bought this movie because of <UNK> welch she was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of harry mike wagner girl friend harry a <UNK> down on his luck trying to make one more heist harry goes to a funeral where he meets <UNK> de <UNK> and takes him for a ride when things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the <UNK> way to get money harry and his gang decide with the help of <UNK> de <UNK> to from there on mob rest a sure that no matter what the gang goes after that the outcome is never the same and will keep you on the edge of your sit the rest of the out come you need to watch for yourself as far as <UNK> goes if you're a fan of here then you need to watch this movie because she never looked better standing on the beach with a on i give this movie 10 <UNK> stars on <UNK> welch body alone it's no wonder why she was the <UNK> actress back in the sixties she was the sex symbol everyone one wanted and no one could get not only does she look good she can act even better if you like <UNK> welch then you'll like this movie
<START> i thought the movie was pretty good i really enjoyed myself as i viewed it however the last scene at <UNK> birthday party was cut way too short i myself was an extra in that scene and was upset with the results but other than that and the weird casting the movie was superb
<START> i liked this quite a bit but i have friends that hated this there's no sex but there's very little nudity in any of the episodes which is a good thing also has a toilet <UNK> that's explored in at least half the episodes <UNK> are way more advanced in japan hmm i'm wondering why i rated this so high myself it certainly isn't that i like naked cartoon girls in some ways <UNK> the main character is <UNK> to johnny bravo except instead of being an obnoxious <UNK> jock is a <UNK> nerd or you can think of him as <UNK> answer to <UNK> suit larry he's easier to take if you watch it subtitled rather than dubbed but he grows on you either way if you give him a chance he is the br br the formula is the same for each episode boy meets girl boy tries to win girl's heart despite being a <UNK> <UNK> boy somehow succeeds against all odds typically the girl doesn't realize she likes until after he's beaten to a pulp and or pulled off some spectacular stunt like <UNK> a modern operating system in one week or winning a race against a <UNK> powered motorcycle using his <UNK> br br episode 1 features a rich <UNK> <UNK> i think <UNK> her boobs put a major <UNK> in the budget because she's the only female that has this kind of animation she also dresses completely <UNK> most people who rate this <UNK> probably never got past the first episode br br episode 2 has the rich young daughter who likes to <UNK> she's only 16 but that's legal age in japan and in some states in the us i might add her father is also a brutal type that has a reputation for killing guys interested in his daughter br br girl 3 is the sweet innocent daughter of a <UNK> shop owner that's mixed up with a bad boyfriend aside from running <UNK> for the maiden and being <UNK> by a guy there's almost no <UNK> of any kind in this episode a sharp drop from the previous two nevertheless and the evil boyfriend really pound each other br br episode 4 has trying to impress a top notch swimming coach seems more about his intentions with this particular girl than any other and she's pretty direct in return br br girl 5 is the biker babe she's probably the most top heavy of the 6 although not super <UNK> like girl 1 and in terms of sexuality and <UNK> this particular episode is easily the most over the top in terms of lack of realism should have broken every bone in his body at least twice during the race against the biker babe but i think the producers and writers said it's just a cartoon we can do anything this <UNK> in realism makes it a fan favorite br br finally episode 6 introduces a new girl that's works in animation and the previous 5 girls help as he tries to cope with impossible time and <UNK> constraints to get an <UNK> out the door by the <UNK> in terms of <UNK> this one's very tame as well but there's plenty of humor the ending has all 5 extremely pretty girls from the past team up to hunt who slips away <UNK> ostensibly with the intention of gang <UNK> him yeah that almost happens in real life someone crossed ala samurai with steve ala family matters br br all in all there's no middle ground for this you'll either hate it or love it if you're new to anime you probably don't want to start with this at the same time if you can stand characters like <UNK> from <UNK> 1 2 or johnny bravo or you like comedies that lean more heavily towards silliness but have very sexual overtones you should give it a shot
<START> i had heard interesting critics on this movie i believed it was a love story but i wasn't sure what was the plot about so when i finally saw it i found myself in the middle of a love relationship between the ex con <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> so a love story but not probably what i was expecting br br the movie is focused on <UNK> as she struggles to get back into society she doesn't want to return back to her neighborhood and she finds herself without a home or anywhere to go so while she just experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from jail she came across an old of her which while she was in had become a <UNK> and lives on the streets not having where to go and without money or <UNK> source of <UNK> she decides to join on his <UNK> a covered area on a lonely street br br the story by itself is moving it explains how the impossible relationship between <UNK> and gets deeper until the the almost final twist of the movie br br definitely the movie is worth watching <UNK> is splendid in his role of the <UNK> a person being able of both being an innocent and tender giving person and a ruthless street <UNK> just depending whom deals him with i believe his role br br on the other hand i don't quite believe the role of <UNK> although the movie tries to show the <UNK> inside her through several scenes she is not capable to make me believe it she is in a way too sweet and too honest for which might be expected of somebody on the same situation br br the movie tries to show a love on a desperate situation it is a enjoyable movie but the feeling i get when the movie ends is that <UNK> with the way of thinking and acting she has would never have arrived to that situation her role partly because of the script partly because of the acting is difficult to believe br br i specially like the ending and because of it i have raised my rating one or two points i liked its <UNK> and the fact of showing that sometimes survival instinct is above other more spiritual <UNK> as love br br <UNK> an interesting movie but it lacked some punch to be a total must see
<START> last evening i had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie <UNK> i was stunned and amazed will smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he isn't always associated with he proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie kevin james was also very impressive i admit that i've always like him on the king of queens but this role really brought him into the light more and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future the movie was funny and adorable and i recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine the mix of comedy romance and drama left me feeling complete it's nothing like most chick flicks in the sense of tears and sadness but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females i encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren't involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from <UNK> br br two way big thumbs up
<START> i am a firm believer that a film tv serial or any form of art should and would be fully appreciated once the timing factor as to when written produced or conceived should be taken in to account br br <UNK> jo <UNK> is one such series i remember watching it in the mid 80's on tv and the re runs via the video <UNK> <UNK> during early 90's and laughing out loud and being addicted to it that made me buy the full series dvd set and surprise of surprises the comedy and the moments of the good <UNK> days simply fell flat for me even the very popular 30 years <UNK> experience and <UNK> <UNK> bed did not <UNK> the kind of <UNK> i thought it would the timing factor for the 80's this was the <UNK> the main event the mother of all tv comedies and it worked during the age and time perhaps the same cannot be said right now but nonetheless watching the dvd did bring back pleasant memories br br i wish the seasons with <UNK> <UNK> and were longer <UNK> shah has been un <UNK> good as the heart of the show with equally effective support cast of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> throughout br br all in all an experience that will bring back memories for those who saw it during the prime times might not appeal to the younger viewers or first time <UNK>
<START> i was so excited to finally watch pulse after receiving it from amazon and i have to say i was utterly disappointed i perhaps think i was too hyped up i had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met after loving other asian horrors i thought i knew this would find a place in my heart br br the story was slow painfully so i am a diverse fan of horror i love the brutal bloody <UNK> of the devil's rejects and i love equally the steady growing macabre of a tale of two sisters pulse offered little from either spectrum sadly br br along with the of the plot it was also very muddled i hadn't a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem it seemed as if the director <UNK> off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was from our actors unlike a tale of two sisters which also has a rather hard to follow plot line pulse <UNK> up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated confused and <UNK> in the characters' <UNK> my closing statement about the plot was its <UNK> at first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world <UNK> and their medium of escaping is the internet that's a damn original idea i like that but as the plot <UNK> on plot holes and unexplained happenings their heads in it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale as evident by the ending that just hasn't been clear enough throughout to <UNK> br br i realize the <UNK> of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated but the <UNK> of the movie was only <UNK> by the grainy shadowy surroundings i will admit there was a certain feel of <UNK> with the movie but that may have just been my attention <UNK> in and out br br the actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well and perhaps if i was more enthralled by the story i would've been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being <UNK> so too were some of the characters like i mentioned previously the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the <UNK> of the plot perhaps it was a result of the <UNK> <UNK> that the characters do questionable things to be honest i don't really care br br the acting was decent certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either no to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awful br br now i'll stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments one towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout i would've enjoyed this movie almost wholly i thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face the things that went on between these ghastly run ins were just too lackluster <UNK> and wtf for me to truly appreciate br br now for something <UNK> to the dvd itself release of pulse comes with subtitles yes but the subtitles are off they aren't said at the correct time of the character's speech it may sound <UNK> picking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others i think this is the only north american release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing never watch dubbing i tried to like the film i really did i wanted this film to live up to the hype but sadly it fell flat for me if you're looking for other creepy asian cinema i can recommend you audition <UNK> a tale of two sisters strange circus and all of which are more my palette
<START> warning spoilers dear roger br br during your distinguished career you've made a wide range of entertainment some good some night of the blood beast falls in the latter category it's not as awful as say the phantom from 10 000 <UNK> or maybe the <UNK> horror nonetheless one of my greatest criticisms of this movie is that i could have made it for you faster better and cheaper br br let's start with the and titles roger the rocket sequences look like something from disney's man into space not as good of course the futuristic looks like nothing in contemporary 1958 why didn't you just use a <UNK> <UNK> or even a <UNK> launch better still why not <UNK> entirely with the launch and start with a shot of space and the capsule floating in it that's what i would have done for you roger second why have the spaceship crash upon even a middle school physics student could have told you your astronaut would have arrived on earth extra <UNK> and largely i would have shown your astronaut becoming possessed by the monster maybe by using that great negative positive stuff you used in war of the <UNK> losing contact with earth and landing in the wilderness that would also explain how you blood beast could <UNK> your astronaut during the tremendous heat of but still be destroyed by fire even with these <UNK> the first half of your movie is pretty good had you spent some money on decent music it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of outer limits but once again your writer describes ed nelson as the designer of the landing system then gives him some stupid dialogue regarding <UNK> the biggest problem with the second half of night of the blood beast is michael he's terrible as the doomed astronaut you should have fired him on the spot and replaced him with ed nelson you could have combined <UNK> <UNK> with those of john and saved yourself the cost of one actor i don't know if you actually paid any of these people but at least you would saved the cost of <UNK> three <UNK> a day i'd had also <UNK> the <UNK> parrot costume and spent the extra money using makeup to have the astronaut turn into the blood beast maybe that was a little too close to the <UNK> unknown for you but it would have helped the pace of the second half immensely if you are going to have a blood beast wouldn't it be a good idea to show a little blood yeah i know the title comes from the <UNK> in the <UNK> blood but <UNK> could've done a lot better job for you if he <UNK> a little chocolate <UNK> around after all it looks like blood in black and white <UNK> that cost you maybe two bucks i'd have also used some closeups for some reason insipid dialogue and bad acting don't seem quite so bad in closeups look at almost 70s tv series and you'll see what i mean oh in closing roger a note to your writer you can't use a to show some poor <UNK> full of alien <UNK> when you don't have any electricity remember you fried the <UNK> in the first reel oh and i almost forgot roger couldn't you afford a fake knife you know the kind where the blade goes into the handle i had one of those when i was 9 which also happens to be the year night of the blood beast was made it cost maybe another two bucks i think i knew enough then to make you a better movie i know i know enough now to do so so roger if you decide to remake night of the blood beast or if you are looking for a writer director to work with you on some other project i'm your man i'll work cheap 'cause i'd really like to make a movie for you roger br br i give night of the blood beast a 3 special note if you like to watch <UNK> movies like night of the blood beast the dvd i bought for 3 99 was very good quality you can also get night of the blood beast along with a lot of other terrible horror scifi movies at places like for about 6
<START> i can't express enough just how bad this film was first of all what a waste of some legendary stars although they are quite old and pretty unconvincing fred astaire well i guess he must have <UNK> some one a big favor as this was his last film role the script is a mess and the film seems terribly <UNK> i imagine maybe if i saw this back when it came out 1981 i might have thought it was decent however seeing so many actual good horror films this was one of the worst the only real convincing anything in this mess was the very young and lovely sort of creepy alice <UNK> the main young character was trying to act the best he could but was utterly terrible i wasn't sure how much of it was from his lack of skill or the lack of a comprehend able script but either way he was just plain bad don't watch unless you want to see a bunch of old guys be somewhat scared
<START> considered by many to be a strangely overlooked <UNK> it seems to me the reason it has been cold <UNK> is its sleaze factor not as overtly sexy violent or gory as many films of this period it nevertheless starts rather <UNK> and although becoming more <UNK> continues to <UNK> a rather unpleasant ms not here the ice maiden but a drunken mother donald <UNK> does a cameo as a child <UNK> david <UNK> has his eyes on <UNK> sex and the central theme involves the relationship between a brother sister and niece no not very nice at all and <UNK> treats it all as if it is very normal like it might be in some small french village instead of ed <UNK> new york city had this been treated in a more sensational manner then it would have been a more acceptable but lesser film here we really have to choose between the <UNK> of various unpleasant <UNK> before the final denouement very watchable
<START> after 10 viewings in 20 years i too think this was the crazy <UNK> best effort on film with more <UNK> in the plot than their next best button <UNK> they were indeed a crazy trio of double acts thrown together mainly on stage sometimes in front of <UNK> until allen retired in the <UNK> through ill health he <UNK> them all by years apparently they were just as mad outside work regularly playing practical jokes on one another br br the six wonder boys <UNK> head for i'll get her to tell me <UNK> to dig for the gold that was being found there it seemed a better idea than going to <UNK> because they'd been there when they get to red <UNK> they find their information was a mere 40 years out of date they thought that the <UNK> that were in the guilty newspaper they'd read <UNK> funny but by then it doesn't matter as they've all fallen in love with snow white and want to help her <UNK> find his long lost <UNK> of gold baddie bill m wants it himself however br br the number of verbal and visual <UNK> is astonishing but most of them will probably only make sense to brits and ex <UNK> interested in seeing <UNK> british b w comedies imho nearly all of the gags and routines work including the gold if <UNK> between bud and the <UNK> while you work <UNK> even the always getting our man <UNK> <UNK> a marvellous little film in a rather tired looking condition but utterly recommended
<START> the most worthless film of the decade the responsible parties should never be allowed to film again i have no words to describe the lack of entertainment this film provides you couldn't pay me to watch this film again quite honestly i think i would be a better person had i not seen it if i called it offensive i would fall into a category of emotionally <UNK> <UNK> i would say this film goes so far as to damage the industry there are films that i refuse to watch now that i feel they might be this tasteless i feel like an idiot that i didn't have the good sense to walk out during any one of many moments i was compelled to do so yes i saw the end and am ashamed for it as should anyone else including the writer i am in awe
<START> irwin allen put all his talents behind this one he's co screenwriter producer and director of this cartoonish epic about an atomic submarine and its efforts to <UNK> a ring of radiation <UNK> the earth potentially exciting story fails to take off despite an <UNK> cast varied players from walter <UNK> and joan fontaine to frankie <UNK> and barbara <UNK> are interestingly <UNK> and provide a dash of color but this <UNK> sci fi is pretty cheesy good for a few stray laughs but allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong solid adventure and campy nonsense later a popular tv series from
<START> i don't understand why critics would bash this movie it's a teen movie that's actually serious which is a <UNK> i'll admit that there are moments that are hugely sappy but c'mon it's about young love it's gotta be sappy to be valid my biggest complaint is chris <UNK> while he was funny in american pie he apparently isn't ready for the switch into more dramatic fare yet he's very uncomfortable looking in some of his mama stuff <UNK> and <UNK> on the other hand demonstrate a remarkable amount of depth and believability as do the <UNK> although the script is heavily cliched with the lovers <UNK> off poetry the actor's make it work the directing sports some powerful images on the screen beautiful cinematography nice music great young actors i was impressed and i'm a jaded critic when it comes to teen movies
<START> i have 2 complete sets from time life this is my favorite movies of all time love all the actors and actresses <UNK> picture love patrick this is the film that showed his true talent but yet he does not get credit for the display he <UNK> much credit has been missed in these films love the way they portrayed the dry and dusty of the civil war making it into one of the greatest love stories of all time and showing through all of life what true <UNK> means how 2 divided countries split but yet all and all the <UNK> remained solid even though the war divided and up but through it all till the very end they remained and taught us the viewer how true ships can still remain till present day simply the best gone with the wind doesn't compare to this film patrick at his best after seeing this movie for the one hundred thousand time i became a big fan of and have followed his career ever since have all his movies after he made north and south
<START> so i turned on the tv today at 1 00 <UNK> on a sunday expecting to see crap and <UNK> and this great movie was just starting didn't know what it was but drew me in almost immediately the movie was excellent br br there were a couple of things that didn't make sense for one i don't get why the dead guy was talking about doing stuff to get yourself out of your bad situation but then jimmy doesn't really do anything except the basic stuff to survive that anyone would do in his situation in other words it wasn't his <UNK> that got him out of his bad situation it was just luck second i don't get the thing about the girl killing the the gangsters at the end because the whole thing was partly by the thief people stealing money and then the other thief kills <UNK> at the end so they steal his money twice and kill him how is that good
<START> betty is an for the lead in a production of <UNK> <UNK> when a car mysteriously hits the lead betty is thrust into the spotlight opening night is a <UNK> success and betty decides to leave the after party to celebrate in private with her boyfriend but when the boyfriend leaves the room betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown black <UNK> masked figure the unknown <UNK> ties betty to a <UNK> gags her and places <UNK> under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain should betty close them the boyfriend returns to the room and is stunned to see betty in such a <UNK> he's even more shocked when the killer grabs him and <UNK> a knife through his lower jaw with such force the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth and betty has been forced to watch all of this so begins <UNK> terrifying ordeal with a killer not just intent on hurting her but also on forcing her to watch as he <UNK> her friends br br opera gets classified as a giallo but to me it <UNK> in quite a few ways from the model less emphasis is placed on the mystery elements of the story than in something like <UNK> <UNK> or the bird with the crystal <UNK> the black <UNK> masked killer may be <UNK> but the clues and red herrings normally associated with a good giallo are absent instead opera is all about the tension of an unknown killer and making the audience uncomfortable the focus is on the grisly death scenes <UNK> fear and the killer's obsession with betty br br opera features what i think are some of <UNK> most artistic death scenes when the killer grabs betty after her boyfriend leaves the room you're sure that <UNK> had it but the sadistic killer only wants to force betty to watch as he brutally stabs her lover in the neck  the knife <UNK> in his mouth it's a well shot and designed scene and those <UNK> in the eyes  brilliant or take the death of the <UNK> at first her death seems like an ordinary run of the mill murder but when the <UNK> accidentally <UNK> the killer's what started out as just another death scene turns it up a notch as the killer uses a pair of <UNK> to cut the girl's throat open to get his chain finally there's the most famous death scene in opera that i'm amazed with each time i see it  mira is shot in the eye while <UNK> through a <UNK> that scene displays a lot of what i like about <UNK> it's got style to burn as implausible as it may be it's creative memorable and a blast to watch br br <UNK> certainly wasn't the first italian director to concentrate on eye <UNK> but in opera he's taken eye trauma to a new level <UNK> holding eyes open a bullet in the eye and <UNK> <UNK> out an eye are all part of <UNK> vision pun intended and these scenes do have the effect that i believe <UNK> was going for the first time i saw the killer putting those <UNK> in <UNK> eyes i couldn't stop <UNK> it actually had a physical effect on me what is it about the eyes that make them such a target for abuse in italian films br br to be fair and not sound like such a <UNK> there are problems i have with opera that keep me from rating it as <UNK> best one of my problems is with the air <UNK> system running through <UNK> apartment building while i don't doubt there are air <UNK> systems in older apartment buildings that connect the apartments the <UNK> in opera are huge i'm no expert but i sincerely doubt any building like the one in this movie would have had such <UNK> air <UNK> it doesn't seem practical at all and don't you think someone would have done something about them long ago to keep criminals and <UNK> neighbors out of the other apartments it's convenient for the plot but it's not very realistic br br but i suppose my major problem with the film comes with the finale what's up with that ending it feels totally out of place tacked on and like a bad <UNK> i'm not sure what else to say other than it's horrible
<START> this movie is kind of good it seem that they used the <UNK> rex like a blown up balloon just like godzilla just maybe back in those 60 70's days scientist haven't got enough info on all sorts of dinosaurs back in those time scientist still making dinosaur so i guess this movie was base on a <UNK> rex movements back in the 60 70's there even a part where a giant rock fired by someone at the <UNK> rex it damage the <UNK> rex and it was knock out for a little while at the end the <UNK> rex went back to search for food there is something wrong in the movie as well like a rifle how can one rifle kill a <UNK> rex when it could be 1 000 5 000 stronger than we are if this film going to make a remake i suggest make it more good and excited because watching a old movie seems like to have a remake of it if lucky
<START> lucio fulci was one of the most prolific italian directors by the time of his death in 1996 yet his career had long since <UNK> into a <UNK> spiral of increasingly <UNK> genre entries that could barely stand in the shadow of his earlier work for much of the '70s into the mid '80s he <UNK> out such <UNK> distinctive horrors as city of the living dead the beyond and the brutal giallo the new york <UNK> <UNK> remembered by fans like myself and while cat in the brain falls in with the era of <UNK> decline as a filmmaker it is a shocking darkly hilarious that while a clearly inferior work the framing effects and acting are below par proves an interesting open ended <UNK> on pop psychology and film's ability to make no mistake cat in the brain is a total <UNK> and as disjointed as <UNK> previous films but it deserves credit for trying to be something more in a deliciously tongue in cheek touch fulci plays himself a director in the midst of filming yet another violent horror flick who comes down with perverse murderous hallucinations after visiting a shrink who puts him under <UNK> his dreams and reality begin to <UNK> to the point where the viewer cannot <UNK> the two the recent dvd from <UNK> releasing mentions cat as an heir apparent to the likes of <UNK> and it does carry a similarly <UNK> <UNK> funny quality associated with the best <UNK> art
<START> dracula 3000 or van <UNK> <UNK> revenge cheap cash in on another lame vampire flick as i saw it is a master class in how not to make a movie a <UNK> tag collection of <UNK> board a previously lost <UNK> ship the in the <UNK> <UNK> system which later is <UNK> to the <UNK> galaxy and awake a relentless evil in this case the script the film is a bizarre <UNK> of event horizon and whatever the <UNK> vampire film of all time is br br <UNK> follow after a <UNK> of production company <UNK> and a credit sequence that most of the budget must have been blown on we open with a cheesy exposition type speech from casper silly name who plays captain abraham van <UNK> <UNK> name and in <UNK> of actual character development goes on to describe the twisted <UNK> <UNK> that make up his crew van <UNK> himself sports a <UNK> on <UNK> and wears a body <UNK> throughout in a sort of retro 80's tribute to han solo i guess now and again the captain of the pops up in some sort of mad video diary to tell us nothing of consequence in a <UNK> german accent subtitles sadly not included <UNK> <UNK> boards the <UNK> ship alone armed only with a gun shaped torch and thick east european accent while <UNK> with van <UNK> on his ships bridge which is basically a single <UNK> wall <UNK> wearing a gas mask with rubber <UNK> glued to the front encounters what can only be described as a <UNK> in a black cloak who continually <UNK> by the camera why this happens as the vampire is not yet made flesh is never explained this leads on to a shaky camera chasing <UNK> down the <UNK> until she runs into <UNK> it's possible will smith could have been <UNK> in to write lines as most of them consist of <UNK> reminding us he is black every ten seconds and saying the word ass enough for a guinness book of records entry while delivering all this in a from da hood accent this is the year 3000 does da hood even exist one of the main problems with this film is that it insanely tries to pretend its set in the year 3000 unfortunately anyone with healthy eyes won't buy this as the looks <UNK> like a soviet style ocean going <UNK> possibly the film crew thought it would be okay to leave hammer and <UNK> symbols everywhere and a sexy poster of <UNK> next to a bunch of <UNK> and explain it away as some sort of futuristic communist comeback special the <UNK> clothes look as if they were <UNK> from a collection box sealed since 1993 and they are armed to the teeth with latest in 20th century automatic weapons with added year 3000 <UNK> when fired which of course are absolutely no use against vampires is a thing of the past in the future as the <UNK> professor not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair my god what happened to all that genetic <UNK> stuff br br the professor is an interesting character as he is a direct rip off from alien <UNK> who had their own <UNK> tag <UNK> crew with a guy in a wheelchair who oddly wasn't killed fans didn't take to <UNK> as he appears scared in a lot of scenes if i were <UNK> in a non wheelchair access soviet ship pursued by bad acting vampires and everyone left me because i was such a whining <UNK> i'd be scared too br br during the un dramatic <UNK> chase scene the <UNK> informs us with feeling this is <UNK> the rest of his lines are also <UNK> <UNK> and we're all going to die x 100 follows br br erika <UNK> appears as the vice captain what happened to 1st officers in what i thought would be the tired standard issue hard <UNK> no nonsense don't eye me up unless i tell you too beat up 10 <UNK> at one time super babe but this is a z flick so she basically wears a tight low cut top and even <UNK> leather <UNK> <UNK> performance <UNK> the ham factor by 90 and is <UNK> than a row of <UNK> but luckily for us he dies soon enough although he seems to keep his heart on the right hand side of his body br br after a lot of running up and down the same <UNK> using clunky soviet style controls and sitting in soviet style locker rooms the crew find themselves stranded as their own ship off to find a more interesting crew probably why dracula is even mentioned is unknown as the main bad guy is called which is space <UNK> for crimes against fashion as he <UNK> about in a big <UNK> <UNK> shirt and even bigger <UNK> collar making hammer horror vampires look slick by comparison stops to explain his entire back story off camera to <UNK> <UNK> but fails to kill her in another rip off twist from alien <UNK> his back story is such a load of <UNK> it's not worth repeating as the budget can't afford fight <UNK> special effects original music script not written by a <UNK> and even proper end titles the first cast list i saw were same characters but completely different and italian names the film begins to destroy whatever sanity you began with the crew luckily are able to fight back with the help of a ships computer that contains obscure millennium old references on how to kill fictional creatures and some handy 20th century pool <UNK> they find in the ship recreation room up yours <UNK> the ending is awful and a little suspect either they ran out of money or the ex <UNK> <UNK> their ship back i walked into this film knowing it was bad but oblivious as to how bad it really was
<START> what a surprise a basic <UNK> of the comedy classic 'the nutty <UNK> only <UNK> funny guy tim <UNK> who steals the show as in robin hood men in <UNK> is downright hilarious as the <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> and the sex crazed hyde br br the one scene that is really funny is when dr mark <UNK> catches <UNK> in bed with his daughter and says br br how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter br br <UNK> replies but sir i'm going ahead with the operation br br replies back oh well in that case fu your brains out
<START> i am a happily married <UNK> year old female who just happens to love this movie to death br br <UNK> <UNK> character is strong smart and kick ass i thought she did an excellent thats an understatement job in this movie br br i'm not real big on action movies but i thought it was <UNK> sexy and entertaining br br she is my alter ego when she starts putting that assault rifle together in the old hotel room i got chills she did it like she knew what she was doing thats one of my many favorite parts in that movie br br i think she deserved an oscar for her acting and physical roles br br i'm going to have on my back i'm one of those girls who will never be a victim i'm like her secretly and isn't that oh so sexy
<START> the <UNK> <UNK> is now the oldest film i've seen and it is also the first silent film i've seen i heard a lot of good things about this movie so i got the tape out at home and i watched it when it ended i just thought that this was a classic masterpiece the story is based on the real life russian <UNK> <UNK> you wouldn't think it but some of it was sad and disgusting sad being that the mother dies and the rolls down the <UNK> and disgusting being they have to eat rotten meat with <UNK> in it br br today it is still considered to be one of the best silent and russian films ever made i think that everyone should see it if they can find it you will be <UNK> surprised at how good it is it's a must see classic 5 5
<START> it's proof that movie makers and their <UNK> treating their audience with contempt isn't a new <UNK> as it was done as early as the 1940s and house of dracula is a great example you'd think having a film with dracula the wolf man and <UNK> monster the producer would <UNK> to the screenwriter to have all three appear in a scene they had a chance with house of frankenstein then when they had a second bite of the <UNK> they blew it again with house of dracula to lose one chance is a misfortune to lose two <UNK> of cynical money making br br it's obvious the producers are beyond caring larry <UNK> turns up again even though he was shown to die in the previous film which sums up the cynicism of the franchise it also shows what a poor screenplay it is and we're <UNK> to some awful plot turns like condition being <UNK> by a special type of plant which will <UNK> his skull i'm thinking screenwriter edward t lowe might have had his skull <UNK> if this is the type of stuff he comes up with br br director <UNK> c can't improve on the script and throws in a few of his own for example <UNK> is <UNK> to see dr snatch a lift on a <UNK> but <UNK> watches climb a wall and jump in to the <UNK> <UNK> one can't help thinking reaction shots were <UNK> switched round at the editing stage br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is famous for his roles in horror movies but didn't have much of a career outside them perhaps that's down to the fact he's not a good actor and here he commits the worst type of acting being very wooden it's not entirely his fault though because all the characters <UNK> rather awful dialogue and are all rather wooden due in part to lackluster directing br br house of dracula feels a million miles away from james whale 1931 film and its sequel from <UNK> and would have been a very sad note to end on but ironically universal decided to make one more movie to wrap up their franchise with a horror comedy starring <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> this is strictly for <UNK> fans just because he was a great funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a b movie the script is awful it just <UNK> around constantly <UNK> crime and prisoners of war it <UNK> between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither br br first there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic uninspired vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point how more can you <UNK> to your audience that prison time is boring unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep br br back in the u s the guy for no real reason at all is considered a war hero yet he is of course quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be stumbling into all kinds of wacky <UNK> or are they really we will soon find out yawn there are annoying clichés his sick mother his little daughter he never meets a high end whore falling in love with the hero etc it is very odd how this movie constantly switches from tragedy to slapstick in one instant doesn't work at all br br overall this in fact is just a bad comedy and does a <UNK> to prisoners of war just because this guy was a great stand up comedian played in a few good movies and died of ms is no reason not to be annoyed by this silly unconvincing unfunny comedy but if you like richard <UNK> you will probably be thrilled by him reading 3 hours of <UNK> poetry
<START> where to begin where to begin <UNK> in the episode <UNK> shelter to <UNK> fox does not at this point in time have any intention of releasing the show on dvd but be not that you are reading this reveals that the magic <UNK> fifteen years on and small wonder this was post modern television a <UNK> attempt to <UNK> magical realism <UNK> the blue <UNK> charm and <UNK> were scripts <UNK> with symbolism and metaphor music that actually <UNK> with scenes and ultimately an attempt however doomed to <UNK> one's belief in innocence to <UNK> <UNK> as it were it's <UNK> is perhaps best <UNK> to by the fact that even as we <UNK> type a book is being written about the show <UNK> will be found the thoughts <UNK> and <UNK> of many of the show's actors writers directors and producers in the anyone <UNK> of once again visiting the end of the world and themselves with <UNK> sheriff cody <UNK> et al should not hesitate to contact me i may be able to make you a copy angels in the <UNK> <UNK> in the palm trees
<START> there have been some great television movies in that past epics such as roots and <UNK> <UNK> come to mind category 6 day of destruction will not be remembered for <UNK> the cause of made for tv movies a laughably bad story <UNK> only by the horrible screenplay as i like to call it <UNK> more sympathy for the actors involved than terror in nature that the movie was supposed to bring out that sound you hear during the movie is supposed to be the sound of wind but instead it's actually the careers of randy quaid brian <UNK> and thomas gibson greg of the <UNK> greg duo <UNK> faster than houses and <UNK> and <UNK> can fly away from one of the 15 <UNK> we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie the movie was advertised as nature gone amok instead we get a lame story about how 15 different weather systems <UNK> to produce 150 degree days in chicago then a <UNK> the next day from a <UNK> that was in the <UNK> of mexico that combined with a storm system from canada but actually had it's origins in a jet stream changed by global warming enough it didn't matter what the story was the acting was terrible the words the actors said were dumb and 13 scientists throughout the country had after hearing the <UNK> that came out of the movie i didn't care what happened to any of the characters the special effects were sub par even for made for tv standards and the story lines were pointless all in all i really really <UNK> this tv event
<START> i loved this film independent film making at its best the cinematography pacing rhythm and acting were perfectly in sync fred <UNK> best work to date the movie is well written with lots of plot twists that take you to a great ending it moves well and keeps you involved being a photographer i was most impressed with the cinematography the lighting creates mood and a beauty that is usually found in a much bigger budget film this gave the actors a great <UNK> to start from to work their magic and that is just what they did great performances from all the actors and each one was well cast in their roles as i said in the beginning the is a wonderful film and one of fred <UNK> best movies you will love it
<START> makes the fourth theatrical release the one national lampoon took its name off of look like a comedy classic a complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize on a once proud franchise painfully unfunny and unwatchable even for a tv movie the cousin eddie character has become <UNK> less amusing from the original vacation when it was fresh and unique through christmas vacation when it was starting to wear a bit thin to vegas vacation where it was actually annoying to see come on screen but in fairness there were a lot of things that were annoying to see come on screen in that movie but this attempt to move the character up to lead status is unfortunate to say the least the vacation movies themselves met an ugly death in las vegas and this hope at <UNK> even the <UNK> thread of the series for television was thoroughly misguided chevy chase and company put together a great trilogy back when he was in his prime now let's just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace one tiny note of interest the original audrey <UNK> dana <UNK> the first of four actresses to play the part including juliette lewis returns to the role 20 years later one is left only to wonder why
<START> i would like to know the real name of the <UNK> where scenes from the movie were filmed it is truly beautiful and <UNK> back to <UNK> and 30's architecture like the hotel del i know it was on either big bear lake or lake <UNK> and would like to hear if it is still in existence as for the movie itself it is truly amazing that jane <UNK> was even nominated for an academy award this must have been a period when she was well liked by her academy peers it really would have been interesting to get a true impression from <UNK> and the other actors in this movie regarding the script the script of this movie like the recent kevin <UNK> movie with a message in a bottle is so unbelievable that it it limits the credibility that the actors can bring to their parts rock hudson can be forgiven he was never a great actor was able to get by mostly on his looks and didn't get credible roles until later in his career pretty <UNK> is the exception but <UNK> must have been forced to take this movie through <UNK> <UNK> or the studio system
<START> the sea inside a film by <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> has always single handed the flag for spanish cinema for years now out of nowhere came <UNK> <UNK> genres and <UNK> some new blood to the otherwise spanish industry now in a big <UNK> he switches from psychological terror to social drama well the big ones would be are audiences ready to embrace the swing and more important can he hold the flag this is the story of <UNK> a sailor that in his <UNK> was <UNK> from the neck down in an accident at the sea and his fight with the spanish government for the right to end his life the story has the <UNK> of an afternoon made for tv melodrama and the only way this is going to work is through words and honest performances and they both come in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> co write in a way where the audience is not meant to be lead blind to a death end but they are encouraged to make up their own minds in the process and that is a brilliant stroke this is not a movie pro death but a movie in favour of the ultimate <UNK> of our time liberty there is a few laughs spare a long the way like when the church comes home in a wheel chair to <UNK> beliefs but is mostly a valley of tears through out punches coming from all <UNK> even when you think you are safe his father that to that point didn't make any sense comes up with the most moving line of the entire movie it is a heartbreaking experience specially when seems more full of life than most the people wandering the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life even those who are helping him to <UNK> but when you strip a man of his the film is almost exclusively built on close ups bringing a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic with that's for the actors a huge challenge that must <UNK> their whole performances with their eyes and the eyes don't lie <UNK> was not granted his second oscar nomination probably in favour of eastwood but in my opinion he was the only one who could have <UNK> fox this role reminds me of the great gregory peck in to kill a <UNK> where the acting looked <UNK> and i <UNK> <UNK> has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely <UNK> i was never fond of his early work but since <UNK> live flesh he is on a roll los <UNK> al <UNK> the dancer upstairs and the oscar nominated before the night falls made him an international star and although he and <UNK> come from the same <UNK> background is fascinating to see how different paths they took and how <UNK> has now become a real reference for spanish cinema in the whole world a golden globe 14 <UNK> jury prize at <UNK> and probably an oscar with <UNK> from the chorus boys <UNK> directs co write edits and puts music to a high caliber drama he has pull it <UNK> what about some science fiction now whose life is it anyway
<START> i really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by stephen king that i didn't finish i was truly disappointed it was the worst crap i've ever seen what were you thinking making three hours out of it it may have a quite good story but actors no suspense no romance no horror no it didn't have anything br br it's got this strange crazy science man with einstein hair the classic thing not real at all and a man keep getting younger all the time it seems like they just used the name of stephen king to make a crappy too long movie with nothing exciting at all br br i give this movie 1 awful if they had like 5 i would probably take that instead it was a total waste of time
